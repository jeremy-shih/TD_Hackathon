I am Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations.","This morning, Moody's released its results for the first quarter of 2015 as well as our updated outlook for full year 2015. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our Web site at ir.moodys.com.","Ray McDaniel, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer will lead this morning's conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Linda Huber, Moody's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I call your attention to the Safe Harbor language, which can be found toward the end of our earnings release.

I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel.","Ray McDaniel","Thank you, Salli. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's first quarter 2015 results, Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. As we have no legal or regulatory updates, I will conclude the comments on our outlook for 2015. After our prepared remarks we will respond to your questions.","In the first quarter, Moody's delivered revenue of $866 million, an increase of 13% over the first quarter of 2014. On a constant currency basis Moody's revenue was up 18% year-over-year. Excluding the 2014 consolidation of ICRA and our 2014 acquisitions of Lewtan Technologies and WebEquity Solutions as well as the impact of foreign currency translation Moody's revenue grew 16% year-on-year.","Operating expense for the first quarter was $494 million up 14% from the first quarter of 2014. Operating income was $371 million a 12% increase from the prior year period. Adjusted operating income defined as operating income less depreciation and amortization was $400 million also up 12% from the same period last year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted operating income by 7%.","Operating margin for the quarter was 42.9% while adjusted operating margin was 46.2%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.11 increased 11% from the prior year period. We are reaffirming our full year 2015 earnings per share guidance of $4.55 to $4.65 despite our expectations for uneven global growth as well as the strength of the US dollar at current exchange rates.","I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda Huber","Thanks Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned Moody's total revenue for the first quarter increased 13% to $866 million. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Moody's revenue by 5%. U.S. revenue of $500 million was up 17% from the first quarter of 2014. Non-U.S. revenue of $366 million was up 7% and represented 42% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $124 million represented 49% of total revenue. ","Looking now at each of our business starting with Moody's Investors Service, total MIS revenue for the quarter was $602 million up 14% from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 5%. U.S. revenue increased 18% to $372 million. Revenue outside of the U.S. was $231 million increased 8% and represented 38% of total ratings revenue. Excluding the 2014 consolidation of ICRA MIS revenue increased 12%.","Moving now to the lines of business for MIS, first global corporate finance revenue in the first quarter was up 13% to $299 million, reflecting increased investment-grade issuance from heightened M&A activity as well as strong investor demand for high yield bond, partially offsetting these gains with the contraction impact loan issuance. U.S. corporate finance revenue increased 13% while non-U.S. corporate finance revenue increased 14%.","Second, global structured financed revenue for first quarter was $101 million 6% above the prior year period. This increase was primarily the result of strong U.S. commercial real-estate issuance. U.S. structured finance revenue increased 13% while non-U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 6%.","Third global financial institutions revenue of $94 million increased 10% from the same quarter of 2014 primarily due to increased revenue from U.S. finance companies and insurers. This benefit was partially offset by a decline in revenue from global managed investment issuers who experienced elevated activity in the prior year period. U.S. and non-U.S. financial institution revenue increased 19% and 4% respectively year-over-year.","Fourth, global public project and infrastructure finance revenue increased 25% year-over-year to $101 million resulting from increases in U.S. municipal financing activity and global municipal infrastructure issuance. U.S. public project and infrastructure revenue increased 37% and non-U.S. revenue increased 7%. As a reminder MIS other consist of non-rating revenue from ICRA and Korea Investor Service or KIS. MIS other contributed $8 million to MIS revenue in the first quarter compared to $3 million in the prior year period.","Turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA is $263 million was up 11% from the first quarter of 2014. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 5%. U.S. revenue grew by 17% year-over-year to $128 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased 5% to $135 million and represented 51% of total MA revenue. Excluding the 2014 acquisitions of Lewtan Technologies and WebEquity Solutions MA revenue grew 7% year-over-year.","Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research, data and analytics or RD&A, revenue of $150 million increased 9% from the prior year period. Growth reflected strong sales of credit research and licensing of ratings status and 96% customer retention rate and the acquisition of Lewtan Technologies in October 2014. Year-over-year U.S. revenue was up 13% and non-U.S. revenue was up 3%.","Second enterprise risk solutions, or ERS, revenue of $77 million grew 29% from last year. This increase resulted from strong project delivery across all product offerings as well as the acquisition of WebEquity Solutions in July 2014. Revenue was up 41% in the U.S. and 22% outside the U.S. Trailing 12-months revenue and sales for ERS increased to 28% and 24% respectively.","As noted in the past due to the variable nature of project timing in completion ERS revenue remained subject to quarterly volatility. Third, global professional services revenue decreased 10% to $37 million primarily due to the year-over-year effect of existing certain Copal Amba product line in late 2014. U.S. revenue decreased 4% and non-U.S. decreased 13%.","Turning to now to expense, Moody's first quarter expense increased 14% to $494 million, primarily due to hiring in 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, as well as added operating expense from our 2014 acquisition. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 4%. Excluding the 2014 consolidation of ICRA and our 2014 acquisitions of Lewtan Technologies and WebEquity Solutions Moody's expense grew 9% year-over-year.","Moody's reported operating margin and adjusted operating margin were both down slightly in the quarter to 42.9% and 46.2% respectively. Excluding the 2014 consolidation of ICRA and our 2014 acquisitions of Lewtan Technologies and WebEquity Solutions Moody's added more than 100 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year. Moody's effective tax rate for the first quarter was 32.9% compared to 28.9% for the prior year period primarily due to a benefit from the resolution of foreign tax audit in the prior year period.","Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter of 2015 Moody's repurchased 3.8 million shares at a total cost of $366 million and issued 2.3 million shares under its annual employee stock-based compensation plan. Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2015 total 202.2 million and 5% from the prior year. As of March 31st Moody's had $1.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","On March 9, 2015 Moody's issued \u20ac500 million of 12 year senior unsecured notes at 1.75%. This transaction provides both cost effective financing and a partial hedge for the company's euro exposure. At quarter end Moody's had $3.1 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility.","Total cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments at quarter end were $2 billion, down $50 million from a year earlier. Free cash flow in the first quarter of 2015 was $242.8 million, up 54% from the first quarter of 2014 due to the increase in net income and changes in working capital. As of March 31, 2015 approximately 63% of Moody's cash holding were maintained outside U.S.","On April 17, 2015 Moody's announced a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share of Moody's common stock payable on June 10th to the stockholders of record at the close of business on May 20th.","And with that I will turn the call back over to Ray.","Ray McDaniel","Thanks Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing our 2015 full year guidance. Moody's outlook for 2015 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to some degree of uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.","Moody's guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates including $1.48 to the pound and $1.07 to the euro. Moody's still expects full year 2015 revenue to grow in the mid single-digit percent range. However on a constant dollar basis Moody's full year 2015 revenue and operating expense growth rates would now both be 4% to 5% higher up from the approximately 3% higher than we communicated in February.","The company still expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.55 to $4.65. For global MIS Moody's still expects 2015 revenue to grow in the mid single-digit percent range. However MIS's U.S. revenue is now expected to grow in the high single-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range.","Within MIS both structured finance revenue and financial institutions revenue are now expected to grow in the low single-digit percent range. For global MA 2015 revenue is still expected to increase in the mid single-digit percent range. However MA U.S. revenue is now expected to grow in the low double-digit percent range. While non-US revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range. Within MA professional services revenue is now expected to decrease in the low single-digit percent range.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investor Service; and Mark Almeida, president of Moody's Analytics. We would be pleased to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","The first question I had was just around the constant currency improvement. Generally may be you can tie that, was that increase more driven by the Moody's Analytics side or is that just more of the thing better than [indiscernible] some color there?","Ray McDaniel","Manav I apologize I didn\u2019t hear the beginning of your question if you repeat that I would appreciate it?","Manav Patnaik","Yes it was just around the increased guidance on a constant currency basis, so just what the main drivers there were?","Ray McDaniel","The underlying operating business is performing very well. And if not for the decline of the euro against the dollar we obviously as we communicated we would have had even stronger performance in the first quarter. Our current outlook as we said assumes the $1.07 to the euro and so that's absorbing as some of the strength of the underlying operating performance I think that's really the story.","Manav Patnaik","And then you Linda on the expense side I mean you sited a favorable benefit of the FX on the expenses and still it looked like it was up double-digit. So A, is that mainly just because of the contribution of acquisitions and then can you help us bridge what you've given us before in terms of how we expect the expense to move quarterly to the end of the year?","Linda Huber","Yes Manav, your point is correct that the FX impact actually benefits us on expenses and its 4% to 5% benefit, for the rest of the year we think on the expense line. In terms of the ramp for expenses for the rest of the year, this is one of the trickiest calls that we make and there are many things that can cause this number to move around. The expense number for the first quarter is been $494 million and from there now we\u2019re looking at a ramp of about $30 million, but again I would emphasize that could be 25 million it could be 35 million and it's impacted by a number of things including our IT projects and of course that is absence any changes in incentive compensation as we end up doing better.","So a good central scenario would be about $30 million but there is some flexibility around that. And please keep in mind that it's one of the tougher numbers to predict that we have to give you. ","Manav Patnaik","And just last one for me, it seems like you guys have had a pretty steady stream of the small sort of tuck in type of deals. Can you -- is that pipeline still pretty active should we be expecting more of these going forward?","Ray McDaniel","As we've said before Manav we certainly are looking for opportunities to add attractive assets to the portfolio that we have. So yes we\u2019re actively looking. But the opportunity to make good acquisitions that what we think our fair prices is lumpy. And we had a series of those last year more than we would normally or have normally had in individual year. So I would not draw from 2014 and try to extrapolate that in 2015.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin","The question is on ERS, I know is up 29% in the first quarter. So I was just wondering if you could remind us why you're assuming such a sharp decelerations ahead mid single-digit growth for the year. And how we should think about the puts and takes that would drive upside and downside to that guidance.","Ray McDaniel","I will ask Mark Almeida if he wouldn't mind commenting on that.","Mark Almeida","Sure. Andre I think it\u2019s just a matter of or looking at the projects that we've got underway in the ERS business and having pretty good visibility into what work is going to get done and when it's going to be completed and what kind of revenue recognition we\u2019re going to have. So the first quarter was very strong. It was largely in line with our expectations. So again it's really pretty straight forward and it's a function of the schedule of work that\u2019s being done and when we expect it to complete.","Ray McDaniel","I would just add to that, that it's also as much of a story about 2014 as it is 2015 and that we had a very strong fourth quarter, I mean 2014 in ERS which is making for more difficult comparables in the back half of the year.","The other thing to add to that Andre is that we did have the WebEquity acquisition midyear last year, and we\u2019re getting some benefits from that in the first half of this year we won't get as much benefit from it in the second half.","Andre Benjamin","Then same business to global professional services I know you said part of the reason it was down was because of exiting certain products. I was wondering maybe little color on what that would have looked like if you have kept those products. And I don\u2019t know how FX is weighing on that business in particular given its more international expose.","Linda Huber","Andre it's Linda and Mark and I are going to tag team on this because I'm managing Copal Amba and he will comment on some other factors. As you saw in the earnings release and then also on the script we had exited part of the business for Copal Amba and that leads us revenue deficit of about $8 million $9 million that we\u2019re looking to catch up from which makes it little harder to have growth on that line. Maybe Mark wants to talk little bit more about the other components of professional services.","Mark Almeida","The other big piece in professional services is our certification business in Canada and the Canadian dollar has fallen pretty sharply so we took a very big FX hit in Canada. So between what Linda described and the FX impacts on the training and certification business it create a lot of headwind for professional services overall.","Operator","We will take our next question from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Linda I think every quarter you kind of remind us what the pipeline is looking like, though pretty straight forward question any update you want to highlight particular?","Linda Huber","Sure Alex, we can have it be pipeline time. So what I'll do is I'll note that these are the comments we've gotten from a collection of U.S. capital market's desks and what we\u2019re talk about here first is just U.S. dollar markets and it doesn't align how Moody's thinks about revenue and expenses. So I want to talk about three different areas, investment-grade bonds, and high yield bonds and then leverage loan. And then I'll provide some comments on Europe.","So let's look at investment-grade bonds first, for the first quarter of 2015 we have $350 billion of U.S. issuance which is up 20% year-over-year. For the full year the banks are now expecting 1.1 trillion of U.S. high grade issuance, note that that's up 10% from the forecast that we received in the beginning of the year that we had said at that time we're about flat. You will note that these forecast at the beginning of the year are always very speculative and they always move around. ","So the state of the U.S. high grade markets is very strong and first quarter of '15 it was a new single quarter record for issuance in the investment grade bond markets in the U.S. there were jumbo acquisitions from AT&T at 17.5 billion and Oracle at 10 billion, we\u2019re anticipating a very busy May as investor demand remains strong.","So that's been driven by M&A financing, financial company and bank issuance and opportunistic activity if in fact there is a fed raise later in the year. The current pipeline is described as robust and we don\u2019t see that word too often with many jumbo transactions expected and the bodice that May could rival March in terms of high volume again March was 140 billion. So we've had some pretty heavy quarters here for U.S. investment grade.","Let's look at high yield bonds, for the first quarter of 2015 a $100 billion of issuance that's up 20% year-on-year and for the full year we're looking at 300 billion of issuance, again about flat outlook there is an upgrade from the prior down 10% yield that we had seen at the beginning of the year. So the state of the market is very strong, positive funds flows throughout the year so far, rents are performing well and the pipeline is described as average to robust.","Now leverage loans which in some sense are a substitute for high yield bonds are not looking robust, this is a result of some changes in what we're seeing from the fed, if you look at the shared national credit program and a press release from November 7th that said had some concerns about high leverage levers and syndicated loans. And again program covers loans of $20 million or more with three or more banks in the deal.","So the fed talked about it concerns that has had downward pressure on leverage loans. In any case $100 billion for the first quarter of 2015 down 45% year-on-year 350 billion forecast for the year which is down 20%. The market continues to see a little bit of weakness as I said because of the fed oversight and issuers however have strong demand, are showing strong demand for the paper.","The pipeline is judged to be average at this point and we still see a strong year-to-date CLO issuance, 30 billion for the first quarter of 2015 versus 23 billion in the first quarter of '14 and the last two weeks have been positive funds closed into leverage loans.","Now let's look at Europe and what we're seeing in Europe. Investment grade in Europe first quarter saw very heavy supply driven particularly by surge in issuance from U.S. based issuers wishing to lock in historically low rates as you probably saw Moody's was part of that, the pipeline looks to be above average in May.","Now some of that attractive spread level and the attractive issuance conditions in Europe has weakened a little bit, the conditions were probably in the first quarter but we continue to see above average pipeline. High yield a bit different, market is very strong in Europe up 30% over the same time last year, a record Q1, strong April, good inflows into European high yield and that market looks to be quite attractive right now.","So overall U.S. investment grade very robust high yield bonds, robust leverage loans, not so much, Europe investment grade pretty good may be we saw peak opportunity in the first quarter and high yield continues to look pretty good in Europe. So is that sufficient Alex?","Alex Kramm","As detailed as anyone can hope for but may be just couple of things, just to add there. Obviously you highlighted the leverage loans and the fed and also I forgot the word that you used but you said high yields and leverage loans sometimes work, no, counter cyclical is that the right word to use? So if leverage loans come into continues pressure, do you think the high yield market can absorb that, and is that from a margin profitability perspective in particular if you add the CLO side, are you comfortable that those two businesses, that the high yield market will be enough there from your perspective. And then secondly, sorry for the long question, secondly on the European side, am I reading it right that you're actually feeling better about how Europe is going so far but that it's really the FX that's the impact there?","Linda Huber","To deal with your first question Alex I would say that high yield bonds and leverage loans are substitutes for each other, they are counter cyclical that's little bit of different thing, it's a substitution effect. So we are pretty indifferent as to whether we raise bonds or loans, any kind of speculative grade security we're able to price a little higher for so we're happy with either. We released a piece of research yesterday on this situation with the fed and leverage loans and it might be interesting for people on the call to get that. But what we see is that more capital has to be allocated to those leverage loans and there is stricter lending guidance on the bulk of those leverage loans. And the price if a loan is sold to the CLO vehicle. So we would expect that that would continue and we will find that the bond being stronger.","Now in Europe issuance conditions are pretty good and we would also note that we think that, that market continues to look good from an issuance point of view. I will let Michel talk little bit about what we\u2019re seeing potentially in terms of new mandates and some other things.","Michel Madelain","In terms of new mandate I think we've seen a bit of slowdown in the first quarter, we see that as a really something that is cyclical essentially there is overall level of growth in Europe is still very much subdued, there is continued to be some covered deleveraging. So against that obviously we've very low rate environment and we have a banking system that continues to struggle somehow. So although we\u2019re very satisfied with the volume we've seen in first quarter, a bank loan we see a similar contraction to the one we've seen in the U.S., but overall I think we continue to see the structural trend in our favor in Europe basically unchanged.","Operator","Next we'll move on to Denny Galindo with Morgan Stanley.","Denny Galindo","Can you talk little bit about the share repurchases, you bought back on an aggressive pace this quarter, you paid a good price. I know you use a grid to figure out exactly how much to buy, at what prices, but can you talk about the metrics that would cause buybacks to go up and down in the quarter. And does in fact that you bought more shares this quarter have any bearing on how much you might buy in Q2?","Ray McDaniel","We do use a grid Denny as you point out, but the details around that and exactly the pace at which we\u2019re going to be buying under that grid as well as opportunistically outside that grid is not something we would want to telegraph.","Linda Huber","Denny our guidance has been around the $1 billion for this year, and pace was a little heavier in the first quarter. We are pleased with the price that we achieved in the first quarter $95.20 per share stock crossed $110 briefly this morning. So we\u2019re pretty happy with that. And we'll have to see as we always say the total amount of buybacks is subject to a lot of different factors and the pacing is something as Ray said that and actual grid prices are not something that we disclose.","Denny Galindo","And then moving on to PPIF group within MIS, it sounded like that was pretty strong. And it's sometimes hard to get good information on that space. Do you expect public financing to kind of remain fairly strong over the next few quarters and what types of issuers are really driving that strength there?","Ray McDaniel","The real strength in the first quarter was coming from the U.S. municipal sector of PPIF, and that municipality is taking advantage of couple of things, obviously low rate and attractive borrowing conditions but also the fact that a lot of the volume from the mid-2000 is coming off of lock up and is able to be refinanced is a driver as well. We do think we\u2019re going to see a good year for PPIF for the full year, but realistically the pace that we saw in the first quarter I don't think that\u2019s a central scenario.","Denny Galindo","And then just one more longer-term question, longer-term and structured we're starting to see some innovation in the stacker deals from GSE or securitizing single family rentals, both kind of ways to bring private money and to financing single family homes. Could you talk about these deals or any other areas of structures which could boost the growth rate in structured products or in that RMBS bucket specifically?","Ray McDaniel","Sure, I'll make couple of comments and Michel or Linda may wish to make remarks as well. Certainly innovation has always been a future of the securitization market as you said some of the new products that we\u2019re seeing is bringing private money into portions of that market. Also changes in regulation are going to have an impact on that market going forward and would undoubtedly drive further innovation.","Whether it's the rules or 2016 that are impacting the CLO market and how the market adjusts to that, the leverage limits that are being put on banks the activities in the banking sector that\u2019s being tailed that may move capital raising and liquidity raising into the structure sector should all be characteristics of this market going forward. Really though for the shorter term looking out over the next couple of quarters I think we will be looking for the upside coming from existing products and from a resumption of securitization activity at more robust levels coming out of Europe.","Michel I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to that.","Michel Madelain","Maybe if I may, just one comment on single family rental, it's a sector where we've been active but just in terms of number of transaction that remains fairly small sector. Although again we've seen innovation with new structures with multiple originated deals and so that\u2019s a sector where we have presence, yes.","Linda Huber","Denny I think you may will double check this but I think you may have confused one concept. Stacker deals are deals that come out of the existing portfolios there is a similar type between Fannie and Freddie. So that is to move from the government balance sheet into the capital market. That\u2019s not really a new product and it has nothing, zero to do with private capital, that\u2019s moving balance sheet exposure for the U.S. government into the private market, not new private market origination. So you might want to just think about that little bit.","We are not super excited about the innovation in the RMBS market at this point, there are some of those products including single-family rental but these things are few and far between and what we\u2019re really looking for is a resumption of the jumbo mortgage market, the private label jumbo market, but U.S. government is still backing the vast majority of mortgages in the U.S. So still rather limited private capital participation at this moment.","Operator","And we'll move on to Joseph Foresi with Janney. Please go ahead.","Joseph Foresi","I wondered if we could talk first about just trajectory of the margins in the analytics business. I know it's been an area where you are trying to scale up on the software side in this quarter might have been affected by some one-time changes. But can we just maybe, could you give us a little color on sort of what you think that might look like through the back half of the year?","Ray McDaniel","Mark would you like to comment on that?","Mark Almeida","I will comment on what we\u2019re doing with the margins generally, but as you observed and as Linda explained earlier we had some changes that we made in the Copal Amba business and some integration costs that we were dealing with there. If you exclude Copal Amba from Moody's analytics the margin for the rest of the Moody's analytics business actually went up in the quarter, and that\u2019s even taking into account the drag we had from the two acquisitions that we made.","So we did that margin expansion on that basis in the quarter that\u2019s the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion in MA. So I think it's consistent with what we have been talking about and the efforts we've been making to drive margin in MA, that continues to be a focus we think it's achievable but as we've described before, we expect this to be a very long-term effort and something that is going to occur in a meaningful way over a number of years and not something that you are going to see a dramatic change in over the next couple of quarters.","Joseph Foresi","Should we think of that as a small creep, I think what that implies and fortunately our models sometime, we extrapolate some of the historical and just kind of run it through going forward. So is that a small creep year-over-year or do you think that momentum in each quarter obviously excluding the one-times carriers through the back half of the year?","Mark Almeida","Well again, what I am describing was modest increase in the MA margin ignoring the Copal Amba business in light of the changes that we were making over there. So I think given that we don't really guide to margins for the business. I think that\u2019s pretty much all we can say there.","Ray McDaniel","And there will continue to be some noise on a quarterly basis just based on the mix of activity that we\u2019re seeing there.","Joseph Foresi","And then just a larger question on issuance side for a number of years people have been talking about the amount of corporate debt out there, and I think starting next year and heading into the back half of that year and going forward that\u2019s all going to come due. Do you have any sense of sort of how that plays from an interest rate perspective and then mixes it to the issuance market?","Ray McDaniel","We've talked before about the refinancing walls that we can see on the horizon. This is particularly pronounced in the U.S. and particularly in the spec grade area. So beginning in 2016 but then really more of a 2017 and 2018 story we are going to see substantial refinancing needs in the corporate sector. That\u2019s true also in Europe and in Asia, albeit to a lesser degree than what we see in the U.S. And I'm not anticipating a dramatic increase in interest rates over this period certainly at the longer-end. So I think even though I keep saying this and I keep being wrong even though I would expect rates to increase on a going forward basis, I don't expect that to be the kind of increase that would make absolute financing terms unattractive.","Joseph Foresi","And then last one for me, any comments you have, I know you said you really didn't have any on the regulatory changes. Any comments or updates there?","Ray McDaniel","No, nothing really new to report on the legal regulatory side, we'll be filing our Q very shortly but again nothing notable that I would point you to as of right now.","Operator","From FBR we have Bill Bird. Please go ahead sir.","Bill Bird","Ray I was wondering if you can talk about you know what you are seeing right now in the reverse Yankee market? Are you seeing that pipeline build, do you anticipate more companies following your lead and tapping this market?","Ray McDaniel","Sure Bill, I am actually going to hand this over to Michel and let him offer his thoughts on this.","Michel Madelain","Well I think this is really a matter of two factors, one, the currency play and two, the rate differential that exist between, and the spread differential between the U.S. and European markets and I think on both of these fronts I think we continue to expect to see favorable factors for such a trend. So we don\u2019t have a number to offer here but I think the conditions that have been favorable to date I expect it to remain in place at least for the foreseeable future for the short-term, medium term.","Ray McDaniel","And Bill let me just add something we show in terms of our revenue performance the revenues based on the location of the issuer rather than the market into which it is issued. So think about that in the context of our U.S. versus European corporate revenues.","Bill Bird","Linda could you also give us the incentive comp accruals for the quarter year-over-year?","Linda Huber","Sure Bill, just a second, while we look that up. For the first quarter of 2015 the incentive comp accrual was about $38 million and that's up from last year's $29.5 million and we're running about on target with where we expect it to be at this point in the year, that number is one that obviously bounces around if we're doing worse that's number is smaller if find ourselves doing better, of course that number would become a bit heavier but 38 million for the first quarter.","Bill Bird","Just one final question, your more moderate growth outlook for structured and financial institutions, is that just currency or is this something else?","Mark Almeida","That's really currency. As a matter of fact most of the outlook story the change is related to currency.","Operator","Next we have Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","Bill Warmington","So I wanted to start up by asking about the very strong muni issuance up 37%, just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the conditions that have produced that and thoughts on the pipeline there going forward for the rest of 2015?","Ray McDaniel","The 37% growth is really driven again by the U.S. municipal market which had a very strong quarter. We expect that the US market is going to continue to be strong through the year, although not at first quarter levels as I think I mentioned earlier and again it's a combination of refinancing with the opportunity to do so in an attractive rate environment and the expiration of lock up periods for some of the municipal bonds.","Bill Warmington","I noticed the MIS relationship revenue growth about 3.7% just seem particularly low and I wanted to ask how much of that\u2019s being distorted by FX and if there's anything else going on there that would explain that?","Ray McDaniel","No it is again an FX story I know this starts to sound like a broken record but we have reasonably large recurring revenues coming out of Europe a lot of frequent issuer pricing arrangements and the monitoring fees and they go along with that, we\u2019re seeing growth but it's, that growth is really being impacted by the decline of the euro.","Bill Warmington","And then one last question for you on the research data analytics there. Just wanted to ask about how price increases were trending so far in 2015 what your expectations are going to be there for the year?","Ray McDaniel","They are running pretty much in line with the way they were through 2014, so we continue to get a nice kick from pricing we anticipate that continuing.","Operator","Next we have Peter Appert with Pipe Jaffray.","Peter Appert","So Ray your market share performance relative to peers has been really strong certainly in the first quarter, I think even for the last several years. Can you call out anything in terms of what you see driving that performance or any particular categories where you think you are picking up share?","Ray McDaniel","Yes our coverage has been strong and obviously we are -- we would attribute that to a combination of the work we\u2019re doing on our analytics and the demand that that is creating from the institutional investor community for issuers to get Moody's ratings, beyond that I think it's really a matter of operational execution and we\u2019re paying a lot of attention to executing well. Nothing fancy about that.","Peter Appert","No particular asset class, where you think -- I was thinking about for example in CMBS one of your competitors has had some issues, maybe that\u2019s helping you?","Ray McDaniel","Ironically not really in that area, and you are correct the structured finance area in particular shows some coverage volatility it always has rating shopping is more prevalent there. But the area where we\u2019re strong in the commercial mortgage backed securities area in terms of multifamily or multi-property deals we've been strong in even before there were -- where there was a moratorium on the ratings from one of our competitors. And so the strength continues but it hasn't really changed in terms of the mix we\u2019re picking up because of external events.","Peter Appert","And then just one other thing, feels like maybe the banks in Europe are getting a little bit healthier at least there seem to be just scraping by on their version of the stress test. Wondering if you think that has any implications in terms of this whole disintermediation thesis in terms of there is just the competitive pressure from banks being able to better serve lending requirements.","Ray McDaniel","I guess the short answer Peter is, no I don't think so. The demand on financial institutions globally in terms of meeting stress test, capital requirements, liquidity requirements the businesses that they have been curtailed from are all continuing to put pressure on profitability, willingness to make loans, and I think also are increasing the awareness from corporations and municipal entities that they need access to multiple forms of liquidity in capital. So the bond market is not a substitution for bank relationships and alternative and an addition to the banking relationships.","Peter Appert","So 2% to 3% is still the right number in terms of incremental revenue from disintermediation or you think maybe even better than that?","Ray McDaniel","I think that\u2019s probably a fair number, it's going to vary quarter-to-quarter cyclically but structurally I think that\u2019s very much intact.","Operator","And we will take Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes I got few questions. Linda if I could ask you just to break down the revenues by your four segments high yield versus bank loans for the three sectors to start up please?","Linda Huber","Sure Craig, we\u2019re looking at the first quarter of 2015 over 2014, so investment grades at $87 million is running at 29% of the almost $300 million we saw in CFG for the first quarter that 29% is up from last year's 18%. So as we said investment grades been running hot and strong and the jumbo deals are really terrific. Spec grade is about $63 million up from last year's $53 million percentages are about the same 21% versus 20%. Bank loans are down both absolutely and in percentage terms about $45 million versus last year's $67 million 15% of the total growth of last year's 25. And other is at $104 million which is up from last year's 97, but on the percentage terms down to 35 versus last year's 37.","So big change there is the increase in percentage from investment grade, spec rates bonds and percentage terms up a little bit, bank loans down very important for everyone to note we can do okay with the change mix and we\u2019re doing pretty well just like the fact that the investment grade piece was stronger than first quarter.","Now looking at structured, first quarter 2015 versus 2014. Looking at asset backed securities absolute numbers about 21 million about flat from last year's 23 percentages it's 21% of the total for structured of $101 million down from last year's 24. Residential mortgage backed securities which does include covered bonds about 18 million flat from last year's 18 million percentage wise down to 18% versus last year's 19. Commercial real-estate up $33 million from last year's 29 in percentage terms it's also up to 33% versus last year's 31. Structured credit which is primarily CLOs up to about $29 million from last year's 25 percentagewise up to about 28% versus last year's 26.","Then FIG first quarter 2015 versus 2014 $94 million in revenue versus last year's 85 million. Banking about 63 million up from last year's 57, that stays flat at about 67% of the percentage total. Insurance at about 25 million versus last year's 21.5 million is up to 27% from last year's 25%. Managed investments 3.5 million versus last year's 6.6 million is down, that\u2019s 4% of FIGs total versus last year's 7%, and others about 2%.","And then lastly PPIF total was 100 million versus last year's 80 that\u2019s a big jump, PFG and sovereign up absolutely to $56 million from last year's 41, up in percentage terms 56% versus last year's 51. Project and infrastructure also up about $45 million from last year's 40, percentagewise down to 44% from last year's 49, and that\u2019s the total for a PPIF. So that\u2019s the whole view on the ratings business.","We do have the MIS other line which is something kind of newish Craig and that includes KIS and ICRA so that\u2019s up a little bit from last year because of the ICRA consolidation, $7.8 million dollars versus last year's 3.3 and of course the ICRA percentage at 56% of the total is higher because we didn't have that view as of last year.","Ray McDaniel","And sorry just for clarification the MIS other is ICRA's non-ratings businesses. The ratings agency has its revenues rolled up into the lines of business that we have for MIS already.","Craig Huber","Like to ask a simpler question. On the currency side Linda I think last quarter you had about 100 basis points spread between the impact on revenues versus your cost. I believe you said that the second quarter impact 4% to 5% for reach. Is just rounding or you really are thinking almost top each other this quarter?","Linda Huber","It's rounding Craig, this is pretty hard for us to forecast. So what we\u2019re looking at is it's a negative 4% to 5% in revenue, it's positive 4% to 5% in operating expenses, as we talked about before our main exposure of the euro and the British pound at the end of the first quarter the pound was at $1.48 and the euro was at a $1.07 and we had run this year with the euro at a $1.15 with what we've had in our forecast, now a very happy phenomenon for me as the CFO is the euro this morning is at a $0.12.","So we\u2019re coming back in the right direction. And Ray and I talk about the euro every day. So what that will boils down to is if you were to see euro to further weaken we would $0.05 decline in the euro would cost us another 20 million in revenue but help us 4 million on the expense side. So the net would be down $16 million or about $0.05 on EPS. So this is actually pretty simple. The short hand we use is if the falls another $0.05 versus the dollar it will hit is $0.05 and EPS which is a pretty simple metric for you to use.","Craig Huber","I guess I'm also asking Linda the 7% hit as you guys calculated when you're operating profit line in the first quarter from currency, are you expecting a similar type hit here on the profit line on currency?","Linda Huber","It could be Craig it depends what happens going forward as I said we\u2019re slightly cheered by the fact that the euro is up a little bit but this is bouncing around far too much for us to put a tight range around this. And as you saw we help guidance and we don't like to move guidance after the first quarter that would be a correct observation, but this currency piece makes it a little bit harder to know where we\u2019re going to go. So we\u2019re going to have to just watch it. The euro could continue to strengthen or it could weaken from here and those two situations don't look the same and that\u2019s why we\u2019re being a little bit thoughtful and we'll see where we get to as the year goes on.","Craig Huber","Lastly Linda is there anything else beside your incentive compensation you would call out, on that variable cost side to help offset the potential weakness at some point down the road on the revenue side, anything else of significance.","Linda Huber","I think we will Craig we always have our 50 million in an expense flexibility if things really got difficult we can slow down on things and certainly slowing hiring would be the first thing, but I always want to put some perspective on this because Moody's is a growth company and you need to think about us that way. We're looking at 72% of the S&P 500 have reported so far. And sales growth for the S&P 500 all in is minus 4.1%. And if you take out the energy companies if you want to make that argument the growth is up 2%. We just put up 13% growth and 18% on a constant currency basis.","So in order to do that we\u2019re spending some money but as you know our shareholders have been telling us if we can get growth we should do that, and I think we've demonstrated pretty effectively we\u2019re able to do that despite some pretty hefty currency headwinds. We think we've had a pretty good quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will continue with Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Tim McHugh","Most of my questions have been asked but I have two quick ones. I guess Copal you said that $89 million hit from shutting down products, I guess since there is different pieces in there with the certification business. I just wanted to circle back to another question. What's the underlying trend? Are they seeing still good growth, good demand if you adjusted for that? Is it possible to strip that out and look at how it's performing without that change?","Linda Huber","I'll comment a little bit and then Mark may want to comment. I guess we've had the confluence of two frustrating events in the professional services line, and I'm managing the Copal Amba business, Mark is managing the rest of professional services which includes CSI but the two really have nothing to do with each other, other than that they're reported up for the same line in Moody's Analytics.","I did mention the product line that we decided to reduce in scope Copal Amba, but we very much like the trends and the outlook for Copal Amba. I think I have mentioned before it has generally Moody's like growth rates and close to Moody's like margins and right now as banks are looking to reduce costs being able to offshore knowledge processes is growing at a pretty terrific rate and we\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing at Copal Amba, we were just out in India last week a group of us and we\u2019re very pleased with the opportunity that, that business presents.","So just a little bit of a lapping problem and I don't know if Mark has anything more to add about CSI than what he is already said. Mark?","Mark Almeida","I would just add that in training and certification ignoring the currency impact which is quite substantial. Let's say the underlying business is okay, it's not growing as well as the rest of Moody's analytics, so its low trend in that respect but it's alright.","Tim McHugh","And then Mark I guess ERS, I don't know if I missed it but I think in the past you have given kind of a trailing 12 months sales activity or sales growth rate. Can you give that? How does that\u2026","Mark Almeida","I think Linda did mention it, trailing 12 months sales is 24% growth.","Tim McHugh","Does that include WebEquity or is that organic?","Mark Almeida","That includes WebEquity as well.","Ray McDaniel","Which would be a small piece.","Mark Almeida","Yes, it's a small piece, couple of points.","Operator","We will take Vincent Hung with Autonomous. ","Vincent Hung","I just want to pull you back on the question on market share from before. I am really curious as to your strong growth in MIS, so it's up 12% excluding ICRA versus 6% at S&P. And I think one of the sources of dispersion is your non-U.S. results where you saw good year-over-year increase even if you exclude MIS on that. And S&P saw a year-over-year decline. And can you give us some color on the non-U.S. trends you saw this quarter?","Ray McDaniel","I can talk about Moody's; I don't really know anything more than you do about how other firms got to their performance levels in the first quarter. We have talked about the Moody's story pretty extensively here. So Vincent I actually don't have a lot to add to that, I apologize.","Vincent Hung","And then last question. Do you think it would be harsh to say that leverage lending is structurally impaired?","Ray McDaniel","I think that banks have got to work through an evolving regulatory and profitability environment that is going to have an impact on lending. It's also going to continue the disintermediation trend that we've been seeing. And so I think that\u2019s structural as well.","Linda Huber","Vincent its Linda I am going to read you from the Fed's press release on this topic form November 7th. It says the annual shared national credits review with them, that the volume of criticized assets remained elevated to 340.8 billion or 10.1% of total commitments which is approximately double pre crisis level. So let's assume that the banks are listening on that Fed on that front. And perhaps they are tamping down leverage lending in this higher risk category because they have got to hold more capital against these loans as we said even if they put them into CLOs later.","So it's pretty important that that situation be understood. And I would urge you to take a look at what the Fed is saying and also the research we have written on this topic.","Operator","We have Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Please go ahead.","Doug Arthur","One quick question. Linda can you just clarify I think you threw out a figure of 35 million as I believe you are referring to the quarterly trend in clause Q1 to Q4. Can you just clarify that figure is, is that revised given the so much heavier Q1 clause or there no change?","Linda Huber","First of all congratulations Doug on your joining Huber Research. And the number of the mid case the base case we\u2019re looking at now is $30 million of expense ramp, and our first quarter expenses were 494, I think on an earlier call we had said maybe 500 for the first quarter. And I think we have had a steeper ramp originally that might have even been $40 million to $50 million. So we\u2019re kind of backing off on that. Again I would caveat, this is probably the number I dislike giving the most because it can vary based on whole bunch of different things and this is cutting it pretty finally to get that midpoint of $30 million of expense ramp Q1 to Q4, but that\u2019s our best guess as of right now.","Operator","And we'll move on to Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","First question is with the reverse Yankees, I appreciate you saying that you book U.S. revenue but how are you charging for reverse Yankees? Are you actually generating revenues in euro on that, and having those translate back to dollars?","Ray McDaniel","If these are U.S. issuers, U.S. domicile companies we would be charging those in dollars.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","And then a follow-up. S&P or McGraw-Hill in their call talked about how the dollar issuance environment was very strong but the breadth of issuance was not very good and so that going to have ramifications on their growth. And certainly that doesn't seem to be something that you guys talked about or showed up in your results. So can you just maybe talk about, do you tend to have a preference for a lot of smaller deals versus a few bigger deals. And what\u2019s recent environment looked like in that regard?","Ray McDaniel","When we look at volume and we look at count, obviously we\u2019re pleased when both are up. But because of the way the pricing is structured I would say as a general rule seeing more smaller issuers a higher count would make more of a difference than higher dollar volume.","Operator","At this time this concludes Moody's first quarter 2015 earnings call.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ms. Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Salli Schwartz","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on this teleconference to discuss Moody's' first quarter results for 2013. I'm Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the first quarter of 2013. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com. Ray McDaniel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Moody's Corporation, will lead this morning's conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer of Moody's Corporation.","Before we begin, I call your attention to the Safe Harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website.

I'll now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Thank you, Salli. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's' first quarter 2013 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights, and I will then speak to recent regulatory and legal developments and finish with comments on our outlook for 2013. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to respond to your questions.","First quarter revenue of $732 million increased 13% over the first quarter of 2012, reflecting strong operating performance for both Moody's Investors Service and Moody's Analytics. Operating expenses for the first quarter, which include a litigation settlement charge related to the resolution of our Abu Dhabi and Rhinebridge cases, were $451 million, a 19% increase from the first quarter of 2012. Excluding the litigation settlement charge, operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year. Operating income for the first quarter was $280 million, a 4% increase from the prior year period. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income less depreciation and amortization, was $304 million, also up 4% from the same period last year. Excluding the litigation settlement charge, first quarter operating income and adjusted operating income increased 25% and 23%, respectively, year-over-year.","Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter increased 9% from the prior year period to $0.83, which includes the litigation settlement charge of $0.14. Excluding the litigation settlement charge, diluted earnings per share of $0.97 increased 28% year-over-year. Our full year 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $3.49 to $3.59, which reflects our continued focus on cost control and also excludes the impact of the litigation settlement charge.","I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda S. Huber","Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's' total revenue for the quarter increased 13% to $732 million. Foreign currency translation for the quarter was negligible. U.S. first quarter revenue increased 18% to $406 million, while revenue outside of U.S. grew 8% to $326 million and represented 45% of Moody's' total revenue, down slightly from the 47% in the year ago period. Recurring revenue grew 6% to $350 million and represented 48% of total revenue, down from 51% in the prior year period.","Looking now at each of our businesses. Moody's Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $521 million, up 15% from the prior year period. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible. U.S. revenue for MIS increased 21% over the prior year period to $313 million. Revenue outside of the U.S. of $208 million increased 8% and represented 40% of total ratings revenue.","Turning now to the MIS business lines. First, global corporate finance revenue in the first quarter increased 29% from the year ago period to $258 million, primarily driven by strong speculative-grade bank loan and bond issuance as corporations continued to take advantage of historically low interest rates. Revenue was up 25% year-over-year in the U.S. and up 36% outside of the U.S. Secondly, global structured finance revenue for the first quarter was $93 million, down 1% from the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 26% year-over-year due to strong issuance of collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue was down 29% against the prior year period, primarily reflecting weaker issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities in Europe. Thirdly, global financial institutions revenue of $87 million increased 10% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was up 14%, primarily reflecting increased bond issuance by insurance companies, while non-U.S. revenue was up 7% as compared to the first quarter of 2012, driven by stronger banking activity from issuers taking advantage of generally favorable market conditions. Finally for MIS, global revenue for the public project and infrastructure finance business rose 5% year-over-year to $83 million. Revenue was up 10% in the U.S. due to gains in both public and infrastructure finance, while non-U.S. revenue declined 3%.","And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for Moody's Analytics of $211 million was up 9% from the first quarter of 2012. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 10%. As you know, we have not made any organic acquisitions during the past year. We are very pleased with our organic revenue growth this quarter, which demonstrates the inherent strength of our underlying businesses and is among the strongest in our industry. U.S. revenue grew by 10% year-over-year to $93 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased 8% to $118 million and represented 56% of the total Moody's Analytics revenue.","Looking now at each of the MA business lines. Revenue from research, data and analytics of $130 million increased 8% from the prior year period and represented 62% of total MA revenue. Our customer retention rate remains strong in the mid-90s percent range, and we continue to see solid demand for credit research via our CreditView offering. U.S. revenue was up 8% and non-U.S. revenue was up 9% as compared to the first quarter of 2012. Second, revenue from enterprise risk solutions of $53 million grew 10% from last year, reflecting strong growth of products and services that support bank regulatory and compliance activities. Revenue was up 12% in the U.S., and non-U.S. revenue was up 9% against the prior year period. Due to the variable nature of product timing, enterprise risk solutions' revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. Third, professional services revenue grew 7% to $28 million, reflecting strong growth in revenue from Copal Partners, partially offset by softness in the training and certification business.","U.S. revenue increased 32%, while non-U.S. revenue increased 3% year-over-year. Finally, we note that subscription revenue, which includes MA's research, data and analytics segment, of certain products within the MA's enterprise risk solution segment was up 9% for the first quarter of 2013.","Turning now to expenses. Moody's' first quarter expenses were $451 million, an increase of 19% compared to the first quarter of 2012. However, excluding the litigation settlement related to the resolution of our Abu Dhabi and Rhinebridge cases, expenses were up 4% year-over-year. More specifically, this year's P&L will be impacted only in the first quarter by expenses associated with the litigation settlement charge, which is tax-deductible. The impact of foreign currency translation on operating expenses for the quarter was negligible. Moody's reported operating margin for the quarter was 38.3%, down from 41.6% in the first quarter of 2012. Adjusted operating margin was 41.5% for the quarter, down from 45.2% for the same period last year. Again, excluding the litigation settlement charge, first quarter reported operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 46.1% and 49.3%, respectively. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.5% compared with 32.1% for the prior year period.","Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter of 2013, Moody's repurchased 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $91 million or an average price of $48.48 per share and issued 2.2 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans, which are substantially issued in the first quarter of each year. Outstanding shares of March 30 -- as of March 31, 2013, totaled 222.9 million, reflecting a 1% decline from a year earlier. As of March 31, 2013, Moody's had $1.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program, reflecting the additional $1.0  billion of share repurchase authority approved on February 12, 2013. As of March 31, 2013, Moody's had $1.6 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.8 billion as of March 31, 2013, an increase of $943 million from a year earlier.","As of March 31, 2013, approximately 50% of our cash holdings were maintained outside the U.S. Free cash flow of $194 million increased $147 million from a year ago, due in part to first quarter 2012 payments related to the settlement of state and local matters. While -- we remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Thanks, Linda. I'll continue with a brief update on regulatory and legal developments. First, in the U.S. In December 2012, the SEC published its report under Dodd-Frank on matters related to assigning credit ratings for structured finance products, commonly referred to as Franken amendment study. On May 14, the commission will host a roundtable to which Moody's has been invited and in which we will participate.","Turning to Europe. As discussed on previous calls, few additional steps remain in the legislative process for a third round of legislation related to credit rating agencies, known as CRA3, is finalized. We expect that CRA3 will come into effect sometime in the second half of 2013, and we are currently preparing for its implementation. Finally, as you are aware, last week, we settled 2 litigation matters known as the Abu Dhabi and Rhinebridge cases. These settlements allow us put the distraction of these very protracted legal matters behind us.","I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing our full year guidance for 2013. Moody's' outlook for 2013 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability, business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. There's an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, and if actual conditions differ, Moody's' results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. As I mentioned earlier, our full year 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $3.49 to $3.59, which reflects our continued focus on cost control and also excludes the impact of the litigation settlement charge. For Moody's overall, the company still expects full year 2013 revenue to grow in the high single-digit percent range. Full year 2013 operating expenses are now projected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range.","Full year 2013 operating margin is now projected to be 41% to 42%, and adjusted operating margin for the year is now expected to be 44% to 45%. Guidance ranges for operating expenses, operating margin and adjusted operating margin all include the litigation settlement charge. The effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 32%. We still expect full year 2013 share repurchases of approximately $500 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.","Capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately $50 million. We still expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is still projected to be $10 million to $15 million. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $850 million. Certain components of our 2013 guidance have also been modified to reflect the company's currently view of business conditions. For the Global MIS business, revenue for full year 2013 is still expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is now expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range, reflecting anticipated ongoing weakness in the European structured finance markets.","Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Revenue from structured finance is now expected to be about flat, while revenue from financial institutions is still expected to grow in the low single-digit percent range. Public project and infrastructure finance revenue is still expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range. For Moody's Analytics, full year 2013 revenue is still expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., Moody's Analytics revenue is also expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range.","Non-U.S. revenue is now also expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range. Revenue from research, data and analytics is still projected to grow in the high single-digit percent range, while revenue for enterprise risk resolutions is still expected to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Professional services revenue is now projected to grow in the high single-digit percent range, reflecting softness in the training and certification business.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. Michel Madelain, the President of Moody's Investor Service is traveling and unable to join us today. We'd be pleased to take any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll hear first from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The first question, just on the litigation settlement. I mean, I guess you've given us many different ways to back into it, which is helpful. Can you just maybe help clarify how that works with like, I guess, what the accounting is with the 20 million reserves you took last quarter, like does that have any adjustments in this quarter? And also what the tax rate for the tax-deductibility of that settlement is?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, with respect to the reserves, any remaining amounts that we had accrued for defense costs relating to Abu Dhabi or Rhinebridge are no longer necessary, and those have been reversed.","Linda S. Huber","And Manav, it's Linda. We're not going to attempt to go through how the accounting works step by step on the call. However, we would note that our 10-Q is coming out later today. You may want to take a look at that. And as I said earlier in the script, the settlement charge is tax-deductible. We're not going to go into information on the specific rate, though.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Can I ask -- in terms of the guidance, which on the expense and margin side you obviously lowered because of the settlement charge, if we would exclude that, did the sort of ranges and commentary you provided us last quarter change one way or the other materially?","Linda S. Huber","We had been at $3.45 to $3.55, which was a GAAP number. We've had the settlement charge, which is $0.14. Our new EPS guidance, which is non-GAAP, we would note, is $3.49 to $3.59. That centers on $3.54, which shows an increase of $0.04 as a result of, as Ray said, increased focus on cost control. Now we'll see where we go as we go through the year. Ray may want to comment a little bit further. We're only through 1 quarter of the year. In recent years, we've been surprised by things like interesting activities in Europe during the summer. So for this point in the year, we think that $3.49 to $3.59 feels about right.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, I'd just emphasize Linda's point. On Europe, we have taken a cautious approach in our outlook. Hopefully, it's a conservative approach. But for each of the last few years, we have had periods of market interruption or dislocation really centered on some of the stresses and recessionary pressures in Europe.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So Ray, you've enjoyed very impressive growth in the Moody's Investors Services business for the last several years. We're seeing some signs of life domestically in the structured finance markets. So I'm wondering how your thinking has changed, if at all, in terms of sustainable revenue growth outlook for the ratings side of the business now that structured finance seems to be coming back. Are you feeling any more optimistic about what the revenue numbers could look like over the next few years?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, as you note, Peter, I think I've been feeling pretty optimistic about the outlook for the last few years. We have said that we think we can, on average, grow at a low double-digit percent rate. Obviously, that will be subject to cyclical factors. But the underlying drivers for the business, I think, are as strong, if not stronger, today than they have been in recent years. As economic activity regains some momentum in the U.S., as Europe works through the stresses that it has to work through and the consequences of that in terms of changes in the banking system and growth in the bond markets, capital markets and the further maturation of the emerging capital markets, all of these are powerful. I'd also just note that the recent comments, very recent comments, coming out of the European Central Bank looking for resumption of asset-backed securitization activity in Europe are also encouraging, if a longer-term driver.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And Linda, on the tax rate, specifically for the first quarter, beyond litigation, there was something else going on, I assume. Can you help us understand that?","Linda S. Huber","Sure, Peter. That was primarily due to the domestic tax benefit associated with the litigation settlement, but again, we'd ask you to take a look at the Q and see what you think, and then maybe we can help you a little bit further.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then, Linda, can you give me any guidance on the cost of implementation of CRA3? Is that going to be a big item?","Linda S. Huber","What we've said in terms of the incremental regulatory and compliance expense, Peter, we've mentioned, and Ray just confirmed, $10 million to $15 million this year. We think we've got a good start on much of that, but again, those rules are not totally finalized. So we're going to have to wait and see what comes of that. Peter, I wanted to take just a moment to kind of go through market conditions, which Ray had touched on sort of in the macro. And if it's okay with you, we've got some commentaries around what we're hearing from the banks in terms of investment-grade and high-yield issuance, if that's okay with you?","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Please.","Linda S. Huber","Okay. So investment-grade issuance to date 2013, we've heard, has surprised to the upside. We've seen $325 billion of year-to-date issuance versus $319 billion in 2012, which is an increase of 2%. $50 billion had been expected in April, and the total came in at $106 billion. Now $17 billion of that was Apple, so you can do what you want with that information. One bank is reviewing its 2013 volume predictions of $800 billion and may move that up by $50 billion to $100 billion. Another is keeping its original forecast of $750 billion, as it expects issuance to flow in the second half of the year. So you can kind of look at some different views there on issuance. Apple had the largest U.S. dollar offering at $17 billion and generated demand of $50 billion, had the largest single tranche ever of $55 billion. Expected high-grade volumes in May are $80 billion to $100 billion, and expected high-grade second quarter volumes are $200 billion to $250 billion in issuance. The key things we're seeing: continuing drop in U.S. Treasury rates, which were 2.05% in March, 1.64% currently; and continued tightening in spreads. Investment-grade spreads are at record lows, 20 basis points tighter year-to-date, and that is very helpful for borrowers. We're seeing new and infrequent issuers playing a larger role this year. We've seen borrowers who haven't tapped the markets since before 2009 comprise 25% of corporate issuance. So that's a different borrower group than we've seen before. We're seeing dropped new issue concessions and preference for shorter-dated paper as investors are concerned about what will happen with the eventual Fed exit. Use of proceeds is mostly refinancing with some M&A and recent uptick in return of capital, such as Apple, and fund flows have been positive: $29 billion flowing into investment-grade funds versus $23 billion in 2012. If we turn to high yields, similarly to the high-grade market, high yield has outpaced expectations. Demand for loans, though, continues to outpace bonds. Bond, $130 billion year-to-date versus $127 billion last year. Loans at about double that pace, $286 billion in high-yield, high-leverage loans versus $108 billion last year. That's up 65%. We expect those volumes to be about -- bond volumes to be the same as 2012, and loans expected to be higher. We are seeing still a lot of CLO issuance, running 3x ahead of 2012. Use of proceeds for high yield is about 2\/3 refinancing, and the balance, M&A and general corporate purposes. Funds flow is about $1.7 billion into bonds year-to-date, and significantly higher funds flows into leveraged loans, about 4x that of funds. $9.3 billion fund flows into leveraged loans. So we're continuing to see good fundamentals, good levels, and that's helpful to us. So sorry for the long explanation, but hope that's helpful.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's great. That's very helpful. And can I just ask one other thing?","Linda S. Huber","Sure.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","With regard to the Abu Dhabi settlement, should we perhaps interpret that as an indication of greater willingness to consider settlement of other cases?","Raymond W. McDaniel","No. We haven't changed our view on how we handle litigation. As a general matter, our approach is unchanged. There were circumstances in this case that made us feel that the ongoing legal cost of 2 federal trials and the distraction of those cases made it in the best interest of shareholders that we go ahead and complete the settlement.","Operator","Our next question today comes from William Bird with Lazard.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about just your point of view on the durability of the strength you've seen in leveraged loans. And Linda, can you discuss, I guess, how you see your expense profile unfolding in coming quarters?","Linda S. Huber","Sure. On leveraged loans, Bill, it seems to be the place where investors want to be in the high-yield sector right now. As I just said, fund flow is running 4x stronger into those leveraged loans, and it seems to be that, given the questions about the interest rate outlook, variable-rate paper seems to be more attractive to investors than fixed-rate paper. So we would expect that, that trend would probably continue. Now, of course, issuance in the high yield area, whether bonds or loans, is very specifically tied to that all-in funding cost. And if that moves, which it sometimes does, we can see periods where windows close pretty quickly. But for right now, things look relatively good.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, I'd just add that some of this is -- I think we've characterized as opportunistic, given the rate environment that Linda referenced and the relatively narrow spreads that we're seeing. And some of it is, I think, again, more structural in terms of a shift in the mix of debt and the rating of bank loans that are then available to go into other vehicles such as collateralized loan obligations, and there's been a lot of demand for those vehicles. So I would expect that, outside of the opportunistic nature of this, we would also continue to see the diversification of the debt mix available in the market.","Linda S. Huber","And Bill, on your second question regarding the expense outlook, we want to be very clear in explaining to everyone that first quarter includes all the charges related to the litigation settlements. That's it. So you won't see those in the future quarters. If you remove those settlement costs, we still expect expenses to ramp about $50 million over the balance of the year from Q1 sort of normalized expenses through to Q4. About half of that will be growth in compensation, and the other half will be various non-comp costs. So that's what the outlook is for right now.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And what was your incentive comp accrual in the quarter?","Linda S. Huber","Sure. Hang on just one second. We'll get that for you. Okay, incentive comp for the quarter was about $30 million, which was about flat to last year's first quarter incentive compensation accrual.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just staying on the, I guess, on the MIS business and the outlook there. It looks like this quarter, you had tremendous operating leverage if I back out the settlement charge. I mean, really, really high, like 90%-plus or so. So just maybe you can give us a little bit more color on what drove that. Obviously, you just talked about high yield being strong in bank loans, but maybe just talk about the different areas and how they changed your margin profile as we think about the outlook here.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, the strength in corporate finance in terms of issuance volumes was complemented by the mix because it was the speculative-grade part of that market that was so active. And that is, as we've discussed previously, a beneficial area for us financially when that is active. Linda may have some more specifics on this, but I don't think we had 90% leverage. But it was a good quarter, obviously.","Linda S. Huber","Sure, Alex. Generally, I count on Craig to ask this question, but I'll go ahead anyway. For the first quarter of 2013, looking at the corporate line as compared to first quarter last year, investment grade was about flat at $44 million, but that was only 17% of the total corporate line of $258 million. Last year, it was higher at 22%. So high yield was considerably higher, $75.6 million versus $51.6 million last year, and it's 29% of the total corporate line. So you're correct. We've seen much greater revenue from this spec-grade line. Bank loans also considerably higher, $55.8 million this year versus $34.7 million last year. That's up 22%. And other accounts also up nicely to $82.4 million from $70 million last year. That's 32%. So the total for corporate is $258.3 million, and that represents 50% of the whole MIS business. So I hope that helps you.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, I didn't mean to steal anybody's question. But real quick, just to stay on the same topic. When you compare bank loans and high yields, how do those margin profiles compare? I know you can't really compare because it's probably the same people, but how does that usually compare?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, it is the same people, and it's really driven as much as anything by whether we are seeing relatively more refinancing or new money financing from new mandates. And this past quarter, we happened to have both a lot of new mandates, which, because they are more time consuming than companies that we already follow, are initially a lower-margin business, but we also had very high levels of refinancing. So it was just a strong quarter for spec-grade corporate book bonds and loans.","Linda S. Huber","And Alex, as we put out the new investor deck here in a couple of days, we'll have more detail on the new mandates. But new mandates are running strong, and you can see that when we put out that new investor presentation pretty soon.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Just moving on to the capital return real quick. I think you gave the number of 500 million for buybacks. Just backward looking a little bit here, I mean, you bought back a, I would say, small amount of stock in the first quarter. So any more color you can give us? I mean, the stock obviously got crushed, if I may used that word, in early February, and you obviously bought back at a good price. But it seems like you could have been a little bit more aggressive, in particular as you were working towards the settlement. So maybe a little bit more color here.","Linda S. Huber","Alex, we'd point out a year is a long time, and we've only been through 1 quarter. We've done about $91 million worth, which is about 20% of the $500 million that we said we would do. So give us a little bit of time. Things have changed quite a bit here in the last week, so we're now focused on our forward-looking capital allocation program, which we will be discussing, and we'll take a look at our share repurchase. We'll take a look at our dividend levels. The stock price is higher. Dividend yields could use a little bit of work. We'll see where we go with that, but we were -- are well aware of the $500 million commitment, and we've got 3 quarters to go here.","Raymond W. McDaniel","And I'd just add that, again, our ability to conduct opportunistic share repurchase as opposed to programmatic share repurchase is constrained when we have information that the market doesn't, and these litigation settlements were something that we were obviously aware of in the weeks before it was announced.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, that's what I figured. I just wanted to make sure. And then just last one for me. You gave a little bit of color on the outlook here for the second quarter. I think one area you didn't touch upon was the RMBS or -- particularly the private market there. It seems like we're seeing a few green shoots here with a little bit of issuance in the U.S. here, a couple of things coming to market. So any other color you could provide when you talk to the banks and issuers and so forth?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, I would agree with you. We are seeing some green shoots. That market is coming back slowly as issuers and investors look at the appropriate terms, conditions for a resumption of the RMBS market. So the absolute volume levels are still quite light, even though we can see some progress. Unfortunately, it's being more than offset on a cyclical basis from the European side, where the RMBS market, as well as the covered bond market, have been very weak in the first quarter. But again, the good news there is we can see that, that is a cyclical downturn as opposed to something longer-term.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just -- I guess, one change in guidance in structured. You previously saw overall as up mid-single, now you're saying flat. And obviously, U.S. looks quite strong. So I'm wondering if you can elaborate on the weakness you're seeing in structured in Europe. And then, in terms of your guidance for the year, obviously, the comps in the second half, investment grade and high yield, are more difficult. Can you comment on that?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes. As you've, I think, correctly identified, there's a bit of a tug-of-war going on in structured finance, where we're seeing good growth in the U.S. and offsetting declines outside the U.S., particularly centered in Europe, as I said, and particularly centered in the mortgage-backed securities in Europe. Although, really, most asset categories in Europe were down in the first quarter. So we don't expect it to be down as much in the succeeding quarters as it was in the first quarter, but again, we are cautious about the pace of recovery in the European market. As I said earlier in our comments, hopefully, we are being overly conservative on that. But right now, we're just not seeing a lot in the pipeline there.","Linda S. Huber","And Doug, it's Linda. In terms of MIS as a whole, MIS, as we said, did $521 million in the first quarter. The second quarter is about the same, and the third quarter would be the one where we'd ask everybody to focus a little bit and look at expectations for the third quarter in terms of the MIS revenue line. You're right that comps get tougher as we go through the year. But traditionally, third quarter has been a little bit softer. Again, as Ray had said, we continue to be on the watch for any unusual activity in terms of the European situation in the third quarter. And then the fourth quarter, as you pointed out, in 2012 was tremendously strong. And that, as we said on the previous call, may be the only one that isn't absolutely up from last year. So I hope that helps you in terms of how we're thinking about it, which, of course, may or may not be a correct and accurate forecast. We're going to have to see.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So let me just clarify. In the third quarter, you're saying traditionally -- obviously, it's a summer quarter. It's traditional weaker. So I mean, is your implication that, between that and the comps, it will not be up much at this -- obviously, it's very early to have a crystal ball.","Raymond W. McDaniel","No, that's -- we had an unusually strong third quarter last year. Just the market pattern didn't follow what we normally see, and we're assuming that the third quarter is going to go back to being a relatively light quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","I did want to just finish up that one question from before, Linda, if you could just break down within structured finance, financial institutions and PPIF, the revenue categories on a percentage basis and\/or dollar?","Linda S. Huber","Sure, Craig. So we did CFG, and we'll move on to structured. So for the first quarter 2013, global structured revenue was $93 million. And asset-backed securities of that is $23 million. It's about 25% of the total. RMBS, about $17 million, 18% of the total. Commercial real estate, $25 million, which is 28% of the total. And derivatives, $26.8 million, specifically, which is 29% of the total. So again, very good strength in derivatives, and that has been helpful to us. Moving on to the FIG line. We don't usually have a lot of exciting movement here. $86.5 million for the quarter. We're looking at $60 million for banking. It's about 70% of the total, which is about where we were last year. Insurance is $22 million, 26% of the total, marginally up from last year. Managed investments, $3.9 million, almost $4 million. That's 5%. So those percentages are relatively as they were last year, with maybe a bit more strength in insurance. Going on to public project and infrastructure. Total for the quarter is $83 million. Public finance and sovereigns, $42 million, which is 51% of the total, about flat from last year. Munis, about $4 million, again, flat from last year. Project and infrastructure, $37 million, 44%, about the same as last year. And again, the total for PPIF is $83 million. And I think that's it.","Craig Huber","And then also just a couple of quick housekeeping questions, and I think I might have a follow-on. I think the last 2 quarters, your cash on your balance sheet, 50% to 52% of that was tied up overseas. What's the update on that number, please?","Linda S. Huber","Sure. As we said on the script, that continues to be about 50-50. We've got about 8 50  [ph] in the U.S. and about 9 10  [ph] internationally, Craig.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, so it's 48%, 52% right now.","Linda S. Huber","Yes.","Craig Huber","And is the plans of that, given just how expensive it is to take it, bring it back home here, given the tax situation, is just to keep it overseas and use it opportunistically for acquisitions?","Linda S. Huber","Yes, that's correct.","Raymond W. McDaniel","And obviously, if there are opportunities to bring it back under some sort of tax holiday, we, like everyone else in corporate America, would look at that.","Craig Huber","How much is your head count change here in the first 3 months this year, please?","Linda S. Huber","Sure, hang on just a second. Let me see. Since the end of 2012, not too much. Let me see here. We are up, let me see, we're up only 73 people since the end of last year, which is about 1%. So we haven't grown too much. Over the course of the year, Craig, year-over-year comparisons were up 7%. And most of that, again, has been in the business lines, particularly Moody's Analytics, and particularly overseas. Those numbers do exclude -- include Copal Partners. So that can be a big addition, big line of addition for us.","Craig Huber","And then my last question, please. Just speak a little about -- a little further about what happened over in Asia in the quarter on your ratings business.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Sure. The Corporate Finance business in Asia was strong, just as it was in Europe and the U.S. Structured finance, similar to Europe, was somewhat soft, although not nearly to the degree that Europe was. And financial institutions, we had growth that broadly reflected what we saw in the U.S. So low double-digit growth outside of Europe internationally. And public project and infrastructure finance, which is relatively small, but was down a bit in Asia.","Craig Huber","If I could just sneak one more in here. This upcoming roundtable discussion, as you think about that, are you expecting much -- anything material to come out of that?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, we will be participating in it. There are a couple of different panels. I think, as you would expect, the roundtables are an opportunity for people with very diverse points of view to share their views and for the staff at the SEC to collect this wide range of viewpoints. I expect that's what's we're going to hear, given the roles and responsibilities of the different participants who are joining the roundtable.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So my first question is with the Abu Dhabi and the King County cases resolved, I think that knocks out 2 of the 3 legal proceedings that you had discussed in your SEC filings. So maybe now is a good time to take a step back and kind of talk about where you see yourself in the overall process of dealing with these issues? And then, I guess, on a similar vein, when you are through dealing with all these issues, how do you view your professional expenses and the impact on your expense base when you no longer have to deal with all this stuff?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes. Just to answer the second question first, yes, we would expect to see a reduction in our ongoing legal defense costs from what they are today. The trials that -- or the lawsuits that we are continuing to deal with are -- many of them are in discovery, and the discovery process is a relatively expensive process. That being said, of the U.S. lawsuits that were filed since the financial crisis, we had about a little more than 4 dozen cases against us, and a little more than 3 dozen of those cases are -- have been disposed of in one way or another.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you have about a dozen outstanding cases that you're currently working your way through?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, approximately.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] It appears there are no further questions or comments at this time.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Okay. I just want to thank everyone for joining the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you again in July. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Please go ahead.","Sallilyn Schwartz - Moody's Corp.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on this teleconference to discuss Moody's fourth quarter and full year 2016 results as well as our outlook for full year 2017. I am Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations and Communications.

I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Thank you, Salli. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. And I will then conclude with comments on our outlook for 2017. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","In the fourth quarter, Moody's revenue of $942 million increased 9%, primarily as a result of higher issuance in global leveraged finance, U.S. CLOs and U.S. public and project finance, as well as continued strength from Moody's Analytics.","Many of Moody's other fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial measures were impacted by the company's January 2017 agreement reached with the U.S. Department of Justice, 21 U.S. states, and the District of Columbia to resolve pending and potential civil claims related to credit ratings assigned during the financial crisis era. The agreement, while costly at $864 million, removed legacy legal risk as well as future costs and uncertainty. As such, we felt that putting these claims behind the company was in the best interest of Moody's, our employees and our shareholders.","Fourth quarter adjusted operating expense, which excludes the $864 million settlement charge, was $551 million, up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income, which excludes the settlement charge as well as depreciation and amortization, was $424 million, up 17% from the same period last year. The adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 45%, up 320 basis points from 41.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.23, up 13% from $1.09 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter 2016 adjusted EPS excludes a $3.63 loss from the settlement charge and an $0.18 gain from a non-cash foreign exchange benefit related to a subsidiary liquidation.","Turning to full year performance, against volatile market conditions, Moody's achieved 2016 revenue of $3.6 billion, up 3% from 2015. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Moody's revenue by 1%. Moody's Investors Service record second half revenue overcame a very challenging first quarter, allowing MIS to record a 2% revenue increase to $2.4 billion. The impact of foreign currency on MIS revenue was negligible. Moody's Analytics revenue surpassed $1.2 billion in 2016, a 7% increase over the prior year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 3%.","Adjusted operating expense, which excludes the settlement charge and a $12 million restructuring charge, was $2.1 billion, up 4% from the prior year. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%. Adjusted operating income, which excludes the settlement and restructuring charges as well as depreciation and amortization, was $1.6 billion, up 3% from 2015.","Moody's adjusted operating margin for 2016 was 45.5%, consistent with the prior year. Recognizing ongoing uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, our 2017 outlook is for mid-single-digit-percent revenue growth and EPS of $5.15 to $5.30, which includes an estimated $0.15 benefit from an accounting change related to equity compensation.","I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the fourth quarter was $942 million, up 9% from the prior-year period. U.S. revenue of $534 million was up 11%. Non-U.S. revenue of $408 million was up 6% and represented 43% of Moody's total revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Moody's revenue by 2%. Recurring revenue of $472 million was approximately flat to the prior year and represented 50% of total revenue.","Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service, total MIS revenue for the quarter was $608 million, up 12% from the prior-year period. U.S. revenue increased 11% to $376 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $232 million was up 13% and represented 38% of total Ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.","Moving to the lines of business for MIS; first, global corporate finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $278 million, up 13% from the prior period. This result reflected increased levels of U.S. and European rated bank loan issuance as well as higher global speculative grade bond rating revenue. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were up 6% and 28%, respectively.","Second, global structured finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $131 million, up 14% from the prior-year period. This result reflected increased deal activity in U.S. CLOs and CMBS and in European RMBS and CLOs. U.S. and non-U.S. structured finance revenues were up 18% and 7%, respectively.","Third, global financial institutions revenue of $89 million was down 4% from the prior-year period, primarily as a result of reduced European banking issuance. U.S. financial institutions revenue was up 4%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 8%.","Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $103 million was up 21% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven by strong non-U.S. infrastructure and U.S. public finance issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenues were each up 21%.","MIS Other, which consists of non-rating revenue from ICRA in India and Korea Investors Service, contributed $8 million to MIS revenue for the fourth quarter, up 10% from the prior-year period.","And turning now to Moody's Analytics, global revenue for MA of $334 million was up 4% from the fourth quarter of 2015. U.S. revenue of $158 million was up 11%. Non-U.S. revenue of $176 million was down 1% and represented 53% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 4%. On a constant currency organic basis, MA revenue grew 5% in the fourth quarter.","And moving now to the lines of business for MA; first, global research, data and analytics, or RD&A, revenue of $167 million was up 3% from the prior-year period and represented 50% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly driven by new sales and contract upgrades for credit research and ratings data feeds. U.S. RD&A revenue was up 7%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 1%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted RD&A revenue by 4%.","Second, global enterprise risk solutions, or ERS, revenue of $130 million was up 7% from last year. The growth was driven primarily by the March 2016 acquisition of GGY as well as an increase in software license revenue. U.S. ERS revenue was up 24%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 1%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted ERS revenue by 3%.","Trailing 12-month revenue and sales for ERS increased 12% and 4%, respectively. Product sales were up 13% while services declined 16%, reflecting our progress on shifting the mix of the ERS business to emphasize higher margin products.","Third, global professional services revenue of $37 million was down 3% from the prior-year period. U.S. professional services revenue was flat, while non-U.S. revenue was down 4%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted professional services revenue by 3%.","Turning now to operating expense. Moody's fourth quarter adjusted operating expense, which excludes the settlement charge Ray mentioned earlier, was $551 million, up 3% from 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to increased incentive compensation, the March 2016 acquisition of GGY, and annual merit increases largely offset by management savings initiatives implemented in early 2016. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted adjusted operating expense by 3%. As Ray mentioned, Moody's adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points to 45% in the fourth quarter.","Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Moody's repurchased 558,000 shares at a total cost of $60 million or an average cost of $107.48 per share and issued 86,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plans.","Moody's returned $71 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the fourth quarter of 2016. For full year 2016, Moody's repurchased 7.7 million shares at a total cost of $739 million, or an average cost of $96.38 per share and issued 2.8 million shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plans. Moody's returned $285 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during 2016. The total capital returned to shareholders in 2016 was $1 billion. Additionally, on December 21, 2016, Moody's increased its quarterly dividend by 3% from $0.37 to $0.38 per common share of stock.","Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2016 totaled 190.7 million, down 3% from December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, Moody's had approximately $700 million of share repurchase authority remaining. At year-end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program, which is backstopped by an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility.","Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at year-end were $2.2 billion with approximately 78% held outside the U.S. Free cash flow in 2016 was $1.1 billion, up 4% from 2015, primarily due to changes in working capital.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing our full year guidance for 2017. A complete list of Moody's guidance is included in our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on the Moody's Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.","Moody's outlook for 2017 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Our outlook does not include any estimated impact for potential changes in U.S. tax laws or other possible policy or regulatory changes. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-year exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.24 to \u00a31 and for the euro of $1.05 to \u20ac1.","As I noted earlier, Moody's expects full year 2017 revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Adjusted operating expenses expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range from the 2016 adjusted operating expense of $2.1 billion.","On a constant dollar basis, the revenue growth rate would be approximately 120 basis points higher and the adjusted operating expense growth rate would be approximately 170 basis points higher. The company is projecting an operating margin of approximately 43%, up approximately 100 basis points compared to 2016's operating margin, excluding the settlement and restructuring charges of 42%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 46%.","The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 31% to 32% and reflects the U.S. accounting change related to equity compensation as well as changes to U.K. tax laws as noted in our earnings press release.","Full-year 2017 EPS is expected to be $5.15 to $5.30 including the estimated $0.15 per share benefit resulting from the accounting change previously mentioned.","Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $500 million, which includes the payment of settlement charge recorded in the company's fourth quarter 2016 financial results. Moody's expects share repurchases to be approximately $500 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $100 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $135 million.","For MIS, the company expects full-year 2017 revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Both U.S. and non-U.S. revenues are expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. On a constant dollar basis, the revenue growth rate for MIS would be approximately 100 basis points higher.","Corporate finance revenue, structured finance revenue, and financial institutions revenue are each expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range.","For Moody's Analytics, the company expects 2017 revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range and non-U.S. revenue is expected increase in the high-single-digit percent range. On a constant dollar basis, the revenue growth rate for MA would be approximately 180 basis points higher.","Research, data and analytics revenue is projected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. Enterprise risk solutions revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range and professional services revenue is expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics, and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investors Service. We'll be pleased to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Hey. Hello, everyone. I think my questions are mainly for Linda today. Starting with the expenses, I think the margin guidance was a nice surprise relative to what you said before. Could you walk through the puts and takes a little bit more? How should we think about what's driving the upside, is it the way you've ended in terms of being soft on hiring this year, what about legal expenses that might be coming down post the settlement, and maybe any color on variable compensation, how \u2013 what we should be expecting for the year? Thank you.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Okay, Alex. I'm glad you're happy and I have a couple of points to make about that. We did do better in 2016 due to some pretty rigorous expense control measures that we took back in February of last year. So we did better at the conclusion of 2016 even than we had expected. Those controls will continue going into 2017. So we feel pretty good about guiding to approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion. Some of that does come from savings from legal costs, but the majority is what we're doing in terms of hiring. We have slowed the pace of hiring for the corporation. MA continues to move a little bit faster than the rating agency and shared services. Looking at 2016 over 2015, MIS is actually down in head count and shared services is approximately flat. So, all those things have helped us just with good general housekeeping and some discipline.","In terms of incentive compensation, let me find the right page here and we'll talk about that. As what sometimes happens, we noticed that in the fourth quarter because our performance was a good deal stronger in 2016, Alex, the quarters had gone in 2016 for incentive compensation about $32 million, $35 million, $42 million. And then as sometimes happens, the fourth quarter was $59.6 million in incentive compensation.","For 2017, probably the right thing to model there is somewhere between $40 million and $45 million per quarter of incentive compensation. And does that hit most of what you wanted?","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","I think that got everything. Secondly, similar on cash flow I guess, how should we be thinking about the settlement and how you will actually end up paying for that and the timing of all that? So if you can run through the kind of like the buybacks, are those going to be more third quarter or fourth quarter, how about \u2013 are you going to draw on the revolver or the commercial paper program, what's the interest rate we should be thinking about? I don't think you guided on interest expense. So just think about, you have a lot of cash overseas, you generate decent cash here, but maybe not enough. So how should we thinking about that? And then maybe lastly related to that. How do you think about leverage in general? Because if you need to raise a little bit more debt for this, like, I think you're hitting some of your initial targets. Are those targets changing? How do you think about it from being a rated company yourself, anything we should be thinking about here? Thank you.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Okay. Alex, that's about all the questions.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","I know that (21:35).","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Let me try to start with the DOJ settlement. So the happy news is, we're done or we're just about done. The payments have been made. Those were largely completed and the way we did that was cash on hand, U.S. cash on hand. You'll recall back in 2016, we've reduced share repurchase guidance from $1 billion to $750 million. And then also for those who've been paying close attention, we've reentered the commercial paper market. We have about $600 million of commercial paper outstanding right now about an average maturity of 60 days and we're paying about 1.2% on that commercial paper. So we're very happy with the receptivity of the commercial paper markets and that's how we have financed the payment of the settlement. So again that's done. Going forward, we've guided to about $500 million of share repurchase for the rest of the year, that's subject to many things as we've discussed already, but some of it is how cash flow comes in for the year for the company, so we'll see.","As we announced the settlement, one of the other rating agencies that looked at us did provide a little bit more leverage room for us under its measure, which is now 1.5 times to 2 times rather than the 1.5 times that you had seen before.","However, we very much like our rating category that we have right now and we don't like to run right up to the edge of our leverage level, so we feel that we have some dry powder. We're happy about that. We have at least $500 million of dry powder, something like that, as we look at what we might want to do for 2017.","So we like the leverage levels. We have a bit of room, share repurchase about $500 million, and again we just want to be thoughtful given everything that we've just had to deal with and we don't like to be too close to the edge in terms of the leverage levels.","I don't know if Ray had anything else you wanted to add. I think that's most of it.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","No, I just want to underscore both and this is implied both in the question and then addressed directly by Linda's answer. But between our cash on hand and our various borrowing options, we feel we have quite a bit of flexibility. And so, we are going to be making decisions according to market conditions as we go through the year and, as I imagine you would expect, we're going to pay close attention to what we think are the best opportunities.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. Alex, one final point which may not have been taken into account in by everyone looking at their models. We did do some financing in 2016. So, you'll see in 2017 the roll-forward effect of that interest expense. Secondly, we do have the $600 million of CP and we are considering the term market at this time and we'll see what we decide to do about that. But again, if we take that 1.2% expense \u2013 I'm sorry, the rate we're paying for the CP and we term that out, I think it'd be fair to say that we would expect that that interest expense would be a little bit heavier. So, we're considering that right now and that's one of the reasons why everything doesn't flow fully down to EPS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Very helpful as usual. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. My first question is just any thoughts on issuance given the new administration, I'm sure you're predicting that one. And what could that do to your current projections? Any internal scenarios you're setting up for.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Joe, what we'll do, I'll go through what we usually do regarding our views that we're hearing from the investment banks, and then we have an exciting new feature. Rob Fauber is going to add a little bit of color in terms of what the rating agency is noting in the marketplace. So, starting with the U.S. view, and again, this is coming from the investment banks and it's sort of an averaging of what we're hearing from the different banks. Investment grade right now is running very, very strong. January was $200 billion in issuance, a strong month is $100 billion, and this is record January supply. Financials had dominated as well as significant issuance from TMT companies. For the year, we're looking at about $1.2 billion of U.S. investment grade issuance. That's about flat year-over-year.","The pipeline is robust as corporates exit their blackout periods and potentially look to get ahead of Fed rate hikes later in the year, which might be June, could be March, and then potentially again toward the end of the year. We note that many issuers we're hearing from the banks pre-funded in favorable 2016 issuance environment that might serve as a bit of an offset to 2017. And we're thinking about the M&A pipeline which is bouncing around a bit.","For U.S. high-yield, $35 billion issued so far, $250 billion expected for the year, which is up 5% year-over-year. 2017 has started on a positive tone. Large cash inflows to high yield, recovering commodity prices and attractive yields are very constructive. More constructive default scenarios and energy price outlooks are helping with the backdrop, and we think that will support 2017 high-yield bond issuance.","Leveraged loan so far, $120 billion. That is a torrid pace. $400 billion expected this year. The year is expected to be down 15% year-over-year. But right now, stability in the macro backdrop is aiding the leveraged loan market. With potential interest rate increases, the floating rate view is preferred for investors. And we continue to have CLO formation and that will support leveraged loan activity; not enough, though, to surpass the elevated levels of 2016.","Now moving to Europe, what we've heard from the banks, investment grade in Europe, volumes were higher than usual in January as issuers took advantage of the good conditions and low rates. The ECB and Bank of England continue to buy bonds and support the market. And there's a strong pipeline as issuers look to go to market ahead of the key political events in Europe and potential ECB tapering. We're about two months away from the French election as the first major event.","High yield in Europe and the leveraged loan market remain in robust shape. ECB bond buying has indirectly supported the high-yield market and should help maintain rates at all-time lows. Macroeconomic and geopolitical risks continue to be the key focus, though, in Europe particularly for the speculative grade market.","And now, I'll invite Rob to make any further comments that he might want to offer.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Linda, that was pretty thorough. I don't have too much to add to that. I might just talk about a little bit of kind of the upsides and downsides in general to how we're thinking about issuance. Certainly, higher economic growth leading to more capital investment and in turn debt financing would be a positive. Some sort of infrastructure stimulus, either privately funded or in the municipal market. More constructive M&A environment, certainly Linda touched on that. And I think, importantly, a pull-forward of these 2019 through 2021 maturity walls. We think we're seeing some pull-forward now. But if we see more pull-forward, that could provide some upside.","The things we're thinking about as potential headwinds, I think you mentioned potentially unfavorable tax changes. I know there has been a lot of discussion around that, around corporate interest, tax deductibility, repatriation of foreign cash. Interestingly, we did see in January some very large issuance from some big tech players, who have large cash balances offshore. And we're looking at trade developments that could disrupt market, stall investment. Obviously, watching the election calendar in the EU. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar would also be something that would have an impact on us as well.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","And not that we're supposed to ask the questions, but Rob you had mentioned one of the pieces of research we've released last week on the refinancing model.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. I don't want to confuse people because I don't have the global numbers handy, but we just put out some research last week, I know, in regards to the U.S. spec grade, maturity wall. We're looking at the five-year maturity walls now over $1 trillion for the first time. That's up about $100 billion from the study this time last year.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. So any color, though, on sort of real-time what the clients are telling you given the new administration. Are you seeing a wait-and-see approach or any pull-forwards? I'm just wondering if there is anything outside of kind of what you laid up from the issuance side of things.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","No. This is Ray. Obviously, conditions were very strong in January. And the markets remain active in February. We really don't expect to see the January kind of numbers in the loan and high-yield sectors continue with that pace, but market conditions remain good. All of that indicates that issuers are taking advantage of a tight spread environment. They may be moving ahead of uncertainty later in this year, whether it's policy uncertainty here in the U.S. or the potential implications of unexpected outcomes in the European election. So, the pull-forward is, I think, both a recognition of good market conditions and potential uncertainties later in the year.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And then the last one from me, on the regulatory side, we've heard about some repeal maybe at some large institutions. Just wondering if you had any thoughts about any of that impact on your Analytics practice? Thanks.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I'll let Mark comment on how they're thinking about that and I'll add any color, if appropriate.","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Yeah. I'd say that we are not seeing any meaningful impact, any of the talk about pullback on banking regulation, for example. We're still seeing very good demand for our products, for regulatory requirements as well as some of the accounting rule changes that are coming through, both IFRS 9 and the Current Expected Credit Loss, CECL, program that's coming in in the U.S. So, nothing meaningful from our standpoint.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a strong quarter.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Thanks.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, first question on, I wanted to ask about new issuer rating mandates for 2016, how that's been trending versus previous years?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Well, the fourth quarter was up year-on-year. We had, I think, about 175 new rating mandates in Q4. So that's good, looking forward into the new year. We are not at peaks we were at back in 2013, 2014, but it has been a stable flow of new mandates at healthy levels, just off-peak levels. Rob, I don't know if there's anything else worth adding on that.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","No, I think that's right.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","How's the breakdown between Europe and U.S.?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","I don't have that number in front of me. Rob is telling me it was skewed towards the U.S...","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","... at least in the fourth quarter.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the Moody's Analytics side, just wanted to ask how things were looking at RD&A in terms of how the retention rates are being holding up, how the pricing realization has been?","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","It continues to be strong on both fronts. We're running in the mid-90s on customer retention, pricing is solid. We're seeing good upgrade activity. So that's all strong. I mean, any softness we see in the RD&A numbers for the quarter really are down to currency, I mean, we really took it on the chin on currency translation in Europe. So it's hit us pretty hard. But the underlying business is as strong as it's been over the last couple of years.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Then last question on ERS, you had mentioned the GGY acquisition which you're going to be anniversarying and then also what looked like very strong software license revenue. So I was going to ask for some help in terms of modeling that out for the rest of the year, how we should think about that?","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Well. You're right. We had a good year in 2016, because we had very good performance in the business. We also had help from GGY acquisition. So that was all good. Linda also referred to the fact that we are making good progress on our transition in the mix of the business, as we've been talking about for a while. We are deemphasizing the services piece of the business and focusing much more heavily on sales of products that are much more scalable and, therefore, much more profitable. So the impact of that will flow through to 2017 revenue in the sense that we had a deliberate revenue decline in the services segment of the business. And so you're going to see that flowing through to revenue growth in 2017.","So we're guiding toward mid-single-digit revenue growth in ERS and I think the way to think about that is, think about 2017 in terms of ERS revenue growth as sort of a transition year as we shift the mix of the business away from services and focus more heavily on products, which we think will drive a much stronger P&L over the coming years.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Linda, just to follow up on the expense commentary, could you give us the ramp that you usually guide us to from now to the fourth quarter? And also, how much of the 100 basis points is coming from the Moody's Analytics side? Maybe you could just update us on the efforts for the margin improvement there.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Sure. Manav, the first question is a little bit easier and maybe I'll let Mark to think a little bit about what he wants to say on your second question. This year, we're hoping that the ramp will be a little bit flatter than it's been in previous years. So to give you somewhere to start, I think I've got this right. We're looking at about $532 million for the first quarter budget for expenses in 2017 and we're looking at the ramp going up $20 million to $25 million from the first quarter to fourth quarter.","Now I'll give the same warning that I give every year that includes the view that incentive compensation lays out pretty evenly for the year. We haven't had that sort of performance recently in 2016. You'll note, incentive comp went way up in the fourth quarter because of the strong performance. But all things being equal, you want to start with $532 million or so and take it up $20 million to $25 million.","Now, we've had a pretty significant margin work in MIS and some pretty strong cost controls in shared services in 2016. That reduces the kind of the run rate increase for 2017. And Mark's continuing to focus on margin by looking at his higher margin businesses, as we've said in the prepared remarks.","I don't know, Mark, if you want to make any other comments on your thoughts?","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Yeah. I mean, I would only observe consistent with what we said before that I think we are making good progress with the MA margin. The challenge that we have is it's difficult for you to see that because of the way that we allocate overhead expense to the two operating businesses. MA, as it's been growing faster than MIS over the last couple of years, is attracting more overhead. So that's sort of offsetting the work that we're doing in the business itself.","So it's difficult for you to see it \u2013 because of that, it's difficult for you to see it because of the impact on the margin, at least in the short run, with some of the acquisitions we've made. So, we believe we're making good progress. We think that progress is only going to get better over the coming years, but it is going to be difficult to see it on the MA standalone P&L just given the way we treat overhead expense.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So is the target still mid-20s over several years?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yes.","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Yes.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. And then just one on the rating side, maybe, Rob can add some color here, but I think you guys have put out some pieces around tax reform and the impact on the issuance. I mean, it sounds like for Moody's company specifically, obviously the lower tax and repatriations are positive. But just on the broader tax reform piece, I mean, I guess it sounds like the view is it should be a negative, but how should we think about timing and how that impacts issuance and the company's decision-making, any help or color there would be helpful?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","That's right. When we look at potential changes in taxes, it's really \u2013 there are a number of puts and takes. Certainly, to the extent that there are impacts from changes in interest deductibility, you have to count that as a negative, but to the extent that debt financing is still a low cost form of financing, you would have companies that have more available cash. It would probably be a stimulus for economic growth and so there I would hope and anticipate we would see more new money borrowing, so that the quantification of whether it ends up being a net negative or a net positive is difficult to assess without having more detail about what the actual changes in tax law would be, and as we see that, we will obviously communicate it.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. All right, thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","And we'll go next to Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Good morning.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","In 2016, your transactional revenue \u2013 ratings revenue growth was up about 0.5% while your biggest competitor was up about 6% in transactional ratings. What do you think the key drivers are that explain the delta there, just given that historically you've been a little bit more in terms of transactional mix shift. And so just wanted to figure out what we should be thinking about?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Toni, it's Linda. This is one of the most difficult types of questions for us to answer, because we can see what goes in that view for us, but of course we don't know what goes into that calculation for our competitor, it makes it pretty hard for us to judge. I'll ask Rob if he wants to make any other comments on this, but that wouldn't \u2013 we don't have as much clarity on that as you might think and it's a little hard for us to parse. Rob?","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, the only thing I think I could surmise would there be some sort of shift in the mix.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, and just to add on to that. Our transaction versus recurring revenue splits remained fairly constant in 2016 versus 2015. So we didn't see any big shifts there.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And so, and I guess related, can you just talk about sort of the pricing environment within MIS?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Sure. It's Linda. We had spoken about at Investor Day back in 2016 that we felt pretty good about the pricing environment, I think that continues. I think I had noted then that we expected to be closer to the 4% end of the range we had said of 3% to 4%. We are very interested in providing appropriate value for what we do. And we think that we've made some significant investments in what the team has been able to do in terms of ease of use and otherwise very strong value proposition, which I'll let Rob talk about. But we're feeling okay about pricing. Rob, anything else you want to mention?","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","No. I think that's it.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then your long-term framework calls for EPS growth in the teens, this coming year you're expecting a mid-single-digit MIS growth environment. Why only 5% on the EPS increase excluding the tax benefit? I think you did mention perhaps the higher interest expense before rolling into 2017 from the actions you took in 2016. But are there other pieces that we should be thinking about as well?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Toni, you might want to note the new accounting provision, it's helpful to us. But the U.K. has a couple of laws; it's going to limit the interest deductibility piece to 30% of EBITDA. And that is costing us about 160 basis points on the tax line. The tax line is, in this climate, one of the more challenging things for us to predict. If we do see a change in tax policy, I would note, which might be helpful to you that a 1% change in the ETR, that's 100 basis points, gives us $0.07 to $0.08 in EPS which is a lot.","So we're quite sensitive to what happens to that tax line, but you know that we've guided to 31% to 32%. We'll see what happens with that, and there is obviously some variability around it. So we're taking a prudent view on this given what we know now, and if we have adjustments, we'll be happy to discuss those with you on future calls. Ray, I don't know if you want to...?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. The only other thing I would direct you to is the fact that we do have higher financing costs this year than we did last year, part of that is the roll-forward of financing that we did during the year, last year, and part of it is the fact that we've done some financing and we'll continue to do some financing as a result of the settlement with the Department of Justice and the payments that were made there. So that's just giving us an increase in that line that we normally wouldn't see.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll go next to Warren Gardiner with Evercore.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks. On the margin in Analytics in the quarter, it sounds like there are a couple of moving parts there with GGY and some FX. I mean, any sense you could kind of parse that out for us and give us what do you kind of think the, I guess, core margin would be for that business?","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Well, I can tell you that, if we ignore the additional overhead expense that we absorbed and we ignore the impact of the acquisition. For the quarter, the margin would have been flat to 2015. I should also note that we've got a couple of million dollars of \u2013 we had a couple of million dollars of non-recurring expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 that we won't have going forward. And so, you probably \u2013 if you want to look at on a run rate basis, you want to back out a couple of million dollars for that as well.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. I guess then on expenses overall \u2013 for Linda maybe, in the past you guys have \u2013 and this has kind of been asked a little bit, but in the past you guys have given us a sense of what you might have to kind of pull back on if things got choppy. Any sense what that level of flexibility would be for 2017?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, I think I'd stick to what we said in 2016, we always tell you guys we can achieve $50 million of expense savings and, voila, we achieved $50 million of expense savings. So there is probably another $50 million in there across the company. I would note that we are being very thoughtful about expenses. We note that both operating expenses and CapEx, CapEx is looking to be up about $100 million as we go through 2017. We've had a little bit of lightening up in terms of our real estate projects. We'd taken two floors in One World Trade Center in 2016. And as you know, we're making some investment in our technology, but we expect that to lighten up a little bit in 2017. So, we're guiding to $100 million, as we had said.","So, just across the board, we're just being really careful with what we're doing and considering every cost. We do have a procurement group that's done a really nice job on some of our expenses, such as T&E, and we're managing very, very closely. So, we'll think about maybe flexibility for another $50 million for 2017.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Okay. Makes sense. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll go next to Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks and good afternoon. I guess I wanted to come back to the ERS growth and the assumed deceleration of mid-single digit from double digits the last three years. I know you called out the mix shift of going towards products away from services. One, I just want to confirm is, for similar I guess offering \u2013 I'm sorry, the implication that it's a lower price. So, I just want to confirm that that's right, for one. And then two is that, how much of it is that versus just you being conservative? The last couple of years, I think you've guided to mid-single digits and put up something much healthier than that.","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Yeah. Andre, a couple of things. First, as Linda said earlier, she noted that trailing 12-month sales in ERS are up 4% and then she decomposed that. She said that product sales \u2013 again trailing 12 months, product sales are up 13% and services are down 16%. So, if you just start with the trailing 12-month sales for ERS, up 4%, that's sort of flows through to our mid-single-digit revenue guidance for 2017, right, because we've got sort of the lag on revenue recognition. So, that's sort of how we get to the guidance. The mix shift, again, is designed to deliver more margin. I think you're right in talking about fees. You're right in the sense that over the last number of years, we've done some very large projects for customers where we charged many millions of dollars for the services work that we did.","So in that respect, that \u2013 not doing projects of that scale and charging those kinds of fees for services will put a bit of a drag on top-line growth. But we think that because the product is more mature, it is more scalable. It meets more needs for more customers. We think we'll be able to sell more. But I guess what I'm saying is we're going to make it up \u2013 to some degree, we're going to make it up on volume. So we'll be able to \u2013 as we get through this transition, we'll be able to get to a very better growth rate over time.","And then, the other thing to keep in mind here is, that decline \u2013 that 16% decline in services sales in 2016 was kind of a one-time phenomenon. Our expectation is that we'll hold that line flat going forward. So, you won't see a big contraction there. We'll be holding that flat, while the product line continues to grow at a double-digit rate. So, we think we're going to get to \u2013 on balance, we'll get to a much healthier overall growth rate in ERS, which is why I say it's healthy to think \u2013 or helpful to think of 2017 as a transition year for the business.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just a follow-up on the margin question a couple other people ask. Definitely makes sense that you're getting more overhead. You've been talking about that for a while now. It's just explicitly to make sure we modeled it right. Should we assume that margins for that business are up next year as you work through this transition, or is getting to the mid-20s more backend loaded?","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Well, again, we don't give specific margin guidance by line of business. But I will tell you, again, that if we were to \u2013 you ignore the GGY acquisition, you ignore the additional overhead that we attracted in 2016, and if you ignore that couple of million dollars that I mentioned that non-recurring expense that we had in the fourth quarter, we would have seen over 100 basis points of margin expansion in MA from 2015 to 2016. And I would expect that trend to continue.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. Ray, what's left on the legal front?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Fortunately, not much. If we step back and look at all of the crisis era litigation, we've now disposed of better than 90% of what we were facing globally. So, very little left in terms of numbers.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","And then, Linda, I understand the rationale in terms of lower pace of share repurchase in 2017. Should we anticipate then that in 2018 maybe you get back to more of the $1 billion kind of run rate you've been doing in recent years?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Peter, it's hard for us to guide that far ahead in terms of share repurchase. We do look at market conditions. We do want to reinvest in our businesses, and share repurchase oftentimes is sort of the last number that we look at, given that. We thought it was best to be prudent for this year. Yes, we would like to return to more vigorous share repurchase, but we're going to have to see it. It's too early to tell where that will go.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","I think the fairest thing we could say looking out that far is we believe we would certainly have the capacity...","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","... to do so and we'd make those decisions near the date.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. And then lastly, Rob, just on the trends in the structured finance market, which seems like it's basically come back to life. Any commentary in terms of changes you're seeing in the market that might give you more confidence in the sustainability of volumes there. And any commentary on competitive dynamics, because it does seem like there's more competitive pressures in that market than you see elsewhere? Thanks.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. Maybe, I'll focus primarily on the U.S., it's obviously the largest market. So in the ABS sector, got off to a bit of a subdued start as folks were still adapting to the Reg AB II loan-level reporting requirements, but the pipeline's certainly heating up and activity is heating up in February on some very strong demand there.","In terms of CMBS, we saw very weak start that was due to a pull-forward of deals from the risk retention deadline at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. And I would say that CMBS hasn't weathered risk retention quite as well as the CLO market. So we're only seeing two risk retention compliant deals get printed since the deadline at the end of December. That said, there is a pipeline building in CMBS.","And then CLO, we've seen some very strong issuance continuing into the first quarter of 2017. So obviously you saw in our results, there is a very strong issuance in the fourth quarter, due to a real pull-forward from 2017 into 2016 in advance of that risk retention deadline. I would note that much of the early volume in the first quarter in CLOs is refi, as spreads have come in, we are starting to see some new CLO formation come into the March pipeline as the CLO market seems to have found some structures that work within the risk retention framework. Just in terms of \u2013 from a competitive standpoint, our coverage continues to be strong and we actually seen some nice gains in our coverage in Europe.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Tim McHugh with William Blair & Co.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Just on the margin question, obviously 2017 is better. I guess, are you finding things that you didn't expect or are we seeing some of the expected margin expansion that you talked about at the Investor Day in terms of the path towards 45%, just come faster than you would have otherwise expected?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. I think it's is a couple of things. We have taken actions in 2016 that we're somewhat accelerated against our original expectations and we're getting the benefits of those. We've also got a little bit, as you might imagine, better position on the legal side now than we had last year. We are still anticipating that we can move to the mid-40s-percent margin. Overall \u2013 again, subject to the mix of the two different businesses, but \u2013 so yes, you've got an acceleration of what we were identifying earlier in the year, last year. Linda, I don't know if there is anything else you wanted to add to that?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. We're very pleased with the progress we've made in 2016. I think we even surprised ourselves frankly, Tim. We did a $12 million restructuring charge. The genesis of that was split sort of half and half between the rating agency and shared services. We're being very careful with what we're doing in head count and in shared services we're very thoughtful about our use of lower cost locations and those are our own employees that we're using in those lower cost locations. So we've gotten the run rate down, and we're very happy about that, and we're being really careful about what we do going forward. So I think it's good housekeeping. And Ray and I encouraged our colleagues to think hard about the margin line, and everybody really got the message and did a great job, and we expect that that will continue.","We run the business in a very disciplined way. We've been very careful in terms of adding new head count and even backfilling. So we're pleased with what we're seeing, and we're doing a little bit better than we even thought. So we're very happy with all of that. There is no magic to it. It's just day-to-day hard work and good discipline.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. Just to follow up on the tax benefits from the new stock comp rules, I guess. Is that causing more seasonality in the tax rate that we should expect? Because \u2013 I know there is timing differences sometimes and when you will recognize the benefit associated with that part of it, I don't know if the U.K. rule has similar?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, sure. So the U.S. rules probably will see seasonal effects and we've estimated about $0.15, but there are a number of factors that go into that which could move around. So we would urge everybody to think about that as an approximation. A lot of that might come into the first quarter when our restricted stock awards vest. And there are a bunch of factors there. One is, what is the exercise price? Second is, what is pace of that exercise pricing, the timing, the number, and any number of other factors? So we would expect that that effect might be heavier in the first quarter, particularly given very happily where the stock price is right now. So, we'll see how that lays out, this is new to us and we'll give more information as we see what we get in the first quarter.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you. I have just a broad question on the tax policy potential changes we heard out of Washington. If they do get rid of interest expense deductibility in the U.S. as part of the overall tax reform, could you guys base case that would hurt potentially high-yield issuance much more so than investment-grade issuance? That's my first question.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","I think it would probably have more of an impact on high-yield. Again, though, just trying to weigh the puts and takes on that, it's also high-yield companies that are going to probably want to take most advantage of having additional cash on hand. And so, that gives them more flexibility, it might cause them to engage in different behaviors, whether it's from an M&A standpoint or business expansion. So I do think the premise of your question probably leans against high-yield more than it leans against investment-grade. But there's pluses and minuses in both cases.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","And then, Ray, I assume you'd say that probably even more so of the interest expense deductibility was limited to only up to 30% of EBITDA. Similar to what you talked about in the U.K. and I guess Germany has as well as opposed to getting rid of 100%?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. And again, it's \u2013 there's \u2013 what it does in an absolute sense. But then it's also relatively what is still the more or less attractive ways to raise capital and so even if it's less attractive, if it's still the most attractive, you would expect firms would make rational economic decisions.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","And then, Ray, as a follow-on to that, if you just isolate \u2013 I know this is hard, but if you just isolate, if the corporate tax rate in the U.S., the federal rate goes from 35% to 15% or 20% or thereabouts, what is your general sense on what that could do to debt issuance in terms of that \u2013 I mean, obviously it should be more pro growth out there, and so what do you think it would do from debt issuance, from an M&A perspective, and investing in backing companies, et cetera? What could it do (1:03:32) to debt issuance?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","I mean, we \u2013 I don't have a quantification of that for you, Craig, but again the pluses and minuses that we've outlined in a couple of our comments throughout the call indicates that we don't expect dramatic change in what is happening around our business, but it's going to have some impact whether it's a 15% or 20% or 25% and we're just going to have to see.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Linda, a couple of quick housekeeping questions. What \u2013 maybe I missed this, what percent of your cash hoard is outside the U.S. right now, if you would, please?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","78% is offshore, now, Craig. The numbers are, U.S. is roughly $500 million, international is roughly $1.7 billion, that totals to $2.2 billion a little bit more, but 78% overseas and that's because we use some of the U.S. cash as we dealt with the DOJ situation. But as we noted, the very vast majority of the settlement payments have already been made.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","And in the case in the past, a substantial fraction of our foreign cash is also held in U.S. dollars.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then lastly, Linda, if I could just ask just given the concerns \u2013 ongoing concerns around Brexit for your ratings, was your revenues out of the U.K. for full year 2016 roughly 7%, 8% of your ratings revenue again, is that fair number to think about?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Offshore \u2013 off-hand \u2013 excuse me, Craig \u2013 I'm not certain where we're sort of puzzling and looking at Rob to see if he has any further information.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, it's not a straightforward as you might hope, Craig, because we do both U.K. entity-based ratings out of the U.K., but we also do European-based ratings, EU-based ratings out of the U.K. And so \u2013 and the companies that are issuing into the EU may be followed from any one of a number of offices. So both, how the revenue gets apportioned and then how the expense base supporting that revenue gets apportioned are subject to some interpretations of what's in and what's out. The U.K. is not a large part of our overall European business, but I don't have a fraction I can give you.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jeff Silber with Bank of Montreal.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Henry Chien on for Jeff. I just had a question on MIS, just curious from a commercial sales perspective, now the business is stabilizing. Are there any new markets or geographies that you're looking at to potentially expand your coverage in?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, in terms of markets that we are looking to expand in, we have been active as you have seen in emerging markets including India, increasing our stake in Korea, growing business coming out of China has been growing very nicely. With the liberalization that is being proposed and discussed in the Chinese markets, we would anticipate that that should create some opportunities. We've also been concentrating on building out the business in Latin America and Middle East. So, Rob, I don't know if there is anything else you wanted to add to that.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. We opened an office last year in Sweden. So we've been building out our presence as well in the Nordic region.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. Yeah. That's helpful. And just in \u2013 on MIS, just as a follow up, I mean, in terms of the different products, I'd say, are there any margin changes when one sort of increases as a percentage of the whole, let's say, like structured increases as a percentage, does that sort of impact the margin a little bit?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","The margins in the MIS business for all of the fundamental areas are roughly the same. The structured finance margin is more variable. It's a more transactionally-oriented business. And so in periods of high volume, you get higher margins and low volume, lower margins. It's also susceptible to how intense the monitoring activity has to be. In periods of greater stress, there is greater allocation of resource to \u2013 having to be on top of the monitoring, simply because in periods of stress, there are more assets that have to be scrutinized more closely, and so you get some swings there as well. So that's the only line of business that I would say has substantial variability in margin.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, the monitoring for the structured or just overall?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Monitoring for structured in particular, because of the large number of assets that underlie those pools.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll go next to Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon. A quick CLO question for you. Does the CLO refinancing create the same sort of revenue opportunity for you guys as a CLO issuance?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","No. New issuance would be a higher revenue opportunity than refi.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And then a follow-up question. The acquisition that you just announced the other day, this structured finance data and analytics business of SCDM, is that going within research, data and analytics? And if so, can you talk about how much of the high-single-digit revenue growth target for that segment in 2017 is going to come from acquisition?","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","The answer to your first question is, yes, it is part of our DNA, but it is a very, very small acquisition. I mean, I think it's a good acquisition. It makes a ton of sense. We've done this a number of times before where we've acquired businesses, where in this case, we didn't acquire any people. We essentially bought a product that is very similar to an existing product of ours. We're going to transition their customers from the legacy product to our product. So essentially, we bought that business without buying any expense, frankly, that would come along with it. So I think it's a very good transaction for us, but it is \u2013 honestly, it's tiny.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, strategically, it's a nice fit, but it's not going to turn the dial on financial performance for RD&A in 2017.","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Yeah.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, got you. So smaller than the GGY acquisition last year?","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","That's correct.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Significant.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ray McDaniel for closing comments.","Raymond W.

At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Capital Management. Please go ahead.","Sallilyn Schwartz","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on this teleconference to discuss Moody's second quarter 2019 results as well as our current outlook for full-year 2019. I am Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Capital Management.","This morning, Moody's released its results for the second quarter 2019 as well as an update to our current outlook for full-year 2019. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.","Ray McDaniel, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead this morning's conference call.

These, together with the safe harbor statements, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements.","I would also like to point out that members of the media maybe on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. I'll now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel.","Raymond McDaniel","Thanks, Salli. Good morning, and thank you everyone for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's second quarter 2019 financial results and providing an update on the execution of our strategy. Mark Kaye will then follow with further details on our second quarter results and comments on our revised outlook for 2019. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","I'd like to start by providing select highlights for quarter. First, Moody's second quarter performance reflected continued double-digit growth in Moody's Analytics with strong contributions from all lines of business. Recurring revenue in MA represented 84% of total MA revenue for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2019.","Second, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Moody's Investor Service revenue in the second quarter was in line with the record prior year period and the issuance environment is constructed as we move into the back half of the year.","Next, the charges related to our restructuring program are largely complete and we are increasing our anticipated annual run rate savings by more than $10 million to approximately $60 million.","And finally, since our last earnings call, we've continued to execute on our long-term strategy in a disciplined manner through targeted acquisitions of businesses that extend our assessment and analytical solution capabilities as well as the planned divestiture of Moody\u2019s Analytics Knowledge Services or MAKS. In addition, I'm pleased that Moody\u2019s has further strengthened its leadership in ESG engagement and disclosure.","Moving on to second quarter 2019 results. Double-digit MA revenue growth and MIS\u2019s resilience despite subdued issuance activity resulted in a 3% revenue increase for Moody's Corporation. Moody's adjusted operating income of $599 million was up 2% from the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS grew by 1% aided by a 2% reduction in diluted share count from the prior year period as a result of our share repurchase programs.","In the second quarter, issuance activity was mixed. Falling benchmark rates, tighter spreads, and economic fundamentals supported strong issuance conditions. However, declining global growth forecasts, continued geopolitical uncertainty and lower M&A and investment activity kept some issuers on the sidelines.","The resurgent and corporate fixed rate issuance helped partially offset weakness in floating rate bank loans. Overall however, global issuance activity fell for the fourth consecutive quarter. The banks have indicated that U.S. investment grade and leveraged finance issuance pipelines are moderate, but CLO activity remains weak.","Nonetheless, the relatively easier year-over-year comparable gives us confidence that MIS will deliver growth in the back half of the year. Since the first quarter earnings call, we have announced several transactions that enable us to further align our portfolio of offerings with our strategic priorities.","Moody's delivered trusted insights and standards that allow market participants to make informed decisions contributing to market transparency and fairness. Our resolve to bring clarity and efficiency to markets has led us to execute these transactions as we increase our focus on providing risk assessments and analytical solutions.","Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'll take a minute to review our recent strategic transactions with you. First, with our majority acquisition of Four Twenty Seven, a provider of data and analytics on physical climate risks. We will significantly bolster our capabilities to integrate environmental and climate risk factors into economic modeling and credit ratings.","Second, our acquisition of RiskFirst extends Moody's reach into the buy side with market leading solutions for portfolio management and risk analytics delivered on a software as a service or SaaS platform.","Third, our newly established joint venture with Team8 combines Moody's experience in developing methodologies and global standards with teammates, expertise in cybersecurity technology.","And finally are planned divestiture of Max reflects MA's increasing strategic focus on providing scalable data, financial intelligence, and analytical tools rather than the spoke service oriented engagements. These transactions are included in our updated full-year 2019 guidance. We expect they will have a diluted impact of approximately $0.05 to adjusted diluted EPS.","I will now turn the call over to Mark Kaye to provide further details on our second quarter performance and review our updated outlook for 2019.","Mark Kaye","Thank you, Ray. For MIS, second quarter issuance activity was down 14% from the prior year period. However, MIS revenue is down in 2%, demonstrating the continued resilience of the business model.","As Ray mentioned earlier, issuance was key towards fixed rates activity given low benchmark interest rates and additionally, the mix of jumbo M&A related issuance and infrequent issue is coming to market with favorable.","MIS's recurring revenue base supported by pricing initiative as well as monitored credit growth also contributed to substantially offset this decline in issuance. For the second quarter, the slight revenue contraction alongside relatively flat expense growth lead to a decline in MIS's adjusted operating margin, which was 60.2%.","For MA, each business contributed to the achievement of an aggregate 12% revenue growth rate, concurrently enabling 350 basis points of improvement in adjusted operating margin. This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted operating margin improvement of 350 basis points.","Organic MA revenue was up 10% from the prior year period. RD&A revenue grew 14% due to strong sales credit research and rating data feeds by sales growth at Bureau van Dijk and contribution from the Reis acquisition. On an organic basis, RD&A delivered double-digit revenue growth of 11%.","ERS strong demand for subscription products, particularly from insurance companies drove the 7% revenue increase. We also benefited from the ongoing transition to SaaS-based operating model. Trailing 12 months ERS revenue is up 1%. The sales were up 8%, which provides a positive signal for future revenue growth. Professional services revenue growth of 13% was driven by strong global demand for training solutions. Organic professional services revenue was up 10%.","I'll now discuss Moody's updated full-year 2019 guidance. Moody's outlook for 2019 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macro economic and capital market factors including, but not limited to, interest in foreign currency change rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions and the level of debt capital markets activity. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.","Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast for the remainder of 2019 reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.27 and for the euro of $1.14. We continue to forecast that revenue will increase in the mid single-digit percent range. While anticipating total operating expenses to increasingly high single-digit percent range.","Operating expense guidance includes depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges and impairment charge related to the plan divestiture of Max and acquisition related expenses. Excluding the incremental restructuring in Max impairment charges, total operating expense guidance would have still been an increase in the mid single-digit percent range.","Of note, we are not expecting a material ramp in expenses from the first to the fourth quarter of 2019, as we start to realize savings from the restructuring program. The full-year of 2019 operating margin forecast is approximately 42% with the adjusted operating margin anticipated to remain at approximately 48%. We now expect net interest expense to be approximately $195 million.","The full-year effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 21% to 22% not withstanding the low effective rate in the first half of the year. Diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS, our forecast to be $7.15 to $7.35 and $7.95 to $8.15 respectively. Share repurchases anticipated to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.3 billion.","For a full list of all guidance. Please refer to Table 13 about earnings release. For MIS, we expect total full-year revenue to increase in the low single-digit percent range, with growth weighted towards the second half of the year as the year-over-year comparable becomes easier.","We are anticipating U.S. revenue to increase in the mid single-digit percent range with stronger contributions from fixed rate corporate bonds. Non-U.S. revenues forecast remain approximately flat. Our issuance estimate remains flat to down 5% in comparison to 2018 with continued support from dead funded M&A that was lower contributions from floating rate bank loans and CLOs.","We are on track to achieve approximately 901st time mandates in 2019. The MIS adjusted operating margin remains at approximately 58% in 2019. For MA, we anticipate total revenue to increase in the low double-digit percent range. As we recognize strong sales growth across all business lines, as well as the benefit from the stability of recurring revenue derived from the core RD&A business and the ongoing ERS transition to SaaS base model.","The MA adjusted operating margin is forecast to expand 150 to 250 basis points to the 28% to 29% range in 2019 reflecting the aggregate impact of the announced transactions. The charges related to our restructuring program are essentially complete. The total restructuring charge of $108 million that we took in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first half of 2019 exceeded our previously announced range $70 million to $80 million.","We are currently revising anticipated annualized pretax savings to approximately $60 million, a $15 million increase from the midpoint to the previously announced range of $40 million to $50 million. This will enable us to realize approximately $30 million of savings as you move through the second half of 2019 allowing us to reinvest in our business and provide annual margin stability.","Going forward these savings will create financial flexibility and the various capital market conditions and provide additional options to reinvest in our business and or bolster margin.","Before turning the call back over to Ray, I would like to note a few key takeaways. We remain confident in Moody\u2019s ability to both deliver revenue growth and sustain margins in 2019. Moody's will continue to execute on his strategic vision to provide trusted insights and standards while delivering transparency to adjacent markets and emerging risk areas.","Finally, we have confidence in our disciplines and thoughtful approach to capital management and the return of free cash flow to all shareholders.","I will now turn the call back over to Ray, for his final remarks.","Raymond McDaniel","Thanks, Mark. Before turning to the question-and-answer session, I'd like to review a few of our recent activities demonstrating our commitment to a sustainable future. Each year, Moody's has further honed its CSR program to strategically focus on societal issues that we are in a unique position to help address and those that our employees are most passionate about.","Additionally, Moody's work on ESG, specifically climate-related risks and opportunities is directed toward promoting global measurement standards for use by market participants. Moody's continues to support disclosing and adhering to the standards set by the taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures, or TCFD. Moody's released its most recent TCFD report earlier this month, which is linked to this presentation and otherwise available on moodys.com\/CSR.","We are also working towards incorporating disclosure metrics set out by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB. We continue to engage with a multitude of other partners that develop CSR and ESG standards and frameworks or evaluate and assess performance.","Please see the press release we published yesterday, highlighting our ongoing ESG initiatives, available at ir.moodys.com for more details.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Mark Kaye and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics; and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investor Service. We'll be pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Manav Patnaik of Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning. Ray just on that last point around, your ESG initiatives, it sounds like there's a PR around ESG with a lot of companies have picked up, you guys have made a few tuck-in acquisitions as well. Can you just help us size maybe what it is today and how much can be where the opportunities are? That would be helpful.","Raymond McDaniel","Sure, Manav. In terms of the opportunity in the ESG sector for commercial purposes, we are looking at \u2013 we might characterize as non-geographic emerging markets. And so the degree and pace at which these markets will monetize is more speculative than you might see in more established markets that are using various kinds of risk assessments and risk standards. So we would acknowledge that. However, we are confident that there is strong demand for the creation of good measurement tools and standards in these areas. And so we are committed to providing that. This is true for certainly for climate, in cybersecurity as another example.","So we feel that this is going to be a good opportunity even though these are our market sectors that are not yet heavily monetized. I would also add that really regardless of what the direct financial opportunity ends up being in these areas and how quickly it gets realized, that this is going to contribute to what we're doing in both Moody's Analytics and Moody's Investor Service as far as providing risk assessments eating into our economic models and tools and our credit ratings. And so it will enhance the relevance of the products that we are already providing and the relevance of our credit ratings in particular. So that's how we're thinking about this.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up, I mean, can you just help me size what your India ratings exposure is? I guess, you had your CEO stepped down out there and it's all over the news out here in India. So I just wanted to see like how big or what's the risk might be there?","Raymond McDaniel","Yes. When you say our Indian opportunity or exposure, are you referring to the cross border or what we're doing in the domestic market?","Manav Patnaik","Well, it's more of the domestic market around the fact that there is, I guess a couple of the rating agency CEOs had to step down, down there, including your guidance, so I was just trying to understand what the risk around the issues there are today?","Raymond McDaniel","Yes, sure. With respect to our affiliate in India, ICRA, they've reported a couple of things. One that they are, addressing a matter relating to credit ratings that were assigned to one of its customers, and this is the subject of a proceeding that's been initiated by the securities commission called SEBI in India.","And secondly, they've reported that they were investigating, an anonymous allegation that was forwarded to ICRA by SEBI and they've gotten outside experts to look into that anonymous allegation. We don't anticipate that an unfavorable outcome would be material to Moody's in anyway. And we'll just continue to watch and let the ICRA management team and the ICRA board handle the proceeding and the investigation that they're dealing with.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We will not go to a Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. Could you help us understand how you were able to out pace issuance growth in MIS as well as you did, just looking at your transactional business down four and the global issuance environment of down 14. I usually think of price and mix has maybe two drivers that can explain some of the delta, but I just wanted to understand if there's a piece that I'm not thinking of?","Raymond McDaniel","Sure. Rob?","Robert Fauber","Toni, its Rob. So first of all, this is actually a nice question to be answering this quarter. So thanks for asking. You're right. Those are the two primary drivers and it really did this quarter. I've got a mix of who was issuing and when we look at prior quarters. So can I comparing back to the first quarter, the issuance mix in Q2 was, was more favorable because it was driven by a larger proportion of M&A driven financing and infrequent issuer supplies.","So this comes to frequent versus infrequent issuers and what kind of commercial construct we have around them. Meanwhile, the frequent issuers who tend to be on these relationship based pricing constructs contributed to the issuance decline two or greater degree in the second quarter. So again, it was mixed and I also think we had, I mean you touched on price. I think we had some very nice commercial execution the quarter as well.","Toni Kaplan","Got it. And the price maybe could continue the other on less clarity. Would you expect that that mix between the frequent and infrequent to continue as it did?","Robert Fauber","It certainly May. I mean, the infrequent issuer, sometimes this gets to two things, the M&A environment and opportunistic financing. And so when we see a decline in benchmark rates and a tightening of spread spreads, that tends to drop, draw the infrequent issuers out to tap the market.","Toni Kaplan","Extremely, helpful. Thank you. And then for my second question, MA margin was very, very strong this quarter again, similar to last quarter. Can you help quantify how much was from BvD synergies versus the shift to the SaaS model and ERS or just general efficiency or if there's any other pieces I'm missing that'd be great. Thanks.","Raymond McDaniel","Mark?","Mark Kaye","Mark. Sure. Well we had 350 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter as Mark said, and you could deconstruct that into a couple of categories. About 150 basis points of the expansion came from the core business. About half of that came from the work we've been doing in Enterprise Risk Solutions to increase the profitability of that business.","We got about a 100 basis points from the removal of the deferred revenue haircut in the Bureau van Dijk business that we had in the second quarter last year. And then another a 100 basis points from the Bureau van Dijk business in the aggregate. So I can't really give you any further detail to tell you how much is attributable to Bureau van Dijk synergies per se, but those are the three principle categories of that margin expansion.","Toni Kaplan","That's really helpful. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Cho of J.P. Morgan.","Michael Cho","Hi, good morning. Just my first question is around the change in the MIS U.S. guidance. I was just hoping you could give a little bit more color behind the increase in the MIS U.S. revenue guide. I guess behind some of the commentary you just gave.","Raymond McDaniel","Yes. Sure Rob. So obviously we've \u2013 as mark touched on we've got the same overall issuance outlook and the components to get to are our overall MIS low single-digit guide. As you said, we've increased our U.S. guidance and that's really around the our outlook for corporate bond issuance and the revenue expectations given the receptive environment that we're seeing. Some small upward revisions in our outlook for us project in infrastructure finance activity. And that's been partially offset by the downward revisions that we've got in us bank loans and CLOs. So I don't want to overstate the magnitude of these forecast revisions. It was enough to push the U.S. into mid single-digits, but obviously not enough to impact the broader in MIS revenue guide.","Michael Cho","Okay, great. Thanks. And just my follow-up is around the restructuring program. I think the Mark you mentioned that do expect to see about $30 million or so benefits this year and $60 million overall run rate synergies. I guess one, when should we expect this see the full benefit of the $6 million, and two, how much of that are you playing to reinvest?","Mark Kaye","Thanks for the question. Certainly the increasing in these total restructuring charges of $108 million was really due to the acceleration and expansion of our staffing and real estate optimization and some of the acquisition integration and that as you correctly note, that lead to an increase in our analyzed pretax savings amount of approximately $60 million. Part of that benefit that $30 million that you'll see in $19 is really coming through in how we think about the expense ramp for the year.","So specifically we're now only expecting an expense ramp up between $0 and $10 million from Q1 to Q4 vis-a-vis a much larger amount that you would have seen in 2018. And depending on the opportunities as we evaluate both internal investment opportunities versus margin expansion. And that will very much depend on the particular environment as it developed in 2020.","Michael Cho","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take a question from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alexander Kramm","Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to just talk about the divestiture or the Max divestiture. I'm a little unclear actually what's included in your updated guidance on the one hand, there's this on the slide, you say it's a $0.05 impact from all these transactions, but I don't really think you adjust as kind of like the revenue margin outlook.","I know that deal is supposed to close later this year, but just maybe clarify what's included, what's still will come out when this closes. And then I guess bigger picture on this whole question. As we think about 2020, this business completely out. How does this change kind of like the revenue and the margin profile of that MA business? Thank you.","Mark Kaye","Alex, good morning. This is Mark here. I'll start with your first question and I'll answer it specific to you adjusted a diluted EPS guidance update. The increase was primarily due to the lower effected interest expense and we certainly did factor in the MIS U.S. revenue guidance improvements. But also note that we didn't narrow our range.","Given the higher confidence that we have from a first half operating performance. In particular as related to a Max itself and while Max is not material to Moody's, we did forecast, we had forecast 2019 financial in the absence of a transaction to be around $110 million in revenue and around a 20% to standalone EBITDA margin associated with that.","Alexander Kramm","Okay, great. Now that's helpful. Thank you for that. And then maybe just secondly, just quickly on the MIS Business, just obviously you updated your outlook here a little bit, but curious to what degree this contemplates kind of the potential or likely rate cuts that we're going to be seeing today and maybe later this year, how that may still shift kind of the expectations or what you expect to happen in the marketplace. So is this kind of steady eddy guidance or outlook or do you think the marketplace could still change materially given what the Fed is likely to do here?","Mark Kaye","Alex, given your question maybe what we'll do here is I'll talk a little bit about puts and takes sort of for issuance activities that we're hearing from \u2013 externally from some of the banks, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob to follow-up specifically with our internal viewpoint. In the U.S., the banks are saying that investment grade issuance is down slightly year-to-date due to some deleveraging activity still active, but lower year-over-year M&A and it's like multinationals shifting issuance to Europe to take advantage of lower rates there.","Now high yield bond issuance from what we're hearing has been up moderately year-to-date, supported by refinancing activity. And then conversely, leverage loans issuance has been down over 30% with acquisition financing driving for the majority of that activity. The banks have relayed that anticipation of a Fed rate cuts is now driving yields lower and tightening spreads, which does set up conditions supportive of the strong issuance environment for investment grade and high yield bonds in the second half of the year.","And we did hear that expectations persist for lower U.S. benchmark rates as through the medium turn due to ongoing growth concerns. And then of course those concerns are also being reflected in the market with the bifurcation and the demand for high yield credits sort of that preference towards the higher quality names. We turn to Europe, feedback from the banks is that the investment grade market, you've seen some of the rate dynamics to the U.S., but more accentuated. The 10-year bond yield obviously continues to fall further below 0%. And as a result, investment grade relative dynamics continue to encourage reverse Yankee issuance, which by some measures comprises about a third of the total issuance in Europe year-to-date.","And the last thing sort of what we hearing from the banks, it's specifically related to high yield issuance in the second quarter in Europe and that's primarily driven by refinancing activities. And then similarly as in the U.S., there's significant preference for higher-end spec-ed rated names. And I'll turn it over to Rob to update you sort of on MIS\u2019s 2019 issuance expectations.","Robert Fauber","Yes. I'll touch on that in a second. Let me just follow-up with kind of how we're thinking about issuance for the remainder of the year. Mark in his remarks, mentioned our issuance forecast is essentially unchanged at a flat to down 5%. And we have shifted our expectations as we've touched on to more fixed rate bond issuance and less floating rate issuance, and that includes loans and CLOs.","We've upped the investment grade outlook modestly given all the opportunistic refi and jumbo M&A activity we've seen. But the biggest changes are really around corporate high yield bond issuance outlook for us from the first quarter, given all the activity in the pipeline that we're seeing. We're expecting to see some significant growth now in high yield issuance for the full-year. And then conversely, we've trimmed our outlook for bank loan issuance on really less opportunistic refi, and the fact that new issue loans spreads and yields are higher than a year ago. So we expect to see there some significant declines in issuance.","Maybe just in terms of upside and downside, I would say, the supply we're seeing is benefiting from what I would call very issuer-friendly market conditions, probably the most constructive conditions we've seen in quite some time. As I mentioned earlier, that could lead to some elements of opportunistic supply more than we've anticipated. M&A is really going to be a key factor here. Our expectation is for ongoing levels of activities that continue. And as I've mentioned, we've seen some jumbo financing activity to get M&A deals done.","On the downside, I guess a few things. I mean potential surprises in how the central banks respond to the threat of lower economic forecasts. There are obviously expectations that the market has dialed in, and then things like, disorderly Brexit and Chinese, U.S. trade discussion. So those would be some of the things we're looking at that could be a wildcard to our outlook for the year.","Raymond McDaniel","Yes. Just to close this off \u2013 it's Ray. I think what you're hearing from us is that, we're in a bit of a Goldilocks scenario right now where growth is slowing, but there is still growth, that slowing growth is encouraging central bank action which has beneficial to rates and spreads remain tight. If we tip either way away from that scenario, we would have more challenges in the second half or right now that's what we're seeing.","Alexander Kramm","Excellent color. Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes. Thank you, a couple of questions. Maybe if we could start with China, if we could, Ray. Just want to get an update where you're out there in terms of maybe trying to start up an operation there similar to what S&P has done. It's my sense. Correct me if I'm wrong, but is your 30% equity stake over there in CCXI sort of gumming up this whole process from your perspective?","I guess what should be able to top that off and actually buy in more of that operation so you could actually consolidate? I'm just curious where you're at right now? Just given that your main competition, at least globally, got their licenses you know, back in January? I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Raymond McDaniel","Yes. We've talked about this a little bit before. And we have a 30% stake as you know in the largest rating agency, domestic rating agency in China. It's also quite profitable. So we're very satisfied with our position in CCXI. Certainly, if we like CCXI and we do, we would be interested in participating further in that business. That is going to be determined in part by probably, policy decisions that are made in China and potentially in discussions between China and the United States.","So at this point, we are very satisfied with the position we are in. And it if circumstances change, we would be prepared to pivot, whether it's selling down our position or increasing our position or requesting a separate license, other than the licenses currently held by CCXI. So we're just going to have to be patience and see how that plays out. But in the meantime, we are a 30% holder in a very successful business.","Just to give you a little bit more color on sort of the size of the opportunity because I think there's been a fair amount of confusion around this and so let me give you, just a few numbers. First of all, we've talked before about China being the third largest, onshore bond market. And it's closing very quickly on becoming the second largest.","We rate both in the cross-border market, large Chinese companies going to the U.S. or Euro bond markets. And we have the CCXI in the domestic market. So the ratings that we have in the cross-border market are about 37% of the revenue share, so high 30s revenue share. We have about 70% coverage. But it's a multiple rating markets. So that turns into about a high 30s revenue share. And that's approximately a $260 million cross-border markets. So that gives you a sense of what the cross-border revenue opportunity is.","And then coincidentally, CCXI has a high 30s percent, a revenue share of the domestic Chinese market, which coincidentally is also about $260 million. So we've got high 30% revenue share in both cross-border and domestic and both markets are about $260 million in total ratings revenue. So that gives us about $150 million currently in China related revenue, excluding the income contribution that comes from CCXI, which would be, you can do the math would be about another $15 million.","Craig Huber","Thank you for that Ray. And then if I can also ask, you touched on this a little bit, but could you just talk a little bit further about the market conditions for debt issuance for the back half of this year? I mean when you think about that economy spreads and the M&A environment and the pull forward potential here, the base rate, the absolute rates, how low they are? Just sort of sense out there and maybe about Europe as well? Thank you.","Raymond McDaniel","Yes, sure, not a whole lot to add to what we were talking about before. In terms of our expectations for the second half of the year. But as we look at whether the second half of the year may include more significant pull forward. I think we probably will be seeing pull forward that is again more of a phenomenon at least it has been more of a phenomenon in the U.S. than it has been internationally.","So it's really U.S. spec-grade and we do have optimistic expectations for the U.S. spec-grade market year-on-year for the second half. Europe I don't know that we will be seeing a pull forward historically that has not characterized the European market as much. And so whether the quantitative easing that is expected in Europe encourages more pull forward is a question we will have to just watch and see the answer to. And see how significant that is. A reminder that the spec-grade market in Europe is not of the same size as the U.S. market. So it would be less material even if there is pull forward.","Robert Fauber","Ray, maybe I\u2019d just add a little bit of color too, as we're now into the second half of the year, Craig. So second quarter seasonally strong. Our typical consultative pattern supported by these favorable market conditions that we've talked about. The pipeline has, I'm thinking kind hear from corporate perspective, but the pipeline has continued to replenish. I'd say it's pretty solid.","July as usually a bit softer. We've got earnings blackouts, but we're expecting some good issuance added a seasonal slowdowns that we'll see later in August. In U.S. investment grade you've got the corporate bond index that it's tight as level and something like two years in funds flows, flows have been positive every month of the year. And in a U.S. high yield, the spreads have recovered substantially all the widening that they had experienced and can Q4 and high yield bond fund flows have been positive every month this year except May.","I'm also contributing to the demand there. And that's in contrast to the level of outflows that we had seen in high yield bond funds in something like five and over the last six years. So positive funds flows on the flip side, the leverage loans pipeline looks pretty modest and despite the fact we've seen now, I believe it's 34 consecutive weeks of fund outflows, the tone in the leverage learn market, the secondary market is pretty firm.","We've got some jumbo M&A that's been announced that still has to get funded in the markets and the second half of the year. And as Ray said, in Europe, the investment grade market continues to be pretty active. We've got very low benchmark rates. They're strong investor demand. The leverage finance activity has improved in Europe from the first quarter. It was very soft in the first quarter. We've seen some good activity in July. Again, the same theme of sustained investor demand for the supply and good market conditions. So what we're saying.","Craig Huber","Thank you. Can I just ask a quick housekeeping question if I could? The BvD, I always get asked by investors, how did BvD do? Was it was excluding currency was up high single-digits, the revenue there? Thank you.","Raymond McDaniel","Sure. Well, we don't typically disclose the Bureau van Dijk results on a standalone basis as you know. But I can say that the business there is performing very, very well. We're very happy with it. It is both from a revenue standpoint and a sales standpoint. It's been growing in the low-to-mid teens on a organic constant dollar basis. So we feel very good about what's happening in Bureau van Dijk.","Craig Huber","Great. Thank you, guys.","Raymond McDaniel","Yes. Then without getting more into the detail, just to reinforce Mark's point, you can look at the RD&A a growth rate and see that it's getting good contribution from Bureau van Dijk.","Mark Kaye","Yes. But to be fair, it's not just a Bureau van Dijk story in RD&A. RD&A is strong pretty much across the board.","Craig Huber","Thank you.","Operator","And now we'll take a question from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. I wanted to go back to China for a second. I guess my question there is, I understand the opportunity, but how do you protect yourself against fraud in China? And do you think that there's a higher risk around the ratings in that geography versus the rest of the world?","Raymond McDaniel","Joe, in terms of thinking about fraud risk, I mean certainly it's well understood that there is less transparency in some of the financial information available on Chinese companies than you might see for U.S. public companies, for example. The ratings in the cross border market though are on the very largest entities in China, which are internationally active and they do have a higher quality and more consistent financial reporting. So that's less of a concern.","In the domestic market, it is a challenge, and the way to address it through ratings in particular is looking at how much \u2013 how complete the financial information is, how intuitive it is. Do the numbers make sense across the financial statements? And if there is a lack of comfort with the amount or clarity of the information, the choices are simply not to participate in the rating or to make conservative assumptions about where the credit worthiness of the entity should be placed in terms of a rating score.","I think there is going to be continued interest in building transparency. There's going to be continued interest in assessing financial statement quality, and in assessing financial statement quality that in itself provides opportunities for firms like Moody's or Moody's Analytics.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. Okay. And then I guess maybe I'll just stick with China. I was going to ask a different one, but we only get two here. So when Moody's goes in and rates a Chinese company, do they benefit typically the same way that a U.S. entity would benefit? In other words, do they get more favorable potential interest rate associated with that? And I'm just wondering how you \u2013 early stage you can gauge sort of Moody's reputation internationally because I'm trying to just kind of measure what kind of possible demand could come out of that region. Thanks.","Raymond McDaniel","Well, certainly in the cross border market, the dynamics are similar to what we would see among U.S. issuers or Western European issuers. In the domestic market, at this point in time that benefit is less clear because there are more constraints on the buy side and on the issuer \u2013 on the issuers of debt.","And so that is a market that is still more adolescent in terms of its channeling of capital according to the best risk reward dynamics. And that's where I think again, we see opportunity because improving the quality of risk assessments for these entities should over time allow capital to be channeled more efficiently, which is really at the end of the day one of the policy goals for the Chinese officials.","Joseph Foresi","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will be coming from George Tong of Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","Thanks. I want to go back to the MIS segment. You've slightly increased your MIS revenue guidance for the full-year, but you're holding your overall global issuance forecast unchanged at flat to down 5%. The flat to down 5% is a relatively wide range. So at the increment, would you say your view of the global issuance environment is stronger because of fixed rate issuance? So would you say it's really just mix at Moody's that's changing your view on MIS?","Raymond McDaniel","I think \u2013 well it's two things. We are anticipating that the favorable mix that we've seen in the first half will probably continue in the second half. And also I would say we're modestly more positive on issuance, but certainly not to the point where we would move outside of that 0% to down 5% range.","George Tong","Got it. That's helpful. In the MA segment, you're operating margins expanded a strong 350 bps year-over-year in the quarter. You've lowered your MA operating margin guidance by a point for the full-year. Can you talk about what's changing in the business to cause a diminished view on margins in the segment?","Raymond McDaniel","Sure. The change is primarily driven by M&A activity that we've announced, which obviously includes M&A related transaction costs, both the Max divestiture and RiskFirst acquisition. The MA adjusted margin guidance would have been unchanged, where it not for RiskFirst and Max.","George Tong","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And now we will go to Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets.","Henry Chen","Hey, guys. Good morning. It's Henry Chen, calling for Jeff. Just I wanted to talk about some of the acquisitions that you've been making. At a high level, could you kind of just talk through, I guess maybe strategically what areas you're looking at and how to sort of tie that all together in sort of cinematically in terms of how you're looking at future acquisitions? Thanks.","Raymond McDaniel","Sure. I'll turn this over to Mark and Rob to comment in each of their units. But as we said in the prepared remarks, we're starting from the strategic perspective that we want to provide expanded risk assessments and extend our analytics solutions, data and analytics solutions, offerings.","The data analytics solutions are really coming out of the MA and where the Moody's Analytics unit is looking at acquisition opportunities. And the non-credit risk assessments or risk assessments that can contribute to our credit analysis, but also may provide, independent measures are coming from a Moody\u2019s Investors Service for the most part.","Mark, I don't know if you want to say anything on RiskFirst.","Mark Kaye","Yes. I would just note that the RiskFirst acquisition, we view that as kind of a classic Moody's Analytics business. It's a highly specialized set of analytical capabilities that are targeted at important problems that are shared by many customers.","In this case, in the Investment Management segment, those capabilities are built around a unique highly specialized data sets. They get in this case that data relates to a pension plan, assets, the historical returns of the liability structures, et cetera.","The solutions that RiskFirst offers benefit from network effects as they serve the buy side ecosystem, including the investment managers themselves. The ultimate asset owners that is the pension plan sponsors, insurers, foundations and endowments as well as the investment consultants.","And those network effects are stimulated by the fact that this product is on a SaaS platform, which is very readily implemented, customers can have it up and running very quickly after making a purchase decision. So the ease of use speeds the adoption of the platform. And so that again that enhances the network effects we get from this thing.","And there are some very important synergies in the RiskFirst product with the work that we've been doing in the insurance space. You'll recall about three years ago, we acquired GGY, which substantially ramped up our analytical relevance to the management of insurers liabilities.","RiskFirst now gives us some very important capabilities on the asset side of the insurance companies. So you can start to see that we're building out a very substantial position to be able to solve a very wide range of problems for insurance companies.","Henry Chen","Got it. ","Raymond McDaniel","Rob, you want to comment on Four Twenty Seven?","Robert Fauber","Yes. So dovetailing with what Ray said, I mean we're investing in areas where the market is looking for analytics and insights to be able to assess risks that are increasingly relevant to both the credit markets and even more broadly capital markets and financial institutions, and Four Twenty Seven is a great example.","So you've got investors, banks, insurance companies, issuers, all increasingly focusing on the physical risks associated with climate. And that's things like sea level rise or water scarcity, wildfires so on. And Four Twenty Seven bring us some very robust climate analytics, modeling data and very importantly expertise. That's going to allow us to be able to leverage this content across Moody's. And that's both the rating agency as well as MA.","And you know, we've acquired some unique content sets and capabilities and we think that's really going to differentiate us and our ability to integrate climate analytics into our offerings. And again, that's all part of this broader focus that we've got on an investment in the ESG space.","And I would also say that that deal, while small has gotten some \u2013 has some very good industrial logic and we've gotten some very good press and market feedback, from around the world on our move into that space.","Henry Chen","Okay, very cool. That's super helpful. Thanks. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And now we will go to Timothy McHugh of William Blair.","Timothy McHugh","Thanks. I guess two questions. One just a numbers one. Can you give us the incentive comp for the quarter? And then secondly, as a follow-up on ESG. I guess, how quickly are you going to integrate things to a Moody's branded type of offering if that's the ultimate plan. I guess are there any other pieces to the kind of the ESG strategy that you feel are missing after some of your recent acquisitions.","Mark Kaye","Tim, I'll answer the numbers question. The incentive compensation for the second quarter of 2019 was $51 million that's consistent with the approximately $50 million per quarter for the expectation that 2019.","Robert Fauber","Yes. So this is Rob. I think there's some scarcity value to some of the assets and the ESG and climate space. So we've obviously acquired majority stakes in Vigeo Eiris, which is really data and scores for investors in ESG.","And then they also have a very nice green bond assessment platform for issuers. Four Twenty Seven, I just talked about focused on climate data and analytics. We're investors, financial institutions. So we think we've gotten some very good assets. We're also producing ESG content within the rating agency. Increasingly, kind of thinking about and being more explicit about how we factor ESG considerations into the ratings.","And I think what you'll see is over time, all of this will be part of a branded broader Moody's Suite of ESG offerings. And they will be then the ESG content; I think you will see packaged to meet a wide range of customer needs across Moody's Corporation. As I said, both the needs of the rating agency, the needs of Vigeo Eiris, and Four Twenty Seven customers and the needs of MAs a very broad customer base.","Timothy McHugh","Thanks.","Operator","And now we'll go to Dan Dolev of Nomura Instinet.","Dan Dolev","Hey guys, thanks for using my question. Appreciate it. So just I understand on Moody's Analytics the RiskFirst, we estimate as about a 100 basis points in growth in the second half. And why didn't you raise the revenue guidance here or I just want to make sure there's kind of no implied slow down on this one? Thank you.","Mark Kaye","Dan, it's Mark. I think you're probably overstating RiskFirst a bit the scale of it. And maybe it's because you're not taking into consideration that we'll have the accounting treatment on the deferred revenue haircut. That may be why you're\u2026","Dan Dolev","Got it. I mean, looking at 16.5 million pounds. Right? Which was disclosed, but have you disclosed the contribution? I don't think you have.","Mark Kaye","Yes. We have not disclosed that. The other thing you need to keep in mind is we're assuming that by the time we get to the fourth quarter, we will not have any revenue from the Max business. So that's going the other way. ","Dan Dolev","Got it. So there is no implied, no implied slow down, it's just the M&A.","Mark Kaye","Absolutely correct. Absolutely right.","Dan Dolev","Got it.","Mark Kaye","The underlying business is performing extremely well.","Dan Dolev","I agree. And just a follow-up question. I mean, you talked about the issuance and you sound very upbeat about the issuance. In our space, in our business services space there's a lot of talk right now about being late cycle, et cetera. I mean, can we get maybe a macro comment from you guys not withstanding the issuance kind of where you think we are because there seems to be a lot of confusion. Thanks.","Raymond McDaniel","Well with respect to issuance, just to be clear, it's not that we are expecting a lot of growth compared to the first half of this year, but we had a relatively easy comparable from the second half and particularly the fourth quarter of 2018. So that's really informing our commentary. As far as the broader late cycle question. Yes, I think it's obvious to everybody that we have been in a long growth cycle, and that that growth has been slowing globally on a somewhat steady basis with a number of IMF reforecast down for global growth and slow down in Europe with renewed discussion about quantitative easing, expected interest rate cuts here in the U.S., not to mention the trade discussions. So yes, you can look at late cycle, you can look at slowing growth.","On the other hand, there are policy tools that are going to be deployed to deal with this slowing growth and a number of things are up in the air right now that could be resolved favorably trade discussions and Brexit being too, which could act as catalyst to renewed growth. So I think appropriate to be a bit cautious and a bit wary of where we are in this cycle, but things can still break in a positive way. ","Dan Dolev","Got it. Thanks a lot. Great quarter.","Operator","Now we'll take a question from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo Securities.","William Warmington","Good afternoon, everyone. So I wanted to ask about the cybersecurity strategy. You've got a strategic investment with Team8. You announced an expanded JV with the company. And I wanted to ask if you were \u2013 if the ultimate thought was to develop a standalone cybersecurity rating and if so, what the opportunity was there for Moody's?","Raymond McDaniel","Yes. I think we are very open minded about what is going to be the best offering in the cybersecurity space, whether it's rating, some other kind of score, probably, research and analytics associated with some standardized measurements. And we also see this as an area where both providing assessments or scores based on publicly available information may be helpful to market participants.","And providing private assessments, whether it's for a risk committees or boards of directors, et cetera, vendor risk management may play a role here. There are a number of directions we believe this can go. And what we're really focused on with Team8 is developing the methodology and then the analytical engine that goes with that methodology to bring some real science to this area.","William Warmington","And then for my follow-up question on the Max divestiture. Any other pruning that you're thinking about doing in the portfolio?","Raymond McDaniel","No, I think we're pretty comfortable with the portfolio.","William Warmington","Excellent. Well, thank you very much. ","Raymond McDaniel","Thank you. ","Operator","We will now go to Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi. Thank you very much for squeezing me in as well. Would you be able to disclose what the growth rates were of some of the businesses that you bought like, the Twenty Four Seven the RiskFirst. And then just kind of on an annualized basis. And then you put up the RiskFirst and Pounds in 2018, but is there some kind of, if you wanted to put the three that you're talking about, I guess with the JV together, is there an annualized revenue assumption that we should make over there amongst those three?","Raymond McDaniel","Yes. I think it's fair to say that this would not be material for purposes of your modeling and assessing what our outlook is. These are young companies, acquisition of capabilities and expertise as much as the immediate financial return from these companies.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And how fast does Max growing, or was it wasn't really growing at all?","Raymond McDaniel","Yes, Max was growing. And as we said, it had about \u2013 we had forecast about 110 million in revenue at a 20% EBITDA margin. If we had not done this transaction, that would've been the profile for the year. It had been growing, but it was growing slower than the MA business overall.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn things back over to Ray McDaniel.","Raymond McDaniel","Okay. Thank you all for joining today's call and we look forward to speaking with you again in the call.

McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Thank you, Steve. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results. Linda will follow with additional fourth quarter financial details and operating highlights and I'll then conclude with comments on our outlook for 2018. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions. In the fourth quarter, Moody's record revenue of $1.2 billion increased 24% from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in rated issuance, the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk and strong organic performance from Moody's Analytics.","Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $703 million, down from $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 included an $864 million charge related to a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the attorneys general of 21 U.S. States and the District of Columbia. Excluding this Settlement Charge, operating expenses were up 27% from the prior year period, including 12 percentage points attributable to Bureau van Dijk operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-recurring Acquisition-Related Expenses.","Operating income was $463 million, up from the fourth quarter 2016 operating loss of $473 million. Adjusted operating income of $519 million was up 22%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted adjusted operating income by 3%. The operating margin was 39.7% and the adjusted operating margin was 44.5%. Moody's diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.13 per share, up from a loss per share of $2.25 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.51, up 20% and excluded a $1.26 onetime charge related to the net impact of changes in tax laws in the U.S. and Europe. Additional adjustments included amortization of acquired intangible assets and Acquisition-Related Expenses.","Turning to full-year performance, Moody's record revenue for the full year of 2017 of $4.2 billion was up 17% from 2016. U.S. revenue was $2.3 billion, up 12%, while non-U.S. revenue was $1.9 billion, up 24%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted Moody's revenue by 1%. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service of $2.8 billion was up 17% from the prior year. U.S. revenue was $1.7 billion, up 13%, while non-U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion, up 23%. Revenue at Moody's Analytics was $1.4 billion, a 16% increase over the prior year. U.S. revenue of $646 million was up 7%, while non-U.S. revenue of $785 million was up 25%.","Organic MA, Moody's Analytics, revenue was $1.3 billion, up 8% from the prior year. Operating expenses for full-year 2017 totaled $2.4 billion, down 19% from $3 billion in the prior year, which included the fourth quarter 2016 Settlement Charge. Excluding the Settlement Charge and a restructuring charge in 2016, operating expenses were up 15%, which includes 5 percentage points attributable to Bureau van Dijk operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-recurring Acquisition-Related Expenses. There was no material impact on expenses from foreign currency translation.","Operating income was $1.8 billion, up $639 million in 2016, which included the fourth quarter 2016 Settlement Charge. Adjusted operating income of $2 billion was up 21%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted adjusted operating income by 2%. Moody's operating margin was 43%, up from 17.7% and adjusted operating margin was 47.3%, up from 45.5% in the prior year. The effective tax rate for full year 2017 was 43.6%, which included net charge in the fourth quarter related to the impacts of tax reform in the U.S. and Europe.","The effective tax rate was down from 50.6% full-year 2016, which included the non-deductible portion of the Settlement Charge. Excluding the net charge in 2017, the effective tax rate was 29.9%. Excluding the Settlement Charge in 2016, the effective tax rate was 31.3%. We're expecting another solid year of growth in 2018 and our outlook is for low double-digit percent revenue growth, diluted EPS of $7.20 to $7.40 and adjusted diluted EPS of $7.65 to $7.85. Both ranges include an approximate $0.65 benefit from U.S. tax reform.","I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the fourth quarter was a record $1.2 billion, up 24%. U.S. revenue of $614 million was up 15%; non-U.S. revenue of $551 million was up 35% and represented 47% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $581 million was up 23% and represented 50% of total revenue. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted Moody's revenue by 3%.","And looking now at each of our businesses starting with Moody's Investors Service, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue for MIS. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $725 million, up 19%. U.S. revenue increased 17% to $440 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $285 million was up 23% and represented 39% of total MIS revenue. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted MIS revenue by 3%.","And looking now at the lines of business for MIS; first, corporate finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $334 million, up 20%. This result reflected strong issuance activity in the U.S. investment grade and speculative grade bonds, EMEA speculative grade bonds and bank loans and Asian investment grade bonds. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were up 16% and 28% respectively.","Second, structured finance revenue totaled $148 million, up 13%, primarily driven by strong contributions from CLOs in both the U.S. and Europe, as well as an increase in rated U.S. REIT transactions. U.S. and non-U.S. structured finance revenues were up 17% and 5% respectively.","Third, financial institutions revenue of $119 million was up 34%. This result was largely driven by an increase in banking issuance from infrequent issuers. U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions revenue were up 36% and 33% respectively. Fourth, public project and infrastructure finance revenue of $119 million was up 16%. This result reflected increased U.S. public finance issuance as municipal borrowers accelerated financings ahead of anticipated changes in U.S. tax legislation as well as strength from infrastructure finance. U.S. and non-U.S. public project and infrastructure finance revenues were up 14% and 18% respectively.","And turning now to Moody's Analytics, total revenue for MA of $441 million was up 32%. U.S. revenue of $174 million was up 10%. Non-U.S. revenue of $267 million was up 51% and represented 60% of total MA revenue. Organic MA revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $379 million, up 13% from the fourth quarter of 2016. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted MA revenue by 3%.","And moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, research, data and analytics or RD&A revenue of $258 million was up 55%. U.S. RD&A revenue was up 18% and non-U.S. RD&A revenue more than doubled. Bureau van Dijk's revenue contribution of $62 million for the fourth quarter included a $22 million reduction as a result of a deferred revenue adjustment required under acquisition accounting rules.","Organic RD&A revenue was $196 million, up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by broad strength in all product lines. Second, enterprise risk solutions or ERS revenue of $143 million was up 10% from the prior year period, driven primarily by demand for products that enable adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standard or IFRS 9 accounting requirement, as well as strong performance in the insurance product line.","U.S. ERS revenue was down 5%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 18%. Trailing 12-month sales for ERS increased 7%. We continue to make progress on shifting the mix of the ERS business to emphasize higher margin products, with trailing 12-month product sales up 14% and services sales down 13%. Recurring revenue represented 69% of total ERS revenue in 2017, up from 66% in the prior year. And third, professional services revenue of $40 million was up 7%. U.S. and non-U.S. professional services revenues were up 6% and 8% respectively.","And turning now to operating expenses, Moody's fourth quarter operating expenses totaled $703 million, down from the $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 included the $864 million Settlement Charge. Excluding the Settlement Charge, operating expenses were up 27% from the prior-year period, which includes 12 percentage points, attributable to Bureau van Dijk operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-recurring Acquisition-Related Expenses. Other drivers of expense growth included additional compensation expense for merit increases and hiring, as well as increased performance-based incentive compensation. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted operating expenses by 1%. And as Ray mentioned, Moody's operating margin was 39.7% and adjusted operating margin was 44.5%.","And now, I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Moody's repurchased approximately 200,000 shares at a total cost of $36 million or an average cost of $146.85 per share. Moody's also issued 100,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plans. Moody's returned $73 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the fourth quarter of 2017. And on January 24, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share of Moody's common stock, which is a 16% increase from the prior quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share. This dividend will be payable on March 12, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2018.","For the full-year 2017, Moody's repurchased 1.6 million shares at a total cost of $200 million or an average cost of $121.21 per share and issued a net 1.9 million shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plans. The net amount includes shares withheld for employee payroll taxes. Moody's also returned $290 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during 2017.","Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2017 totaled $191 million, approximately flat to a year ago. As of December 31, 2017, Moody's had approximately $500 million of share repurchase authority remaining. And at year-end, Moody's had $5.5 billion of outstanding debt and $870 million of additional borrowing capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $1.2 billion, down $1 billion from December 31, 2016, primarily due to the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk. Cash flow from operations in 2017 was $748 million, down from the $1.3 billion in 2016. Free cash flow in 2017 was $657 million, down $1.1 billion from 2016. These declines in cash flow were due to the Settlement Charge payment in 2017.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Linda. Before discussing our full-year guidance for 2018, I'd like to provide some highlights on our progress with Bureau van Dijk integration and synergy activities. Our integration efforts are on track and we remain confident about achieving the synergy targets that we communicated when we announced the acquisition. Since closing the acquisition in August, we have enhanced Bureau van Dijk's products with content sourced from Moody's, launched programs to cross-sell Bureau van Dijk products and initiated measures to enhance sales productivity and efficiency.","In New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong, Bureau van Dijk's staff are now co-located at Moody's offices, with six additional offices in Europe, Asia and South America set to be combined in 2018. Bureau van Dijk business continues to perform well and we are very pleased with the progress we're making as we pursue our various collaboration and integration efforts.","So I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing our full-year guidance for 2018. A complete list of Moody's guidance is included in Table 14 of our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings press release, which can be found on the Moody's Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.","Moody's outlook for 2018 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued.","These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at exchange rates as of January 31, 2018. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.42 to the pound and for the euro of $1.25 to the euro. As I noted earlier, Moody's expects full-year 2018 revenue to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. Operating expenses are also expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. The company is projecting an operating margin of 43% to 44%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 48%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 22% to 23%. Full-year 2018 diluted EPS is expected to be $7.20 to $7.40. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be $7.65 to $7.85. Both ranges include an approximate $0.65 benefit, resulting from U.S. tax reform.","Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion. Moody's expects share repurchases to be approximately $200 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $120 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $200 million.","For MIS, 2018 revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range and non-U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range.","Corporate finance revenue is expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. Structured finance and financial institutions revenues are each expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is expected to decrease in the low-single-digit percent range.","For Moody's Analytics, the 2018 revenue is expected to increase in the mid-20s percent range. U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range and non-U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the mid-30s percent range. Organic MA revenue is expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. RD&A revenue is expected to increase approximately 40%. The full-year 2018 revenue contribution from Bureau van Dijk will be reduced by an estimated $16 million as a result of a deferred revenue adjustment required as part of acquisition accounting. Organic RD&A revenue is expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. ERS revenue is expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range and professional service revenue is expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range.","Before turning the call over to Q&A, I would like to talk for just a minute about Linda. As you all know, last month, we announced that Linda will be leaving Moody's after more than 12 years of outstanding service as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We're grateful for Linda's service and wish her every success in the next phase of her career. We're also grateful that Linda has agreed to remain at the company for a transition period and I'm confident with the strong team she has built, her successor will be able to hit the ground running. We're now focused on finding the right person to take on the role and I have begun a comprehensive search. We'll be looking at both internal and external candidates and have engaged a search firm to assist us in this process. Of course, Linda's departure has no effect on our corporate strategy or financial priorities, which have delivered an unprecedented period of growth for Moody's during Linda's tenure.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics; and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investors Service. We'll be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Your guidance calls for mid-single-digit growth in MIS after a year where the segment grew 17% and it looks like non-U.S. is really the strong part. So could you just give us some color on which geographies and products are really driving this high-single-digit growth in non-U.S. in 2018 and just also just what you're seeing so far in 1Q, just given that it's the toughest comp for the year? Thanks.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Sure. Maybe we can kick it off by letting Linda talk about the consensus views that we've collected and I know Rob will have some comments on this.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. Toni, thanks for the question. I'll start with the views from the various banks that we survey and again, these views are the consensus views of those banks and not \u2013 they may not line up exactly with Moody's revenue categorizations. For investment grade bond issuance for 2018, the call is for $1.25 trillion of issuance, which is flat to down 10% from 17%. Notes include that the market remains robust with tight spreads, offsetting rising rates. And January 2018 was the second largest January on record after January of 2017. You probably noticed the growing M&A pipeline among investment grade borrowers and we note the 87% probability of a Fed rate hike in March, with an average expectation of three rate hikes in total in 2018.","For high yield, the call is for $285 billion of issuance, flat to up 10% from 2017. Notes include high yield fundamentals remaining strong with demand for new issues, an improving macroeconomic environment and relatively narrow spreads and issuance remains primarily driven by refinancings. Year-to-date 2018 issuance is already up 10% year-over-year and the forward pipeline is characterized as robust. A potential headwind though is tax reform impact on companies with very high amounts of debt and low EBIT and EBITDA and I'm sure we'll talk about that later.","On the leveraged loan front, the third category in the U.S., $500 billion is expected for 2018, flat to down 10% from 2017. Notes include that the leveraged loan market remains strong and spreads are narrow. Full-year 2018 is expected to be down slightly from a record 2017, with upside should M&A activity accelerate or if rising rates create further demand for floating rate paper.","And switching over to Europe, investment grade in Europe has had a bit of a slower start issuance for the year, but it is expected to pick up post earnings season. Spreads are near historical lows, some concern about the ECB QE tapering, but those are muted and the euro area continues to see strong growth in GDP and corporate profit. Speculative grade in Europe, notes include high yield and leveraged loan markets are in good shape with strong forward pipeline, though issuance levels faced tough comps as compared to strong 2017. Spreads are narrowed due to strong demand and those are fueling opportunistic issuance. So again, that's the view from the bank. And then I'll ask Rob to comment a little bit more about the various sectors.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Linda. So Linda provided the Street estimates for issuance, overall for U.S. corporate generally flattish to slightly down. Our forecast is broadly in line with those estimates as you'd expect and as you noted, Toni, we're coming off a very strong issuance from the corporate sector in 2017 in really all regions. Just kind of tying this together, several factors influencing our overall issuance outlook this year. Linda touched on a few of these, but expanding global economy, this concept of synchronous growth across the G20, first time we've seen all G20 economies growing at the same time since 2010, modest geopolitical risks, firming in commodity prices, declining default rates that are supporting the tight spreads that Linda talked about and expect to see some robust M&A activity, which we think will help to offset some of the decline, the expected decline in the refinancing activity that we saw, particularly in the bank loan market last year.","There are obviously some risks, namely the recent increase in market volatility and concerns about inflation and rate increases. Currently, our outlook hasn't really accounted for any kind of market disruption to issuance activity in 2018. We didn't have that in 2017. And then maybe as we take the issuance outlook and then build to the revenue guidance, so obviously, there are several factors that go into how that then translates into revenue.","First, the issuance forecast that I talked about, we also have some assumptions around mix, which you've heard us talk about on many of these calls, then new mandate activity, I'm happy to talk about the new mandate activity for the year at some point on the call. Recurring revenue growth from an increase in monitored ratings and I think this is important \u2013 this is about a third of our total revenue, the recurring revenue, you've seen some pickup in the recurring revenue growth rate over the last couple of quarters and that is due in large part to the growth in first-time issuers that we are now rating and then finally, kind of our standard pricing contribution and a bit of favorability from FX; that gets us there.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. And just for my follow-up, Linda, I think this is the question everyone wants to know, but what are your plans and what drove your decision to move on?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Thanks, Toni. This is my 51st first earnings call for Moody's and I think it's just time to take a look at some other things that are out in the world and very orderly transition and nothing really too exciting to say; don't have finalized plans as of this point.","Operator","And we'll go next to Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. And Linda, I would just like to say thanks for all your great work here over the last couple of years. I am missing you already, big shoes to fill for sure. In terms of the RD&A business, the organic growth looked particularly strong and the outlook for 15% growth next year. Just want to be clear, this is ex-BvD, right? That's one. Two is, what's driving the, what seems like better than recent performance in the RD&A business? And then let me ask my follow-up in advance. The margins in the legacy MA business, can you speak to the trend you're seeing there? Thank you.","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Excuse me, Peter, it's Mark. So in RD&A, first, just to be clear about what's in and what's out, in 2017, there is no Bureau van Dijk in the \u2013 when we talk about organic RD&A for 2017. That includes no Bureau van Dijk. In the 2018 guidance, we do have, in the fourth quarter, Bureau van Dijk becomes organic, so we will have Bureau van Dijk in the 2018 numbers and reflected in our 2018 guidance for RD&A. So that's the \u2013 definitionally, that's what we're working with. Just to provide some color around the good \u2013 the very good results we're seeing in RD&A. I guess I'd just call out that we had a very solid low-double-digit underlying growth in the credit research and data businesses, which was a result of our work to improve upon and expand the content delivered to our CreditView platform and our data feed.","New business production has been solid. Customer attrition has remained very low and our yield from existing customers generated strong growth as customer institutions are upgrading their usage rights and extending access to our content across more users in their organizations. So in addition, we gained 2 or 3 points of growth in RD&A in the fourth quarter from one-time projects, which was mostly modeling work for customer stress testing and IFRS 9 requirements and our results were further helped in the fourth quarter by about 300 basis points of favorable FX.","So in short, we are seeing very good execution of our product strategy, with strong take-up of the range of our capabilities, plus some FX benefits. That's what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2017 that drove the very good numbers we had. And as we look into 2018, frankly, it's more of the same. We have good momentum going into 2018. We see continued good performance in all of the businesses, especially as we bring our new content delivery platform, CreditView 2.0, to the market in midyear.","CreditView 2.0 will provide a more modern interface with expanded content and greater flexibility that accommodates access to a broader range of data, which will enable us to better cross-sell the Bureau van Dijk content. And in addition, we will get a strong year-on-year contribution from Bureau van Dijk as the business moves into the organic category in the fourth quarter. And we also expect continued favorable FX impact, which takes up our already strong full-year outlook by another couple of points.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. And then how about the legacy MA margins and the trend you're seeing there?","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Yeah, well, you saw in the fourth quarter, we had 300 basis points of expansion in the adjusted operating margin. Most of that is from the legacy Moody's Analytics business, with some additional contribution from Bureau van Dijk. So we're seeing good success as we continue to rigorously pursue our strategy to drive margin expansion in MA. You may note that we had no head count growth in Moody's Analytics next year. Ignoring the addition of the Bureau van Dijk staff, we literally had two more people working in Moody's Analytics at the end of 2017 compared with the end of 2016. So the strategy is to deploy the resources that we have against our very best opportunities, which we've identified and are pursuing them and we expect to continue to pursue that strategy and feel good about where we're headed.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","And Peter, it's Ray. I would just add, as we look forward in 2018, Moody's Analytics will be getting a larger allocation of our shared service expense because of the increased size of the business with the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk primarily, so just in terms of what to expect.","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","And I think we will dive into that in some detail at Investor Day.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Peter, also \u2013 it's Linda. Just so everyone is aware, we're not helping Mark from the accounting perspective here. As we brought on the business, we had to do, with the BvD business, we had to move through a deferred revenue adjustment. We handled some of that in 2017 and some of that will remain in 2018, just so there is a bit more guidance for modeling purposes. We expect that there is about $16 million left of deferred revenue adjustment for Bureau van Dijk in 2018. Just so you have the detail quarter-by-quarter that lays out about $10 million in Q1, $5 million in Q2 and the rest in Q3. And I think we're done with that once we lap the close of the acquisition in August 2018. So Mark is nodding; just a quick addition there in terms of its deferred revenue haircut in case it's not as well understood as it should be.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. That helps. Thanks.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Sure.","Operator","We'll go next to Anj Singh with Credit Suisse.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could speak on capital allocation a bit, what you plan to do with the proceeds from the tax savings. It seems like you'd probably just delever quicker and faster. But wondering if any tweaks or changes to your normal capital allocation priorities as we look to 2018. Thanks.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Sure. It's Linda and I'll let Ray help me with this one. I think we announced when we took on the Bureau van Dijk business that with the $2 billion of debt we had added for that acquisition, our plans for 2017 and 2018 really centered on deleveraging after that deal. In 2018, we're planning to reduce our debt by about $500 million and we're ahead of schedule in that process because we are strong operating cash flow. We think our capital allocation priorities are going to remain about the same. We have some very good opportunities to invest in our business which will always be job one.","In terms of our international cash, we probably have less cash offshore than many corporations do at that point because we spent $1.3 billion of it for the Bureau van Dijk acquisition. So for Moody's, we may end up with a couple hundred million dollars of offshore cash to repatriate, but not a huge amount. So I think we're going to stick to our plans and continue to focus on deleveraging. And as I think Ray had mentioned, about $200 million of share repurchase on the docket for 2018. Ray may have something else, you might want to add.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","No. I just \u2013 I agree with how Linda has characterized our priorities. It is deleveraging. First, we are going to be able to be ahead of schedule as compared to our acquisition analysis on the deleveraging. And at the same time, we are going to be able to make necessary investments in the growth of the business.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then for a follow-up, could you just speak to MIS margins, down year-over-year in the quarter. I realize it's up strongly on a full-year basis, but this comes despite the strength in revenue growth. How much is driven by mix versus investments or just incentive comp and help us understand how these shape your outlook for that segment as it relates to your 48% margin guide for 2018? Thank you.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Sure. I'll start on this one. It's Linda. And in fact, the MIS operating margin did decline by 110 basis points, despite 19% growth in revenue in the quarter. And on the full-year basis, it's important to note that the MIS operating margin is up 190 basis points. So we had some unusual activity in the fourth quarter. We would really point you towards the full year as being more indicative. But in the fourth quarter, we kind of saddled Rob with some additional expenses here. As you know, we had very strong performance in the fourth quarter, so we had to increase our performance-based incentive compensation, our stock compensation and we had profit sharing in 2017. I think the total amount was a little over $10 million, so all of that hit MIS. The second thing that was important is we had a little bit of a severance charge in one of the non-U.S. businesses. All that comes to little bit less than $20 million or so. So, really just the result of very strong performance and one little item that we right-sized. But I think you should see the margins back to as Rob had described previously, but I'll let him follow up on this.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. Maybe just to give a little color about what we're going to do to continue to drive on the margin. You've seen our results over the last several years; we're continuing to look for further efficiency in managing expenses in a disciplined fashion. So a couple of things I might just point to I think will support that. First, we just, this year, completed a reorganization of our junior staff into a dedicated support organization. That's going to help us manage our staffing more effectively through the inevitable ebbs and flows of issuance and drive up our resource utilization.","Second, we're leveraging technology in a variety of ways across MIS. We just launched our first bots in October as part of our Robotic Process Automation initiative and these bots are automating manual repeatable tasks that are currently being done by people. We're also developing workflow and analytical tools that are going to help the analysts be more efficient and spend their time focused on higher value-added activities. And the last thing I'd say is, we're hiring more staff in low-cost locations, like India, and we're looking to open an office in Costa Rica this year through MIS so that we can make sure we have the right jobs in the right places. In this past year, to give you a sense, about half of our head count growth was at our support center in India.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. My first question was just around guidance. I usually think when you give guidance in the beginning of the year, it's a bit conservative. And I guess there's a few areas, where I just need a little bit more help here. I think one of the areas was on the corporate finance group, which I think Rob explained with mix and new mandates maybe. But similarly, the PPIF group, it sounds like at least in the U.S., it's going to be down quite a bit. So maybe there is an international mix here where it helps you down only low single digits, we would have thought more.","And sort of the second part, the guidance part was just around FX, Linda. If you could tell us the contributions you've assumed on the revenue and margin side, I presume that's benefit because your spot \u2013 your guide is above the spot rate, which is unlike prior years, I believe.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Sure. Why don't we let Rob start off on the outlook around PPIF and corporate?","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. So keep in mind, our PPIF segment has several rating lines in it. We do have a mid-single (sic) [low-single] (00:40:52) digit revenue decline as our guidance. But we have a significant \u2013 we think that the U.S. public finance issuance is going to be significantly adversely impacted from the changes to the U.S. tax law; that's really around the loss of tax-exempt status for advanced refundings in U.S. public finance, which was, depending on the year ,somewhere between 20% and 30% of the market.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","And the pull forward that we saw in the fourth quarter.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","That's right. We saw some pull-forward activity. I think probably a modest slowdown in infrastructure after a very strong year around the globe and a pretty stable issuance environment in sub-sovereign and all that then kind of builds to, ultimately to our revenue outlook.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. It's Linda. On the corporate side, before we move away from Rob, I always encourage him to speak a little bit about what he's seeing in new mandates because analysts have expressed interest in this. So why don't you go ahead and cover that, Rob?","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, sure. And that also is going to touch on, I think, one of Toni's questions around the guidance around non-U.S. growth. So a really good story in the fourth quarter, 260 first-time mandates; that's up about 47% on the year-over-year quarter. So that took us above 1,000 new mandates for the year, it set a new record. We expect somewhere slightly below that number, but still another strong year for first-time mandate activity. The strength in first-time mandates, that we had continued into that \u2013 we see that into the pipeline.","And interestingly, as we look at the mix of first-time mandates and the growth, the European and Asian first-time mandates grew at a rate of growth that was about 2x first-time mandates in the United States. So that then is contributing to that higher rate of growth for non-U.S. revenues, at least in part.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","And Manav, on the FX point, you're right. FX, the spots have been moving around quite dramatically. We expect FX to have a 3% positive impact on revenue in 2018 and 3% positive impact on adjusted operating income. As you know, our main exposures are to the euro and the pound and we put a pin in it with the pound at $1.42 to the dollar, as Ray said, the euro at $1.25. And probably for your planning purposes, the rule of thumb here is that \u20ac0.01 decline in the euro takes about one $0.01 off our EPS and the \u00a30.01 decline in the pound basically doesn't move our EPS all that much. So we're a little bit more sensitive to the euro and hopefully that will help you out. Yes, we do note that the currencies are moving around a bit.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, got it. And then if I could just have you give us the expense build that you typically give us going into the fourth quarter and maybe just that 3 point revenue growth. I presume MA has more of that, if you could just help us price that out.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Let me give you the expense ramp for next year, which is what I think you're looking for. For 2018, we're looking for an expense ramp of $60 million to $70 million and I'll get somebody to give me a first quarter expense number so we know what we're starting from here in just a minute. The expense ramp, as you know, can be very strongly impacted by timing of expenses, FX movements and as we saw this year, very strong late-period changes in incentive compensation. So $60 million, $70 million is given what we know now. But we'll look at that as we go through the year. So let's use a starting number for first quarter of 2018. Maybe sort of $635 million might be a good place to start and then look at $60 million to $70 million increasing ramp as we move through the year.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks so much. I hate to go back to tax reform, but I'm going to. Even in your prepared remarks or I think maybe even bankers (00:45:36) remarks, you note about the potential adverse impact of tax reform in a high yield market, I know it's still early. Are you seeing any of that? And then even on the corporate side or the investment grade side, excuse me, I know there was some noise early on about the limits on corporate expense, interest expense deductibility, and I know that we've watered down a little bit, but again, are you hearing anything from your potential customers on that front as well? Thanks.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. Rob, do you want to talk about what you heard from people?","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. It's a good question. As you can imagine, we're in very regular contact with the issuers on this topic. And I think the general view is it's still very early days in terms of seeing any kind of change to corporate behavior, the highly leveraged companies that we're speaking with have not indicated that this is a significant issue, at least not yet. And obviously that remains to be seen because that's where the impacts could be more noticeable. And I would note though that there is an enormous amount of money that's been raised by the private equity firms that needs to be deployed and we're seeing this in the form of a very active LBO market at this time.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","And I'd just add, in terms of the caps on interest rate deductibility, that is really going to only have an impact for firms that are at the bottom of the speculative grade rating scale, so say B3 and below and then obviously the actual impact will vary by individual company.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, that's helpful and I'm going to stick with the tax theme for my follow-up. In terms of the guidance, the 22% to 23% tax rate for this year, is that inclusive of the stock-based comp benefit that you're getting in the first quarter or is that the number that we'd be using on a normalized basis in second, third and fourth quarter? Thanks.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","That's inclusive of the benefits in the first quarter. I think your point is well taken that that may weigh a little bit more heavily toward the first quarter. So I'd put the majority in the first quarter just because that's when we would expect a heavier exercise of options and I'd lighten it up a little bit in the second and third quarter and then we should be pretty much through that. I think we had a number somewhere around in these documents of approximately $40 million for that. So you can kind of spread it as I had said.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll go next to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Linda, I just want to say, you did a heck of a job and you'll be missed.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Thanks, Craig.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","My first question is, Ray or whoever would like to answer this. On the bank loan outlook for this New Year (48:34), given the strength the last couple of years, can you just talk a little bit further about your outlook for that? I know you said some investment banks you checked in with for this year are down 0 to 10% or something. Just what the puts and takes are to move that number higher or lower this year? What are we looking for there on bank loans?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Well, I mean certainly to the extent that floating rate debt is relatively more attractive in a more volatile interest rate environment, that could have a positive impact, at least relative to competition from the spec grade bond sector. Beyond that, I think so far, we are seeing good activity in the bank loan sector, reasonable pipeline, but, it's very early days.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, and the only thing I would add to that is that we had an enormous refi wave over the last 18 months. So the question will be, as we see an expected pickup in M&A, will that offset to some extent what we think will be a decline in the refinancing activity?","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Okay, then also just real quick if I could. Linda, what was the incentive comp in the quarter versus a year ago? I might have missed that. And then also I could just sneak this in, what percent of your high yield rating is outstanding, Ray, or say B3 and lower which you talked about earlier?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Craig. Let me start with incentive compensation. For the fourth quarter 2017, we got about $72 million; that was up from $59.6 million last year; so call it around $12 million increase, 20% increase or so. And Ray may...","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. With respect to the B3 and below, I don't have a number for you off the top of my head. If we can find a number during the call, we'll be happy to get back on and quote it.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","The one thing I might say though is that the number of B3 and below credits is a good bit lower now than it was in 2016, which was actually at an all-time high. So we've seen that proportion decline; I just don't have the absolute percent on hand.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Craig, I just want to give you some more...","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","It sounds like you don't think \u2013 go ahead.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","I'm sorry. Why don't you follow up there?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Go ahead Craig.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","I was just \u2013 sorry, I was just going to ask, so it sounds like though you guys don't think this interest expense deductibility issue from the tax reform is to have a material impact on your high yield piece of your business, is that a fair statement?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","No, I think that is a fair statement. It's a headwind, but it's not a tremendously strong one in our opinion.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Craig...","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","And Rob was just telling me that B3 and below is about 14%, 15% of our spec grade.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","And Craig, it's Linda. I just wanted to speak a little bit more about incentive compensation because I think the detail would help. We had some very lumpy quarters for 2017. Incentive comp went $52 million, $51 million and then the third quarter was $83.4 million and then about $77 million in the fourth quarter. Within the third quarter, we added to incentive compensation $5 million of profit sharing for the employees worldwide and $5.5 million in the fourth quarter. So profit sharing requires that we put up some pretty good numbers in order to have that take effect, but again, a total of $10.5 million for profit sharing, which falls into incentive compensation for the third and fourth quarter.","If you were looking to model this for next year, for 2018, we're kind of thinking maybe $50 million-ish as incentive compensation kind of returns back to more normal numbers. But again, if we put up really big numbers, the incentive compensation number does move up. Conversely, if we miss, the incentive compensation number comes down as the bonus pools take the first hit. So just wanted to make sure you understood the lumpiness there.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. And Linda, congratulations on a good one, and best of luck.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Thanks.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Just to be clear about what's in the issuance guidance. So we're expecting no change to issuance from the tax reform at the corporate level and you've built in some expectations for at least a couple of interest rate increases, is that a fair way of thinking about it?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yes. We certainly are expecting interest rate increases this year. And there are puts and takes to the tax reform. Obviously, there's going to be repatriation of cash. There are the interest deductibility caps. But at the same time, we think that this is going to support stronger economic activity, possibly mergers and acquisitions activity boost and investment back in business growth and business expansion. So it's really going to depend on how those puts and takes balance out against each other over the year.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","And Joe, it's Linda. If you look at the futures, I think the markets are looking, as I said, for three interest rate increases with the first in March with an 80% plus probability on that. It's pretty important though that potential investors in Moody's take a look at times when this has happened before and we'd point you back to our investor deck. We've had periods where rates have gone up more than 100 basis points in a year. We often cite 2008 to 2009 when rates went up 100 basis points and then 2012 to 2013, rates went up 120 basis points.","As Mario Draghi had said, he'd do what it takes to hold the euro together. In both of those periods, MIS revenues went up. So it's very important to understand as Ray had said that growth is a very positive condition for Moody's and we haven't had the synchronous growth for quite a long time. So for us, if things move along as they are predicted to do, this could be very, very helpful for us, but we're going to have to see how things pan out and of course the present volatility is something we're keeping a close eye on. But as Robert said, the bond market's reaction to all of that has seemed to be relatively subdued as compared to the equity market's volatility. So, hope that helps you a bit.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. And then as my follow-up, just as a point of clarification, how has issuance been at the beginning of this year with the markets kind of moving around a little bit and maybe I could sneak one more in, how's the competitive positioning of BvD within MA? I think you talked about some takeaway wins last quarter? Thanks.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","I'd just say, Rob, do you want to tackle first part.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, I think. In general, we've seen issuance in line with our expectations, but specifically very recently in regards to the recent volatility. I mean, first of all, many of the issuers are in blackout period, so this is normally a little bit lighter period of issuance.","In general, obviously rates are up, spreads have widened a bit, but I would say that the pipelines look steady and that's \u2013 everything that I'm hearing indicates that as Linda said, the market, the bond market took this a bit in stride. If you think about the spreads, they did move out about 25 basis points, but they were at kind of four-year tights before they did that. In the U.S., we've seen a deal or two postpone and I would say those were on the more aggressive end of structures. We've also seen some sizable deals get done this week and in this market, one recently for some acquisition financing. I think the general view is still constructive, at least that's what we're hearing now and issuers, I think, will continue to come to market if they have a financing need. What we may see is some of the opportunistic issuance taking a bit of a pause to wait on the market to digest some of this volatility.","And in Europe, I think a pretty similar story. You've got investors with very robust cash levels. The debt markets, I'd say they are perhaps being a bit more selective, but again, a pretty constructive tone is what we're hearing, the loan market there, a little bit slower to react to this volatility and we're seeing continued flow of primary issuance in the loan market. And you know that last year was quite a strong year of issuance in the European loan market.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","And unlike 2017, but like earlier years when we get volatility like this, I think it's particularly important to keep an eye on the pipelines because issuers will wait for relative periods of calm and then they would be \u2013 they would be poised to go opportunistically, so the pipeline's become a very important indicator for future health of the market. Mark, did you want to comment on BvD?","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Yeah. Could you repeat the question, please? I just want to make sure I'm being responsive.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","It looks like we lost, Joe. Joe, can you get back on, okay, sorry, go ahead.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","I think last quarter, you had talked about some competitive takeaways now that you had MA and BvD together and so I was just curious if you could give us an update on what's happening in the competitive environment as you go after some market share with the two companies now together.","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Sure. It's still, frankly it's still relatively early days for us to execute on some of the plans we had and what we could do together with Bureau van Dijk, but we're making good progress on some joint product development efforts. Again, there were some products that we had planned to build and launch in Moody's Analytics that Bureau van Dijk already had a reasonably well developed product in that area. And so we've been working together with them to complete the build-out of that product and add some of the additional features and enhancements that we had planned to create independently. So we will be going to market with that product early this year and we feel very positive about the opportunity and the prospects there.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Just to follow up on that. Can you \u2013 if you will \u2013 if you're willing, I guess, any sense for the underlying growth rate of Bureau van Dijk kind of on a pro forma basis I guess in the fourth quarter and kind of what you're thinking about going forward into 2018?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. Tim, what I'd say is that Bureau van Dijk has historically been growing at high single-digits, low double-digit kinds of rates. And in the back half of 2017, after the acquisition, we saw sales growth at those kinds of rates and we see that momentum flowing into 2018 and that's sort of inherent in our outlook for the business and its contribution to MA overall. So, we see the business continuing to perform well at or may be a little bit above the overall Moody's Analytics growth rate.","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And I know it's a smaller piece, but professional services, it's ticked up lately and the guidance is good. I imagine currency is impacting that a bit, but is there a story, I guess, to the improved performance there lately?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. The story, Tim, is that we've got two pieces of that business, our knowledge services business where we outsource our research and analytical staff from our platform in India to our clients around the world, and then our training and education business. Both of those businesses struggled a bit over the last couple of years. But we've done a number of things operationally to get them on track and early in 2017 or midyear 2017, they both sort of turned it around and we're starting to see good results coming out of both of those product lines. Customer attrition is down, new business production is up. So we're seeing good progress and good momentum in both of those businesses. You're also quite right. Both of those businesses, particularly the training business, we're seeing some benefit from FX there as well. But generally, we think we have two good turnaround stories there and we're optimistic going into 2018.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Tim, it's Linda. Just a quick follow-up on that. Earlier in 2017, we turned over the Max business, which I have been running for two years to get it up to SOX compliance standards for U.S. public companies. We turned that over to someone in the \u2013 from the sales organization, in Mark's organization. And quite frankly, we've seen very nice results on the sales front as we've done that. Now, the business is operating very nicely within the Moody's framework and quite safely with a interesting journey from an Indian \u2013 two Indian private companies to a U.S. public company standard and then Mark's team has really turbocharged that on the sales front. So that has been a happy story and thank you for noting that change.","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, hey, hello everyone. I'm going to go back to the beginning when Rob, I think, mentioned the strong issuance last year and how that could lead or should lead to higher recurring revenues in MIS this year. Can you put a little bit more meat around that? I think in past years when we've had strong issuance, I've seen that monitoring fees up in like the high single digits and obviously FX helped that too. So is high single digits kind of what we should be thinking about on the recurring MIS side here or could it even be better? Any color?","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, I don't think we typically guide on that, but you have seen an acceleration of the growth rate of the recurring revenue over the last few quarters. And again, it's the \u2013 yeah just because we have issuance doesn't necessarily mean we're going to have growth in recurring revenues because that issuance fee comes from existing issuers. So it's really, you really have to look at the growth of the first-time issuers, first-time mandates and that really is, I think, the best future indicator of recurring revenue growth.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, and you'll recall that we had a little over 1,000 new rating mandates in 2017 and that rolls forward into monitoring a relationship on a going-forward basis.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. And then just switching to BvD also for a minute here. Now that you've owned the company for a few months, I guess, you've gone through a few renewals of clients. So can you just tell us about the pricing opportunities you've seen as you renew? And then related to that, is there actually seasonality in renewals or any seasonality you would call out as we think about modeling 2018 for BvD or RD&A combined now?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. Well, let me take the first part \u2013 or the second part first, Alex. No, there is not any particular seasonality in the underlying business. So, I don't think you need to really think about that too much. And then on the business generally and the opportunities there, the business is performing well. We are \u2013 we have a Moody's Analytics executive now running the business and applying some of our processes and practices to the Bureau van Dijk business. But it's a good solid business and it continues to perform very well. It's not as though it was broken to begin with. But we do continue to see some substantial opportunities for us on the cross-selling side, on the product development side as we share content between Bureau van Dijk and Moody's Analytics and in \u2013 with regard to pricing. So, we have \u2013 candidly, we have not hit that particular lever real hard just yet, but we'll continue to look at that and we'll look at that in the context of the other work that we're doing on the product development side.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Vincent Hung with Autonomous.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hey. Just one for me. So if the phase around high rates persist, would you expect maybe an acceleration of issuance from pre-funding of late 2018 and 2019 maturities?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","No, we're not counting on a lot of pull forward from 2019 into 2018. It's \u2013 in our view, the positive side of the story is really going to be around economic growth, business expansion, borrowing for business expansion and around M&A. So that's where we look for the upsides more than pull forward from 2019 or even 2020.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Just one on the potential impacts of an infrastructure bill to your business, as we potentially at least maybe see a bill make its way through Congress. What will be the key provisions you'll be watching that could indicate whether it's going to have a meaningful impact on your business or potentially not much at all?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. I mean, we've certainly seen the media coverage on the infrastructure bill. It should have a potential positive impact on our PPIF business. But of course that depends on how the final legislation is actually structured. And to the extent that it would allow for use of tax-exempt bonds to finance infrastructure projects, that could increase the sale of debt. So, that would be a positive. Rob, do you have anything to add on that?","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. I have a few things to look for, I mean, obviously there's some \u2013 there's been some discussion about the infrastructure bill. Talking about $1.5 trillion, not large in the overall scheme of the U.S. economy, but it would be an increase \u2013 I think a significant increase over the current level of infrastructure spending in the United States. And I think we then want to look at the mix of federal versus state and local funding to understand that will have an impact on how that translates into issuance. And then another topic is around regulatory approvals and timeframes and how long will it take this infrastructure investment to actually make it to the market. I know there's been some discussion about shortening those approvals, but some are at the federal level and others are at the state and local level.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful color. Thanks. And then just wanted to ask on the cash position and how to think about the leverage in the business. Just post tax reform, any thoughts around changing how you think about how levered Moody's should be just given you convert a higher percentage of your EBITDA into actual cash income. And then just on the debt pay-down, I was looking at your guidance for $1.6 billion of free cash flow, looking at $500 million for dividends and buybacks, $500 million for debt pay down and then CapEx another $120 million, it still feels like you've got some extra dry powder there. So just wondering to think about how that could get deployed.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, it's Linda. I think we intend to proceed as we had said on our ratings level and our leverage levels. We don't like to be right at the edge on any of those things. But your observation is correct; we probably have a few hundred million dollars of potential additional dry powder if things continue as we're seeing now, which we could potentially use in another way. In terms of what we're going to do with interest pay down and then I'll let Ray add some further observations to this, we've got an additional $39 million in interest expense from BvD throughout 2018. That addition is $11 million in the first and second quarter and it kind of ramps down to $9 million and then $8 million in the third and fourth quarter, so probably going to prepay the most expensive debt first as you would probably imagine. So that's how you can probably take a shot at modeling that. But it was sort of like our leverage levels. We like to remain consistent and with a little bit of luck, we'll do perhaps a bit better than we had expected. We could delever a bit more quickly or have a little bit more dry powder and maybe Ray would like to expand on that.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","No, the only thing I would add is to the extent that we are able to delever ahead of what we had previously been anticipating, we certainly would go back and look at our capital policy and how we want to handle that.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","We'll go next to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thank you for \u2013 or good afternoon, thank you for squeezing me in here. First question just, Linda, would you be able to bracket the tax impact on free cash flow due to the tax legislation?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Sure. We were able to, for 2018, add about $150 million to free cash flow from the reduction in the tax rate, which is helpful. Might be interesting, Shlomo, to take a look at the increase in our 2018 adjusted diluted EPS guidance. And we're moving from if I've got this right about $6.07 to a midpoint of a little over $7.70. I think what we have there is about $0.65 of that from U.S. tax reform, about $0.40 each from BvD and the business and maybe $0.15 coming from FX and other things.","So $0.80 of our increase there is really coming from our business and the acquisition, $0.55 from tax reform and the rest from FX. In terms of the operating margin expansion, we also got the question about how much of that is from FX. So, if you look at that 70 basis points, only 10 basis points is from FX. So we're doing most of that the hard way. So, I hope that all of that is helpful to you in thinking about where we're going with 2018.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And thanks, just as a follow-up, just a little on BvD, a prime competitor of theirs in Benelux was DNB and they sold that business to a private investor about a year and a half ago. Was there any change in competitive environment back then? I mean one of the reasons they sold was because they were being challenged by BvD. I want to know if the old DNB business has become more competitive for you guys over there.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Bureau van Dijk has a terrific market position in Europe and has for a very long time. We have not seen any meaningful change to the competitive situation there, which is not to say that there isn't competition, but we feel that we're very, very well positioned, we feel good about where we are.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon, everyone. So, Linda, just wanted to say phenomenal run, congratulations and I look forward to when our paths cross again.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Thanks, Bill.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I wanted to ask a question on RD&A. You'd talked about the strong organic growth there and some of the drivers, a nice pickup in the core research business. You also highlighted 2 to 3 points coming from one-time projects, and you also mentioned the BvD deferred revenue adjustment. So I'm trying to weigh those pieces and I want to ask for your help in terms of how I should think about the constant currency organic revenue growth for RD&A, normalized for all these things kind of going forward.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah I guess Bill, going forward, I think you can think about the underlying legacy business performing at high single digit kinds of rates. And then we've got a number of things that boost the overall results. We've got the addition of Bureau van Dijk. We've got the FX impact which takes us up from there.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Is that helpful?","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So well, not to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like once you've normalized for the factors, kind of as you're exiting 2018, it sounds like you're going to be like low-teens, maybe mid-teens as kind of an organic growth on that piece. Is that the way to think about it or am I missing it?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","That sounds a little high, Bill. I'm not sure how you did that.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Fair point. All right. And then one last question there for my follow-up on the low- single-digit growth on ERS. Maybe give us some color there in terms of what's driving that.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, a continuation of the story we've been talking about for a while there and I guess there are really two pieces to it. There's the very intentional product strategy that we're pursuing, where we're moving away from a business that was driven rather substantially \u2013 where growth was driven rather substantially by lots of one-off project works that we were doing as large customers were asking us to install our software and configure it in a highly bespoke manner for them. We were moving away from that business. Now that we've established what I think is a pretty strong market position, moving away from that very customized kind of business to delivering much more standard product where we can sell a larger number of units ideally on a subscription basis and reduce the amount of low margin services work that we're undertaking.","So we've got the services business declining, very intentionally. We're taking on less and less of that work and the product business is growing at a good clip. But as we make this transition from a services-led business to a product-led business, we have this period where the decline in services is offsetting the growth in profit. As we work through that more this year, that situation will start to stabilize and then we'll be growing off of a more stable base as we move into 2019.","So that's one part of the story which I guess I would characterize as the idiosyncratic part of the story and then the market part of the story is that ERS was growing very, very well over the last number of years through 2016, driven heavily by new regulation that banks were dealing with around capital adequacy and liquidity and stress testing, et cetera.","That regulatory wave has matured. We don't see nearly as much new regulation being placed on banks with respect to those kinds of issues. So the regulatory driver of demand has dissipated. And so we're also dealing with a softer market environment, at the same time that we are executing the shift in product strategy. So we have two things going on that is constraining growth in the ERS business.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Hey, Bill, it's Linda. Also in terms of other things we're doing to make Mark's life a little bit more tricky, you may've heard about the new accounting standard, Revenue Recognition Standard 606, we have to bifurcate software subscription licenses, that requires a lot of accounting work to reclassify some of these things. And near term, that's going to add a little bit more volatility, maybe a 1% negative on MA's overall results in 2018 as we move through that, that should smooth out as we get later on in the year, pretty technical set of changes, but just wanted to let you know that that is going on and it's something that all software companies have to adopt. You'll be seeing more detail on that as we release our 10-K.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Well, thank you very much.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Welcome.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up question from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Yes. Hi. Can you just flesh out a little bit, if you would, of this very strong growth here in the fourth quarter in finance institutions and obviously for the year as well in 2017, you're looking for, I guess, up mid-single-digit revenue growth in that segment this upcoming year. So, decent growth on top of stellar year, just what's going on there please? Thanks.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, I mean a large part of the story was the interestingly titled issuance from infrequent issuers in the fourth quarter and there was strength in that outside of the U.S. as well as inside the U.S. Rob, I don't know if there's more detail you have on that.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, that's right. I mean in the U.S., it was across banks, insurance companies, cards, securities brokerages. In Europe, really driven by this continued issuance as part of the move towards building levels of bail-in-able capital as part of TLAC in the resolution regimes in Europe. So that's been kind of a full-year trend. And in Asia, we saw some good issuance from Chinese asset management companies, ASEAN. And we even saw some good issuance activity from our affiliate in Korea where there was a good bit of issuance from subsidiaries of foreign banks. So, like Ray said, a lot of issuance that tended to come from issuers who aren't hitting the markets frequently. As you know, Craig, there's a more relationship-based construct. And you can see our guidance, we would expect to move back to something that looks more like that in 2018.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's first quarter results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. I will then conclude with comments about our updated outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","In the first quarter of 2016, reduced global bond issuance weighed on Moody's financial performance despite Moody's Investor Services, consistent market coverage, and additional ratings mandate as well as strong results of Moody's Analytics which is not sensitive to debt issuance activity while revenue for Moody's Corporation of $816 million declined 6%.","Operating expense for the first quarter was $512 million, up 4% from the first quarter of 2015. Operating income was $304 million, an 18% decline in the prior year period. The impact of foreign currency translation on operating income was negligible. Adjusted operating income defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization was $334 million, down 16% from the same period last year.","Operating margin for the first quarter of 2016 was 37.3%. The adjusted operating margin was 40.9%. Diluted earnings per share of $0.93 was down 16% from the prior year period. Given market conditions, we have scaled back our revenue and earnings expectations for full year 2016 and are managing our cost base accordingly. Our 2016 EPS guidance is now $4.55 to $4.65.","Before I turn the call over to Linda, I'd like to highlight two investments we made in the first quarter. In March, Moody's analytics announced the acquisition of GGY, a leading provider of actuarial software for the life insurance industry. The addition of GGY's products and specialized expertise accelerates MA's extension into financial risk management for life insurers, complementing our already strong position with global banks.","As part of the Enterprise Risk Solutions line of business, GGY will contribute to MA's regulatory solvency and capital management solutions. We also announced the minority investment in Finagraph, a provider of cloud-enabled automated financial data collection and business intelligence solutions for private companies. This investment underscores Moody's commitment to innovative financial technologies to better address the needs of our customers. Finagraph's information and analytical solutions represent important advantage in bank's risk assessments of small and medium-sized businesses, thus improving access to credit for this underserved segment of the market.","I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","A - Linda Huber","Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the first quarter declined 6% to $816 million. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by 2%. U.S. revenue was $480 million was down 4% from the first quarter of 2015.","Non-U.S. revenue of $336 million, was down 8%, and represented 41% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $452 million increased by 7% and represented 55% of total revenue. Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service, total MIS revenue for the quarter was $525 million, down 13% from the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 1%. U.S. revenue declined 10% to $336 million, while non-U.S. revenue of $189 million declined 18% and represented 36% of total ratings revenue. Recurring revenue of $231 million increased 4% and represented 44% of ratings revenue.","Moving now to the lines of business for MIS, first, global corporate finance of $240 million for the quarter was down 20% from the prior year period. This result reflected lower levels of global speculative-grade issuance, as well declines in the number of U.S. investment-grade bond offerings, and in the volume of European investment-grade issuance. U.S. corporate finance revenue decreased 10%, while non-U.S. revenue decreased 36%.","Second, global structured finance revenue for the first quarter was $91 million, down 11% from the prior year period. This represented the lowest revenue quarter for structured finance that we have seen in 10 quarters. U.S. securitization activities slowed primarily within the CMBS and CLO markets due to widening spreads, regulatory requirement and reduced availability of bank loan collaterals. U.S. structured finance revenue was down 15%. Non-U.S. revenue was flat with a modest increase in Europe.","Third, global financial institutions revenue of $95 million was up 1% from the prior year period. U.S. financial institutions revenue was down 3%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 4%.","Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $92 million was down 9% versus the prior year period as U.S. project finance activity and European infrastructure-related issuance fell amid choppy market conditions. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was down 6%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 14%.","MIS Other, which consist of non-rating revenues from Moody's majority on joint venture interest in ICRA and Korea Investors Service, contributed $8 million to MIS revenue for the first quarter led to the prior year period.","And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $291 million was up 11% from the first quarter of 2015 excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew by 10%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 2%. U.S. revenue of $144 million is up 12% year-over-year and non-U.S. revenue $147 million was up 9% and represented 51% of total MA revenue. Recurring revenue of $222 million increased 9% and represented 76% of MAs revenue.","Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research data and analytics or RD&A, revenue of $165 million was up 10% from the prior year period and represented 57% of total MA revenues. Growth was mainly due to strong new sale of research and data, as well as record customer retention. U.S. RD&A revenue was up 14%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 5%.","Second, global enterprise risk solutions or ERS revenue of $90 million was up 16% from last year primarily from accelerated project delivery. U.S. ERS revenue was up 14%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 17%. Excluding revenue from GGY, ERS revenue grew 13%. And as we've noticed in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue remain subject to quarterly volatility. Trailing 12-month sales for ERS increased 1% reflecting a very difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2015.","Third, global professional services revenue of $37 million was flat to the prior year period. U.S. Professional Services revenue was down 6% while non-U.S. revenue was up 3%.","Turning now to expense, Moody's first quarter expense was $512 million, up 4% from 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation cost in MA, reflecting additional head count required to support business growth, as well as Moody's ongoing technology investments. Expenses in MIS were down slightly compared to the prior year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.","As Ray noted, Moody's reported operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 37.3% and 40.9%, respectively, for the first quarter. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.3% versus 32.9% for the same period last year. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to a change in New York City tax laws relating to income [indiscernible].","Now, I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter of 2016, Moody's returned $334 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. The company repurchased 2.9 million shares at a total cost of $262 million or an average cost of $89.83 per share, and issued 1.6 million shares under its annual employees' stock-based compensation plan.","Moody's also paid $72.1 million in dividends during the quarter, and on April 11, announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of Moody's common stock payable June 10 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 20.","Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2016 totaled 194.3 million, down 4% from the prior year period. As of March 31, 2016, Moody's had $1.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","At quarter end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter-end were $2.1 billion with approximately 73% held outside the U.S. Free cash flow for the first three months of 2016 was $211 million, down 13% from the first three months of 2015 primarily due to the year-over-year decline in net income and changes in working capital.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Ray.","A - Raymond McDaniel","Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing the changes for our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our first quarter 2016 earnings press release which can be found on the Moody's Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.","Moody's updated outlook for 2016 is based on assumption about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporation profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.","Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. Specifically our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound and the euro at $1.44 to \u00a31 and $1.14 to \u20ac1, respectively.","As I noted earlier, the company now expects 2016 EPS of $4.55 to $4.65 inclusive of $0.02 dilution from the acquisition of GGY. Moody's full year 2016 revenues now expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range. In response to this revised revenue outlook, we have lowered our projected base business spending for the year by approximately $50 million through expense management actions and reduced incentive compensation. These savings allow Moody's to maintain guidance for operating expenses to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range despite the addition of GGY's operating expenses and the negative impact to foreign currency translation. Moody's now projects an operating margin of approximately 41% while adjusted operating margin is still expected to be approximately 45%.","Free cash flow is now expected to be approximately $1 billion. Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $125 million. For MIS, 2016 revenue is now expected to be approximately flat. U.S. revenue is now expected to decrease in the low-single-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range. Corporate Finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the low-single-digit percent range, reflecting weak issuance in the first quarter, as well as expectations from variable issuance activity for the reminder of the year.","Structured Finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the mid-single-digit percent range as a result of continued challenges to U.S. securitization activity. Public, Project and Infrastructure Finance revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, which assumes weakness in the first quarter is not offset in the reminder of the year.","For Moody's Analytics, 2016 revenue is now expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Research, Data and Analytics revenue is now expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range as a result of new business and an increased customer retention rate.","Enterprise Risk Solutions revenue is now expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range, including revenue associated with March 2016 acquisition of GGY.","Before we move to the Q&A, I'd like to highlight MIS management change that we announced on April 4. Effective June 1, 2016, Michel Madelain will retire as President and Chief Operating Officer of MIS and will assume the role of Vice Chairman for MIS. He will also remain on the MIS Board of Directors and MIS European boards. Rob Fauber, who has been with Moody's for 11 years, will succeed Michel Madelain as President of MIS. I'd like to extend my thanks to Michel and congratulate Rob on his new role.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of MIS; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We'd be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] And we'll take our first question from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Yeah. Hey. Good morning. I guess, afternoon already almost. Wanted to come and talk about the guidance for a second here. I guess, from a bigger-picture perspective, what was really the thinking in the EPS reduction? And I'm talking primarily from a seasonal perspective. Is this, hey, the first quarter was really awful, but our outlook, because of refinancing and everything else that we talked about three months ago, has not really changed? Or is this also a reflection of, you know what, the second quarter is all right, but there's still a lot of uncertainty here with Brexit in June and things like that? But we're still hoping a lot for the second half. So, hopefully, you're getting the drift on my question. But where is the near term and the remainder of the year kind of fit in into this?","Raymond McDaniel","Yeah. At a high level, Alex, I would point to two things. One is, as you point out, we feel there are still quite a bit of uncertainty for the remainder of this year at a macro level, between Brexit and the potential for interest rate increases, and the fact that we still have some tough comps in the second quarter in particular. We do expect more momentum in the second half of the year than we've had in the first half, and we've already seen improvements in late March and April compared to the very weak beginning to the year in January\/February.","The other thing I'd point you to, though, is Structured Finance and the conditions for the structured finance market have been very challenged so far this year, and we think that they are going to continue to be challenged especially in the U.S. There are a number of reasons for this. Not only is it credit spreads, which can affect the economics of the transaction, but also regulatory requirements that are being implemented and interpreted, and a lot of the market participants are sorting out the appropriate interpretation for new regulatory requirements around risk retention and disclosure of underlying assets information.","And that, in combination with a challenging interest-rate environment or spread environment and issues around the appropriate availability of collateral and areas such as CLOs, has really impacted our outlook for structured finance in the United States for, not only in the first quarter results, but our outlook for the remaining nine months.","Linda Huber","Alex, just to give you some sense of the calendarization of that, we've taken down the MIS revenue outlook by a little bit more than $100 million. You should consider 40% of that is what we've already seen as weakness in the first quarter. 60% of it comes from the rest of the year forecast. And in terms of that remaining 60%, about 60% of that is a reduction in structured finance and the balance, about 40%, is incorporate. So, that should give you something to work with in terms of what we're seeing. So, we've taken it down for the first quarter but also we've moderated our expectations of the balance that being structured and the remainder being incorporate for the rest of the year.","Alex Kramm","Well, that's very great color. Thank you. And then secondly, Linda, while I'll have you, I guess, can you talk about the cost side of the equation in more detail. I think in the past, you've done a great job kind of talking on an absolute dollar basis and how the trajectory looks like. And it seems like you've really now cut all the flex that you have. So, you should probably have a pretty good visibility for the second, third and fourth quarter.","And then, if there is any variability to what you hopefully going to give me now, is it basically - if revenues actually end up being a little bit better, some of the negative flex comes back and maybe some of the bonuses come back? And so, basically, what I'm saying is in a weaker revenue environment, there's not much that's going to change on the cost side on an absolute basis. But if we actually end up doing better, you probably see cost up a little bit again. Is that fair?","Linda Huber","So, let me just set up the explanation for this. So, we saw the markets go weak in the beginning of February. We moved aggressively and we moved hard against that situation. We have taken steps in T&E and most importantly in hiring. For two of the divisions, this excludes Moody's Analytics. We are back to what I would call essential hiring, and we're looking at hiring on a person-by-person status in terms of backfilling. So, really clamped down on that front for two of the divisions.","Now, we can't turn the ship that quickly, and that's the issue. So, we often talk about $50 million of expense flex. So, we have that in train already. And about half of that is from reduced incentive compensations because we've just taken the guidance down. The other half is from the expense management actions that I spoke about earlier.","Now, if this gets worse, we have another $50 million which again is split about half-and-half between incentive compensation and other expense saving measures that we could take. But as we move into that second $50 million, this does get tougher. And we've already taken down our incentive compensation with this first half by about $20 million. So, we'll see how we go. And we'll see what we want to do, but we have been very clear about this, and we started these actions again in February, but you're going to have to wait for the rest of the year to see this flow through, and I'll ask if Ray has any further comment on this.","Raymond McDaniel","Yeah. The only thing I would add is as we've said before, we would take different actions if we saw structural changes in the markets that we're operating in, versus cyclical ups and downs. This looks largely, to us, to be a cyclical condition in the markets. We'll see in the structured finance area how that market adjusts to different regulatory requirements. But history said that it does adjust, but in terms of how quickly that's going to recover we will have to see. There's a couple of phases of regulatory requirements. The market is adjusting currently to the first phase, there will be more coming. So, we just have to keep on an eye on space.","Linda Huber","Just one more clarification. The $50 million we've already committed to that is largely offset by additional expenses from GGY and what we view as potential unfavorable FX situation. So, good effort by taking down expenses by $50 million. However, we do have the offset, we're basically back to where we started. So, the watch board here is to be very, very careful with hiring and to be very careful with all other expense items up and down the P&L. And we are absolutely on that.","Alex Kramm","Great. And sorry just to quickly - on the expenses, in absolute dollars like you usually give like, hey, in the next couple of quarters see that $5 million, $5 million, $5 million. Like can you just give us an update? It seems like not much has changed, but just to remind us of the absolute dollar level that's changing, any expectations?","Linda Huber","Sure. We're looking at expense ramp from here that we think it's going to be $35 million to $45 million over the course of the year. Now, the most variable part of that is incentive compensation. If we are not doing well incentive compensation gets hit first and hard. And if we somehow manage to do better, incentive compensation might ramp up towards the end of the year. So, just to watch out there, but we expect to ramp from here $35 million to $45 million.","Alex Kramm","Excellent. Thanks for that.","Operator","We will now go to Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Raymond McDaniel","Hey, Andre.","Andre Benjamin","Thanks. Hi. How are you? So, on ERS, I was wondering if you can maybe talk through the increase to guidance on that business line, particularly the high-single-digit increase from low-single-digit just a few months ago. I was wondering how much of that is M&A contribution versus new business wins and other factors because if you are simply pulling business forward, I would think the full year guidance wouldn't change that much.","Raymond McDaniel","Sure, we'll ask Mark to take that.","Mark Almeida","Yeah. I think you've got it right, Andre. It's really driven by the GGY acquisition, taking up the ERS result to high single.","Andre Benjamin","Okay. And then just on...","Mark Almeida","Yeah, the business is performing very much in line with what we expected coming in to the year. The timing in the first quarter has been a little different. I think we've just been executing quite well on project delivery, so we pulled some things forward. But the base outlook for the business organically is consistent with what guided to previously.","Andre Benjamin","And then on the debt outlook, I know you talked a bit about the split between how much came out of structure versus other buckets. In corporate finance where you did take the view down, I was wondering if you could provide some color on how much of that is continued weakness in the high-yield market versus like starting to see some cracks in the pipeline for investment grade as well?","Linda Huber","Sure. Andre, maybe this is a good time for us to talk about what we are hearing from the banks. And again, this is issuance views for both financial and non-financial U.S. dollar issuance and then we'll go over to Europe. So, I think you should be able to see a slide that we've put up. Now, investment grade balance, curious situation. For the first quarter of 2016, $340 billion in issuance, about flat year-over-year, that's good. What was less good is that the deal count, the number of transactions was down by about 20%. So, dollar volume, dollar value about the same but deal count is down which is not helpful to us.","Moving across the columns, months-to-date for April about $65 billion; and for the full year, we're looking at $1.2 trillion which is about flat. So, right now, from investment grade, the pipeline is robust. It's good. And we expect the market remain active and the backdrop is stable and companies are coming out of black out. So, it looks like there's quite a bit to do right now. So, investment grade is positive, the issue here has been the deal count.","Going down the high yield, looking at the $40 billion of issuance so far, that's down 60% year-over-year. Months-to-date April $25 billion. Year-to-date, we're looking at $230 billion down 15%.","The market tone is better. There's some deals in the market - there have been deals in the market this week. There's one in the market today, a Friday. That's unusual. The market tone has improved but the market is still bifurcated as you see in the second point between have and have and have not. The stronger credits are doing better.","Brand tightening has already happened. We're in about 160 basis points. The question is, is that enough? And if spreads continue to tighten, we may see some progress. Conversely, if they want now again we may see further back up, so we're going to have to watch that closely.","Leverage loans, we see $40 billion in the first quarter which is down 25% year-over-year, $15 billion month-to-date, and $260 billion for the year, which is down 10% year-over-year. So stability in the macro backdrop as you see in the first point is also aiding the leverage loan market. It's weaker than the high-yield bond market, though, because of fund outflows and the slowdown in CLO formation that goes back to the risk retention requirement which we can talk a bit more about if you want, and some increased default activity serves as a bit of a headwind.","Now, if we move over to Europe, looking at the next slide, again, these are the views of the bank. Investment grade in Europe, pipeline is robust and can pick up further because of the ECB's corporate bond-purchasing program. Brexit, though, in the second point, is an uncertainty. And that could side line the issuers and be harmful for the summer season which is traditionally weaker depending on what happens with that vote. And U.S. corporates continue to see that there's good value in accessing the euro market, what we would call the first Yankees, and we expect that to be a heavy component of supply as it has been and will be, we think going forward.","Spec-grade in Europe, the market was muted, supply was down 70% and very volatile first quarter. Again, the ECB's move had sparked the renewed risk appetite, and is leading to a pickup in high-yield activity in Europe. And tighter spreads, again may encourage further issuance. So overall in Europe, the ECB's move makes us more optimistic, but it has been a very slow first quarter in Europe. I think the overall view on the more speculative asset classes across the world would be keep an eye on spreads if they continue to tighten. We may see the outlook improve, and conversely, if they widened particularly as we go into the Brexit vote, that will be detrimental. So hope that helps to you, Andre.","Andre Benjamin","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now go to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. So, a lot of the big picture, I guess, constraints on the issuance market don't sound much different than what it was when you gave guidance in February and I was just so - I guess as I said I guess some more color on what the degree of changes? I think, Linda, in the $100 million you helped break out the way you're assuming what and I think you just walk through the corporate side of things and maybe structured finance where maybe you can help us understand the different issuance categories and what change was with February?","Raymond McDaniel","Yeah, I'll start, Manav, and then invite Linda or Michel to weigh in. It's really centered on - our changes in outlook for structured finance really centered on the U.S. and within the U.S. it's focused on primarily the CMBS market and the CLO market.","As you know from our prior comment in the commercial mortgage backed securities area, there is a lot of refinancing that needs to occur. Some of that refinancing is occurring outside of securitization and we are also expecting to see the volume and activity pick up in the third and fourth quarters of this year because there was very little conduit lending early in this year and the conduits have increased their financing but it will take some months for that to feed into CMBS.","In the CLO area, it's the market dealing with both the risk retention requirements and the interpretations or other regulatory requirements that having to do with transparency around underlying assets and the suitability of the collateral itself. So, assuming that we see the market sort out how it is going to meet the new regulatory requirements and the suitability of collateral, again, we could see a pickup in CLOs later in the year.","Pipelines are not bad. As a matter of fact, in Europe, pipeline is up quite substantially. And so, some of the issues that we're seeing in the U.S. are being partially offset by the international business. But it's still not enough to allow us to come anywhere close to holding our original guidance.","Linda Huber","Manav, just a little bit of color, and then I'll ask Michel if he wants to comment further. I think your thesis was, what's changed, and shouldn't we have been able to see this when we gave our initial guidance? As I've said previously, high yields, bonds issuance down 60% in the first quarter is a pretty heavy hit. Leverage loans down 25% also is a pretty heavy hit. We have the risk-off mode happening. You had oil prices collapsing. Concerns about China and growth concerns.","So, we went through a pretty heavy risk-off phase there which is now starting to wide itself. So, generally, around here, we're okay if we have one segment off, but having corporate hit hard, as well as having structured having had the worst quarter it's had in 10 quarters, we frankly didn't see that.","Now, as Ray said, that is what we would view as a cyclical issue in structure, but until the participants in that market figure how to deal with some of these different conditions and move. We do think that that situation will ease as we go into the end of the year. But I don't think we expected the total [indiscernible] environment in the first quarter. We were thoughtful but it was worse than we thought. And as we've said, there are number of factors that make the rest of the year a little bit tricky to predict.","With that, I'll turn it over to Michel to have him perhaps give some more thoughts about how we're viewing the balance of the year.","Michel Madelain","Thank you, Linda. I think now what I was going to say is that really, in terms of the numbers we're seeing, this is really the result of market volumes and that I think as Ray alluded earlier, our coverage has remained very consistent with what we've seen in the past. So, as market improves, we should see a pickup in our own volumes, obviously. That's what I was going to add.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. And then, just thinking a little beyond the second half of the year in that your comments on structures was cyclical. I mean, it sounds like a lot of this, at least in your comments, are a little bit more cyclical. But how do you, guys, think about opportunity it takes? I know you talked about the, I guess, the majority backlog, so maybe if you could just give us a few comments on that and then maybe some comments on, I guess, M&A is going down a bit. That's been a big driver of your issuance in your backlog and it sounds like waiting the valuation says this might be a little slow because of that. So, any puts and takes that you need to call out?","Raymond McDaniel","Yeah. You're correct. We have seen slower activity in our rating assessment service coincident with reduced activity and issuance. As far as the cyclicality of the conditions. Clearly in the corporate sector, this is cyclical. There are significant refinancing walls that begin to build in 2017, and really built for several years after that. So, we're going to see a large amount of activity associated with refinancing.","M&A, there had been some bumps in the road with M&A, but it has been strong for a while, and to the extent that we're in a low-growth environment that has and probably will continue to encourage M&A. Where we see the erosion in M&A-driven debt is at least at the margins around some of the tax-driven deals and things of that sort. So, really I view the corporate story as being very much a cyclical story with a significant refinancing wall coming upon us beginning next year.","On the structured finance side, again I think it's largely cyclical. But we have to watch and see how the market deals with new requirements, and what economically the market determines to make sense. So, that's an area to keep our collective eye on in terms of how much of it is cyclical and whether there's some structural changes to that market.","Manav Patnaik","Yeah, that's why - Yes. Go ahead.","Linda Huber","I'm sorry. I just wanted to note that investment-grade issuance conditions are really good right now. The U.S. 10 years at 1.85%. If you want to look at Reverse Yankee Issuance, Unilever did a particularly attractive bond issuance recently, and they paid very, very little for that issuance which is really quite remarkable. We've seen M&A kind of stop as we dealt with the changes in the inversion rules. And then, this week, healthcare M&A came back strong - three deals this week. I think we saw three deals in the G&P space this week. So, there still is appetite, and there's still transactions that need to be funded. So, we'll see how that goes.","So, this is really a week-by-week situation with the backdrop of the Brexit both coming up on June 23. So, it provides an unusual degree of uncertainty particularly in Europe. Absent the break that's concerned, I think we would feel pretty good about companies financing opportunities particularly for Reverse Yankee. But we're going to have to watch this closely.","Manav Patnaik","All right. Thanks so much for that color, and I just like to congratulate Michelle and Rob on their new roles.","Linda Huber","Thank you.","Raymond McDaniel","Thanks.","Manav Patnaik","We'll pass that along.","Operator","We'll now go to Warren Gardiner with Evercore.","Warren Gardiner","Great. Thank you. So, I realized it was a pretty tough quarter for transaction fees. But it kind of looks like at least in shorter products and corporate finance relationship fees jump pretty nicely from the fourth quarter. And maybe some of that is pricing, but anything to kind of call out there in terms of good growth?","Raymond McDaniel","Yeah. I mean, some of it is pricing, but it's also the monitoring and annual fees associated with the new rating mandates that have come in over the trailing 12 months are significant contributor to that. So, as the stock of outstanding ratings grows, the monitoring fees, annual fees grow along with that.","Warren Gardiner","Okay. Okay. And then, a while back, I think you guys provided some nice color around those monitoring fees across some different regions. I recall that fees in the U.S. were pretty high relative to Europe and Asia. And that's kind of on the monitoring fee side or relationship fee side. So I guess, my question is does that relationship kind of also holds for the most part on the transaction fee side as well?","Raymond McDaniel","Unfortunately, it's not as simple as an answer as would probably be convenient because we have a different mix of frequent issuer-pricing agreements versus transaction-based pricing agreements by geography. So, the U.S. market, for example, which is heavily represented by speculative-grade issuers has more transaction pricing. Those are less frequent issuers. And the European market, which is more investment-grade driven has more frequent issuer-pricing agreements. So, the pricing is a bit difficult to match up. But broadly speaking, our pricing is consistent around the world for global ratings. It's not exactly the same everywhere, but it's broadly consistent.","Warren Gardiner","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. I wanted to ask about some of your assumptions because it sounded like you're touching on some of your earlier points. But is it fair to think you're building in a steady environment in Europe in your non-U.S. assumptions? And then I've got a couple other ones.","Raymond McDaniel","We do think that Europe is going to be relatively stronger in the second half of the year once we get through the Brexit vote and with the corporate sector purchase program through the ECB. So, assuming that Brexit is resolved in a reasonable way in terms of how the market interprets it, and with that, June purchase program kicking off. We think that's going to be a very attractive spread environment for corporates and that's supporting what should be good year-on-year growth for our European corporates.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. And then, the assumption, I guess, global corporate finance. It sounded like you've seen some people comeback to a market on the M&A side, are you expecting a rebound in the next, I guess, two to three quarters in M&A. Again, I'm just trying to get the assumptions behind some of the guidances out there.","Raymond McDaniel","No. I wouldn't say - I would not anticipate M&A to be running for the remainder of the year at the pace it ran last year but there's still going to be reasonable amount of activity. So, I don't have a number for you on that but that would be my narrative around it.","Linda Huber","So, keep in mind, there's also the announced M&A pipeline that still needs to be funded. We had cited at $200 billion at the beginning of the year and only some of that financing has moved through the pipeline. So, we've got some very, very big deals. We're thinking about the Teva deal and also the Dell deal alone. That's $60 billion that we could see that has to move for example. So, we would still see that there is some opportunity there but we think that the companies are going to choose their slots pretty carefully again given the macro environment.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just on the cost cutting side, have you seen any change in attrition rates among employees? And then, it sounded like the compensation was perhaps flexible in the sense that if we had a better second half of the year, we could see that compensation number go up, how do we think about that kind of given the current environment?","Linda Huber","Sure. I think we're seeing a little bit of reduced voluntary turnover, but it's only moved a few tenths of a percentage point off of our high-single-digit view of things. If one is looking for a job in the financial sector right now, particularly if one is looking for a job in the banking sector, that's a pretty challenging place to look at this point in time. So, that would probably be the reason why we're seeing that a slight reduction in voluntary turnover.","Now for incentive compensation, let's talk about that. We have started the year with 100% of our bonus target being set at the $4.80 we have previously seen for guidance. We've pulled that down to $4.60. And as a result of that, we have taken down our incentive compensation.","For example, for the first quarter of last year, incentive compensation was $38 million. And this year on the first quarter, it's come down to $32 million. So, we've pulled down incentive compensation pretty hard to deal with this new lower forecast. And if we're not going to hit our numbers, the employees are not paid as well. That's just the way it goes.","In terms of $32 million number, we would see that it will ramp a bit as we go into the fourth quarter, if things go right. But if we do considerably better than the $4.60 we're predicting now, Joe, you would expect that we would take incentive compensation back up. So, $4.80 was 100% and $4.60 is below that. So, we've cut incentive comp accordingly.","Raymond McDaniel","And this does react formulaically. So, improved performance will cause higher accruals and reduced performance will reduce the incentive comp line formulaically.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to Vincent Hung with Autonomous.","Vincent Hung","Hi. How is it going?","Raymond McDaniel","Good afternoon.","Vincent Hung","On the frequent issue of programs, are you happy with the proportion of MIS by its frequent issuer or longer-term would you prefer that to be higher?","Raymond McDaniel","There is some volatility that we are accepting in order to have more transactional pricing as opposed to frequent issuer pricing. But that really, outside of cyclical conditions, it really is driven by our view of whether global debt is likely to continue to grow and we would like to capture the upside of that through higher transactional pricing, which we might think of as retail pricing as opposed to wholesale pricing. That being said, if we see a change in the growth opportunity in global debt markets, we will consider whether a different pricing model makes more sense and we would adjust.","Vincent Hung","Okay. And just a last one for me. So, can you talk a bit about the management change in MIS? Is it going to be business as usual or should we expect a maybe a different approach? Well, we're very pleased with all the work that Michel Madelain has done since he has been the President of MIS. So, in that respect, you should think of it as business as usual. That being said, Rob and Michel are not the same person. So, we're looking for good ideas. We're looking for good ideas from Michel going forward in his new role and from","Rob in his new role. So, anticipate business as usual, but maybe not all exactly the same business.","Vincent Hung","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now go with Denny Galindo with Morgan Stanley.","Denny Galindo","Hi there. Thanks for taking my questions. First one on the expenses. The incremental margins were very high in MIS, and I was wondering how much of that was due to kind of losing some of these things like rush fees and new issuer fees that might be kind of a higher-margin profile than some of the pure kind of transaction-based fees that you, guys, charge.","Raymond McDaniel","No. I really think that the focus should be on transaction volumes in terms of the change. Those other businesses, rating assessment service, and that sort of thing is really not a very large part of the revenue profile for MIS. And so, even though we appreciate when that area is more active, it's not a big contributor to changes in revenue or margin. It's really based off of volumes.","Linda Huber","Denny, a little bit more color, in the first quarter of 2016, in fact, expenses increased 4% over 2015, and you might want to ask why that was? The majority of that growth was to continue the growth, support the growth in Moody's Analytics which as you can see is performing beautifully. So, MA expenses grew 9% which supported revenue growth which was even greater. MIS expenses though were slightly down, and of course, we're trying to match the expense support for the revenue growth in the business. And we can't do that instantaneously.","Most of the $50 million that we've already equipped and processed on expense management will come from shared services, that's the fourth part of the business which I run for the most part and then also to MIS. Moody's analytics is performing well and we will continue to invest in it. And if compensation view will be slightly different perhaps than the rest of the corporation, if it performs according to its targets which through the first quarter, it has, and even better, it's incentive compensation would be at target or perhaps even higher.","So, we've been very cautious to match what we're doing here with where we're seeing growth and the further reason for the growth in that incentive compensation for the first quarter year-over-year was because of some of the additions that we made in head count last year and that some of the things we've already started at the very beginning of 2016. We have a very good handle on that right now and of course, we did see the acquisition of GGY which added some expense and we continue to make prudent technology investment. But this is very carefully planned expense management where we need it to support the growth areas and we're throttling back on those areas particularly the support areas where we can do that. So, very careful, very active management of our expenses.","Denny Galindo","Okay. That's helpful. I mean, that's a good segue into Moody's Analytics. That was a little strong and most of the guidance increase seems to be from the acquisition. We've also seen some stories coming out of our IFRS 9 and the equivalent GAAP rules which seem like might give you guys a pretty nice runway and ERS over the next, say, two to three years. Have you been able to kind of size that opportunity in a better way since we last spoke on IFRS 9 and these changes to the GAAP provisioning rules?","Raymond McDaniel","Denny, well, we've talked about this. IFRS 9, we think, is going to be a very nice growth driver for the business. We actually think that the prospect for IFRS 9 is probably richer for us than what we've gotten from stress testing because it's applicable to many, many more institutions all over the world. So we are very optimistic about IFRS 9. It's still early days, frankly, for that initiative. We've had some success thus far. We have a good pipeline and we have very good expectations for what we can do there.","But you're absolutely right. We had good strength across MA in the first quarter, really very broad-based strength for Moody's Analytics. On a constant-dollar basis, every region was up double digits organically, so we feel that the business is just performing very well. And demand for the things that we're doing continues to be very strong. So, we've taken up guidance in ERS because of the GGY acquisition, but we've also taken up guidance in our RD&A, just reflecting strong underlying growth in the business.","Denny Galindo","Okay. And then just one last one. On the capital allocation guidance, you had this kind of $1 billion number out there. And typically, the way you formulaically do this, you end up buying more shares whenever - or spending more whenever the stock price is down. So, I was a little surprised that only - roughly 25% of the annual buyback rate occurred in the first quarter. I mean, is there - was there something kind of stopping you from - or did the formula not come out? Was it more aggressive buybacks in that quarter? And is this something that maybe we could increase that number if there is an attractive opportunity with the price in the second quarter or third quarter? Maybe just kind of your thoughts around on how that buyback number will progress?","Linda Huber","Denny, it's Linda. And then if Larry wants to chime in, I'm sure he will do so. So, we are working with the guidance of approximately $1 billion in buybacks, and we have to set our plan as we finish the previous quarter's earnings call. So, in the absence of better information when we did this close to 90 days ago now, we decided to keep our allocation pro rata across this year because you could see a couple of points that likely concerning around Brexit, around the U.S. election and so on.","So, we started out spreading our money pro rata across the year. Now, we had some heavy tiering in place, and when the stock price fell to $78, we were able to buy back more shares quite cheaply. And in fact, we were at $89 and change for average repurchase price in the first quarter. Until yesterday the stock was in the high 90s and $100. So, we felt pretty good about that.","So, I'll have to see where we want to go with that allocation over the rest of the year. But, again, we have to do this in advance for the coming quarter, and we can't change that allocation until we move in to another window period.","So, that's the technical explanation of what's going on. I hope that's helpful to you, and maybe Ray has some further thoughts.","Raymond McDaniel","No. I think that's it.","Denny Galindo","That was very helpful. Thanks. That's it for me.","Raymond McDaniel","Sure.","Operator","We will now go to Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert","Thanks. So, the MIS revenue performance in the first quarter lagged just a little bit against your primary competitor. Anything to read into that in terms of changes in the market share dynamic?","Raymond McDaniel","No. Our coverage was very strong, and so I don't think that's part of the story. I think the story probably does revolve around the fact that we have more transactional-based pricing than our competitor. And so in a low-volume quarter, I think that's where you see the difference show up.","Peter Appert","Yeah. Makes sense. Ray, on the Brexit issue, let's say, God forbid, they make the wrong decision and decide to go, do you interpret that as a fundamental structural change in the market that might just reduce the issuance opportunity coming out of the EU?","Raymond McDaniel","Yeah. It's certainly for, I would think for some period of time that is going to be a disruptive influence in the European market. And not only because of an exit by the UK but whether that causes any other nations to rethink their position in the EU or in the Eurozone. So, it's quite speculative to try and anticipate what the overall consequence of this would be. That being said, it's also hard for me to imagine that in the short run it wouldn't have a chilling effect on issuance just because of the confusion about what the longer-term consequences would be.","Peter Appert","Right. Understood. So, then lastly for Mark. I'm wondering if it's possible for you to give us any color around a backlog metrics for the ERS business to help us better understand the sustainability growth? I'm asking this in the context of you've decided to accelerate the deliveries as a driver of revenue. I wonder if that brings down your backlog number that, therefore, makes the revenue growth number going forward look maybe less compelling.","Mark Almeida","Peter, the way to answer that is we've got frankly and we talked about this last time. For ERS, we've got a pretty modest revenue growth outlook this year partly because of the pull forward that we saw at the end of 2015. We pulled up a pretty sizeable chunk of revenue in the late 2015 from 2016, so that was impacting our 2016 growth rate. But we still - the business is still performing well, I mean, trailing 12 months sales are now down to I think 1% over prior year. I think that's really a question of difficult comps in this past quarter and in the second quarter of last year. We expect double-digit sales growth for the rest of this year. So, I think we're going to be in good shape as we move into 2017. I don't see this impairing growth in the business going forward.","Peter Appert","So, net new sales are running at a double-digit rate currently, is that the message?","Mark Almeida","Net new sales, well, again, to be very precise, trailing 12 months sales are up only 1% over where they were this time last year. That said, we had very, very strong growth in the second quarter of last year and in the first and second quarters of last year. So, we've got difficult comparables in this period. Moving ahead, in the quarter 2, 3 and 4 of 2016, we're projecting double-digit sales growth in ERS. So...","Peter Appert","And that's - I'm sorry, when you say double-digit sales growth, are you talking about new billings? Are you talking about...","Mark Almeida","Yeah. Yeah.","Peter Appert","...recognized revenue?","Mark Almeida","No. No. I'm sorry. I'm talking about sales as opposed to revenue recognized on the P&L. So, billings would be the right metric.","Peter Appert","Got it. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now go to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First, Ray or Linda, can you just talk a little further about the high-yield market out there in the U.S. maybe in the context where are the default rates right now for the energy commodity companies? Do you separate that as default rates diversity the rest of the market for high yield?","Raymond McDaniel","No. Our forecast for the energy sector, the one-year forecast is for a 10% default rate and about 12.5% in metals and mining. So that obviously is elevated compared to the global 2016 forecast of about 4.5%. So, with the recent relative strength in energy prices, that might help these numbers tick down, but we'll have to see. The energy sector has been quite volatile through the first quarter. And it was a source of money both leading the high-yield sector, but then also money coming back in later in the quarter. So, it has contributed to the volatility and availability of funding based on the overall close in and out of that sector.","Craig Huber","And then where are you seeing the default rates for non-energy companies from high yield in the U.S. right now?","Raymond McDaniel","For our high-yield U.S., we're forecasting at year-end 6% in the U.S., about 2% in Europe. So, the global number would be about 4% - high 3s, 4%.","Craig Huber","Sorry, that's the non-energy related companies or the overall?","Raymond McDaniel","Yeah, that's with the overall spec grade.","Craig Huber","I guess you're informing them that the non-energy companies, the default rates. The health of those high-yield companies are much better shape, of course.","Raymond McDaniel","Exactly. Exactly.","Craig Huber","So, does that give you a reason for optimism for high yield? Is you kind of think out here over the next 12 months for high yield debt issuance for overall?","Raymond McDaniel","Yeah, I mean the spreads have certainly come in from where they peaked in early February. They've come in significantly. I think it would be beneficial for them to continue to come in because there's not a lot of refinancing that has to happen this year. It is more opportunistic. So, if we were moving out 12 months or 18 months, I would say this kind of spread environment is certainly supportive of refinancing for maturing debt but right now, we're in a more opportunistic environment, so more firms can wait and see if spreads continue to tighten or not.","Craig Huber","Two other questions please. One, is there any update Linda or Ray on the DOJ front if they potentially come after your company like they did a few years ago with SMP?","Raymond McDaniel","No, we've been disclosing in our Qs and K that we continue to have investigation, inquiries being made of us from the DOJ and state attorney general. That disclosure has remain very consistent, so there's really no new news to offer there.","Craig Huber","Good. And then last for Linda. If you could just give us an update for the first quarter breakdown of revenues on your four ratings areas. How those ratings broke down your high-yield bank loans, investment grade, et cetera, please.","Linda Huber","Sure, Craig. I'll start with the corporate sector, and we'll start with investment grade, and we're looking at Q1 2016 compared to 2015. So, for investment grade in 2016, we had $66 million of revenue from investment grade. That was 28% of the total for CFG which is $240 million. Last year, we had $87 million as investment grade and $298 million in corporates, so the percentage stayed about the same at 28%. That grade is where the story is. For the first quarter of this year, we had $30.3 million. That is less than half of last year's $62.7 million, and this year we're looking spec grade being 13% of the total. Bank loan is down a bit at $41.3 million versus $44.5 million last year. And 17% of the total and other about flat $102.6 million and 43% of the total for CFG.","Going to structured. Again, quarter-over-quarter, 2016 versus 2015, ABS, asset-backed security, is pretty close, about $20 million for the first quarter of this year versus $21 million last year. Percentage is about flat at 22%. RMBS, also not that much movement. In fact, this was up in the first quarter of 2016 to almost $21 million versus about $18 million last year. Percentage was up to 23%.","Commercial real estate here again was where we saw we had more dramatic difference, about $28 million in the first quarter of this year versus $33 million last year. Percentage is about 31% this year. Structured credit also have more dramatic change, $22 million this year versus almost 29 last year, and 24% of the total. So, that's the story in structured.","FIG, not too much difference in FIG, total of $95 million for the first quarter of 2016 about flat to last year's about $94 million. FIG does not move around as much as the other line. So, for banks, we're about $59 million. Last year, was about $63 million, percentage is about 62%.","Insurance did perform better. We're close to $30 million in insurance versus $25 million last year, that's 31% of the FIG total managed investments, about $4 million flat to last year in dollar and percent. Other also flat in dollar and the percent to about $2.5 million and 3%.","And PPIF again, this is another less-than-pleasant surprise. Last year in the first quarter, PPIF in 2015 did $100 million. I'm sure we have a little bit less than $92 million. So, CFG severance is about $55 million, about flat to last year's $56 million.","Project in infrastructures where we saw some weakness about $36.5 million versus last year's $44.5 million. So, that's about 40% of the PPIF line and about an 18% decline which was obviously not helpful. Then the other line is negligible for PPIF. So, again PPIF in total down 9% year-over-year.","So, we had three out of four of the businesses having some challenges with corporates down the most in dollar and percent terms. Structured which is our second biggest business so off. And then PPIF off 9% as well, with banking about the same. So, again, if we have one of these engines have a bit of a challenge, we can usually figure it out and make it up somewhere else. But three out of four of the MIS engines down that's a little bit tricky. And so, you see the results in the quarter numbers.","Craig Huber","Great. Thanks for going through all that.","Operator","We will now go to Doug Arthur with Huber Research Partners.","Douglas Arthur","Yeah. Thanks. Two questions. I mean, Ray, there's been a bunch of sort indirect questions on this on the call, but I'm just trying to get a better sense of the trend in mandates globally right now. And then I've got a follow up.","Raymond McDaniel","Obviously, we're continuing to see significant number of new mandates. The first quarter, they were down a little bit compared to the first quarter of last year, and that would be typically associated with reduced debt market activity. So, we're convinced - I am convinced that it remains a very important fundamental long-term driver of the business. But it does follow the cycles of debt issuance activity, and so it was off slightly in the first quarter compared to last year.","Douglas Arthur","Okay. Great. And then, Linda, just a technical question per se, interest expense on an absolute basis was up quite a bit sequentially from the fourth quarter, I'm trying to understand within your tranches of debt, did anything materially changed there, Q4 - Q1 over Q4?","Linda Huber","Let me take a look at that Craig. Q1 over Q4, I think the answer to that is that we did reopen our 30-year notes in November of 2015. Now, not to call anybody out but a number of the analysts have completely missed that we took on $300 million worth of debt in the fourth quarter in November. We've talked about it a lot. But despite that, some folks have completely missed it. So, adding another $300 million of debt in November we only had, obviously, a partial inclusion of that debt in the fourth quarter and we had a full quarter of net interest expense in the first quarter. So, let me see. We - the fourth quarter, we had interest expense of $31.8 million, and that bumped up to $34.6 million in the first quarter of 2016. So, that's what that's all about.","And again, sorry if we didn't signal this strongly enough. We thought we did. But everybody should note that we added $300 million to those 2,044 in November.","Craig Huber","That clarifies it. Thank you.","Linda Huber","Sure.","Operator","We will now go to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William Warmington","Good afternoon, everyone.","Raymond McDaniel","Hi, Bill.","William Warmington","So, a question for you on the improved outlook for Moody's Analytics. The - part of it is coming from the inclusion of GGY, but then RD&A is also - came in better than expected in Q1. What was actually going on within RD&A? That's normally pretty steady, predictable business and it's coming in on the upside, so I was going to ask for some color on what's driving that?","Raymond McDaniel","Bill, I think the short answer is we had very strong sales at the end of last year and at the beginning of this year. It's a subscription business. And so having sales come in a bit stronger than we expected, that's going to result in more revenues that gets recognized for the full year in 2016. And it was a combination of a number of things. Customer retention continues to improve. So, we got a little bit of a bump from that. New sales production has been very strong, so that contributed. Pricing has been good.","So, I guess on the RD&A side one way to say this we're firing on all cylinders. We're just - we're doing quite well there. And as I mentioned earlier, we're doing well all over the world. So, the business is just quite strong and it added to the expectation for the year and prompted us to just move the guidance up.","William Warmington","And then a balance sheet question for you. You've got about $2.1 billion in cash. And could you remind us how much of that is offshore? And how do you feel about taking out some additional leverage at this point to support stock repurchases? And then I might as well ask about the private placement is coming due in 2017, just to ask if it's too early to ask what you're thinking about doing with that?","Linda Huber","Bill, we have 73% of our cash offshore to be exact and the total amount that we have is $2.066 billion. So, $1.05 billion offshore and a little bit more than $0.5 billion is onshore. We do have some room within our leverage. But given that we did the $300 million addition in the fourth quarter of last year, I think our view would be we're fine for right now. We'll wait and see what the end of the year looks like, but, yes, we could potentially put on a little bit more debt.","We're watching the markets very closely. Your point is very good that we have a private placement with a particularly high coupon coming due in 2017, and we're running the breakevens on that right now, and we'll take a look at that. If we do decide to move toward the end of the year, that may or may not be included, depending on what the breakeven looks like. But we're watching the markets carefully.","But since we did $300 million more in the fourth quarter in November, as I've just said, I think if we do anything, it might be more weighted toward the back half of the year. Our cash position is fine to continue with our share repurchase, and we'll continue to run our plans as we have guided.","William Warmington","Okay. Thank you for the insight.","Linda Huber","Sure.","Operator","We will now go with Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Henry Chien","Hey. Good afternoon. It's Henry Chien calling in for Jeff. I just had a question, a follow-up question on MIS. Looking at the non-transaction revenues, how should we think about that for the rest of the year given the amount of mandate you already have and especially the environment sort of remains as it is right now? Any color you can provide, that would be appreciated.","Raymond McDaniel","For the monitoring fees, there gross will not change dramatically for quarters two, three and four. We got the biggest in the first quarter as we move into the New Year. And then we'll see - we'll continue to see growth, but it will be more modest through the remainder of the year.","Henry Chien","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And in terms of your guidance, the raised guidance for MA, are you also assuming some margin expansion or additional margin expansion for the segment, as well, for 2016?","Raymond McDaniel","Well, we don't provide guidance on the margin outlook but we can - as we have discussed, we're continuing to work in executing on all the plans we have in place to drive margin expansion and MA over the next several years.","So, that plan remains intact. Obviously, the acquisition we did will have some impact on the margin in the near-term, but nevertheless, the work that we are doing to drive margin expansion given the maturity of the business and the scale that we are achieving, those continue to be a work in progress.","Henry Chien","Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.","Linda Huber","Henry, it's Linda. To be clear about this, we report our margins fully loaded with overhead costs. I would ask you to look at that very carefully compared to others who are in the same business. Mark's business has been particularly successful of late, and perhaps the less than happy outcome for him is that he's now allowed to carry more of the overhead allocation which makes his life a little bit harder on the margin line. So in the no good deed goes unpunished category, just something you might want to think about a little bit because we do most of that work after we look at what's clearly trackable and traceable for overhead allocation. That's based on the revenue view. So, Mark's progress is garnering him a little bit more overhead.","Henry Chien","Okay. Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you so much.","Operator","We'll now go to Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Tim McHugh","Yes. Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked. But just one quick one maybe would be if you have to make the additional $50 million of cuts if things got worse than, I guess, you've anticipated. I know the incentive comp is kind of formulaic, but that next tranche of cuts, I guess how deeply would that require you cutting at that point? Is it - at this point, it sounds like you've kind of gone through essential hiring. But what would be required to make that next layer. And I guess just trying to get a sense of how painful, I guess, that would have to be if that's where you had to go.","Linda Huber","Tim, let me just make one thing clear. We received a question why did we deal with our guidance right now on the first quarter call that's a little bit early for us. Part of the reason why we did that is change in guidance triggers the reduction in incentive compensation for us. In other words, we've just taken out about close to $20 million in incentive compensation for the first quarter and the rest of the year. That is the result of our pulling down the guidance. So, we will look at now how we perform according to where we are with the midpoint being $4.60.","So, the next thing that would happen on $50 million is we'd be about evenly split between another $25 million in incentive compensation if our performance is weaker than we expect now, and some other cost cuts that we could make.","We probably need to keep with some essential hiring, less so in shared services but certainly in MIS. We'd like Mark to continue with his hiring plans in MA because they're doing really well as he's outlined. And we've got to be thoughtful about what we're doing with our technology spend. Projects that we could postpone or dial back. I think we've largely done that. We're taking another pass through that, but again, there are certain things that we need to do around here and it gets harder with the second half. Again, we've had cost conditions in the first quarter. We view that as cyclical. We have better coverage proportionately and structured finance which has been hit hard in the first quarter and we're waiting to see what happens for the rest of the year. So, we think we're being prudent and incentive compensation is what we're going to do in order to keep the margin from being hit.","Now, we've move the margin guidance down from about 42% to about 41%. So, we are holding the margin for the most part down 100 bps perhaps in the guidance but the first hit goes to incentive compensation and we would like the shareholders to note that it is our intention to hold the margin at about 41% which is still pretty healthy. We hope that helps in terms of your questions, Tim. If I missed anything, let me know.","Tim McHugh","No. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we've got a Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Hey. So, the question is to the extent some of this market headwinds are impacting your customers and particularly the sell side that capital markets groups. Does that potentially post some sort of threat to your RD&A revenues or are those most in a buy side and pretty sticky?","Raymond McDaniel","We'll have Mark Almeida talk to that, Patrick.","Mark Almeida","Patrick, we have not historically seen very much correlation between head count cut backs on the sell side and the RD&A revenue and in fact, arguably as they cut back on head count, be it on the sell side or on the buy side, those organizations become more dependent on people like us as providers of information and analytical support. Where we saw a real impact on the business is when you're in a very, very, very bad environment like what we saw in 2009. But in this kind of an environment, we have not historically seen that as a headwind for RD&A and maybe even a benefit to RD&A.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And it appears that there are no other questions at this time, I will turn the call back over to Mr. McDaniel for any additional or closing remarks.","Raymond McDaniel","Okay. I just want to thank everyone for joining the call today and we look forward to speaking with you again in July. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes Moody's first quarter earnings call.

At this time, I would like to inform you that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the conference over to Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Salli Schwartz","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on this teleconference to discuss Moody's third quarter results for 2013. I am Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the third quarter of 2013. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.","Ray McDaniel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Moody's Corporation, will lead this morning's conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer of Moody's Corporation.","Before we begin, I call your attention to the Safe Harbor language, which can be found toward the end of our earnings release.

McDaniel","Thanks, Salli. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's third quarter 2013 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. Although we have been providing regulatory updates each quarter, at this time, we have no material changes to report. Therefore, after Linda's comments, I will finish by noting our outlook for the remainder of 2013. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to respond to your questions.","Third quarter revenue of $706 million increased 2% over the third quarter of 2012. We're pleased to have achieved growth despite volatile market conditions and challenging comparisons to the prior year period, which, at the time, was a record quarter. Operating expenses for the third quarter were $414 million, a 1% decline from the third quarter of 2012. Operating income for the third quarter was $292 million, an 8% increase from the prior year period.","Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income less depreciation and amortization, was $315 million, up 7% from the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share of $0.83 increased 2% from the third quarter of 2012 GAAP EPS of $0.81, and 11% from non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 in the prior year period, which excludes the $0.06 per share legacy tax benefit. As we're approaching the end of the year, we have refined our 2013 EPS guidance to $3.51 to $3.57.","Turning to year-to-date performance. Revenue for the first 9 months of 2013 was $2.2 billion, an 11% increase from the first 9 months of 2012. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $1.5 billion for the first 9 months of 2013, an increase of 12% from a year ago. Moody's Analytics revenue of $657 million was 8% higher than the prior year period.","Operating expenses for the first 9 months of 2013 were $1.3 billion, up 10% from 2012. Operating income of $923 million increased 13% from $817 million in 2012. Adjusted operating income was $993 million, a 12% increase from the prior year period. Operating expenses, operating margin and adjusted operating margin for the first 9 months all include our first quarter litigation settlement charge.","Diluted earnings per share of $2.66 for the first 9 months of 2013, which includes the litigation settlement charge of $0.14, increased 14% from $2.34 in the first 9 months of 2012. Excluding the litigation settlement charge in the first quarter of 2013 and the legacy tax benefit in the third quarter of 2012, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.80 for the first 9 months of 2013 grew 23% from $2.28 for the same period in 2012.","I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda S. Huber","Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the quarter increased 2% to $706 million. Foreign currency translation for the quarter was negligible.","U.S. third quarter revenue increased 3% to $391 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 1% to $315 million and represented 45% of Moody's total revenue for the quarter. Relationship revenue grew 9% to $376 million and represented 53% of total revenue, up from 50% in the prior year period.","Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $478 million, up 1% from the prior year period. U.S. MIS revenue of $290 million was flat to the prior year period. MIS revenue generated outside the U.S. of $188 million increased 2% and represented 39% of total ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenues was negligible.","Moving now to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue in the third quarter increased 6% from the year-ago period to $233 million. In the U.S., increased revenue from bank loan ratings and monitoring fees was offset by declines in revenue from investment grade and high yield bond ratings, resulting in flat revenue year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue was up 18%, driven by high yield and bank loan ratings in EMEA, offset by declines in investment grade.","Second, global structured finance revenue for the third quarter was $84 million, a decline of 10% from the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 3% year-over-year, primarily due to commercial real estate issuance. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue was down 27% against the prior year period, primarily reflecting weaker issuance volumes across the regions outside the U.S.","Third, global financial institutions revenue of $79 million decreased 5% from the same quarter of 2012. U.S. and non-U.S. revenue declined 3% and 6%, respectively, primarily from the decline in activity by funds and smaller banking institutions.","Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue rose 7% year-over-year to $83 million. U.S. and non-U.S. revenue were up 1% and 20%, respectively, from the prior year period, primarily due to gains in infrastructure finance globally, largely offset in the U.S. by the impact of lower public finance issuance.","Turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for Moody's Analytics of $227 million was up 6% from the third quarter of 2012. 100% of the revenue growth in MA was organic as we've not made any recent acquisitions. U.S. revenue grew by 14% year-over-year to $101 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $127 million was flat and represented 56% of total Moody's Analytics revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MA revenue was negligible.","And moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research, data and analytics, or RD&A, revenue of $134 million increased 8% from the prior year period and represented 59% of total MA revenue. Our customer retention rate remains strong in the mid-90s percent range, and we continue to see solid demand for MA's research offerings. RD&A U.S. revenue was up 10% and non-U.S. revenue was up 5% as compared to the third quarter of 2012.","Second, global enterprise risk solutions, or ERS, revenue of $64 million grew 1% against a strong prior year period. ERS revenue was up 26% in the U.S., while non-U.S. revenue declined 9% against the same period last year. As we have previously noted, ERS revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility due to the variable nature of project timing and completion. It is important to note that on a trailing 12-month basis, revenue and sales for ERS have increased 15% and 20%, respectively.","Third, global professional services revenue grew 10% to $29 million, reflecting solid growth in revenue from Copal Partners, partially offset by softness in the training and certification business. U.S. and non-U.S. revenue increased 21% and 6%, respectively, year-over-year.","Finally, looking at MA's revenue on a subscription basis, which includes RD&A plus subscription products within ERS, was up 8% for the third quarter of 2013.","Turning now to expenses for the corporation. Moody's third quarter expenses declined 1% to $414 million compared to the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to lower incentive compensation, partially offset by increased headcount and higher technology expenses. The translation of foreign currency had a negative impact of 1% on operating expenses for the quarter.","Moody's reported operating margin for the quarter was 41.3%, up from 39.2% in the third quarter of 2012, an expansion of 210 basis points. Adjusted operating margin was 44.6% for the quarter, up from 42.7% for the same period last year, an expansion of 190 basis points over last year. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.1% compared with 29.5% for the prior year period.","Next, I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter of 2013, Moody's repurchased 6.2 million shares at a total cost of $397 million and issued 855,000 shares under employee stock-based compensation plan. Outstanding shares as of September 30, 2013, totaled 215.1 million, down 3% from the year earlier. At the end of the third quarter, Moody's had $930 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. Year-to-date, Moody's has repurchased 12.2 million shares at a total cost of $748 million or an average price per share of $61.37.","As of September 30, Moody's had $2.1 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2013 were $2 billion, an increase of $504 million from a year earlier, primarily reflecting Moody's August 2013 bond offering of $500 million of senior unsecured notes, from which we now incur approximately $6 million of incremental interest expense per quarter.","Cash holdings outside of -- maintained outside of the U.S. at the end of the third quarter were $1.2 billion or approximately 58% of total cash holdings. Free cash flow of $623 million for the first 9 months of 2013 increased $162 million or 35% from a year ago.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Thank you, Linda. I'll now discuss our full year guidance for 2013 and then make some closing remarks.","Moody's outlook for 2013 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability, business investment spending, mergers and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. There's an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ, Moody's results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates.","As I mentioned earlier, we are -- as we're approaching the end of the year, we have refined our 2013 EPS guidance to a range of $3.51 to $3.57. For Moody's overall, the company still expects full year 2013 revenue to grow in the high-single-digit percent range. Full year 2013 operating expenses are still projected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Full year 2013 operating margin is still projected to be 41% to 42%, and adjusted operating margin for the year is still expected to be 44% to 45%. Guidance ranges for operating expenses, operating margin and adjusted operating margin all include the first quarter 2013 litigation settlement charge. The effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 31%.","Full year 2013 total share repurchases are still expected to be approximately $1 billion, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately $50 million. We still expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is now expected to be $5 million to $10 million. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $850 million.","We have modified certain components of 2013 guidance to reflect the company's current view of business conditions. For the global MIS business, revenue for full year 2013 is still expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. U.S. MIS revenue is still expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range, while non-U.S. MIS revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the mid-teens percent range. Revenue from structured finance is still expected to decrease in the low-single-digit percent range, while revenue from financial institutions is still expected to grow in the low-single-digit percent range. Public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range.","For MA, full year 2013 revenue is still expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is still expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. Non-U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Revenue from research, data and analytics is still projected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range, while revenue for enterprise risk solutions is now also expected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range. Professional services revenue is now expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range.","In closing, I would like to point out a few additional positive developments at Moody's. Moody's Investors Service was once again voted the Best Credit-Rating Agency in a 2013 poll of U.S. fixed income investors conducted by the well-known publisher Institutional Investor. MIS was also was also named Asia's Most Influential Rating Agency in a similar poll conducted by the publisher FinanceAsia. Additionally, Moody's Analytics ranked first in economic capital calculation management and second in regulatory capital calculation management in the 2013 Asia Risk Technology awards. I appreciate the market's recognition of our efforts, and I applaud the accomplishments of both the MIS and MA businesses.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Joining us for the question-and-answer session are Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investor Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We'd be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just maybe starting with the outlook a little bit here. I mean, obviously, you have pretty tight guidance, but that, obviously, gives us a little bit to work with here. But talk a little bit more of what's going on in the ratings business. I mean, we had a very slow October start. We had like, obviously, some debt ceiling issues and government shutdown. So maybe you can talk a little bit about what you're hearing when you talk to desks. Is there pent-up demand that's coming back? Obviously, the 10-year has moved a lot. So maybe a little bit more than you usually discuss given what's been going on in October.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Sure. I'll offer some introductory comments and then my colleagues may wish to add some color. As you described, we had a period in early October where there was pretty significant disruption associated with the debt ceiling and budget negotiations that were going on in Washington. So we did not see a lot of activity here in the U.S. That has more recently shifted. We have seen strong bond issuance and good pipelines building. Investment-grade issuance here in the U.S. in particular has been strong. I'd note that in Europe, in the third quarter and into the fourth, the bank loan market and high yield markets were strong. And so the -- some of the disruption that we saw in the U.S. has not had a significant impact on the European side. That being said, some of the issues that we've seen in structured finance in Europe in terms of very low volumes continue. And we don't really expect a big jump in that in the fourth quarter. Let me see if Linda has any other comment she'd like to add to this.","Linda S. Huber","Yes, Alex. First, looking at investment-grade issuance. A lot of the points that you made were right on. This week, we heard issuance expected at $25 billion. And for Q4, projections are around $175 billion, but they seem to be moving upward a bit. As you said, the 10-year has been through 2.5%. Today, it's bouncing around that level. So it's looking like the full year projections for investment grade will be about flat to 2012 to possibly up 5%. There is a piece in The Wall Street Journal today talking about low rates bring bond bonanza. So we'll see about that. The state of the market is good. The pipelines are good. Investors and issuers, I'm told, are relatively calm. And to the recent unexpected drop in rates provided issuers with a good opportunistic window. Headwinds and tailwinds, we continue to deal with the issue of the debt ceiling, as you had mentioned, which has been pushed out. But that also results in there being less clarity on what the Fed will do regarding tapering. We spoke to a lot of sources, both in the firm and outside the firm. It looks like the median view right now is that tapering won't begin until March of next year, although there is some dispersion around when that will happen. Tailwinds include the rally in rates and a lot of discussions right now on opportunistic refinancings and some pickups in the M&A rate. So again, pipeline looks pretty good. For high yield, we're still seeing high yield through 6%, below 6%, which is good. October projections of $25 billion. Quarter projections of $60 billion. And looks like last year will be up slightly -- this year will be up slightly from last year, which was about $350 billion in issuance. Market fundamentals are described as strong and expectation is that rates will be lower for longer than expected. Leveraged loans are really the star of the show. For October, $20 billion to date. October projection of $30 billion and quarterly projection of $70 billion. What's really interesting is the full year projection is $600 billion for leveraged loans, which is fully twice, 200% of what it was last year. The market's been strong all year. And it looks like things are continuing on that front. So all in all, pretty good pipeline, rates breaking unexpectedly lower, and we'll have to see what happens from here. And I'll ask if anyone else had any further comments on that.","Raymond W. McDaniel","I think that's it.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, that's pretty thorough. But you just mentioned in terms of the uncertainty being out there, when I think about your business in particular from the margin perspective, Linda, maybe you can talk a little bit more about where we are in terms of, what you've accrued for the year? How that's been running relative to expectations? I think we've had prior years where the fourth quarter has been really strong and then that certainly has been impacting comps. So where are we right now? And like, kind of what's the environment? A maybe like the up a couple of percent, down a couple of percent and how that would be impacting the margin, if you know what I'm trying to get at.","Linda S. Huber","Yes, I do. You've got many questions in there. So let me try to -- I think I just want to start it out with incentive compensation first. And good to note that, yes, the margin has expanded 210 basis points third quarter this year over last year, which is, we think, pretty phenomenal progress. I think your point is right, Alex. Much of this is coming from the difference in incentive compensation. 2012 was a very strong year, and the third quarter, as Ray explained, was a record quarter at that time. For the third quarter of last year, we had to put up about $130 million of incentive compensation and profit-sharing by that point. This year, unfortunately, we have no profit-sharing to date, and we've put up about $100 million in incentive compensation for this year. So that number is down by 22%. At the pace at which we're running and given the expectations we've just outlined, it does not appear that we will have profit-sharing for this year. And last year, that was about $12 million. So we have previously guided that incentive compensation should be about flattish over the course of this year. We had guided to around $35 million a quarter, and we still think that makes sense. So we are seeing the difference in incentive compensation and profit-sharing really driving this, and that is a considerable difference versus last year.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's great. Just if I can squeeze in one last one, a very brief one. On the fixed side, that surprised me a little bit. And I think you spoke to it a little bit from the funds and I think something in Europe. But we usually look at this as a very stable kind of recurring business, so any shift there? Was this kind of like an unusual occurrence this quarter? Or how should we be thinking about that business in particular? That's it for me.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Now the banking was soft compared to the third quarter of last year, but it was not because of a shift this year. It was rather that last year, we had an usual amount of activity from smaller regional banks, especially in Europe, following some supportive comments that had come out of the ECB in July of last year. So there was more transaction revenue in Q3 of 2012 than we would normally associate with the FIG business.","Operator","We'll move next to William Bird [ph] with FBR.","Unknown Analyst","Ray, I was wondering if you could talk about just how you think about putting cash to work for greater buybacks. And then Linda, you touched on ERS lumpiness. Were the factors that depressed growth, were those temporary factors?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, with respect to use of cash, the first priority is investment back into what we believe will be profitable opportunities, whether it's organically in the existing businesses or through acquisitions that we think are strategically aligned with the direction of the business. As you know, we are disciplined about M&A activity. And so we have periods where we are not active. We have not acquired anything in over 7 quarters now. So that allows us to return capital to shareholders. We have guided to $1 billion in share repurchase for this year. We believe that we are on target to do that. And we have also increased our dividend. And we intend to maintain that balance, as I think Linda has discussed before.","Linda S. Huber","Yes, Bill. As we said on the call, 12.2 million shares bought in so far this year at an average price of $61.37. We're pretty happy about that, and we will continue on our pace here. Regarding ERS, and I'll invite Mark Almeida to comment afterward. I think the comparison might have been viewed as light because last year's third quarter was unusually strong for ERS. And again, we say it on every call, this is a lumpy business. We really mean that. We have variability from quarter to quarter. I did note, and I'm sure Mark may point to it again, that the trailing 12-month numbers are, in fact, are very strong. And so I think that pretty much sets it out, but I'm sure Mark may have some more color.","Mark E. Almeida","Yes, that's exactly right, Linda. The whole issue here is one of the timing of project completion and associated revenue recognition. We have pretty good visibility into what projects are coming toward completion and will trigger revenue recognition events. And as she said, there's a lot of lumpiness associated with that. But you're quite right, sales growth is very strong. Trailing 12-month sales are up 20%, running well ahead of revenue growth. So I think we're setting ourselves up for very healthy revenue growth in ERS over the longer term, but we are going to have this kind of variability over shorter periods.","Operator","We'll move next to Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So Ray, you guys have grown -- the MIS business has grown considerably faster than some of your competitors for the last couple of years. And I'm just noticing in the current quarter, you're growing a little bit slower. Anything we should read into that from a market share perspective?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, I guess the first thing I would direct you to rather than the year-on-year is the sequential second quarter to third quarter. And there you see that for the ratings businesses, the move in revenue between Moody's and our principal competitor is identical. So really, what we're looking at is the fact that we had a very strong Q3 of 2012, and we were working off of a number in 2012 that had produced higher growth than our competitors.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Fair enough. Second, you talked at the Investor Day very confidently about the prospect for roughly 10% long-term growth. The comp in '14, obviously, is pretty challenging. So do you have any preliminary thoughts on how we should think about how '14 might play out?","Raymond W. McDaniel","No. I think we're going to wait and talk about 2014 later in the year. We, obviously, are paying attention to the macroeconomic conditions, looking for self-sustaining growth here in the U.S., looking at developments in Washington and whether longer-term solutions can be put in place so that we don't have to revisit what we were looking at in early October every 3 months for 2014. And I would hope and expect to be able to comment on that more definitively as we get to the new year.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That might imply though that the -- well, obviously, the comp is tougher in the first half of the year and the political stuff will be an overhang in the first half. So I guess the implication might be that first half a little more challenging than second half?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, it -- well, the comps are challenging -- will be challenging in the first half of 2014. But again, there are a lot of moving parts. We've seen some more positive news coming out of Europe more recently. The movement in rates in the U.S. has been favorable, and the discussion about when the taper begins has been pushed out by economists and commentators. So again, I think it would be premature for me to try and make predictions on this and provide a 2014 outlook, but that's what we have our eyes on.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Sure, great. And then last thing, the -- anything new you can talk about in terms of the legal environment?","Raymond W. McDaniel","No. There have not been a lot of developments in the litigation environment. The cases that we are still dealing with, none of those are set for trial, and we are continuing the process of seeking dismissals. And we will update you, of course, when there is any news.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two questions. Linda, just a clarification. Did you say that based on the sources you cited on the outlook for issuance in the fourth quarter, you were looking for $175 billion of investment grade, and then that would be flattish? Is that what you said?","Linda S. Huber","I did say $175 billion. I don't have '12 in front of me. I think that, that may actually be a little bit lower than last year, but I did say that -- the comments on that number had sort of been moving a little bit more to the upside. So I think probably everybody should recheck this next week when companies come out of blackout and look up and see that the 10-year is still in a very attractive place, around 2.5%.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, no doubt. Okay. And then, Ray, you touched on the sequential drop in the ratings Q3 over Q2. Now in most years, not every year, you have a fairly strong sequential pickup in the fourth quarter, which I assume is somewhat tied to kind of the year end balance sheet activity at companies, particularly in the structured market. Do you sense that normal seasonality will occur again, notwithstanding tough comps or not? Or is the seasonality theory wrong?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, I don't think it's wrong, but we have seen some conditions that caused the seasonal patterns that we might naturally expect to see to not show up in some recent quarters. Now the third quarter did behave more like we would expect seasonally. Whereas last year, our third quarter was actually our second strongest quarter, and that is quite unusual. The -- what I think we're anticipating for the fourth quarter though is some offsetting conditions. We have rates back down. That's a positive. We see good pipelines in the corporate area. That's, obviously, a positive. On the other hand, with rates having been low throughout this year, some issuers that might have normally issued in the fourth quarter are going to have pulled their issuance forward into the earlier quarters this year. So we, as you can tell from our guidance, we are not expecting a big increase in revenues for the remainder of the year on a year-on-year comparison basis. But things don't look bad either. So it's -- the commentary is a set of offsetting conditions.","Operator","We'll move next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Let me -- I want to ask you 2 questions on -- just on the cost side. I mean, clearly, on the -- in MIS at least in the expense side, you guys seem to have done a pretty good job of controlling that. I was wondering if there's anything specific this quarter, maybe why it was down nicely year-over-year. And looking forward, how should we think about that run rate?","Linda S. Huber","Sure, Manav, it's Linda. I think I covered the main driver on what was going on with cost. In fact, incentive compensation and profit-sharing being lower and nonexistent, respectively, was very helpful to the expense rate this year. Again, we base our bonus programs off of the midpoint of our outlook. And if we're not doing great, the bonuses fund at a lower level. And that's what we're seeing right now. We did have a bit of an offset based on new hires that we've had over the past year and a little bit of merit increase in salaries. But all told, we were very happy with the expense control. Now last year, because of the strong pop-up in incentive compensation, which was $60 million in the fourth quarter, that would probably look a little bit heavy for this year given that I said that we're thinking we're going to run a bit more evenly quarter-over-quarter on bonuses, more toward $35 million. But it remains to be seen. Again, if things break to the upside, the number could be a little bit heavier. So hopefully, that will help you. But expenses look like they're still going to be well under control for the fourth quarter.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So if you were to take out sort of the incentive comp, the variable component of that, over the long term, how should we think about just how the expense moves either with issuance activity or without it?","Linda S. Huber","Let me try to answer the question in a different way. We had said back in the first quarter call that we would have a $50 million expense ramp over the course of the year, and we think that's about right. We started at 395 in the first quarter, and it will be somewhere around that $50 million for the year. Expenses generally do tend to trend up over the course of the year, excluding the compensation line, Manav. But again, the comp line will not be -- we don't believe at this moment looking like it did in last year's fourth quarter. So I think that's about as much as we need to spell out there.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then just the reason for the change in the compliance -- incremental compliance expense, is that just pushing things out in '14 or it just came in lighter than expected?","Raymond W. McDaniel","It came in a bit lighter than expected. We still will have, I believe, some incremental compliance cost in 2014. But as you can see, the incremental growth is trending down as we expected it would. And I think that's good news for the longer run.","Operator","We'll move next to Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just want to ask for an update on the structured products area. You had said at the Investor Day, I believe, you thought '14 would kind of be a bottom for that market but -- and also, obviously, sounds like Q4 -- or Q3 was a tough quarter particularly in Europe there. I know you probably knew most of those results at the Investor Day. But I guess can you contrast those to kind of what you saw in Q3 and why you think it's still going to bottom, kind of going pretty soon here?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Let me ask Michel to comment on this, if he will, in particular on what they're seeing in Europe.","Michel A. Madelain","Yes, I think we clearly have a divide between the U.S. and Europe here. We're seeing actually improving conditions in the U.S., both in terms of volumes and market position. Europe is a different story. We have a sharp contraction of volume across-the-board. And we don't expect that to resume next quarter. And as we said at Investor Day, I think next year is going to be another year, a challenging year for that market. And the reason is really around -- it's linked to the monetary conditions that prevail and the overall economic environment in Europe and the lack of effectiveness of sort of finance products there. Both are issues for investors. So that's here to stay through '14.","Raymond W. McDaniel","And yes, I'll just add that policymakers in Europe have started to offer more positive commentary about restarting the securitization market. But at the same time, they are providing significant liquidity to the banking system. And so for the near term, we believe that, that liquidity provision and the availability of inexpensive capital is going to keep the longer-term market from growing quickly.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just on the bank loans and, I mean, it's obviously a strong area for you, as well as S&P right now. What -- I guess can you talk about how much of that's a structural shift and how much you still see room for a structural shift in terms of more deeply penetrating that, such that you can continue to see kind of above average growth from that product area?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, I think it's both structural and cyclical. The structural component is that the rated bank loan market is associated with banks wanting to have the ability to transfer loans off their balance sheet. And as they deleverage, that remains a priority. The cyclical component would be, I think, more appetite from the investor community for floating rate paper in anticipation of a rising rate environment. The good thing here, assuming that we don't have any shocks in terms of large, unexpected movements in interest rates, is that the bank loan market and the speculative grade bond market somewhat offset each other. Now we happen to be in a period of good activity for both. But if we see more appetite or better financing conditions for spec grade companies in the bond market, I would expect they would shift out of their banking relationships for additional capital raising.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess just one follow-up. I mean, can you -- do you have any rough sense of how much you would attribute to cyclical versus the more structural growth for the bank loan area?","Raymond W. McDaniel","No. I mean, I don't have educated answer for you on that. So it would be just my speculation, and I'd rather not fall for that.","Operator","We'll move next to Craig Huber with Huber Research.","Craig Huber","Just to be clear, your incentive compensation, pure incentive comp this quarter, Linda, what was it? I think you said it was $59 million to $60 million a year ago?","Linda S. Huber","Yes, the pure incentive compensation for third quarter of 2013 was $35 million. And last year, it topped $60 million. Profit-sharing is carried in a separate line. And this year, we didn't have any. We have not had any profit-sharing year-to-date. And last year, profit-sharing was about $8 million, Craig.","Craig Huber","Okay. And then like I had said [ph] people would like to ask you, Linda, can you break out the revenues a little bit finer here for your 4 areas within structured finance and corporate finance, et cetera?","Linda S. Huber","Sure. You went out of order for us, Craig. We had flipped to that page already. Hang on just a second. Okay. So starting with corporate finance, investment grade was 14% of total revenues for the third quarter. Again, for all of global corporate finance, the number was $233 million. So again, 14% was investment grade. 20% was speculative grade. Bank loans was 24%, which is up from 16% last year. So you see the significant shift over to the bank loans line. And other was 42% versus 35% last year. Going on to the other areas for structured. Total global structured, $83.5 million. 25% of that was ABS. 20% of that was RMBS. Commercial real estate was 31%, notably up from 25% last year. So that was the line that was running heavier. And derivative, about flat at 24% of that line. Going on to FIG. Total FIG was about $79 million. And 66% of that was bank issuance. 30% was insurance issuance, which was up from 26% last year, so some increase in the insurance revenue. Managed investments was 4%. So that's FIG. And moving onto PPIF, public finance and sovereigns was 44% of the total of about $83 million for this line. Municipal structured deals were 5% of revenue for this year. And project and infrastructure saw the big increase at 51% of that $83 million. So again, the big shift there was to project and infra. And we note that municipal issuance actually comes in the first line, which is the PFG and sovereigns line. So just make sure that everybody has that reflected accurately. And I think, Craig, that does it.","Craig Huber","It sure does. Another follow-up question, if I could. Within your public finance, project infrastructure area, can you just talk a little bit further about what you're seeing there? And obviously, you've lowered your guidance here for the year. But what you're seeing there and what your outlook is? What were the puts and takes, please?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, the project and infrastructure finance had a good quarter in the third quarter, and that was true both in the U.S. and in Europe. And to the extent that what we've seen in that area is refinancing, we would expect that a lot of that has been completed. And so what we're looking for is new project, new infrastructure activity to carry the growth in that line. And there's a degree of uncertainty around how quickly that will reach the market. So that's informing our current view.","Linda S. Huber","Yes, to follow-up a little bit, Craig, we had talked about disintermediation being important. And the actual dollar numbers for project and infra, it was $34 million last year, and it's $42 million this year. So I think that increase speaks to disintermediation as some of the banks, particularly European banks, step back from infrastructure projects, particularly in Latin America. And we're seeing more of those deals come to the capital markets. Also, we've had a little bit of a stall in muni issuance probably brought about by the federal conditions. So that has come off a little bit. Last year, we saw $38 million. This year, about $36 million. So usually, that's just a matter of timing. But again, the uncertainty in the third quarter made a lot of things a little bit challenging and certainty made forecasting more challenging. So I think that would cover the puts and takes in PPIF.","Craig Huber","And also Ray or Linda, when you think about the corporate finance market here and all the refinancings that certainly have happened here at the low rates here the last 2 to 3 years. What is your bullish outlook, if you have one on this, as you'd think out for corporate finance. Why it should be sustained at even a higher level next year and perhaps the year afterwards in terms of debt issuance, please?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, Craig, this is the \"it depends\" answer. And as we look at current activity, we still see the refinancing component of issuance running 70%-plus of total issuance in terms of reasons cited in offering documentation. Contrast that with, as we have done previously, with, say, the late '90s and the rising interest rate environment of the late '90s, when less than half of issuance was associated with refinancing activity. So if we have economic confidence, business confidence so that the other elements of issuance, M&A activity, capital expenditure, share repurchase, et cetera, become more prominent as they were in the previous rising rate environment of '98, '99, we're in good shape. If that doesn't happen, then we will be on a soft patch for corporate issuance, I would think.","Linda S. Huber","Craig, it's Linda. Also for the fourth quarter, more immediately, we could, of course, see pull forward from 2014 issuance into the fourth quarter of this year. But we're not sure. And as I had said in my earlier comments, the center point right now in terms of what we've heard is that tapering begins in March. But we do note that tapering is perpetually 6 months away from the present point. So we'll see how that plays out. And the bull case would be, that the 10-year stays around 2.5%, doesn't go back up to 3%, and that provides pretty attractive issuance environment for us. The bear case would be, that we go through the whole thing again with the debt ceiling in February. And that is challenging as issuers might step away. So we can really see it go either way. And it sort of depends on how everything breaks. And we'll have more to say about this when we do guidance for 2014.","Operator","We'll move next to Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just maybe a pair of questions for Mark on the color of demand for how demand is trending for the Analytics franchises. I guess, on enterprise risk solutions, we talked about the lumpiness, so less of a focus on the fourth quarter and more just looking out on a rolling 12-month basis, how are you looking at the momentum for that business into next year? Maybe help us understand what products or categories of solutions are seeing the strongest demand trends versus some that maybe are growing a little bit less than the overall average?","Mark E. Almeida","Yes, Andre, demand for ERS is very strong. As we said at Investor Day, frankly, demand is not the problem in this business. We're seeing plenty of demand, particularly heating up in the U.S. related to banks that have to engage in these stress testing exercises. The bank regulators have extended stress testing requirements beyond the largest banks in the country and down to the next tier. And that's driving a tremendous amount of demand for exactly the kinds of things that we offer in MA. So it's been -- demand's been very, very good for us. And we anticipate that continuing well into next year.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I know you didn't formally -- there's no formal guidance, but I guess when we look back at this point next year, should we assume a similar trailing 12-month rate or is it too early to say?","Mark E. Almeida","It's certainly too early to say, but that's how we're managing the business. We see very healthy demand. We're very actively engaged. We're talking to banks all over the country and, of course, overseas as well. So I'd be surprised if we see a shift in the other direction.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Similarly on the RD&A business, is there any color you can provide below just the top line on what solutions are probably selling with a little bit stronger growth versus some that are maybe trending a little bit below?","Mark E. Almeida","Well, the strongest area in RD&A has been the demand for the rating agency content. That continues to be very, very strong. We've sustained very good growth in RD&A at getting up to high-single digits, which we think is very good for that business given the scale of it and our very strong penetration, particularly in developed markets. So that continues to perform quite well, and we're very happy with that business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Edward Atorino with Benchmark.","Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Interest expense jumped up, but your net debt didn't jump up. Can you sort of -- I hate to say the word explain, but explain the jump in interest. And is this now the run rate going forward? And second, on the bank loan ratings or whatever they are called. Are the margins on that the same as the traditional issuance? And that just seems to be a market that's exploded. And is this a sort of a -- is this a sustainable level? Or is it going to go away if something changes? Not go away, but go back to normal.","Linda S. Huber","Ed, it's Linda. Let me take the question on interest expense first and then we'll talk a little bit more about bank loans. As I said in the script, we did do a $500 million bond deal. And we did that in early August. So we carried the expense, extra interest expense, which is $6 million a quarter. We have the pro rata of that expense for the quarter. So the interest expense number is, if you look at the press release, it's about $24 million. And that's up about 4.5% from last year. And that just reflects that new bond deal that we have, so that we have plenty of liquidity here in the U.S. And of course, we hold that in cash. So that's what's going on there. But look for $6 million per quarter going forward.","Raymond W. McDaniel","And with respect to the margins and the bank loan rating business, they are roughly similar to what we would see in the bond area. It is, again, influenced by whether the companies are companies that we might already have a relationship with or not or whether they are new mandates. Certainly, we think the bank loan market is a good growth market for us going forward. That's true both in the U.S. and in Europe. But it has benefited, as I mentioned earlier, both from some structural and some cyclical conditions. So I would not put forward that it can continue to grow at the pace that it's currently growing at.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions at this time.

The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.","Ray McDaniel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Moody\u2019s Corporation, will lead this morning\u2019s conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer of Moody\u2019s Corporation.","Before we begin, I call your attention to the Safe Harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings press release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the Act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2013 and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website. These, together with the Safe Harbor statements, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements.","I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. I'll now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel.","Ray McDaniel","Thank you, Salli. Good morning, and thank you everyone for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's second quarter 2014 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. We have no legal and regulatory update to report therefore I will then conclude our comments with our outlook for 2014. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","Second quarter revenue of $874 million increased 16% over the second quarter of 2013, both Moody's Investor Service and Moody's Analytics delivered mid-teen percent revenue growth. Operating expenses for the second quarter were $462 million, a 14% increase from the second quarter of 2013. Operating income for the second quarter was $412 million, a 17% increase from the prior year period.","Adjusted operating income defined as operating income less depreciation and amortization was $434 million, up 16% from the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share of $1.48 for the second quarter increased 48% from $1 in the second quarter of 2013 and included a $103 million non-cash pre-tax gain resulting from Moody\u2019s acquisition of a controlling interest in ICRA Limited, a leading Indian credit rating agency.","On June 26, 2014, Moody\u2019s increased its stake ICRA from 28.5% to more than 50%. U.S. GAAP requires a re-measurement to fair value of non-controlling shares when a controlling interest is obtained. As a result of the transaction, Moody\u2019s recorded a gain of $0.36 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.12 which excludes the ICRA gain increased 12% from $1 in the prior year period.","Turning to year-to-date performance, revenue for the first six months of 2014 was $1.6 billion, a 10% increase from the first six months of 2013. Revenue of Moody\u2019s investor service was $1.1 billion for the first six months of 2014, an increase of 8% from a year ago. Moody\u2019s analytics revenue for the first half of 2014 of $493 million was 15% higher than the prior year period.","Operating expenses for the first six months of 2014 were $896 million, up 5% from 2013. Operating income of $745 million increased 18% from $631 million in 2013. Adjusted operating income was $790 million, a 17% increase from the prior year period. First half 2013 operating expenses, operating margin and adjusted operating margin all include a first quarter litigation settlement charge.","Diluted earnings per share of $2.47 for the first six months of 2014 which included $0.36 related to the ICRA gain increased 35% from the prior year period which included a litigation settlement charge of $0.14. Excluding the 2014 ICRA gain and the 2013 litigation settlement charge, diluted earnings per share of $2.11 for the first six months of 2014 -- $2.11 for the first six months of 2013 grew 7% year-over-year.","I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda Huber","Thanks Ray. I\u2019ll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody\u2019s total revenue for the quarter increased 16% to $874 million. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted revenue by 2%. Second quarter U.S. revenue increased 13% to $461 million while revenue outside the U.S. grew 19% to $412 million and represented 47% of Moody\u2019s total revenue for the quarter. Global recurring revenue grew 12% to $412 million and represented 47% of total revenue, down from 49% in the prior year period.","Looking now at each of our businesses starting with Moody\u2019s Investor Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $622 million, up 16% from the prior year period. U.S. MIS revenue of $353 million increased 13% from the prior-year period. MIS revenue generated outside the U.S. of $269 million increased 20% and represented 43% of total ratings revenue. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted MIS revenue by 1%.","Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue in the second quarter increased 22% from the year ago period to $321 million, primarily reflecting strong rated bank loan and speculative-grade bond issuance in both the U.S. and Europe. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenue was up 20% and 24%, respectively.","Second, global structured finance revenue for the second quarter was $111 million, an increase of 14% from the prior-year period, primarily reflecting increased ratings of CLOs in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. and non-U.S. revenue increased 17% and 8% respectively against the prior year period.","Third global financial institutions revenue of $92 million increased 9% from the second quarter of 2013 despite an increase in the issuance activity from U.S. banks, U.S. revenue declined 4% year-over-year due to a shift in issuance mix.","Non-U.S. revenue increased 19% against the prior year period as a result of increased issuance from banks across all regions. Fourth, global public and infrastructure finance revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $98 million. U.S. revenue was down 2% primarily due to continued weakness in public finance issuance which was partially offset by increased in structure issuance.","Non-U.S. revenue increased 21% from the prior year period reflecting increased infrastructure revenue across all regions as well as higher sovereign and sub-sovereign revenue in EMEA.","And turning now to Moody\u2019s Analytics, global revenue from Moody\u2019s Analytics of $252 million was up 15% for the second quarter of 2013. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted EMEA revenue by 3%. U.S. revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $109 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $143 million increased by 16% from the prior year period, and represented 57% of total Moody\u2019s Analytics revenue. More than 65% of revenue growth in the quarter was organic with the remainder coming from acquisition.","Moving to the lines of business for MA, first, global research, data and analytics or RD&A. Revenue of $145 million increased 11% from the prior-year period driven by strong performance in credit research and content licensing. RD&A represented 57% of total MA revenue and our customer retention rate remained strong in the mid 90% range. RD&A\u2019s U.S. U.S. revenue was up 9% and non-U.S. revenue was up 13% as compared to the second quarter of 2013.","Second, global Enterprise Risk Solutions or ERS revenue of $67 million grew 12% against the prior year period, due to growth in subscription revenue and services revenue. ERS U.S. and non-U.S. revenue was up 13% and 11% respectively against the same period last year. As we\u2019ve noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. Trailing twelve months revenue and sales for ERS have increased 8% and 15% respectively.","Finally, global professional services grew 41% to $40 million, primarily reflecting the December 2013 acquisition of Amba Investment Services. U.S. and non-U.S. revenue increased 67% and 33% respectively year-over-year.","Turning now to expenses, Moody\u2019s second quarter expenses increased 14% to $462 million, compared to the second quarter of 2013. This increase was primarily due to higher compensation and real-estate expense attributable to increased headcount, increased incentive compensation and acquisition related costs. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted operating expenses by 1% for the quarter.","Moody\u2019s reported operating margin for the quarter was 47.1%, up 70 basis points from 46.4% in the second quarter of 2013. Adjusted operating margin was 49.7% for the quarter, up 20 basis points from 49.5% for the same period last year. Moody\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.1% compared with 32.2% for the prior-year period.","And now I\u2019ll provide an update on capital allocation. During the second quarter of 2014, Moody\u2019s repurchased 3.2 million shares at a total cost of $258 million or an average of $80.39 per share and issued 0.7 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans.","Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2014, were 211.2 million reflecting a 4% decline from a year earlier. As of June 30, 2014, Moody's had 1.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. At quarter end, Moody's had 2.1 billion of outstanding debt and 1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility.","Total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments at quarter end of $2 billion, an increase of $308 million from a year earlier. As of June 30, 2014, approximately 69% of our cash holdings were maintained outside the U.S. Free cash flow for the first half of 2014 of $419 million increased $68 million or 19% from the same period a year ago.","And finally on July 7, 2014, Moody's issued a total of $750 million of debt including $450 million of five year note with a coupon of 2.75% and 300 million of 30 year notes with a coupon of 5.25%. We intend to use the proceeds to redeem our senior unsecured notes during 2015, totaling $300 million as well as for general corporate purposes.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray.","Ray McDaniel","Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for 2014. Additional details on Moody's guidance are included in our second quarter 2014 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.","Moody's outlook for 2014 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates, corporate profitability, business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. There is an important degree of uncertainties surrounding these assumptions, and, if actual conditions differ, Moody's results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates.","The company now expects full year 2014 revenue to grow in the low-double-digit percent range. Full year 2014 operating expenses are now projected to increase in the high-single-digit percentage range. These expenses now include costs related to our acquisitions of a majority stake in ICRA and of WebEquity, as well as additional incentive compensations. We now expect operating expenses to ramp between $80 million and $90 million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of 2014.","Full year 2014 non-GAAP EPS guidance is in the range of $3.90 to $4. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance now includes costs related to our acquisition of the majority stake in ICRA and of WebEquity and additional incentive compensation and financing costs associated with our July 2014 bond offering.","Global MIS revenue for the full year 2014 is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range. Within the U.S. MIS revenue is now expected to increase in the mid single-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the low-teens percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Revenue from structured finance is now expected to grow approximately 10%, financial institutions revenue is now expected to grow in the low single-digit percent range.","With regard to the Moody\u2019s controlling stake in ICRA company will report ICRA\u2019s operating results within Moody\u2019s investor service on a three month lag beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014.","ICRA is expected to contribute approximately $12 million of revenue to MIS in the fourth quarter. For Moody\u2019s Analytics full year 2014 revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-teen percent range. Including the acquisition of WebEquity, revenue for enterprise risk solutions is now expected to grow in the mid-teens percent range. Professional services revenue, including Amba Investment Services, is now projected to grow approximately 40%.","This concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question-and-answer session are Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody\u2019s Investor Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody\u2019s Analytics. We\u2019ll be pleased to take any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We'll take our first question from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Tim McHugh - William Blair & Company","Yes, thanks. I guess just wanted to ask a little bit more about I guess the higher expenses you expect for this year. How much of that can you help us break that down a little bit in terms of added incentive comp versus I guess any drag from upfront expenses related to ICRA and I guess how much dilution from WebEquity? I guess I'm trying to understand what how much that's offsetting what was better than expected performance this quarter and the impact on the full year guidance?","Linda Huber","Sure Tim, it's Linda. Let's first look at second quarter expense increase versus last year. And for the second quarter, our expenses were $57 million higher than last year up, 14%. And I'll give you the reasons for why that is. The largest component of that is compensation increases and that was fell $42 million. Compensation for new hires over the course of the year was about $15 million merit and stock based compensation for the staff we have was about $12 million and the expenses related to Amba acquisition we did last year were about $8 million.","Non-comp was about $15 million and that included acquisition some other expenses of about $6.5 million and some occupancy changes of $4.1 million. As you may remember, we have leased additional -- two additional floors and a third coming on line in this building here. So that would be the reason for the higher expenses second quarter over second quarter.","And as we move to the end of the year, we had said expenses were going to ramp about $55 million. We\u2019re adding another 30ish to that, we said $80 million to $90 million expense ramp between the first quarter and the fourth quarter. The additions would be the cost of the acquisitions at about $20 million, we're thinking incentive comp to add about another $4 million, and expenses that we're spending in the second half rather than what we thought were going to come in the first half were about 6ish. So that adds about $30 million to the expense ramp in the second half.","Now just to be really clear, under GAAP, deal costs are expensed as they are incurred regardless of when or whether deals close. So as we look at deals and when we incur deal expenses, we expense those and we\u2019ve included those. And revenues come a little bit more slowly but that's U.S. GAAP. So we\u2019re looking at three months lag on revenues for ICRA which as we disclosed in our table and the press release, will give us about $12 million in the fourth quarter of this year for ICRA.","But also purchase accounting adds haircuts to revenue. So we are in the position of recognizing the expenses right away and the revenues a little bit later. Now on ICRA, we are taking a three months lag because if ICRA reports on Indian GAAP and we've also always reported ICRA's results on a three months lag. We have to convert those to U.S. GAAP and it takes a quarter to do that transition.","And so we will see the ICRA revenues coming on in the fourth quarter. But again, we closed the deal on June 26th, so you see the expenses and the web equity deals closed on July 17th. So you can kind of think through what the acquisition costs mean there. So generally, we\u2019re thinking it\u2019s about 5ish cents for the deal activity and about $0.04 for the financing that we did. Your call is to whether you want to think about that those our GAAP expenses, so whether you want to think about those in the run rate or not. So, I hope that thoroughly answers everything that you\u2019re interested in.","Tim McHugh - William Blair & Company","That\u2019s great, that\u2019s very helpful. I guess just one follow-up to make sure I understand it correctly. On ICRA, you\u2019re talking about you read away or have to recognize the transaction or kind of upfront expenses, but do you have to recognize the operating expense from ICRA right away or is that tied to when you start recognizing the revenue and that\u2019s delayed by three months as well?","Linda Huber","That\u2019s delayed by three months as well, exactly.","Ray McDaniel","What we were recognizing immediately were the transaction related costs.","Tim McHugh - William Blair & Company","Okay. And then guys, just on ERS, I think trailing 12 months sales activity was up 9% last quarter and so up 15% this quarter, so pretty healthy step up. I don\u2019t know if the comp got easier or I guess as you rolled forward a quarter or did you see a particular pick-up in sales activity that I should read into that?","Ray McDaniel","I\u2019ll let Mark Almeida address that.","Mark Almeida","We had a very strong quarter on sales this past quarter. And we had a number of very good transactions and we had one very, very large transaction as well. So it wasn\u2019t a question of an easy comp so much, it\u2019s just very strong results in the quarter.","Ray McDaniel","And just as we normally comment, we expect to see quarterly volatility and that\u2019s why as you have done, we encourage looking at the 12 month period.","Tim McHugh - William Blair & Company","Okay. And can you give any color on as a stress testing related type of work that you're winning with and I guess particularly you said there is one very large deal. I guess what would -- can you give us any more color on what type of project that is?","Ray McDaniel","Stress testing continues to be good for us and we're doing a lot of business there and we have a healthy pipeline. But just in the normal course business, we're having a lot of continued success. And the large transaction that we did really has nothing to do with stress testing, it's just a very big project that a particular customer is undertaking and they selected us to take the lead on that project.","Tim McHugh - William Blair & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott","Hi. With the change in the issuance business, has your expectations for the overall environment, particularly on the interest rate side changed at all? I know they\u2019ve dipped down recently. Do you expect them to be lower to exit this year or how should we think about the relationship there?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. I know Linda has some detail on this, but just as an introductory comment. Yes, rates have been lower than we were anticipating earlier in the year. We think they are probably going to remain lower than we had expected through the second half. But that there are number of factors relating to that including the flight-to-quality in respect of some of the geopolitical tensions that we're seeing.","So we're going to be paying close attention to what's happening, not just with benchmark rates but also spreads. And the good news is we continue to see low default rates and that's keeping spreads reasonably tight. Linda, I don't know if you wanted to add some commentary.","Linda Huber","Sure Joe, if you want to look at the U.S. issuance trends I will talk about investments grade bonds and then high yield bonds and average loans just very quickly. The second quarter obviously was very strong investment grade bond issuance and for the first half of the year in the U.S. again we are running about 600 billion of issuance which was up about 10% year-over-year.","For the full year expecting 950 million or 1 billion of investment grade issuance in the U.S. which will be about flat so June was very busy July slows down because of earnings blackouts and we think the technical backdrop remains positive, M&A activity is picking up and running at a pace that we haven\u2019t seen since 2007. And for corporate refinancing high coupon bonds remains very popular. So we expect that the pipeline will come back to strength in August and September. ","For high yields bonds, we are running about 200 billion in the U.S. which is about flat year-over-year and expecting little bit less than that in the back half of the year maybe 150 billion full year to be about 330 billion which is flat year-over-year.","A little bit about utility in June because the headlines, and we do see that as Ray said rates remain attractive the pipeline is about average at this point for high yield bolds. And in leverage loans about 270 billion for the first half of the year down 5%. For the full year expecting about 425 billion which is also down 5% year-over-year. Calendar is very active there and majority of that activity is related to M&A issuance and we have seen for the first time from outflows from loans funds but that\u2019s offset by very heavy issuance of collateralized loan obligations, and issuance for the first half there has been $67 billion compared to $46 billion for the same time last year.","And the pipeline continues to be as I said above average due to that LBO and M&A activity in leverage loan. So, bit of a mixed bag and the traditional sort of July earnings black out lag here, but rates remain pretty attractive and as Ray said default levels are low.","Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott","Got it, very helpful. And then just you went through a very slow and also helpful discussion of cost and expenses and how they are looking for the going forward. But are ICRA and WebEquity diluted margins in the short-term and do you expect to have them step up corporate average if that is so? I mean, I understand that the expenses versus the revenues are a little bit mix in those businesses, but I'm trying to get a feel of what exactly dilution is from them if any? And then how long you would take to get that can be average?","Linda Huber","The EPS impact for this year, yes equity is a little bit dilutive. You might recall that about $0.03 and WebEquity about $0.02 and again you might want to think about how you want to factor that in.","Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott","Okay. And just so, am I making the assumption that we're going to get them up to corporate average over a extended period of time?","Ray McDaniel","From a margin perspective, first of all WebEquity is a small business. It's a business we think is a nice fit, but it is small and it will not be margin dilutive to Moody's Analytics. ICRA while it is an attractive business does not have the same margin that Moody's Investor Service does. So there will be a modest drag from ICRA, but again it is a nicely profitable business.","Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott","Got it. Okay. Last question from me, obviously some news out regarding the regulatory environment for your new competitors, any update you can give on that or any thoughts that you think are appropriate. Thank you.","Ray McDaniel","","Not much to say all we know is what has been discussed in the public markets. So really nothing to add to what you would have already read.","Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott","Thanks.","Operator","","We'll go next to Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs","","Thank you good morning. Two quick questions, first how much of the second quarter reported revenue growth in corporate finance was driven by more of the volume growth and high yield in investment grades which we can observe versus other things that are a little bit harder for us to see publicly like pricing or new customers or additional revenue from other stuff like monitoring?","Ray McDaniel","","Yes. I mean obviously volumes were strong in the second quarter. But we also did have a pickup in other non-issuance related components of revenue that includes price. It includes monitoring fees which relate to relationships that we have grown new rating relationships that we have grown in the prior year and earlier in this year. And the pipeline of new rating relationships has remained strong both in the U.S. and in Europe this year. So it's a multi fast did growth story for the corporate sector.","Linda Huber","","Andre, it's Linda. The specifics on the corporate finance area investment grade revenue was $63 million, which is 20% of the whole line and that was up 5% from last year. Third grade bonds $77 million with 244% of the total corporate line. That was up 36% from last year's 57 million. Bank loans about $76 million from last year's $53 million represents about 24% of the total line and that\u2019s up 43% from last year. And other accounts about $105 million up from $93 million last year, that\u2019s 33% of the total line and up 13% from last year.","What we see here is a pretty wide hot speculative grade market and as we go into the second half we\u2019ve tone that down a touch because this is really remarkable speculative grade issuance. And we expect that favorable conditions will continue, but we will take to this degree and this strong, we have to think about that a little bit for the back half of the year. And I don\u2019t know if Ray or Michel would like to comment further on that.","Ray McDaniel","No, the only comment I would add is just reinforcing Linda\u2019s remarks. We don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that looks like it\u2019s going to have a chilling effective on the market but the likelihood that it\u2019s going to remain at the pace we saw in the second quarter in spec rate. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s the central case. Michel if you have anything to add please do?","Michel Madelain","No nothing to add Ray.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. Thank you.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. And a quick follow-up a little bit longer-term. We have run some numbers on some of representative U.S. companies and see that leverage ratios as measured by net debt to EBITDA kind of at the lowest level in about 15 years. I guess as you talked to CEO customers do you feel like we will likely remain and more of a structurally lower then for leverage going forward or could we potentially be at something like a cyclical trough where all the risk erosion and political issues could go away and as the economy improves we can actually see people meaningfully adding leverage again?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. I mean certainly I think what we\u2019re seeing from a geopolitical standpoint REITs caution. But beyond that, looking longer term and assuming that is resolved in some non-catastrophic way. Look, we look primarily I think to economic momentum around the world and the business confidence associated with the strong economic momentum and what that does for borrowing for M&A and capital expenditure as oppose to the refinancing that we've been seeing. So that's if there is a re-leveraging, I think it's going to come off of greater global business confidence.","Linda Huber","Yes, Andre, it's Linda. We saw pretty strong durable good number this morning, which is encouraging. The CapEx picture has been mix though, it has strengthened a bit, but it's very sector specific. So we probably peaked in terms of CapEx additions for the natural resources industry that commodity prices have come up. But for other industries there sort of looking to increase their CapEx spending. So overall it's moved a bit, but perhaps not as robustly as it could and we'll see it's a historical goods order number lease that up which would be helpful for us.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to William Bird with FBR.","William Bird - FBR","Good morning. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about Europe, what kind of trends are you seeing? How is the pace of dissent remediation going? And then secondly could you talk about just your plans for deploying the access 450 million that you raised in July? Thank you.","Ray McDaniel","Right. Michel would you like to comment on what you're seeing in Europe.","Michel Madelain","Yes. Well, I think we continue to see the trends we describe in prior quarters. Dissent remediation continue to run through, we see new issues coming to market, we see high level of activity across the board, basically and specially around high yield basically and also bank loans which is really the speculative way segment of the marketplace. So nothing is putting that in question, as you know that ECB is launching a program of targeted LTRO program which will provide liquidity to banks that are lending to the market place. So that will provide some more lending capacity of the part of the banks, but we don\u2019t expect that to really derail that momentum.","Ray McDaniel","Thanks Michel.","Linda Huber","","And Bill it\u2019s Linda. You are right we did a $750 million bond deals while back and $300 million of that we are looking to redeem a private placement 10 year piece of paper that comes due in 2015 with a 4.98 coupon on that. So once we do that the rest the remaining 450 will be used for general corporate purposes, the usual stuffs working capital, CapEx, acquisitions repayment of other debt and share repo.","Interestingly on the deal that we did we had a 5 year piece and a 30 piece, we were trying to access markets and investor that we hadn\u2019t been able to achieve before. The deal was massively oversubscribed. And we were able to tighten the pricing. We were very, very pleased about that and pleased that we were able to access the debt markets at rates which has been very attractive for us. So we are just doing some management here in terms of how we are handing and in fact as compared to one of our competitors maybe even a 100 basis points tighter. So we are pleased with how all that\u2019s going.","William Bird - FBR","And Linda could you give us the actual number on the incentive comp accrual in the quarter?","Linda Huber","","Yes, hang on just one second Bill, while we find that. So, incentive compensation for the second quarter was $44 million up from $34 million last year, so about $10 million increase. Stock-based compensation moved up as well, $20 million versus $16 last year or $4 million heavier. And salaries and benefits were $238 million versus $210 million last year, which is $28 million heavier or 13% higher. So, that's the incentive compensation view.","And we\u2019ve been asked a lot about that incentive compensation. The main driver of incentive compensation is really operating income. Keep in mind, operating income was up 17%. So if we are able to put up good operating income, we do increase our incentive compensation pool. Note that we do not get paid incentive compensation on that ICRA gain, that is not included, we have to have real results in order for us to have the incentive compensation pool move up.","So, for the rest of the year, because we probably get that question, we had asked people to look at maybe $35 million a quarter for incentive compensation. And it's probably better if you pump that up to more like $40 million per quarter for the rest of the year. Does that help?","William Bird - FBR","Great. Thank you. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Yes, hi. Just one clarification on all the cost detail that you gave out. So the $0.05 impact from the deal cost and then the $0.04 from the financing, that was just for the second quarter and then for the remainder of the year, call it another $0.06 from the acquisition cost. Did I get that right?","Ray McDaniel","The $0.05 and the $0.04 are built into our full year outlook of $3.90 to $4.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Okay, fine. That's great. And then Linda, like you talked about different components in corporate finance, just in structured finance, can you just talk about the CLO market, I guess seems like what's driving most of the growth and how that breaks out in just some commentary there?","Linda Huber","","Yes sure. I\u2019ll go ahead and do the other two sectors after that as well because we usually get asked. So let's start with structured. So structured for the quarter is $110 million; asset backed securities about $244 million, it was actually down a little bit from last year's second quarter, about $25.5 million and after tax are about 22% of structured line.","RMBS about $20 million, up from last year's about $19 million and about 18% of the line. Commercial real-estate is at $30 million, about flat to last year\u2019s $30 million as well and that's 27% of the structured line. And structured credit, you are right about this Manav is $37 million that's 34% of the structured line; it's up from $22 million last year or about a 70% increase. So structured credit CLOs have been very helpful to us on the structured finance line.","Would you let me just go ahead and go through FIG and\u2026","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Yes sure.","Linda Huber","","Okay. So FIG was $92 million for the quarter and that was up from $84 million last year. So banking is about $64 million, up from 57 last year, it\u2019s about 11% increase and banking close to 70% of the FIG line. Insurance $24 million, up from $23 million last year, pretty flat it's about 26% of the whole FIG line and managing investments about $4 million, pretty flattish from last year and that's only 5% of the big line. PPIF, we did $98 million in the second quarter and public finance and sovereigns about $40 million, that\u2019s actually down from last year\u2019s $43.5 million. And PFG and sovereigns represents 41% of the PPIF line. Structured munis, $4.3 million, exactly flat to last year and that\u2019s 4% of the line. And project and infrastructure add about $54 million, up from last year\u2019s $45 million, it\u2019s a 20% increase and that represents 55% of the PPIF line.","So, you can see we had good growth particularly as we mentioned in the script in the project and infrastructure line. The structured credit CLO line, banks a little bit weaker than perhaps because of the nature of the issuance, the big banks issuing and then we\u2019ve talked about the very strong results in the spec grade lines in corporate.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Okay, thanks a lot. And then just one more on the cash balance, the percentage held offshore ticked up nicely at least from what I had for the full year \u201813, clearly you guys are raising some debt in the U.S. and so forth. But just any thoughts around how you\u2019re going manage that international cash?","Linda Huber","Sure. Your observation is right. For the second quarter, we had about $600 million of cash in the U.S. at the end of the second quarter, which keep in mind was before we did the bond deal. And internationally we had about a $1.4 billion, $1.368 billion of international cash, that\u2019s 70%. So we did the U.S. bond deal of course to help our U.S. cash position. And we\u2019ve run a little bit heavier in terms of cash being generated by the international part of the business. So, how will we manage it? We manage it to support international acquisition opportunity. And we are happy with the balance that we have, given that our business is about 50% outside the U.S. So we are fine with the balance that we have and we have plenty of U.S. cash to support our dividends and our share buybacks and liquidity needs that we have in U.S. as well.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Linda Huber","Sure.","Operator","We'll go next to Peter Appert with Piper Jaffrey.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffrey","Thanks. So Linda, just staying on structured finance for a sec. I think this is the best quarter you guys have done for revenue perspective since the financial crisis. I\u2019m wondering if you guys read anything into this in terms of beyond CLOs or we have an inflection point in terms of life in the structured finance market.","Ray McDaniel","Peter, it's Ray, I'll start. We obviously were very pleased with structured for the quarter. It is really being driven by the CLO market both in the U.S. and in Europe. We\u2019ve seen growth in some other areas, but that really is the dominant driver of growth in CLO and structured at this point.","The commercial real-estate sector has been pretty good, but we still are not seeing a lot of activity in RMBS and covered bonds in Europe, student loans, some of the areas that we saw pre-financial crisis are still not showing much of a pulse.","So I think that\u2019s going to moderate the rate of growth in structured finance although I think we are going to continue to see growth in that area. But I would not anticipate any kind of explosive growth coming out of structured at this point.","Linda Huber","Peter, as I noted RMBS is actually been down year-over-year and I think it was noted in this morning\u2019s economic results but new housing sales were down. So we continue to see perhaps a weaker housing market than might we hope for. Around the world though we do have governments starting to talk about the need to get the securitization market for housing, for residential mortgaged backed securities functioning again and that is something that is those conversations have also taken place in Europe and perhaps Michel might want to comment a little bit on covered bonds which we also include in this line and RMBS potential in Europe as well. Michel, did you want to say a few words?","Michel Madelain","","You are right I think there is a lot of discussion in Europe about restarting the securitization market trading the right condition to do the ECB, the Bank of England and number of governments and policy makers are functioning on that. The reality is that as Ray said, it remains a very anemic market at the moment covered bond also is facing the challenge of the federal banks have very ample source of funding and actually ECB is adding to that. So I think the politically and there is a lot of discussion around that but the dynamics of the markets remains behind what we have seen in the past and the CLO is similar to the U.S. has been really the major driver of the improvement together with better activity in RMBS actually in Europe.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffrey","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.","Ray McDaniel","Thanks Michel.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffrey","And Linda can you remind me the relative profitability of the different asset classes for you guys I think the impression in the market is that high yield issuance is generally going to be more profitable for you probably structured financed as well. So, I'm wondering if some of your conservatism and with regard to the second half guidance like the function of just this mix issue and an expectation of weaker trends and high yield.","Linda Huber","Peter, we price a little bit higher for speculative grade ratings and that's because that is a tremendous amount of credit work required in bringing those ratings to the market. So, whether it's more profitable is a different question and we try to run profitability pretty similarly across all of our business months. So, I'm not sure, it's much more profitable.","Structured finance is not more profitable, that's bit of an urban myth, we've had it in place for many years here at Moody's. So I think the issue in the back half of the year and I'll let Ray comment on this, it's just really what we are thinking about regarding speculative grade activity. And as we said, we've taken guidance up, but on the spec rate front, we had a white hot second quarter and we're cautious, as we're usually cautious about whether that pace can continue. And I'll let Ray correct\u2026.","Ray McDaniel","No, the only thing I would add is which I think you already know Peter. Our structured business and the spec rate business are more transaction based business as opposed to recurring revenue businesses. So we are, we do enjoy the benefit of high volume periods, but there is a bit more volatility when issuance activity slows.","We see much less of that in investment grade, in financial institutions, but it is the characteristic of the spec rate and structured market.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffrey","That's helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","","We'll go to next to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","","Yes hi there guys. Few questions I guess first, your total headcount of your company what is it today and what percent of that's up from a year ago?","Linda Huber","","Sure, the answer excluding the acquisition Craig is that headcount is up 10% year-over-year and if you include the acquisitions, I think we've got in the press release where we're running approximately 9,500 people now. Most of our acquisitions have been in the revenue generating businesses and we're being very careful in the share of services part of the business to ensure that we have our more routine functions in lower cost jurisdictions.","So headcount is up to about 9,500 with everything considered without the acquisitions we had about a 10% increase.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","","And secondly, you gave a lot of detail on cost, but I am just curious back in the second quarter were there any one time costs you can quantify for us during the quarter, any deal related transaction costs could you may be quantify to stuff like that?","Linda Huber","","Craig, we don't really want to get into that. I think we had talked about looking forward there is sort of $0.05 there from acquisitions and deal cost and $0.04 from the financing costs. We don't want to tell the analysts what to think if you want to think about that as the part of the run-rate please do that, but we're very cautious to make sure that we give the GAAP numbers and give those first so that those are well understood.","So I don't think we want to get into particular sense associated with various deals.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","","Was there anything else Linda that you want to highlight other than this $0.05 and $0.04 that made you keep your full year EPS guidance the same?","Linda Huber","","I think that\u2019s most of it Craig. We will see where we get to or the next time I\u2019ll be speaking you markets at Investor Day September 30th and we\u2019ll take another look at that time, but from a GAAP perspective we do have include these costs. So again, the analysts can choose a different path if that\u2019s what they prefer to do. Ray, I don\u2019t know if you have any color you want to add.","Ray McDaniel","No.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Sorry, a couple more if I could, the WebEquity revenue, so can you just quantify that for us for modeling purposes sort of small?","Linda Huber","Right. I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark, I am not sure we\u2019d disclosed that.","Mark Almeida","Yes. We haven\u2019t really talked about WebEquity in any detail because that wasn\u2019t a second quarter event, just closed last week.","Ray McDaniel","And it is -- as I said before we like the company quite a bit, we like its fit in Moody\u2019s analytics and the position it gives us with the smaller U.S. banks which has not been an area that we have been as involved as historically. So their loan origination solutions for smaller bank is a very nice fit we think strategically, but again it\u2019s a small company. So, the materiality of the revenue is not there.","Linda Huber","Craig one other thing that we should note on the run rate to the extent that we said expenses the estimated tax rate is 33% and in the first half of the year we ran a little bit lower. So by math it\u2019s going to potentially run a little bit higher in the back half of the year. So, in the first half of the year we had a resolution of some international tax matters and in the second half we are expecting somewhat higher rate absence any other of these individual resolved matters. So we do expect for the tax rate to average 33% for the year. But again it would run a little lower in the first half so that means by the map we would have to run then higher in the back half. So make sure that you factor that in as well.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Also would ask you professional services. What was the revenue growth there excluding the Amba transaction?","Ray McDaniel","It was almost entirely from the acquisition.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Okay. I guess my last question if I could sneak this in. Your main competitor S&P always has been in the news a lot here last 48 hour with their wells notice. I'm just curious Ray or Linda or the ones who answer this, how often does a company like yours have to make significant methodology or criteria changes to tier ratings methodology, that\u2019s something that it seems we focus and with that S&P right now I'm just curious if you just talk a little about that how often you\u2019ve to make it the material way?","Ray McDaniel","I don't think there is a -- I mean we review our methodologies annually. But there is not a schedule for changing methodologies. And frankly that is really dependent on the ratings performance, how well our ratings accuracy is being measured and external events. If there are changes in regulation, in some industry structure that dictates or review the methodology we obviously will do that. But I don't even know what the pace of change in methodologies has been historically other than we review them regularly.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Just curious you suggest is it\u2019s pretty rare do you have change the criteria methodologies?","Ray McDaniel","No, I mean, we've changed methodologies in some sectors this year and we did so last year as well. And minor changes are more common than material changes, but as I said really we are not trying to set a pace for change so much as making sure that we are responsive to what\u2019s happening in the market and what we think is the ongoing quality of the methodologies that we are using.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Great, thank you.","Operator","","We will go next to Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Doug Arthur - Evercore","","Yes great. Just one question, clarification Ray. On the $12 million that your second to recognize from ICRA in the fourth quarter, is that in the revised MIS guidance or is that extraneous to that?","Ray McDaniel","","That is in the revised MIS guidance.","Doug Arthur - Evercore","","Okay, great thank you.","Operator","","We will go next to Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James","","Hey good morning. So my first question is where do you think we are in terms of M&A being a meaningful contributor to bond issuance? And I asked because although we have seen M&A pickup, the commentary from a lot of the advisory shops is we are seeing announcements right now, but a lot of deal closings are late this year, they are going to be 2015 events. And so do you think there is still a lot more room to go in terms of bond issuance related to M&A?","Ray McDaniel","","Yes I think there is potentially. And I take your point that the announcements predate debt financing and so we are pretty optimistic about what we anticipate on the M&A front and obviously we will keep our eye on that.","Linda I don\u2019t know if you have anything else you wanted to add to that.","Linda Huber","","Yes. That\u2019s one of the factors Patrick that encourages us about the back half of the year and also next year as well. If you look in our investor deck there is a chart in there that co-relates M&A issuance to bond issuance which might help you out. And as we said, M&A deals have been running at the fastest pace for the first half since 2007, it's been quite a strong surge. And obviously companies are aware of low interest rate and also record high equity prices. So that creates a really terrific deal environment. And we've been talking about this now for quite a while, but we are finally seeing it which is terrific.","But the point that you make that some of this financing will spill over into 2015 is correct. And that will be helpful to us next year as well.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James","And then if you can remind me, where does M&A financing typically fall? I would imagine a lot of the sponsored financing is going to be high yield. But the corporate M&A, is that mostly investment grade or is it a mix, where is that historically fallen?","Linda Huber","You are correct that most sponsored deals are generally high yield deals and they can either fall in bank bond deals or loan deals. Private equity firms can even kind of run it up to the day, the financing, the size what the balance is going to be between those two. And for big corporate, those probably would tend toward investment grade issuance. You are right about that, particularly the strategic as they are acquiring, that would generally be investment grade financing. I don\u2019t know if Ray wants to add anything.","Ray McDaniel","No, I was just going to say, the financials would tend towards the spec grade and the strategics would tend towards the investment grade.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James","Alright, that's helpful. Thank you. And then lastly from me, how is the tone of your interactions with the SEC been recently, if you can provide any commentary there? And I asked because the SEC's [important] Director has made public comments about they might be more active with their oversight of rating agencies. And just want to know, is anything that you said has been reflected in some of the tone of your interactions with the SEC.","Ray McDaniel","We, as you would imagine, we have frequent contact with the SEC staff through their inspection and review procedures, the office of credit rating agencies. I would characterize those interactions as being constructive. There are things that the SEC expects us to do from a process standpoint, from a reporting standpoint and we do everything we can to meet those expectations. But I would not characterize the relationship as half stone in anyway, I think it is constructive.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James","Alright, great, thank you.","Operator","","We'll go next to Edward Atorino with Benchmark.","Edward Atorino - Benchmark","Could you review the numbers you gave on the bank loan ratings? That's a category that sort of exploded in recent years and what's now pretty good chunk of business. Can you give me on the percent basis something like that year-to-year growth, margins on the business?","Linda Huber","","Sure Ed, I'll give you the growth, we\u2019re less interested in talking about margins. But last year bank loans were $53 million of revenue for us and this year it's close to $76 million. So it\u2019s an increase of almost $23 million or 43%. So you are right that line is a healthy contributor to our corporate finance business. And as Ray said, a lot of that is driven by merger and acquisition activities. And we also note that because investors like floating rate paper right now given their concerns about potential interest rate increases, bank loans are really where the action is primarily in the U.S. but also to some degree in Europe. So you are right. Those are the high points.","Ray McDaniel","","Yes. That Ed\u2026","Edward Atorino - Benchmark","I think banks big enough to do.","Ray McDaniel","","I would just underscore the comment that we are seeing strong activity in Europe in the bank loan area. That is a line that in years past I would not have highlighted because it wasn\u2019t large enough to be more exciting but it has come on very strongly and is a nice part of the corporate business now.","Edward Atorino - Benchmark","Is it totally separate or is it sort of displacing traditional issuance if you know what I mean?","Ray McDaniel","I think it\u2019s really part of the disintermediation story\u2026","Edward Atorino \u2013 Benchmark","","Got you, yes.","Ray McDaniel","","The rating on the bank loans makes it easier to syndicate and transfer those loans. And so yes there is a trade-off between rated bank loans and bonds, particularly spec rate bonds. And as Linda said, depending on appetites for fixed rate versus floating rate paper and the decisions about whether to enter the bond market or remain in a banking relationship by a corporate, drives that mix over time.","Edward Atorino - Benchmark","You may have given this, are they priced about the same as bonds or premium or discount in terms of your rate that you charge?","Linda Huber","Speculative grades area is priced a little bit higher, Ed\u2026","Edward Atorino - Benchmark","So they went to speculative grade area, yes got you.","Ray McDaniel","For the most part, yes.","Linda Huber","Yes.","Edward Atorino - Benchmark","Thanks very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo","Good afternoon everyone. So, a question for you. Now that your operating margins have reached the mid 40s, I think you\u2019ve made some comments in the past about trade-off between investing that incremental profit going forward into revenue growth versus margin expansion, if you could share your thoughts with us on that.","Linda Huber","Sure. I\u2019ll take a crack, it\u2019s Linda, then Ray to take a shot at it as well. We are executing on margin expansion here at Moody's and as I read in the prepared remarks the operating margin for the first quarter was 47.1% that was up 70 basis points from last year's quarter 46.4%.","So again, this is not a marketing campaign and not promises, we are expanding our margin and 70 basis points so I would committed pretty healthy year-over-year. We have said that over the mid to longer term we were looking to the end of low to mid-40s and we continue to be happy with that view, we do want to invest back in our businesses, as you can see our businesses are performing really well, we're very please with the growth rates were putting up. And our shareholders are 80% growth and they've told that they want top-line growth above everything else, but we are able to have margin expansion as well. But I think we feel pretty happy about this balance and our shareholders do as well from what we can see and Ray may have some other thoughts.","Ray McDaniel","No, just obviously it's going to be influenced by mix the pace of growth with Moody's Analytics versus Moody's Investor Service. And the pace of growth inside the U.S. versus outside the U.S., particularly whether it's in develop markets or emerging markets. But where we see opportunity for top-line, we're going to go after that and we're still going to be prudent in managing the margin, but we want the top-line growth.","Linda Huber","Yes. We'll talk a little bit more about this when we get to Investor Day quite frankly we haven't started our process yet to think about what if anything we might to say or change at Investor Day, but potentially we can talk about that. But we would note we're running this business very efficiently and we are very pleased with the progress we have been able to make on our margin line. So I think that pretty much covers it.","Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo","So a question for you on Copal on the knowledge process outsourcing side can you just comment on what you are seeing for the pace of outsourcing at the U.S. banks so that you are seeing that increase, decrease, stay the same?","Linda Huber","","Copal Amba has very nice margins and Moody\u2019s like growth rate is what we have said in the past. We feel that we are in the right place at the right time having very high end knowledge process outsourcing capabilities. And I think it would be fair to say there is very active dialog going on with all of just about all of the U.S. banks who are looking to cut cost. You can see those stories everyday in the press and also looking to increase their return on equity. So it is a terrific business for us to have but particularly at this point of the cycle I don\u2019t see if Ray or Mark want to say anything else.","Mark Almeida","","I think that about does it from my perspective.","Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo","Thank you very much, appreciate it.","Linda Huber","","Sure.","Operator","","And that will conclude our question-and-answer session I would like to turn the conference back over to Ray McDaniel for any closing or additional remarks.","Ray McDaniel","","Okay, just quickly before we end the call, I want to announce that we will host our annual investor day on Tuesday, September 30th here in New York. Attendance is by invitation only and the event will be webcast. Further details will be provided on our Investor Relations website ir.moodys.com as get closer to the event.

After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","In the fourth quarter, Moody's delivered revenue of $878 million, an increase of 13% over the fourth quarter of 2013. We again achieved growth in almost all lines of business.","Operating expense for the fourth quarter was $533 million, up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Operating income was $345 million, an 11% increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income less depreciation and amortization, was $372 million, also up 11% from the same period last year.","Operating margin of 39.3% was down from 40% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted operating margin of 42.4% was down from 43% for the same period last year.

Revenue of Moody's Investor Service was $2.3 billion, an increase of 9% from 2013. Moody's Analytics revenue of $1.1 billion was 19% higher than the prior-year period.","Operating expense for full year 2014 was $1.9 billion, up 9% from 2013. Operating income of $1.4 billion increased 17%. Adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion increased 16%.","Operating margin for 2014 of 43.2% was up from 170 basis points from 41.5% in 2013.

Full year 2013 non-GAAP EPS excluded a litigation settlement charge of $0.14 in the first quarter and a legacy tax benefit of $0.09 in the fourth quarter.","I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda Huber","Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 13% to $878 million. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MCO revenue by 3%.","U.S. revenue was $479 million, up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Non-U.S. revenue of $399 million was up 10% and represented 45% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $444 million represented 51% of total revenue.","Looking now to each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investor Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter, which included results for net growth, was $565 million, up 7% from the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 3%. U.S. revenue increased 14% to $344 million. Revenue outside the U.S. of $221 million declined 2% and represented 39% of total revenue.","Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue in the fourth quarter was up 9% to $263 million, reflecting increased U.S. investment-grade bond issuance and growth in the number of credits monitored. Partially offsetting these gains was the contraction of global high yield bond and bank loan issuance. U.S. corporate finance revenue increased 15%, while non-U.S. corporate finance revenue decreased 2%.","Second, global structured finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $119 million, 9% above the prior-year period, reflecting continued strength in global CLO issuance as well as increased RMBS issuance in Europe and the U.S. These gains were partially offset by reduced ABS issuance in the U.S. and Europe, as well as fewer covered bonds issued in Europe. U.S. and non-U.S. structured finance revenue increased 11% and 5% respectively year-over-year.","Third, global financial institutions revenue of $85 million decreased 4% from the same quarter of 2013, primarily due to lower bank issuance in Europe and the U.S. Partially offsetting this was increased issuance from Chinese and South Asian financial institutions. U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions revenue decreased 7% and 2% respectively year-over-year.","Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue increased 9% year-over-year to $90 million. Gains in the U.S. were partially offset by decreased infrastructure issuance in Europe and Asia. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue increased 26%, while non-U.S. revenue decreased 14%.","MIS other and new line of business, which consists of non-ratings revenue from ICRA and Korea Investors Service, or KIS, contributed $7.9 million to MIS revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $3.2 million in the prior-year period.","Turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $312 million was up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 3%. Excluding revenue from 2014 acquisitions, MA revenue grew 18%. U.S. revenue grew by 15% year-over-year to $135 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 30% to $177 million and represented 57% of total MA revenue.","Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research, data and analytics or RD&A, revenue of $150 million increased 11% from the prior-year period and represented 48% of total MA revenue. Growth was primarily driven by strength in sales of credit research, ratings data licenses, and economic analysis and data as well as the October 2014 acquisition of Lewtan Technologies. RD&A's customer retention rate remains strong at 96% for the fourth quarter. U.S. revenue was up 13% and non-U.S. revenue was up 7%.","Second, enterprise risk solutions, or ERS, revenue of $120 million grew 42% from last year, resulting from strong growth across nearly all product offerings, in particular, the asset-liability and capital solutions, credit origination, insurance and stress-testing verticals. ERS also benefited from the acquisition of WebEquity Solutions in July 2014 and for early completion of some customer projects, leading to better than expected results for the quarter. Revenue was up 10% in the U.S. and 65% outside the U.S.","Trialing 12-month revenue and sales for ERS increased 25% and 16%, respectively. As we've noted in the past, due to variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility.","Third, global professional services revenue grew 28% to $43 million, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Amba Investment Services in December 2013 as well as mid-single digit growth in our training and certification business. U.S. revenue increased 56% and non-U.S. revenue increased 18%.","Turning now to expenses. Moody's fourth quarter expense increased 14% to $533 million, primarily due to hiring and added operating expenses from acquisitions. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.","As Ray noted, Moody's reported operating margin and adjusted operating margin were both down slightly in the quarter at 39.3% and 42.4%, respectively. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1% compared to 30.6% for the prior-year period, primarily due to a higher portion of income in lower tax jurisdictions.","Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, Moody's consolidated ICRA's results of operations on a three-month lag. In the fourth quarter, ICRA contributed approximately $12 million of revenue to MIS. Details on changes to line of business revenue reporting made subsequent to our acquisition of a majority stake of ICRA can be found on Page 13 of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings press release.","I'll now provide an update on capital allocation. On December 17, Moody's increased its quarterly dividend 21% to $0.34 per share of Moody's common stock. During 2014, Moody's returned $236 million to its shareholders via dividend payments.","During fourth quarter of 2014, Moody's repurchased 4.6 million shares at a total cost of $440.3 million and issued 301,000 shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. For full year 2014, Moody's repurchased 13.8 million shares for $1.2 billion for $88.41 per share and issued 4.9 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plan. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2014, totaled 204.4 million shares, down 4% from the prior year.","In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program, which will commence following the completion of the existing program. Included in this incremental program as of December 31, 2014, Moody's had $1.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also at yearend, Moody's had $2.5 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility.","Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at yearend were $1.7 billion, down $428.7 million from a year earlier due to shareholder returns via dividends and share repurchases. This was partially offset by Moody's 2014 bond offering of $750 million of senior unsecured notes.","As of yearend, approximately 75% of our cash holdings were maintained outside the U.S. Full year 2014 free cash flow was $944 million, up $59.5 million or 7% from 2013.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray.","Raymond McDaniel","Thanks, Linda. We've received a number of questions about recent media report that the Department of Justice is in the early stages of looking into Moody's. As we've been disclosing in our 10-Q and 10-K filings, Moody's like other financial services firms has had heightened scrutiny since the financial crisis from a wide range of governmental organizations.","Where we believe specific matters are material, we communicate them in our filings and other disclosures to the market. And in this regard, currently, we have nothing new to report that would alter our existing disclosures.","With that, I will conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing our full year guidance for 2015.","Moody's outlook for 2015 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to some degree of uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.","Moody's guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of year exchange rates with the exception of the British pound and the euro, which assume foreign currency translation of $1.51 to \u00a31 and a $1.15 to \u20ac1, respectively.","Moody's expects full year 2015 total revenue to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. Operating expense is also expected to growth in the mid-single digit percent range. On a constant dollar basis, Moody's 2015 revenue and operating expense growth rates will each be approximately 300 basis points higher.","Moody's projects an operating margin of approximately 43% and an adjusted operating margin of approximately 46%. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 32% to 33%. The company expects diluted earnings per share of $4.55 to $4.65.","Moody's expect 2015 share repurchases to be approximately $1 billion subject to available cash, market conditions and other capital allocation decisions. 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $110 million to $115 million, driven primarily by technology investments in MIS, our corporate systems and the integration of our recent acquisitions. These investments are expected to continue over the next several years.","Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $120 million. Moody's incremental compliance and regulatory expense is expected to be approximately $5 million, primarily due to the continuing maintenance cost to comply with global regulation. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1 billion.","For MIS, Moody's expects 2015 revenue to growth in the mid-single digit percent range. MIS U.S. and non-U.S. revenue are both expected to increase in mid-single digit percent range.","Corporate finance revenue, structured finance revenue and financial institutions revenue are all expected to growth in the mid-single digit percent range. Public project and infrastructure finance revenue is projected to grow in high-single digit percent range.","Our issuance expectations underlying our 2015 MIS revenue outlook are largely in line with the consensus view of various global banks, acknowledging that there is a wide range of views in the market.","For MA, 2015 revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single digit percent range. U.S. revenue is expected to grow approximately 10% and non-U.S. revenue to increase in mid-single digit percent range.","RD&A is projected to grow in the high-single digit percent range. Enterprise Risk Solution is expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range in 2015 following its 25% growth rate in 2014, which benefited from the early completion of some customer projects.","With regard to professional services, as part of our integration of Copal and Amba in 2014, we discontinued certain non-core product offerings. As a result, 2015 professional services revenue is expected to be approximately flat.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investors Service and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We'd be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin","First question, I know the outlook you issued is your official view of the guidance, particularly on the issuance side, but I was wondering where, as we think about 2015, you think there is the most upside versus downside risk to the guidance?","Raymond McDaniel","Just because it's the largest area of our business, I would look to the corporate bond rating area. As we said in our prepared remarks, our outlook is largely in line with the outlooks of the large global banks for bond issuance, both in the U.S. and in Europe. But we did note there is a wide variance in those outlooks, so some of the more optimistic outlooks could certainly generate some material upside for us, particularly in the high yield and in the bank loan area.","Linda Huber","Andre, its Linda, and I'll speak a little bit about what we're seeing on investment grade, high yield and leveraged loans. For each of these I'll talk about what we've seen in terms of issuance in the U.S. year-to-date and then what's expected for the full year. Then I'll talk about fund flows and the state of the current pipeline in each of those areas.","So for U.S. investment grade bond issuance, year-to-date 2015, we've seen about $100 billion of issuance for January, which is a strong month. And for the year, we're expecting a $1 trillion of U.S. investment grade bond issuance, which is about flat year-over-year. Fund flows had been good year-to-date, $12 billion into the investment grade marketplace. And the current pipeline is described by the banks we've spoken to as above average.","High yield bonds, year-to-date we've seen about $20 billion of issuance. For the year, U.S. is expecting $275 billion of issuance, which is down about 10% from 2014. Fund flows are positive, year-to-date total inflows of $2.5 billion. And the current pipeline is said to be above average, but that is a recent development and the pipeline appears to be building at this point.","For leverage loans, year-to-date issuance has been about $30 billion. And for the year, we're expecting about $350 billion of leverage loan issuance, which would be down about 20% from 2014. Fund flows have been slightly negative, down $2 billion so far. The market hasn't seen any daily inflows yet on the leverage loan sector. Current pipeline though is average to above average. And the deal calendar is noted to continue to build at a steady pace.","The really interesting point here is what's going on with European issuance. The European investment grade market is in very good shape. Reverse Yankee issuance is expected to be more active, as U.S. companies are looking to issue in Europe, given the largest interest rate differentials in 10 years between euro and the U.S. dollar.","The European high yield bond market is off to a strong start. And 2014 also was a very strong year in the European leverage loan market and there is optimistic view on that going forward. M&A issuers should help with that on the loan market front.","So we've got some interesting conditions. Investment grade looking pretty good, high yield and leverage loans off to a slower start, but building. And really the very interesting bright spot here is the number of U.S. companies looking to issue in Europe, so bit of a lengthy explanation, but I think that sets the tone for what we're looking at.","Andre Benjamin","I guess, my second question would be for Mark. I was wondering if you can maybe provide some update on the enterprise risk area of Moody's Analytics. Maybe provide some color on why you think the guidance assumes normalization in the mid-single digit next year after such a strong year 2014? Is that based more on what's been contracted than your view on the pipeline, or is it simply being conservative after a tough comp?","Mark Almeida","Andre, I think you nailed it in your note this morning. We had some projects that got completed sooner than expected in the fourth quarter, so we booked the revenue in '14, pulling it out of '15, so I think we've got a tougher comparable as we move into '15. The pipeline is very healthy.","And I would say, really you got to think of two pipelines, the pipeline of projects that are already contracted, that we're working on and delivering, as well as the pipeline of prospective new deals coming in. So I think the story for '15 is that from an underlying perspective, business is just as strong, if not stronger, than what we've been talking about over the last couple of years. And really what we're seeing both at the end of '14 and into '15, is the impact of the volatile timing of when revenue gets recognized in this business.","Raymond McDaniel","One thing I would just add to Mark's comment is, as we have developed this business we have been getting some larger sales, more complex projects that have longer implementation, installation phases, and that is a characteristic that we are dealing with now. We certainly like those larger sales, but that also puts some of the revenue out into 2016, that we might otherwise see in 2015.","Operator","And we'll go next to Doug Arthur with Evercore ISI.","Doug Arthur","I was stuck by your comments in the structured business about the strength in residential mortgage, securities, particularly in Europe. Ray or Linda, can you sort of summarize the residential versus commercial mortgage-backed market. I mean, the numbers that I've been looking at look sort of week in terms of total issuance. But it looks like you're seeing something different?","Raymond McDaniel","Let me first turn it to Michel to comment on the European side, if you would Michel?","Michel Madelain","I think, first, you have to put these numbers in perspective. And the base, while we have a high growth in percentage terms, the dollar numbers are not that large. But what is happening in Europe is we had higher volume of issuance in RMBS coming out of the U.K. and Russia, and that is what drove, for Europe, actually, the improvement we've seen in RMBS. We also had similar to what we've seen in the U.S., a strong volume of CLOs basically, which also contributed to the growth we've seen in structural finance.","Doug Arthur","And is that true in the U.S. as well?","Michel Madelain","Yes. And maybe Ray wants to comment on that. But we have the same situation in the U.S. where for CLOs we've seen strong activities. In RMBS, what we really had is we had, what I would describe as a number of non-traditional transactions, where we've seen growth, typically at things such as the single-family rental and agency risk sharing transactions, where we've seen growth basically from prior volumes.","Raymond McDaniel","And, Doug, certainly in the U.S., while we are seeing growth, just keep in mind, it is off of a very low base. So the significance of that line in 2014 and going into 2015 is small compared to for example CLO or CMBS areas of structured finance.","Operator","We'll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","I just wanted to clarify, so the mid-single digit total revenue guidance includes a 300 basis point FX headwind, is that correct?","Linda Huber","Yes, Manav, that's right.","Manav Patnaik","And then is that the same for all the other line items, like the separate categories, that includes an FX headwind?","Linda Huber","Generally, yes. If there is anything else to be said about this, I'll encourage Mark and Michel to speak about it. But we would have been pretty close to our double-digit growth target, were it not for the FX headwinds. And you can see in our earnings release the rates at which we're using to prepare our guidance.","Raymond McDaniel","And to the extent you're asking is it in our EPS guidance as well as our revenue guidance. The answer is yes.","Manav Patnaik","And how much of the growth is coming from M&A just to get a sense of like the contribution from the deals there?","Raymond McDaniel","As you saw the fourth quarter inclusion of ICRA was about $13 million. And I'll turn to Mark to ask him if he would comment on the acquisitions that are on the Moody's Analytic side.","Mark Almeida","In MA for 2014, our growth was substantially organic. For the year we're talking about in excess of 90% of our revenue growth was organic.","Manav Patnaik","I'm referring just to 2015 like with the inclusion of, I guess, WebEquity and Lewtan, how much does that contribute?","Mark Almeida","Well, again, the majority of our growth in '15 will be organic, but we are getting some benefits from acquisition.","Manav Patnaik","And then, I guess, Mark, just on the margin expansion guidance that you had given us at Investor Day. Does the solid quarter changed that outlook to maybe get to some of those numbers earlier than expected or it was just truly one of those lumpy things you experience in your business?","Mark Almeida","I think it was more than just lumpiness in the business, although that certainly helped, but it's also I think the improvement in the margin is the result of all the work that we're doing to get us there. So I think we're seeing the results of the operational adjustments we're making across the company, particularly in ERS to drive margin expansion, but we did get a bit of a bump in the fourth quarter.","So I would be cautious about extrapolating the fourth quarter results out on a linear basis over the next couple of years. We are going to see the margin move around a bit from quarter-to-quarter. But I think nevertheless the trend is definitely going in the right direction and I would expect the operational adjustments we've made will continue to keep us on track to expand margin in MA.","Manav Patnaik","And then last one from me. Linda, you did a couple of debt raises last year, just from where we are today, just your thoughts on leverage and what you anticipate there?","Linda Huber","Sure. We're comfortable with our leverage. We do have some room. We like our rating and we want to stay comfortably within that rating. We probably have $600 million, $700 million of room in terms of what we could do within this current rating, and we'll see how the year progresses.","Operator","And we'll go next to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","I've got a few questions. Linda, can you just help us, what was the incentive comp in the quarter? I believe it was $47 million fourth quarter a year ago?","Linda Huber","Yes. For the fourth quarter, incentive comp was just about $53 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to $46.8 million previous year. And stock-based compensation was about flat at $20 million. This year we did a little bit better. We had profit sharing in the fourth quarter. We had to put up $7 million of profit sharing, because we finished the year stronger than we had expected. And for the full year, incentive compensation was $173 million, Craig. Stock-based comp was about $80 million and total profit sharing was $9.3 million.","Craig Huber","And then also, Linda, in your EPS guidance for the year, I am curious, FX gain that you guys posted in the fourth quarter, roughly $18 million, how much are you budgeting that line to be for 2015 in your EPS guidance?","Linda Huber","So Craig, if you take a look at the earnings release, if you look at Page 23, I think it is, we've got that outlined. So what we are doing is, we're assuming foreign currency translation at the end of year rates, with the exception of the specific examples of the British pound sterling and the euro and we're looking at those at $1.51 to \u00a31 and a $1.15 to \u20ac1. So we've budgeted flat at those levels and we're not taking a dynamic view from there.","Craig Huber","You said Page 23, I thought this press release was more like 12 pages. So am I missing something?","Linda Huber","You should have a full 24 pages of our at-strength press release here, Craig.","Craig Huber","I'll have to look that up. Ray, the CalPERS case, as your competitor S&P just settled for $125 million. Does that make it any more likely that you guys will be settling CalPERS any time soon or no change in that front?","Raymond McDaniel","No. I think there is really no change on that front. We're in discovery in the CalPERS case. And once the discovery is completed, the next is to move for summary judgment. So we'll not add a point in this case, where the merits have been addressed.","Craig Huber","Then lastly, Linda, like I always ask, if you could just breakout within your four segments, within rating, dollars of a high yields versus bank loans, et cetera, percentages, or however you want do it?","Linda Huber","Sure. Craig, do you want to the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Do you want year total.","Craig Huber","The fourth quarter would be helpful?","Linda Huber","Let's look at fourth quarter 2014 versus third quarter 2014 and we'll look at corporate first. So for investment grade, we had $80 million of revenue in the fourth quarter 2014, which is up dramatically from $39 million of revenue in the third quarter 2014. Spec-grade moved into different direction, we had $34 million of revenue versus third quarter's $54.5 million. On bank loans we had $37 million of revenue versus the third quarter's $62 million of revenue. And on other count we had a $112 million of revenue versus the third quarter's $105 million.","Interestingly, the percentages and the total in corporate segment as we said for the fourth quarter was $263 million. The percentages in the fourth quarter for investment grades was 30% of the revenue, spec-grade was 13%, bank loans were 14% and other was 43%. Interestingly, in the third quarter, things were different. Investment grade was only 15%, so as a percentage investment grades doubled in the fourth quarter. Spec-grades was 21% in the third quarter and bank loans were 23%.","So the majority of the revenues for the fourth quarter were in fact in investment grade. You can see how these things move around and how we can have pretty strong offset. Let's not say that will happen every quarter.","Going to structure, Craig, fourth quarter of 2014, asset-backed $22 million, which was 18% of structured revenue; RMBS, which includes covered bonds, $20 million or 17%; commercial real estate almost $36 million or 30%; and structured credit was $40.3 million or 34%; totaled $118.5 million. And as compared to the third quarter, there ABS is down a little bit; RMBS is about flat; commercial real estate is up in terms of percentage terms, it's only 26% in the third quarter; and structured credit was about flat at 34% in the fourth quarter.","Looking at FIG, fourth quarter of 2014, about $60 million in banking revenue, 70% of the revenue line; insurance at $19.2 million or 23%; managed investments $4.3 million, which was 5% of the revenue line; and the other was $2.1 million; total of $85.3 million for financial institutions. Banking a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter with 70% of the revenue; insurance a little bit lighter than in the third quarter, where insurance was 30% versus fourth quarter's 23%.","And going to PPIF, fourth quarter we saw almost $48 million of PFG and sovereign. That was up pretty nicely from $40 million in the third quarter. Our project and infrastructure of $42 million, down a little bit from the $44.8 million in the third quarter, and other is negligible. So the total is $90 million in PPIF. And do you want Moody's Analytics as well, Craig, or will that do it for you.","Craig Huber","I'm good on that. But I do have one last quick question. Your overseas operations window, what percent of the revenues are booked overseas in U.S. dollars?","Linda Huber","Craig, we're not going into that level of details on FX. I think the statement that we made is that revenue was about $55 million, $45 million U.S., non-U.S. But we're not going into the currencies, in which we're billing.","Craig Huber","Can I ask you, is it a significant number maybe like north of 10% of your stuff overseas in U.S. dollars. Can you help us at all on that?","Linda Huber","We don't disclose that, Craig.","Operator","And we'll go next to Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Just want to come back to sort of a lot of detail you've given on the guidance. Maybe not so big one in particular, but if you look at the U.S., where Linda you talked about the issuance environment, in particular mid-single digit growth is the guidance. Obviously, there is no FX impact. And basically you said, IG flat and high-yield and never slowing down pretty substantially. So help us gap what gets you there? Like obviously, you have pricing power, you have a recurring revenue growth. So just help us a little bit here to get to the delta?","Raymond McDaniel","I mean we do have price opportunities, but I cautioned you on that side that those some of what we can do with price relates to volume of issuance. So if there is a change in a bond rating fee and bonds are not issued, we wouldn't see that pricing opportunity.","I think probably the biggest thing that may not be top of mind is the increase in monitoring fees. We've had almost 2,000 new rating relationships developed since the beginning of 2013. So over the last two years almost 2,000 new names are being followed and we do take annual monitoring fees and a lot of that, the majority of that does come out of the corporate sector.","Alex Kramm","Anything to outside of the U.S. to point out what do you think in other regions the issuance and the revenue growth are more in line with each other?","Raymond McDaniel","Yes, I think they are and in particular I think we see some upside opportunity coming out of Asia. There has been good growth in new rating relationships and bond issuance in Asia, not just in corporates, but in financial institutions and banking sector as well.","Alex Kramm","And then just maybe switching topics, because I think in general you folks are pretty down on the outlook for issuance. But let's say, if you get into this environment where maybe it is even worse than what you are seeing here, what are the levers you can pull? I think Linda you mentioned the incentive comp and things like that. Can you share a little bit what the goals are there or the ranges in terms of where that could come out? And perhaps any other levers you can pull on the margin side?","Linda Huber","We generally view that we have about $50 million of expense flexibilities that we can execute without causing a lot of difficulties. I would cautions that forecast on issuance, those forecasts are notoriously wrong. Last year we started off with investment grade issuance for 2014 said to be down 10% and we finished up 10%. So you have to be careful about that.","And the first thing that we can do is we would probably look to slow our rate of hiring, if we see this difficulty. We can slow up on certain technology project, for example. But we think we've taken a good middle of the fairway view here in terms of our guidance. And I'll let Ray comment a little bit further, if he'd like to.","Raymond McDaniel","Now, as Linda says, we do have tools available to manage expense in more extreme environment, but frankly what we're looking at is just some uneven cyclical conditions. We're probably going to continue to invest through those, because we see some very good long term opportunities and we want to be ready to see some.","Operator","We'll go next to Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert","Ray, appreciate your comments on the legal front, and of course I want more. So you guys don't see any need apparently in the context of the aggressive buyback to reserve cash for potential legal settlements. I'm wondering if you could talk about just where things stand on other cases. Are there any you'd call out that you think we should be paying particular attention to? And then any commentary on directional legal cost for you guys?","Raymond McDaniel","As I have said on the previous calls, the number of active cases is down dramatically from what we had in the peak following the financial crisis. It's down to about a dozen cases here in the state. And we have not had any new litigation since 2013, and the litigation that we have is uniformly in early stages. Nothing is going for summary judgment. There are no imminent trials. So there is not a lot of new news on the litigation front from our previous communications to you.","Linda Huber","We talked about the financial strength and flexibility of the corporation in the prepared comments. We have very significant cash balances of almost $1.7 billion and undrawn credit line of $1 billion. And we're going to run our capital allocation plans in accordance with the guidance that we've given. And beyond that we're just not going to speculate on hypothetical.","Peter Appert","Linda, how about any color on how the costs will build in 2015?","Linda Huber","Yes, Peter, we've been taking a look at that. And I think what we wanted folks to do was take a look at the expenses. First quarter number you might want to focus on. We're never sure if we have this quite right. But we ended the fourth quarter at an expense run rate of about $532 million. We think folks should probably back that off to a little bit over $500 million in the first quarter of '15.","And then we see our ramp this year is being a bit more gradual, because in '14 we had a lot of acquisitions to take into account and those are pretty expensive to bring online. And then we had strong incentive compensation builds in the fourth quarter, as we did better than we expected. So we would expect the ramp to go from sort of $500 million in expenses to maybe $530 million or $540 million.","And that we'll largely see a pickup in the fourth quarter. So you want to take the ramp $30 million to $40 million. But it will be relatively smoother over the first three quarters with sort of how we're looking at it. But we often don't get this right, because of the incentive comp piece.","Peter Appert","And then Linda, gross margin is quite a bit lower than what MIS does, correct?","Linda Huber","I will pass that one over to Ray or Michel.","Raymond McDaniel","Yes, it is a lower margin business, and they do have public financials. So those are available to you.","Peter Appert","But do you guys now run the business actively?","Raymond McDaniel","We have majority control. But as I said, it is a public company, so we're involved through the Board of Directors, and we have a majority of the Board of Directors, but there are also independent directors. We have someone that we've known for a long time as group CEO. So we are managing the business, but in the context of it being a public company with minority shareholder rights and procedures that have to be followed in an Indian context.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Bird from FBR.","Bill Bird","I was wondering if you could speak to what's happening on the investments grade line. It was really struck by the spike in investments grade revenues in Q4. If I look back over the last three years investment grade, typically throttles at $40 million to $60 million a quarter. So I was just curious if there is just kind of anything different going on in terms of how you're pricing the product or does this tie into Ray's comments on monitoring fees?","Raymond McDaniel","The fourth quarter was a strong issuance quarter for investment grade, but it was also supported by mix. There were some large transactions and some issuers that, even though they are investment grade might not fall into our frequent issuer pricings, so that they were on per issue pricing basis, and so it was both good volume and good mix. And monitoring as you mentioned, that continues to ramp.","Linda Huber","This is how you can see the strength of the M&A financing pipeline coming through. And I think we had commented when I read through the various market sectors earlier, we do see a backlog of M&A financing from deals that have been announced and that's helpful to us.","Bill Bird","And then separately as you look at the yearend based on the pipeline that you see right now, how do you see growth sequencing this year? Are we going to likely start strong than we finish or what do you see as the shape of growth this year?","Linda Huber","This is also something that we notoriously don't perhaps do as well as we would like to in terms of the timing, because we are really subject to how the market looks from quarter-to-quarter. Recently, we've seen the second quarter and the fourth quarter to be stronger revenues quarters, Bill, and I think we would probably continue to see that.","MIS has that pattern. And I think from Mark's business, the Moody's Analytics business, fourth quarter is always the strongest. It's quite strong and you saw that in 2014 as well. Beyond that I'll invite Ray to give any further comments, but that saw-toothed pattern would be something that I think we'd expect to see again.","Raymond McDaniel","On the MIS, that's what really has been driving the saw-toothed Mark's business. Moody's Analytics tends to grow sequentially whereas Moody's Investor Service follows the saw-tooth and being larger tends to drive a saw-tooth pattern for Moody's Corporation.","As we've said, there are a lot of different opinions about issuance expectations for 2015. They are subject to, in my view, a more than customary number of uncertainties, which create both risks and opportunities.","Certainly, looking at the strong job creation in the U.S. and how that might influence the Fed's thinking on interest rate, balanced against the weakness in global growth in most places that are not the United States and trying to manage that from a monitoring policy perspective, we will be watching that just as everyone else is. And I would imagine that that is going to lead periods of very active growth and periods of relative softness throughout the year.","Bill Bird","And just one final question related to structured finance. Was wondering if you just speak to the new CLO risk retention rules and how you see them impacting the market?","Raymond McDaniel","Yes, the market's going to take some time to adjust to that. We don't see, for example, that there is going to be an elimination of CLOs. There maybe more of a concentration in some of the large CLO arrangers, but it seems unlikely to me at least that the banking sector is going to be able to step-in and provide the capital absent some sort of securitizations process. And so I would imagine the market is going to be looking for ways to continue to do that process in a way that is regulatorily compliant and economically attractive. It's happened historically and I would expect to see that again this year going into 2016, where it becomes effective.","Linda Huber","Bill, one other thing I just want to caution you and all the other analysts and people who take a look at Moody's. As I said, the issuance pipeline in Europe looks very, very strong. In fact, we're told by the banks that it's difficult to get a roadshow slot to show your bonds in Europe right now. There is that much traffic for issuing into Europe. So some times some folks take an overly U.S.-centric view of things and Moody's is completely agnostic as to where companies issue. We're just pleased that they're issuing. So you should take a look what's going on over in Europe, as particularly the first quarter unfolds. And Asian issuance is looking pretty good for us as well. So just keep an eye on the global pattern this year, which might be a little bit different.","Operator","We'll go next to Joseph Foresi with Janney.","Joseph Foresi","I wonder if we could drill down on what drove margins in the fourth quarter in the Analytics business. I just want to get a sense of sort of what took place there and maybe a better understanding of the trajectory. I know you expect them to increase in 2015?","Raymond McDaniel","Mark, do you want to comment on that?","Mark Almeida","Sure. Well, again, it was really two things going on. One were what I would characterize as the structural changes that we're making in the business and some of the operational disciplines we're bringing in to drive more margin, particularly in an enterprise risk solutions. So I think we're just doing a better job. We're being much more disciplined about pricing projects to ensure that we can deliver the kinds of profitability that we expect and require for the business. So that's a piece of it.","And then the other piece of it is the fact that we just, as we discussed, we had a number of projects that completed sooner than expected, that for which we round up reporting revenue in the fourth quarter. So we had an inflow of revenue on the topline and our expense base was our expense base. So that was driving a bit of a spike in the fourth quarter. So you've got two things going on. You've got structural and then the cyclical, if you will. Is that helpful?","Joseph Foresi","It is helpful. I wonder, is there a way to think about the trajectory of long-term margin expansions or even the trajectory of '15, will they step back down and then gradually go up or --?","Raymond McDaniel","Again, I guess, I'm going to hold to my commitment that we're going to grow margin in this business in ERS over the next several years and we're going to get a number of points of margin expansion over several years. So I think that's the way to think about it. I wouldn't guide you to think about a meaningful shift in margin one way or the other going into '15. Maybe that's the best way to set your expectations for this year.","Joseph Foresi","And then obviously we're kind of excited about the European issuance market there. How do we think about either the profitability or the revenues coming in from European market in light of the currency and the move in currency? I know you've given overall guidance for the total piece. I'm just wondering, as you look at those two factors together, how should we be thinking about those?","Linda Huber","Joe, let me talk a little about what we're seeing with FX. So we spoke about that for 2015, we would be pretty close to double-digit revenue growth, were it not for the FX piece. And of course, it hurts us on revenues and it helps us on expenses. So about 3% loss on revenue from FX and about the same to help on the expense line.","The main exposures for us that we're working with are the euro and the pound. And we are able to hedge a portion of our exposure using some derivatives that are discussed in our Ks and Qs. It's pretty effective, pretty easy to hedge; transaction exposure, which would be something like acquisitions or debt issuance activities. Little bit trickier to hedge translation exposure.","And for us, a good rule of thumb for everyone to think about, if the euro declines from the $1.15 we've budgeted for by another $0.05, that will hit us about $20 million in revenue. And that will be offset by about $4 million of benefit in expense, so net, $16 million on the operating income line. The EPS impact of a $0.05 decline in the euro would be about $0.05 on the EPS line. So you can think about that, use that as a rule of thumb, and that's assuming that the pound is pretty static in this equation, because the euro is the currency that's been moving around.","Raymond McDaniel","Yes. That's assuming that the pound at $1.51 and just the euro moving.","Linda Huber","Yes.","Joseph Foresi","And then just lastly, I know it's often difficult to find sort of the niche acquisitions that you're looking for. How does that pipeline look in general? And were there any specific areas that you're looking to capitalize on in '15?","Raymond McDaniel","We are always looking. We remain disciplined about what we try to pull the trigger on. More of the opportunities are on the Moody's Analytics side. The opportunity that we had with ICRA on the MIS side last year was a little more unusual. But in terms of the specifics on the Moody's Analytics side, I think we'd rather wait till we have something to announce, just so we can look around confidentially.","Linda Huber","Joe, also just in case you want to think about the EPS impact of the acquisitions that we've done, and '14 was a pretty active for us, the acquisitions were dilutive by about $0.05 in 2014, and we expect that to be about the same in 2015, about $0.05 of dilution from the acquisition.","Raymond McDaniel","From our existing acquisitions.","Linda Huber","Existing acquisitions rolling forward. But wanted to just give you that number, which might be helpful.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","Bill Warmington","So I had a question for you on Copal and Amba. You've mentioned that as a result of the discontinued product lines the revenue expectations there was going to be flat for 2015. But I wanted to ask what you thought the longer-term, how we should think about the longer-term growth rate for that group going forward? And also speak, perhaps to the demand that you're seeing from U.S. financial institutions for those types of services.","Linda Huber","I am managing the business, so I'll take this one. You're right, we did discontinue a product line, so it's going to make it a little trickier to have the professional services line grow this year. Historically, and going forward, we would expect Copal Amba to be growing in the low-ish teens. Its margins, which we don't disclose are quite strong. And we're very pleased about that. But given the need for U.S. financial institutions, and in fact, global financial institutions to watch their expenses, we see very good demand for this high-end knowledge process outsourcing that we do.","Legacy Copal supports investment bankers in producing pitch books and valuation models. Legacy Amba is more focused on providing support for equity research analysts. And both of those businesses are doing very nicely. So we wanted to focus on those core areas. And Mark may want to comment just a little bit more about what's going on with the rest of professional services, which he's managing.","Mark Almeida","Yes. On the training and certification side of Professional Services, the business is doing better. We had a couple of years where things were fairly soft in that area. The fundamentals in the business have improved nicely, but we are taking a pretty big whack there with the strength of the dollar, because much of that business is outside of the Unites States.","Bill Warmington","And then second question for you on CapEx, and $110 million to $115 million guidance. I wanted to just ask, if you look at the CapEx over the past three, four years, it's gone from sort of the mid-40s to $75 million in past year to $110 million to $115 million. Maybe talk a little bit about what's driving that? And also, if the $110 and $115, we should think of that is kind of the new normal for the way the business is being run.","Linda Huber","You're right. We have had an increase in CapEx costs. Given the revenue line of the business, we're still running a pretty CapEx-light kind of business. But the main thing that we're doing here is pretty typical of other financial services companies as well, which would be, what we're doing here is we're making capital investments on the technology front. And over the next few years primarily that involves Moody's Investor Service as the main beneficiary in our corporate systems secondarily.","And part of what we're doing here is we're providing for a more scalable and flexible infrastructure for MIS. We are hoping to make our analysts ever more efficient and have flexibility to deal with any kinds of regulatory change that might come in the future. So those are multiyear projects.","Our businesses are performing really well. We are very pleased with how 2014 has come in. So we think it's appropriate that we continue to invest in those businesses. And yes, $110 million to $115 million is probably right for the next couple of years. But for the size of our business, it's still not a particularly heavy CapEx line. So hope that helps you out.","Bill Warmington","A couple housekeeping items. I just wanted to double check. The contribution from acquisitions on a total company basis, it looks like it was about 200 basis points to 300 basis points. Is that a good number? Looks like about 13% reported, 3% from FX, gets you to about 16% constant currency, and then 200 basis points to 300 basis points off of that for acquisitions to get to organic.","Linda Huber","Are you looking at the revenue line or the operating line?","Bill Warmington","The revenue line. I want to just get to an organic constant currency numbers.","Raymond McDaniel","I don't have the specific number in front of me, but you're approximately, your range is correct. That is looking at Amba, which was a 2013 acquisition. So if you're specifically asking about the 2014 acquisitions, it would be a much smaller number.","Bill Warmington","And then just also asking the share count exiting the quarter?","Linda Huber","Sure. I think the simple share count was at 204 million shares. And we took out about 4% net of the share count in 2014. That's probably reasonable to model as a net number over '15, Bill. We can never be sure exactly how that will work out, because as we said, we're shooting for $1 billion.","Lacking any other better ideas, you probably ought to just look at that pro rata over the year. We run, as you know, systematic share repurchase programs, so we try to stay in the market all the time and we set those programs ahead of time, so we can stay in the market despite most things that are going on with the company. So I would run that, about $250 million a quarter, something like that.","Operator","We'll go next to Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Tim McHugh","Just want to ask about the corporate finance segment, the other accounts. Can you talk a little, remind me, I guess, what's in there and what's driving the growth that has grown quite a bit as percentage of revenue for corporate finance?","Raymond McDaniel","The MIS other line is a combination of Korea Investors Service and ICRA's non-ratings businesses. They both have some non-ratings activities. So that's what's captured in that line.","Linda Huber","Are you asking about specifically other within the CFG line? Is that what you're looking for?","Tim McHugh","Yes.","Linda Huber","Sorry. We're prepared to answer different questions here. So let me take a shot at that. What's in that line and the reason why it's growing, it includes fees from monitoring, which Ray has talked about are really nicely moving in our favor, because of the increased number of credits we're looking at.","Then there is some other things, medium-term note programs, shelf programs, commercial paper, a smallish business on estimated ratings, and other indicatives, and corporate family ratings, and as Ray said the ICRA rating revenue as well. So it's a group of different things, but it is a large and nicely growing line item for us.","Tim McHugh","Is the monitoring fee is the piece that's driving it to grow so much as a percentage of revenue?","Raymond McDaniel","Yes. That is the largest driver.","Tim McHugh","And then you're being asked about the MA margins in general for 2015. Do you have, I guess, if I missed it, did you say something or gave your view on MIS's margins? Do you expect them to improve next year or be flat? I guess, what's the outlook?","Raymond McDaniel","No, I don't think we would anticipate margin expansion at MIS, if in fact we're in a mid-single digit revenue growth environment. Certainly, if we get surprised on the upside with issuance volume or rated coverage, I would anticipate having good incremental bring-down from that upside surprise. So we'll have to wait and see.","Operator","We'll go next to Vincent Hung with Autonomous.","Vincent Hung","Just going back to the guidance of investment grade flat, high yield down 10% and loans down 20%, that's just U.S., right?","Linda Huber","This is not guidance. It's rather the view of a group of issuing banks that we talk to. So it sort of sets the tone in terms of what the various banks are seeing in terms of trends for this year. But you're right, that's U.S. only.","Vincent Hung","Do you have a similar sort of sense for Europe?","Linda Huber","What I might do is turn it over to Michel, who might have a better sense of that.","Michel Madelain","As Linda said, I think we expect more positive story on investment grade. High yield, we should benefit from sort of the environment in Europe and then the sort of successful yield we see across the board. And as I think Linda mentioned last year was good year for leveraged loan and we expect that to continue. So that's sort of directionally what we're seeing at the moment.","Vincent Hung","And just on the comment about the pipeline for high yield was above average and developing. Is that's because it's been so weaker today?","Linda Huber","I think you have a good point there Vincent. High yield is very subject to market conditions, and so as we started January with oil bouncing around, with overall rates coming down, but spreads widening a bit, the pipeline has only recently firmed. But that is a positive development for us. But again, we'll continue to watch it. And with fund flows being positive that's good as well. So we'll have to see, but we're encouraged by the recent strengthening.","Vincent Hung","And just lastly, on the investment grade strength in the fourth quarter, I think you noted the helpfulness of the M&A pipeline. Is that supported by the higher fees associated with having to do the deals quicker?","Linda Huber","It can be, but not necessarily. So many of these are really large deals, and that the frequency of M&A deals and the size of them have generally been helpful to us.","Operator","We'll go next to Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick OShaughnessy","Couple of quick follow-up questions for you. So within structured finance that derivatives or structured credit bucket obviously had a very strong fourth quarter. Can you refresh my memory kind of what products kind of fall within that and where was the specific strength in the fourth quarter?","Linda Huber","Structured credit is pretty much a CLO story these days, and that would speak to much of the strength in the fourth quarter. One of the things I was noticing as I was pulling this data together, CLO volume so far for 2015, issuance volume is $3 billion. 2014 issuance volume for CLO was $124 billion, which is just a very, very significant number. And we'll see what happens with that number in 2015, but that's what most of the structured credit consist of these days.","Raymond McDaniel","And for both the fourth quarter and the full year, CLO strength, I mean, there was real strength in the U.S. But I would also point to Europe, although it's a smaller market, a smaller component of the business, there was also strong growth there.","Patrick OShaughnessy","And then a follow-up question on the expense ramp over the year. I appreciate how it's kind of tricky to figure out exactly what that slope is going to look like. But given everything you talked about I think you said maybe start the first quarter barely over $500 million and then kind of finish the year maybe $530 million, $540 million.","If we take, say, the low-end of that average, say that quarter is $510 million, you multiply that by four, that gets you to $2.04 billion. If I divide that by what your expenses were last year, $1.895 billion, I'm getting something like 8% expense growth. And your full year guidance is more like mid-single digit. So am I screwing something up with my math or is it just pretty tricky to figure out what that ramp is going to look like?","Linda Huber","It's pretty tricky to figure out the ramp, and we're not going to go into it quarter-by-quarter. It is mid-single digit, so take a little bit of a look at what you're doing. We return back to target incentive compensation, which would mean 100% incentive compensation and no profit sharing.","And I think as I mentioned, profit sharing is a little over $9 million this year and incentive compensation, because we had a good yearend and was a little bit higher. So we normalized those things as we go into the view of the expense ramp for 2015. So you're close, but you might want to think about it a little bit more.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","End of Q&A","Linda Huber","Just a couple of housekeeping matters for everybody who might be trying to run models. We did note that regulatory and compliance costs will be about $5 million incrementally for 2015. So we wanted to make sure that that was noted by one who is working on their models.","Additionally, we wanted to note the tax rate of 32% to 33%. In 2014, particularly in the fourth quarter, we had some positive resolution of one-off international tax matters. And to keep our lives exciting, the U.S. approved reenactment of extender legislation before the end of 2014. At this point that has not been extended into 2015, which is why we're looking at 32% to 33% rate for 2015.","And I think with that, we've got most of the housekeeping out of the way, unless anybody else has any last final question.","Raymond McDaniel","Just before we end the call then, I would like to announce that we'll be hosting our Annual Investor Day again this year. We'll be doing it on Wednesday, September 30, here in Manhattan. And more information will be available on the Inventory Relations website, as we get closer to the event. So thank you all for joining us today.","Operator","And this concludes Moody's fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings call.

I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations.","This morning, Moody's released its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 as well as our outlook for full year 2020. The earnings press release and the presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.","Ray McDaniel, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead this morning's conference call.

I'll now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. Thanks, Shivani. Good morning, and thank you everyone, for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results, and provide an update on the execution of our strategy. Mark Kaye will then follow with further details on our results and comment on our outlook for 2020. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","I'd like to start with a few highlights. First Moody's achieved 16% revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2019. With Moody's investors service rebounding from the market disruption we experienced in the prior year period, as well as strong organic performance from Moody's analytics, which delivered double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter.","Second, in the fourth quarter of 2019, adjusted operating margin of 45.3% was up 30 basis points as compared to the prior year period. Next, we are pleased to introduce our full year 2020 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $9.10 to $9.30. This guidance includes the expected diluted impact of the regulatory data core or RDC acquisition, as well as projected share repurchases of $1.3 billion.","With the announced RDC acquisition, we continue to expand our risk assessment offering, hoping an increasingly wide range of customers make better decisions. The combination of RDC's compliance data with your Bureau van Dijk capabilities, positions Moody's to become a leader in the know your customer or KYC standards. And finally, I'm pleased that Moody's has continued to enhance its sustainability engagement and disclosure as a corporation, and to invest in important new ESG tools for our customers. I'll talk more about the work we're doing and the progress we're making in these areas shortly.","During full year 2019, Moody's achieved a 9% revenue growth, driven by 13% and 6% increases in MA and MIS revenues, respectively. Moody's adjusted operating income of $2.3 billion was up 8%. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 12%, driven by strong business performance.","Moving on to fourth quarter 2019 results, robust performance across both business segments contributed to a 16% revenue increase for Moody's overall, with 21% growth in MIS, and 10% growth in MA. Moody's adjusted operating income of $559 million was up 17% from the prior year period. Strong revenue growth combined with ongoing cost discipline, drove 60 points of organic adjusted operating margin expansion. This was partially offset by a 30 basis point combined impact from acquisitions and the divestiture of Moody's Analytics Knowledge Services or MAKS.","Adjusted diluted EPS of $2 was up by 23%. Over the course of 2019, credit market sentiment became more positive. This was especially evident in fourth quarter in comparison with the significant market disruption experience in the prior year periods.","Favorable progress on certain overarching geopolitical concerns, as well as generally benign macroeconomic backdrop with accommodative stances from Central banks, allowed for low benchmark rates, tight spreads and active debt capital markets activity. Notably, high yield bond issuance improved substantially following a period of minimal activity in December of the prior year.","I'd like to spend a moment discussing another active sector U.S. Public Finance, where MIS rated issuance grow by 84% in the fourth quarter versus 2018. The favorable low rate environment incentivize public entities to issue taxable bonds as a source of refunding, as lower benchmark rates offset tax disadvantages. This resulted in levels of issuance not seen since the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted at the start of 2018.","We expect the tight credit spreads and low benchmark rates will continue to support elevated refinancing activity in 2020, which Mark will discuss shortly. Our capacity to operate successfully in the capital markets depends on our ability to provide trusted insights and standards that help decision makers act with confidence.","To that end, our performance and historical rank ordering drives investor demand for our credit ratings. We remain focused on analytical expertise and robust credit methodologies to provide predictive, predictable and transparent ratings. As you know, our strategy is focused on continuing to enhance our core ratings and analytics businesses, while expanding our risk assessment capabilities into adjacent product areas and across new geographies.","On that note, I'd like to take a few minutes to review our recently announced acquisition of RDC, and highlight our presence in the Chinese market. Starting with RDC, as I mentioned earlier, the acquisition provides Moody's with a strong leadership position in the know-your-customer market. RDC has a specialized and unique data set of over 11 million curated profiles, an individual and is expected to act as an accelerator for Bureau van Dijk's already fast growing set of compliance products.","Together, they will offer more efficient, one stop to customer solution that otherwise will be time intensive and costly to build. Together, on a pro forma basis for 2019, Bureau van Dijk's compliance products and RDC generated sales of approximately $150 million. We expect this figure to more than double by 2023.","In addition, their combined capabilities have the opportunity to establish a global assessment standard for a market that was worth $900 million, as of 2019. This market has been growing at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 18% over the last five years. We're very","excited about the future opportunities the RDC acquisition presents, and its alignment with Moody's core purpose of bringing clarity, knowledge and fairness to an interconnected world.","Moving to China. I want to first note that we are obviously following developments relating to coronavirus very closely, and have been working to ensure that we are supporting our teams in impacted areas. Our main concern is for the health and safety of the local populations and our employees. In this spirit, the Moody's foundation has donated to give to Asia, a non-profit organization serving health needs in the area to combat the spread of the outbreak.","While the initial and most concerning impact is on human health. The risk of contagion could affect future economic activity in global financial markets. The immediate and most significant impact is in China itself. However, given its importance as the world's second largest economy, a broader slowdown is certainly possible. That being said, Chinese and other authorities have substantial policy tools at their disposal to mitigate the impact of global GDP. The situation remains fluid and we will continue to monitor it actively.","And let's take a moment to discuss the U.S. China phase one trade agreement. The development of the domestic Chinese market is an important driver of our long-term growth opportunity. We are therefore pleased that China has taken important steps towards opening the market to credit rating agencies, and the bilateral trade agreement acknowledges and ensuring certain commitments which we support.","Moody's views the trade deal as a positive for both Chinese and U.S. growth. MIS rates both the cross border market and in the domestic market through our 30% interest in CCXI, one of the largest domestic rating agencies in China. And as China's financial market continues to expand and deepen, we continue to explore ways to better serve customers and contribute to the development of that market.","China related revenues including from cross border activity for MIS and MA, totaled $176 million in full year 2019, up 17% from the prior year. In addition, Moody's attributable income from CCXI totaled $17 million in full year 2019, up from $15 million in the prior year.","Before, I turn this over to Mark, I'd like to highlight some of the key initiatives that we have undertaken, that underscore our commitment to our stakeholders and to a sustainable future. We joined the UN Global Compact or UNGC initiative and enhanced our voluntary ESG related disclosures in our securities filings, consistent with guidelines from the sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and recommendations from the Task Force on climate related financial disclosures. These disclosure enhancements are well recognized by the FTSE4Good and Bloomberg Gender-Equality Indices, for which Moody's satisfied the requirements for inclusion for the first time.","On the business front, we made strategic investments in our ESG risk assessment capabilities, which are becoming increasingly important to investors and other stakeholders. In 2019, Moody's acquired majority stakes in Vigeo Eiris and Four Twenty Seven. We have now integrated data from Four Twenty Seven with the research from MIS and the REIS network in MA.","In addition, Moody's acquired a minority stake in SynTao Green Finance, which provides ESG data and ratings to the Chinese market. We believe that these investments enable us to offer our customers a more holistic Moody's product suite, which our customers continue to recognize as industry leading.","Employee diversity and inclusion remain integral to our culture and essential to our future growth prospects. 2019 was yet another strong year for third party recognition of our achievements in this area. We continue to work towards the goal of embedding our CSR strategy and mindset throughout our communities. And I'm pleased to report that Moody's was verifiably carbon neutral during 2019. In 2020 and beyond, we will continue to differentiate, evolve and demonstrate thought leadership in these areas.","I will now turn the call over to Mark Kaye, to provide further details on our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2020.","Mark Kaye","Thank you, Ray. For MIS, fourth quarter revenue was up 21% from the prior year period, and above the 18% increase in overall debt issuance due to a favorable mix from infrequent corporate and financial institution issuers. As a result of this favorable mix, transaction revenue increased 31%.","As Ray mentioned earlier, MIS also benefited from strong U.S. Public Finance issuance, including increases in refunding supply and taxable transactions. Strong business performance and cost discipline, resulted in 130 basis points of constant dollar organic adjusted operating margin expansion, partially offset by 50 basis points from acquisition.","MA continue to deliver double digit revenue growth, driven by strong contributions from the RD&A and ERS lines of business. As Ray mentioned earlier, MA has now delivered organic double digit growth in the last four consecutive quarters.","RD&A revenue grew 12%, driven by credit research and data feed, as well as strong demand for Bureau van Dijk products, specifically, compliance and loyal customer solution. On an organic basis RD&A delivered double digit revenue growth of 11%.","In ERS revenue grew 20% for the quarter or 16% organically, led by strong demand for credit assessments and loan origination solutions and products, that enable compliance with new accounting standards for banks and insurance. Our RiskFirst acquisition also contributed to this growth.","In the fourth quarter, the MA adjusted operating margin decreased to 160 basis points, primarily due to severance and divestiture related expenses. On a trailing 12 month basis, constant and organic adjusted operating margin expand by 180 basis points, partially offset by a 40 basis point contraction from acquisitions.","We remain disciplined in managing expenses to drive strong operating performance. In the fourth quarter, total operating expenses increased 7%, primarily due to incentive compensation and operating expenses attributable to acquisition and the MAKS divestiture completed within the last year. These were partially offset by saving from the restructuring program. For the full year 2019, total operating expenses increased 10%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation, operating expenses attributable to acquisition for MAKS divestiture and the restructuring charge.","Turning to Moody\u2019s full year 2020 guidance. Moody\u2019s outlook for 2020 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions, and macroeconomic and capital market factors. These include, but are not limited to, interest in foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions and the level of debt capital markets activity. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.","Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rate. Specifically, our forecast reflects U.S. exchange rates for the British pound of $1.31, and for the euro of $1.11.","Slide 19, outlines a variety of drivers we considered when setting our 2020 guidance. In particular, for MIS we believe that stable economic fundamentals with GDP growth of 1.5% to 2% in the U.S. and 1% to 1.5% in Europe will underpin global debt issuance. Relatively tight credit spreads and low benchmark rates should support a favorable issuance mix, with elevated refinancing and opportunistic activity.","For MA, research and data feeds as well as Bureau van Dijk will drive RD&A revenue performance. Growth in ERS will persist, benefiting from demand for IFRS 17 product in contribution from the RiskFirst acquisition. The core business plus the MAKS divestiture will support strong adjusted operating margin expansion for MA in 2020.","Our investments in RDC, and other recent acquisitions are expected to create margin headwinds in the short-term. I'd also like to highlight that starting with the first quarter of 2020, we will no longer report Professional Services as a separate line of business. Instead, Moody's Analytics learning solutions will be reported as part of RD&A.","Moody\u2019s full year 2020 financial performance will benefit from the $60 million, in run rate savings from the restructuring program, which will enable improvement to the 2020 adjusted operating margin. We have identified approximately $30 million of additional expense efficiencies in 2020, that we will fund like announced growth initiatives such as ESG, China and enabling technologies.","We anticipate that Moody's revenue will increase in the upper end of the mid-single-digit percent range, and then operating expenses will grow in the low-single-digit percent range. The full year 2020 adjusted operating margin is forecast to be in the range of 48% to 49%. We are targeting net interest expense to be between $180 million and $200 million. The full year effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 20% to 22%.","Diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS are forecast to be in the range of $8.60 to $8.80, and $9.10 to $9.30, respectively. Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. For full list of our guidance, please refer to table 12 of our earnings release.","In 2020, we plan to return more than $1.7 billion of capital to our stockholders through approximately $1.3 billion of share repurchases, and more than $400 million in dividends. We are expecting free cash flow to be approximately equivalent to adjusted net income similar to 2019.","Today, we are announcing that Moody's Board has directed to create regular quarterly dividends of $0.56 per share of Moody's common stock, a 12% increase from the prior quarterly dividends of $0.50 per share. This dividend will be payable on the 18th of March to stockholders of record at the close of business on the 25th of February. This increased dividend is in line with our target dividend payout ratio of 25% to 30% of adjusted net income.","In 2020, we forecast global debt issuance to be approximately flat. A supportive condition for refinancing activity is expected to be offset by moderating global economic growth and M&A. The chart on the right shows our forecast for 800 to 900 new mandates, in line with 2019.","For MIS, we expect total revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. A strong execution of our strategy enables revenue growth despite flat issuance in first time mandates. The MIS adjusted operating margin is anticipated to be 58% to 59%. For MA, we forecast total revenue to grow in the high-single-digit percent range. Even strong sales growth across the research data feeds businesses, as well as ERS and Bureau van Dijk, further bolstered by the RDC acquisition. We expect the MA adjusted operating margin to expand over 200 basis points to approximately 30%, inclusive of the impact of the RDC acquisition.","Before turning the call back over to Ray, I would like to emphasize a few key takeaways. We continue to execute a strategy that is driving Moody's evolution into a globally integrated risk assessments company, helping customers make better decisions. The acquisition of RDC is another important strategic step forward in this regard, strengthening our position in the large and prospering KYC markets with potential for significant upside. Core business strength, disciplined investments and cost management will support continued revenue growth and margin expansion in 2020.","Finally, consistent with prior years, we're committed to being good stewards of capital and anticipate returning more than $1.7 billion to our stockholders in 2020.","I will now turn the call back over to Ray for his final remarks.","Ray McDaniel","Thanks Mark. I just like to remind everyone that Moody's will be hosting its next Investor Day on March 11, 2020, here in New York City. The event, which will be webcast live will feature presentations from management and showcase important aspects of the company's business. Please contact the Investor Relations team if you'd like additional information about this event.","And finally, listed on this slide are the conferences that we expect to attend in the next few months in Orlando, London and New York City. Please contact your bank representative to request a meeting with Moody's management at these events.","This concludes our prepared remarks, and joining Mark Kaye and me for the question-and-answer session is Rob Fauber, our Chief Operating Officer. We'd be pleased to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good afternoon, almost afternoon to you guys. The first question is just on the ESG side, that you had this slide with all the initiatives, and I get, what you're doing for your own, I guess, corporate angle. You've acquired a lot of the data assets that I think helped the credit rating side, which you said has been doing that for a while. So, I was just curious, what else should we be looking forward to in terms of, incremental revenues, in terms of your ESG efforts down the road?","Ray McDaniel","Sure. I'll let Rob tackle those. Rob, please?","Rob Fauber","Yes, sure. Good morning or almost afternoon Manav. So, just to give you a sense of kind of where we are from a revenue perspective with ESG, we're generating somewhere between $15 million to $20 million in revenues there. Unlike, some other companies that are in that ESG space, we don't have an index business to help us monetize our ESG content. So, really, we see the opportunity across two broad customer segments. It's really issuers on one hand, and investors and financial institutions on the other.","And we're leveraging the content from the Vigeo Eiris and Four Twenty Seven businesses that we've acquired, and integrating that also across a wide range of offerings in MA. Maybe, just to talk about the issuer stock for a second. So, we're seeing some real ongoing growth in what we call the labeled bond market, this has started as the green bond market and has evolved to kind of a broader sustainability bond market. We think that market is going to hit something like 400 billion in issuance this year and that's up almost 25% from 2019.","And through Vigeo Eiris, we offer something called a second party opinion on label bond issuance for issuers. And we did something like 120 of those last year. So, that makes us one of the world leaders in that space and we're further making some refinements to that offering. And Four Twenty Seven, we've got a few other offerings for issuers, sustainability ratings, sustainability linked loan assessments, and we're working on rolling out a climate assessment for issuers.","And then over that second segment and I talked about investors and financial institutions. We've got ESG ratings on something like 4700 publicly listed companies, climate risk scores and over a million facilities. We're selling that to people for portfolio construction monitoring. And we're also now as I said, integrating that content into our MA offerings and we're seeing demand from data feeds, green stress testing, fiscal risk scores on our REIS platform that we just mentioned, even ESG training. So, a number of ways that we're looking to monetize all those.","Manav Patnaik","Got it, that's helpful. And then reading your comments around China, you referred to the trade agreements and so forth. Does that change your strategy in terms of partnering with CCXI, or maybe going back after your license, and so the domestic side of things?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. The trade agreement, we view it as very positive. Certainly, for the financial services sector and the opening of the financial services sector, we think that's a positive for us, it's also should be a positive for the Chinese market. What it does, is, it really codifies and clarifies that we have some different options in that market, we can pursue a license, we can continue with our joint venture in CCXI, and we could think about changing our ownership position in CCXI that was made clear in the trade agreement.","So, what we're doing is evaluating those options. As I've said in previous calls, we are very pleased with the position that we have in CCXI. It has been a very successful business today. So, I think the greatest likelihood is that we will want to continue with CCXI, and see what our joint venture partner would like to do as far as our combined future.","Mark Kaye","Just to add a couple of numbers around that. We have 30% ownership in the leading rating agency CCXI, which has, just a reminder a little over 700 employees and 1500 customer relationships. We estimate that CCXI had around a 42% share of its $280 million single rating domestic market in 2019, and that was up slightly from the 39% in 2018.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Cho with JPMorgan.","Michael Cho","Hi, how are you doing? Thanks for taking my question. My first question is just around the Moody's Analytics margin guide. I was hoping you touched on this in the opening commentary, but I was hoping you could provide a little more commentary on the MA margin progression from 2019 to the 2020 guide. I guess, I'm thinking about core operating leverage investments and dilution from impacts or dilution from acquisitions at balancing those kinds of variables.","Mark Kaye","Good morning, Michael. This is Mark. I'll start maybe with 2019 and then I'll move forward towards 2020. So, for 2019, certainly in the fourth quarter, we did report a decrease in margin of 160 basis points during the quarter. It's important to note that the margin itself would have been more than 250 basis points higher in the quarter, that if we excluded incentive compensation and severance expenses, over and above the prior year period.","And nonetheless, we like to look at MA's margin typically on a trailing 12 month basis. And for 2019, we did see an increase of 140 basis points from 26.4% to 27.8%. It's worth noting that that 140 basis points increase included a headwind of approximately 40 basis points from the inorganic acquisitions we did in 2019. And so, we really saw a run rate of around 180 basis points or call it approximately 200 basis points or so in 2019.","If we step forward to 2020, what we're expecting to see is on a constant dollar organic growth rate increase of around 260 basis points, for the MA fully allocated margins. And that will put us approximately 30 basis points. As a management team, it's also worth noting that that includes around 50 basis points of headwinds from ongoing investment in the business. So not only are we able to grow margin consistently, across the years, we're also able to invest in the business in terms of improving our profile.","Michael Cho","Okay. Great, thank you. That's a great color. I just wanted to pivot slightly around for regulatory data? I saw that you mentioned about $150 million of pro forma revenues looking to double in three years. So, I guess, how fast this regulatory data revenues growing today? And is there something that gives you so much confidence to double that in few years? Thanks.","Ray McDaniel","Yes. So, the combination of RDC and BvD as we talked about its really, we think a very natural fit between two very well established providers in the KYC space. And they have very complimentary offerings. So together, we're going to have an integrated kind of end-to-end solution for customers that's got the people data, the entity data all from one provider. We think that's relatively unique in the market and has the potential to be really ultimately the standard in the KYC space.","So, RDC, I think has been growing generally consistent with what you've seen in terms of the market growth. But we think the combination and leveraging the sales capabilities and distribution that we've got at MA and BvD and particularly outside the U.S. as well, are going to give us an opportunity to really support the growth there. The compliance solutions at BvD are the highest growth product segment that we got there. So, we have a good experience in that segment already and we think RDC is just going to further support that.","Michael Cho","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Alex Cram with UBS.","Alex Cram","Hey, good morning everyone. Just wanted to - I know you gave obviously guidance on the rating side and issuance, but maybe just discuss a little bit more what you're seeing right now and how you expect the year to shape out? I guess, what I'm seeing so far this year is pretty good issuance strength and pretty good environment. But when I think about the second-half, you have an election, you have some other uncertainty. So, just wondering, what you're hearing from corporate? Could this be a year of two half's or how are you thinking about the year for now?","Ray McDaniel","I'll let Mark and Rob handle the bulk of this, but I just want to confirm. Yes, we have seen a good issuance environment in January and early February, even with the normal corporate blackouts that we have around this period. We expected, it was going to be good market conditions in the fourth quarter, have continued into the early first quarter. But, as far as we look forward, I'm going to let Mark and Rob tackle that.","Mark Kaye","Alex, again to your question, I think what we'll do here is similar to what we've done in the past. Now, I'll talk a little bit about issuance drivers that we're hearing from some of the banks, and then I'll turn it over to Rob to follow-up with our internal viewpoint.","Starting with U.S. investment grade. The banks have seen solid activity to start the year with an expectation that volumes will pick up once more corporate come out of the earnings blackout period. Furthermore, spreads remain tight and the yield curve receptive also encouragingly. There are indications that some of the largest offshore cash holders will be mostly absent from the market in 2018 due to U.S. Tax Reform, are slowly starting to return to the markets.","Despite a strong start to 2020 for U.S. Investment Grade issuance, a several factors are driving cautious full year outlooks from the banks. These include a tough comfortable M&A driven issuance, concerns around the economic impact of the coronavirus and potential volatility in the second-half of the year stemming from the U.S. election cycle. Overall, the banks call for U.S. Investment Grade issuance to be flat to down 5%.","Similar to U.S. Investment Grade, the bank's outlook for U.S. speculative grade issuance is mixed, while issuance falling for both fixed and floating rate U.S. speculative grade deck has had a strong start to the year. And banks expected overall preference will fix rate issuance to merge over the years driven by ongoing low benchmark rates and tight spreads.","Now the banks also indicated that they see refinancing in M&A driven issuance to be lower for U.S. speculative grade, and a high yield bond volume in particular face they're relatively tough comparable to a strong 2019. Additionally, the bank noted broader macro uncertainty in the U.S. elections later in the year, it also weighing on their forecasts. They are calling for U.S. speculative grade issuance to decline in the high single digit percent range in 2020.","Now turning to Europe. Feedback from the banks is that the investment grade market they seem similar, but maybe, more accentuated dynamics, compared to the U.S. with tailwinds from the ECBs corporate bond purchases in both benchmark rates.","Investment grade dynamics or relative value dynamics in Europe continue to encourage a Reverse Yankee issuing, which comprise more than a quarter of total investment grade issuance in Europe last year.","Now, in addition, ongoing political uncertainty concerns around macroeconomic environment and lower expectations of the residual net investment hedge capacity for U.S. issuance, all contributing to relatively conservative 2020 outlook. As a result, the banks are expecting European investment grade volumes decline between 5% and 10% for the year.","And then finally, interestingly, now banks expectations with European high yield are slightly more constructive, improved market sentiment around the easing of trade tension, dovish central bank policy, a greater confidence in the speculative grade M&A pipeline are offsetting fears around still weak economic data and the potential impact of the coronavirus. Overall, banks are expecting European speculative grade issuance to be largely flat, with stronger issuance for fixed rate debt or fitting a slight decline in floating rates issuance.","And I'll hand it over to Rob to talk on MISs as 2020 issuance expectation.","Rob Fauber","Yes. Okay. So, just to kind of triangulate to what you heard from Mark, in terms of our own issuance outlook and consistent with what we talked about on the earnings call back in the third quarter, we're looking at flattish issuance. That is inclusive of bank loans. And we think that bank loans will be down slightly in 2020. So, our bond issuance outlook, I would say, is up very modestly over prior year.","Just kind of comparing and contrasting to what Mark just talked about from the banks, we're also thinking about the potential for that second-half volatility due to the U.S. Presidential elections. And I'd say that, our view on M&A is that it's probably moderated a little bit versus what we were thinking four months ago or so, coming off some very elevated levels over the last couple of years. And we are starting to see that in the forward calendars. So, a little bit lighter M&A, and LBO acquisition financing in the forward calendar.","Relative to the banks, actually we're a bit more positive in a few of the asset classes that Mark touched on. U.S. investment grade, I'd say we're a little bit closer to the high end of that flat to down 5% range. And by the high end, I mean, closer to flat. U.S. leverage finance, we think we're actually going to see some growth, modest growth in U.S. high yield after what was a really strong year, obviously, in 2019, that's supported by those tight spreads and what we think is going to be, healthy refi activity.","And probably on leverage loans, pretty similar activity to last year. In Europe, again, we're probably at the high end of those investment grade estimates, that Mark talked about coming down to 5% and down 5% to 10%. And I think we're going to see, in leveraged finance, we're expecting to see some healthy growth and high yield, kind of offset with a decline in bank loans and so that, that puts us at probably flattish in terms of European leveraged finance, which is pretty close to I think what the banks are calling for.","Alex Cram","Okay, great. I'll ask a very quick follow-up on the same topic. In Europe, I mean, Europe issuance has been a little bit more anemic than the U.S. I think you said this yourself.","And rates have been negative, which should have been favorable. But, I guess, what I'm wondering is, you saw one country Sweden recently get off the negative rates. I mean, has that changed anything in conversations? I guess, I'm hoping for maybe corporate seeing the bottoms are in and now let's go, or is that a little bit too optimistic at this point, any comments?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. As far as the influence of negative rates, obviously, that the intention is that, that is accommodated and encourages economic growth. But, in fact, it seems to me that that actually","does represent a drag because of what it does for business confidence. And so, I think, the very attractive borrowing conditions are encouraging, refinancing and they are supportive of opportunistic issuance activity. But they're really not contributors to companies thinking about it being time to invest in property plant and equipment and business expansion.","So, I think overall, those largely offset, and that's what's driving the outlook for modest declines for European investment grade and flat for high yield. It ends up being kind of a push, I think, actually.","Operator","The next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. So, there's a lot of moving pieces in MA next year. I guess, could you help us with what the organic growth rate implied in the guidance is for MA? And also, just with regard to ERS, just given the past four quarters or so benefited from this transition, should we expect continued high levels of growth, or does that start to fade a little bit, now that you have left that?","Rob Fauber","Yes. Tony, hi. This is Rob. So, I think when we think about organically for MA, I think our guidance would have been for organic will be in a low double digit range. So, excluding the impact of M&A, specifically, talking now about ERS, and obviously, we had some very strong growth both in the quarter and for the year. That full year revenue growth was driven by very healthy demand for our credit, assessment and loan origination products as well as our products for the IFRS 17 accounting solutions.","And customers have continued to show a preference for purchasing hosted software instead of installed software. And as we've talked about that on some prior calls, that leads to a bit more steady revenue stream overtime and the subscription revenues for us to really kind of the high teens for the year.","Excluding the revenue related to some multiyear installed software subscription sales in 2019, the growth rates for ERS would have been in a low double digit range for 2019. And that's probably the zip code of what we would expect for an ongoing run rate in the business, is somewhere in that low double digit basis on an organic basis, and probably around low teens when you include RiskFirst.","Toni Kaplan","That's very helpful. And then just on the free cash flow guidance, maybe a little bit lighter than what we had expected, but net income a little bit higher. So, just wondering, if there's anything impacting the free cash flow conversion in 2020 that's contemplated in the guidance, like anything to call out with regard to working capital or something else.","Mark Kaye","Toni, good afternoon. Maybe a big place for me to start is really just to put things in context, certainly, over the last five years, free cash flows exceeded more than 100% of our net income number. If I look at 2019 and 2020, and I thought it was a 2019 number of approximately $1.6 billion for free cash flow, that looks like a 9% growth rate to the midpoint of our 2020 guidance, which is $1.75 billion.","However, there are two adjustments that are definitely worth considering to make it more of a comfortable apples-to-apples viewpoint. Those related capital additions, which were relatively light in 2019, at $69 million, vis-\u00e0-vis sort of the normal 100-ish run rate, which we're expecting in 2020. And the second impact relates to incentive compensation. Just a quick reminder here, 2018 incentive compensation is paid usually in the first quarter of the following year. So in this case, the first quarter of 2019 and that amount was $169 million.","For 2019, the incentive compensation is paid in the first quarter of 2020, and that amount is $237 million. So, if you adjust the both capital additions and incentive compensation, the underlying growth rates in free cash flow is around the 15%, which is higher than the adjusted EPS growth rate of 11% at the midpoint, and that's something we as a management team feel very comfortable with.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.","Andrew Nicholas","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Even she continues to be a big topic and you've spoken on both those on prior calls about the different things Moody's has done to incorporate ESG into your ratings process, in the business more broadly. I'm wondering as the industry continues to evolve and mature, what you view as the key areas of competitive differentiation between the largest players.","Ray McDaniel","Sure, Rob.","Rob Fauber","Yes, so you're right, just touching on the integration into credit ratings. I think, we're continuing to focus more and more on ESG and climate factors, both with our credit analysis and writing some very extensive research about that in leveraging the Four Twenty Seven and Vigeo Eiris content. So, we think that that presents an opportunity for us to really take a thought leadership position in the credit space around ESG and climate, and really reinforce the relevance of that business.","I talked a little bit earlier in that first answer about, how I think we're going to monetize the ESG opportunity through both the issuer space, and through what I'll call kind of that risk channel. Because, if you think about MA, we've got a huge customer base of banks and insurance companies, as well as fixed income investors and commercial and non-commercial property players, who are coming to us and asking us for ESG and climate contents. And as I said, we're able to sell data feeds, we're able to bundle that into stress tests and scenario analysis. We're able to do training around that. We're bundling it into the REIS platform. So, there's a lot of ways I think we're going to be able to monetize that.","And I see that banking and insurance customer base as a real competitive advantage for us, right. We have a huge installed customer base there. On the issuer side, as the ESG and climate solutions and these ratings and assessments become more and more important to companies, I think the companies are going to want to engage with companies like us, like we do in the credit rating process where you engage with us and the methodologies are transparent. And so, I think that'll be a real opportunity for us because it leverages the model that we have in engaging with our issuers around the world.","Andrew Nicholas","Great, that's helpful, Thank you. And then, just want to touch quickly on structured finance, I think structured finance revenue declined year-over-year which is a pretty big contrast the results of your largest competitor in the quarter. Is there anything you need to call out there with respect to the fourth quarter, whether it would be from a mix or the market share perspective? Thanks.","Ray McDaniel","Sure, I'll let Rob start with this and see if there's anything else I can add.","Rob Fauber","Yes. So the decline in the fourth quarter structure revenue was due almost entirely to CLO. So let me just touch on CLOs for a second and then a few of the other lines in structured finance. Around CLOs, this was primarily from lower MIS rated CLO volumes. And, we had market deal volumes that were down slightly on a year-over-year basis in the quarter, that continues to trend in the CLO market for the full year of 2019, where we saw total deal volumes by our countdown something like 10%.","We're also seeing some headwinds in the CLO market given the wider liability spreads associated with deteriorating lending standards for the underlying collateral, the leverage loans. In terms of coverage, when structured finance investor concerns about risk are lower. We sometimes see less demand for MIS ratings, and that shows up in coverage over time, we're seeing that in certain asset classes that include CLOs in the quarter, given the current credit environment.","Moving to a couple of the other asset classes. We saw some growth in U.S. RMBS, that growth in activity was spurred by pretty attractive spreads and the ABS volumes and revenues were essentially flat. U.S. CMBS which is another important line for us in structured, that revenue grew modestly. The deal activity was pretty robust in the quarter, weighted towards those single assets, single borrower deals. And in general, 2019 was a pretty strong year for CMBS activity. But, as I think we've talked about in the past, it's a particularly competitive rating market.","Europe, I mostly have been talking about the U.S. and Europe was down a bit, again, CLO is the main driver there.","Ray McDaniel","And I just want to emphasize what Rob was saying, in particular, with respect to the very easy access to the capital markets that increasingly low rated credits have had, and in combination with deterioration in loan covenant quality, it's causing us to think very carefully about what the underlying credit quality of assets going into the CLOs are. And we don't think that this is a point in time or point in the credit cycle, where a more liberal approach is really suited.","Andrew Nicholas","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. I know you don't provide specific guidance by quarter. But is there anything to kind of call out from a seasonal perspective? I'm more specifically interested on the margin side to help us model? Thanks.","Ray McDaniel","Mark anything on margin?","Mark Kaye","Jeff, typically there are key elements in the way that I'll think about this is sort of it's called above the line and sort of below the line, because there's a single element I definitely want to touch on in a minute related to tax. But, if I try to think above the line, at least, for 2020 we are expecting a better than expected or higher than expected revenue results, certainly, in the first-half of the year vis-\u00e0-vis the same comfortable period last year. And we're expecting slightly lower growth rates vis-\u00e0-vis revenue in the second-half of the year, just given the way that 2019 and 2020 are being developed.","If I look to items below the line, I think the one item that I've caught here relates to tax. And that's specifically, because the bulk of an excess tax benefits are recognized in the first quarter of every year, is most of the restricted stock base in the first quarter. And we are expecting excess tax benefits and full year 2020 at this point to be around $46 million compared to last year, which were around $44 million. And I think that's something that's we've taken into account, as you think through maybe not margin but EPS seasonality for the year.","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And I know you talked a little bit earlier about some of the potential uncertainty going into the presidential election. And I know, it's way too early to call. But anything else from the political environment in terms of some of the proposals that are out there that could impact your business either positively or negatively over the course of the next few years? Thanks.","Ray McDaniel","Yes, certainly, to the extent that some candidates have taken positions that might be less capital market or business friendly. We like most businesses would be impacted by that. I don't really want to comment on any individual proposals or policy suggestions. But, as any business would, we are paying attention to what the different candidates are saying about how they would govern, if they were to be elected. So, I know that's an open ended answer, but it's really a sort of a stay tuned answer.","Jeff Silber","Okay, fair enough. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","Alright, thanks. Good morning. You expect global debt issuance volumes to be flat in 2020 coming off of a relatively strong year in 2019. With net issuance growth moderating, what's the risk that pricing comes in softer in MIS, particularly among your high yield and infrequent issuers?","Ray McDaniel","No, I don't see that as being a risk to our outlook, particularly, given the fact that we're looking at strong relationships with investment grade issuers and high yield issuers looking to refinance at opportunistic points in time, are going to be most interested in getting to market. And so, I don't think that our expectations around pricing being softer would be a realistic concern at this point.","I would say, that to the extent that issuance declines more than we are anticipating, some pricing relates to issuance, some of it relates to monitoring fees and things of that sort, but some does relate to issuance. And so, we're not immune in the pricing area from a downturn and absolute volumes, just to keep that in mind.","Rob Fauber","The other thing I'd add onto that, that's also why we just keep investing back into the rating business to support the relevance of thought leadership. I mean, that's what you see with Climate and ESG. We've recently started to roll out a portal for our issuer customers, which we've gotten very good feedback about, and all of that is about supporting the value proposition in terms of a relationship.","George Tong","Got it, very helpful. You expect $60 million in gross cost savings in 2020 driven by your restructuring program. How do you expect these cost savings to be split between MIS and MA? And what initiatives do you have to further drive MA margin improvement?","Mark Kaye","Sure. Maybe, I think, the most important point to make here which emphasize here, is that that $60 million run rate savings from the 2019 restructuring program are really what's enabling our 2020 adjusted operating margin improvements, over 100 basis points. And keeping in mind, also, that MA is expected to grow slightly faster than MIS in 2020, which will be high single digits versus mid-single digits. And MA obviously, goes with lower rates, it does naturally limit a little bit of the margin growth over the course of the year.","The actual balance of splits between the restructuring charges that we took in 2019, which seen even between real estate, and people-based action. I don't think there was a particular strong line differentiated between two segments. There\u2019s more between actions around individuals last year and real estate, as well as ongoing efficiencies from M&A integration, I mean, that's sort of the way I would think about it, George.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes, thank you. I want to start off if I could on the cost side. Mark, what was the incentive compensation in the fourth quarter and for the year? And what I'm trying to get to here is, your cost in the fourth quarter, checking out those onetime items you guys call out in your press release, that\u2019s up $50 million from the first quarter. When you guys reported last time, at the very end of October, you thought it would be up less than $10 million versus the first quarter. I would have thought at that stage you probably had a pretty good sense what you thought incentive comp would be, the results were coming pretty well, literally a pretty good amount of incentive comp in the first three quarters. So, what changed so much that costs were up a $40 plus million versus what you thought the very end of October? That's my first question.","Mark Kaye","Sure. And let me start by providing the numbers, and I'll give a little bit of messaging around them. Incentive compensation for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $73 million and that was the full year total for 2019 to $237 million. Just the relative comparable to 2018 fourth quarter was $29 million and full year he was roughly $169 million.","So, if I take those incentive compensation numbers and you look at total operating expenses, on a quarter-by-quarter basis, they were up roughly 7%, vis-\u00e0-vis revenue for the quarter, which was up 16%, vis-\u00e0-vis adjusted EPS which was up 23%. And so incentive compensation was the primary driver of higher than expected expenses in the fourth quarter. A secondary driver was additional severance cost that we took in the fourth quarter. And if we exclude really those two drivers, we're very much in line with the guidance that we had given in the third quarter.","Craig Huber","How much, Mark, was at extra severance costs? I don't think, I saw that in the press release. It must be immaterial?","Mark Kaye","Additional severance cost that we took was approximately $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.","Craig Huber","Okay, thank you for that. And then on the cost, as you think about the cost Mark, for this new year, can you just talk a little bit about the cadence over the course of the year how you think it may ramp up? I know you guys talked about costs for the whole year of low single digits, I believe, as soon as can be obviously down versus this big number you had in the fourth quarter. But, how should this sort of play out over the course of the year, including the acquisition of course? Thank you.","Mark Kaye","Maybe, best place to start here is with expense rent for the year. So we're expecting expense ramp guidance of somewhere between $20 million to $30 million on the first to the fourth quarter of 2020. Now, we are giving guidance for 2020 operating expenses in the low single digit range and this is primarily because merit increases in hiring are benefiting by the actions we took in 2019, through the restructuring program.","And the second thing, I'll note is we do expect incentive compensation to return to more of a normalized level in 2020. So, back to that approximately $50 million per quarter. And the last reason I give is that we are incorporating inorganic acquisitions into our cost guidance as part of that expense ramp. I think for example, RDC, that's really what is part of the reason driving that low single digit for year.","Ray McDaniel","And just as a reminder, RDC has not closed yet and so it is not part of the Q1 expense space, yet. So, that will be part of the ramp.","Craig Huber","And then also Ray, if I could just quickly ask you. Your ratings transaction related revenues were up 32%, your main competitor was up 55%. It was interesting to me that your ratings transaction revenues for the fourth quarter were the third highest of the year, lagging the second and third quarter was, your main competitor, he was the largest of the year in the fourth quarter. Other than your comments about structured finance what else can you point us to the variability there? I mean, it's not normal that there's not much outperformance for one of you guys versus the other and stuff. But what happened in the fourth quarter? Thank you.","Ray McDaniel","I think you've got it Craig. I think it is attributable disruption finance, and the fact that the bulk of structured finance revenues are transactional revenues.","Craig Huber","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked, I just have a couple. It looks like the first month of the year was probably the best high yield issuance, at least for the last 20 years. And then on the flip side, the loans is probably the worst that we've seen in the last 20 years. When we see things like that, I know that loans are often a just kind of a substitute. I mean, they are substitutes for each other. But, how does that play out according to your expectation over as you go through the course of the year? Are you expecting them to kind of converge at some point in time when the refi activity places course with the lower interest rates, if you can just kind of comment on that?","Ray McDaniel","I'll let Rob offer some additional color but, I think in a low rate environment like we're seeing and with the yield curve being as flat as it is, we would expect the fixed rate to continue to be preferred. And so, what we're seeing with the strength in high yield bonds versus loans, I would expect to continue through the year. But Rob may have some additional color on that.","Rob Fauber","Not much to add. I think that's right, Ray. And maybe if we also look at fund flows that gives you a sense of investor sentiment. We had a solid year of fund outflows and leverage loans last year. We have seen a few weeks of inflows in January, the high yield side we've seen funding flows for several weeks to start the year again, I think more investor sentiment, kind of shifting as Ray said towards the fixed rate instruments.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then this may be for Mark, you talked about some of the underlying growth in margin you expect in MA. Is there some commentary you want to give in terms of how that business is shaping in terms of the mix of business within MA? And how we should think about more of the longer-term year-over-year growth opportunity, given what seems to be a lot of headroom in terms of improving the margins over there?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. Maybe, I'll start just a little bit. I think Mark may have touched on this a bit, where there's a good bid of shift going on in the ERS business, and I think that's an important driver of what's going on is. We're moving from that historical, traditional software licensing model with implementation services to much more of a standardized product, that's typically delivered in a hosted environment. And that means you've got it on the cloud and customers are subscribing to that product.","So, what we're seeing from customers is they are interested in that, because it's more efficient and in many cases more cost effective for them, but it is for us as well. So, we're continuing to see that trend in 2019. We think it will continue on into 2020. And that's I think a part of what you're seeing there.","Mark Kaye","And then Shlomo, if I step back and start to think holistically across the two segments, and here I focus maybe my comments a little bit on the adjusted EPS growth of 11% to the midpoint of our range. The majority, I call it, 90% of that is really driven by performance in the underlying segments, either MA and MIS. There is a little bit of supplemental benefit from lower share counts through our share repurchase program, and certainly non-operating income through management of our debt portfolio.","But the point I wanted to highlight here is, we are absorbing around $0.21 worth of margin dilution from the ongoing M&A and investment activity in 2020. And I think that's an important part of the story, that we're not only able to meet our expectations and growth through actions, but also able to invest through the cycle and for the business.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Steven Chang","Hi, this is Steven Chang coming on for Joe. I might have missed it somewhere before, but can you please provide some color on the break down between U.S. International revenue. I know you gave numbers around China specifically, but maybe some numbers on a broader level and moving forward, I might have missed it on a press release, but should we no longer expect those numbers in the future?","Ray McDaniel","Yes, sure. Sorry. Go ahead, Mark.","Mark Kaye","Sure. So, in terms of that mix of the U.S. non-U.S. revenue, we're a little bit around 50-50. I mean, it's obviously very different between MIS and MA, but not materially so across periods of time. And we certainly have removed specific U.S. non-U.S. guidance because of several reasons.","First is the geographic revenue mix has remained fairly stable over time. And we also noticed that in field is an outlier in providing the geographic revenue guidance. And we really prefer to focus on those metrics that are used most often and most helpful to sell-side analysts and investors. We will continue to report the actual U.S. non-U.S. revenue mix in our Form 10-K and 10-Q. So, you will be able to get it there and as you probably know, very stable over time.","Ray McDaniel","And just if you'd like to get the percentage split for 2019, for MIS, we were 40% international 60% U.S. For Moody's Analytics we were 58% international 42% U.S. And then for the corporation overall it was 47% international, 53% U.S.","Steven Chang","Okay, great. That's helpful. And just one quick one. I know this probably has been answered throughout the whole call, but I'm just looking at the 48 to 49 margin range. I know you talked about a good chunk of it coming from cost savings in the MA business, especially RDC. But I just was wondering if there are any other factors baked into that 100 bps that maybe we should know about? Thank you.","Mark Kaye","I think there are probably - one point, I'll reemphasize and then one point I'll add, certainly the relative growth rates of the segments do make a difference. And then the point, I would add, is that we've also as a management team identified around $13 million of 2020 expense efficiencies that will fund like amount growth initiatives, which include ESG, China, KYC, and some of the enabling technologies. So, not just relying on past actions to support the margin, but ensuring that we are being efficient as a team and to support ongoing investments in the business.","Operator","The next question will come from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","Bill Warmington","Good afternoon, everyone. So, a question for you on the KYC space. Now that you've combined BvD and RDC and you've got about $150 million run rate in a $900 million market. Who's really the competition there now? And with the RDC acquisition, do you have what you need to take share there?","Ray McDaniel","Yes, Rob.","Rob Fauber","Yes. So, the primary players in this space, Refinitiv, LexisNexis, Dun and Bradstreet and there's a whole host of other players in the market. We do think that this gives us a very good offering in the market. As I talked about earlier, it's very, very complementary fit between what RDC has got and what we've got. And we think that's really going to be a good solution for the customers.","The other thing I might mention is, they've got a very hard to replicate data set at RDC. And part of the real value in that data set is that it can be used to train these AI models. And the reason that's important is, because those AI powered solutions are going to be able to deliver some significant efficiencies to the customers. There's an enormous amount of spend and manual effort going on at financial institutions and corporations all over the world to comply with KYC. So, we think these AI solutions are going to be a very compelling offering for customers.","Ray McDaniel","And I would just like to add that that spend that Rob is referring to is on top of the $900 million market opportunity that we see. So, there is a direct $900 million market and then there is a very large expense base that goes on top of that for firms that are trying to meet, know-your-customer requirements.","Rob Fauber","Yes, there's the vendor spend in a very large, much larger in-house spend at all these financial institutions that Ray is always talking about.","Ray McDaniel","Just one other thing I'd add. We talked about how complementary these data sets are, which they are, but it's also, we see a very nice fit in terms of where RDCs geographic strength is, which is here in the United States versus Bureau van Dijk which has about 70%, 75% of its customer base coming from Europe. So, the sales functions and the reach that we have for each of these businesses under a Moody's umbrella is now for the first time truly global for these firms.","Bill Warmington","Thank you for that. And for my follow-up, I want to ask an ESG question. And you've given us some good color today on the rating agencies and what you guys are doing specifically, within ESG. I wanted to ask about how you're seeing competition from two other places, one, the index providers, and the second is the data providers who are then going direct to the investment managers?","Rob Fauber","So, the index providers, ESG is very natural space for them, right, because they're able to build a whole suite of indices off of the ESG data and ratings. As I said, we don't have an index business but what we do have is a very large customer base that I talked about in banks, financial institutions and insurance companies. And we're seeing demand there. So, we think we're going to be able to monetize the ESG content a little differently than some of our competitors who are going to be able to monetize it, and are commercializing it very effectively in the index space.","Look, data is very, very important. It's kind of the fuel to all of this. But ultimately, we don't think and I tend to think it's not just going to be a data market, I think there will be a need for insights and assessments. And as I talked about, the more important that these - do you want to call them ESG ratings become, the more I think that the customers are going to want to engage with somebody around that rating or assessment. So, that's my sense. So, there will be a real need for data and data feeding investment managers for portfolio screening and selection and all that, but I think there is also going to be a need for insights.","Bill Warmington","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Ray McDaniel for any additional or closing remarks.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. I just want to thank everyone for joining. We will see some of you at our Investor Day, I hope. And, we will be speaking with everyone again in the spring. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes Moody's fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call.

Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's third quarter 2012 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. I will then finish with several comments on the current regulatory environment and our outlook for the remainder of 2012. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","Third quarter revenue of $689 million, increased 30% over the prior-year period, and was the highest quarterly revenue Moody's has achieved in its history. We benefited from double-digit revenue growth in all lines of business at MIS, with particularly strong performance in corporate finance, as well as continued strong growth in all areas of Moody's Analytics.","Expenses for the third quarter were $419 million, a 25% increase from the third quarter of 2011. Operating income for the third quarter was $270 million, a 38% increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $294 million, up 36% from the same period last year.","Diluted earnings per share of $0.81 for the third quarter, which included a $0.06 legacy tax benefit, increased 42% from the prior-year period. Excluding the legacy tax benefit in the current quarter, diluted earnings per share of $0.75 for the third quarter of 2012, were up 32% from the prior-year period. Based on strong third quarter performance, we are raising our 2012 EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.05, or $2.89 to $2.99, excluding legacy tax benefit in the third quarter.","Turning to year-to-date performance. Revenue for the first nine months of 2012 was $2 billion, a 15% increase from the first nine months of 2011. Revenue of Moody's Investor Service was $1.4 billion for the first nine months of 2012, an increase of 14% from a year ago.","Moody's Analytics revenue of $609 million was 19% higher than the prior-year period. Expenses for the first nine months of 2012 were $1.2 billion, up 16% from the prior-year period. Operating income of $817 million increased 14% from $716 million for the same period of 2011. Diluted earnings per share of $2.34 for the first nine months of 2012, which included the $0.06 legacy tax benefit increased 14% from the prior-year period.","I'll now turn the call over to Linda, to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda Huber","Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the quarter increased 30% to $689 million. U.S. third quarter revenue increased 37% to $375 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 22% to $313 million and represented 45% of Moody's total revenue, down slightly from 48% in the year-ago period. Recurring revenue of $346 million represented 50% of the total, down from 59% in the prior-year period.","Looking now at each of our businesses, Moody's Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $474 million, up 35% from the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 4%. U.S. revenue for MIS increased 45% over the prior-year period. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 21% and represented 39% of total ratings revenue.","Global corporate finance revenue in the third quarter increased 71% from the year-ago period to $221 million. Revenue was up 81% year-over-year in the U.S., primarily driven by issuance in the speculative grade market, including high-yield bonds and bank loans. Investment grade issuance was also strong in the U.S. The corporation is taking advantage of historically low rates. Outside the U.S., corporate finance revenue grew 53%, primarily reflecting increased investment grade issuance across all regions.","Global structured finance revenue for the third quarter was $93 million, 14% above the prior-year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 27% year-over-year, primarily due to strong issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligation. International structured finance revenue was essentially flat to the prior-year period.","Global financial institutions revenue of $83 million increased 15% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was up 22% as compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily driven by increased insurance company issuance, corporate financing and debt-funded M&A activity. Non-U.S. revenue was up 10%, primarily due to increased issuance in Latin America and Asia, prompted by refinancing of short-term debt, credit expansion due to economic growth, and reduced lending by European banks in this regions.","Global revenue for the public, project and infrastructure business rose 13% year-over-year to $77 million. Revenue was up 11% in the U.S., primarily due to gains in public and infrastructure finance, while non-U.S. revenue increased 16%, reflecting growth in European infrastructure finance.","And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for Moody's Analytics of $215 million was up 20% from the third quarter of 2011. Slightly more than half of the growth was from the late 2011 acquisitions of Copal Partners and Barrie & Hibbert. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 21%. U.S. revenue grew by 14% year-over-year to $86 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 23% to $129 million, and represented 60% of total Moody's Analytics revenue.","Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $124 million increased 7% from the prior-year period and represented 58% of total MA revenue. We continue to see demand for credit research via our CreditView offering as well as new sales of our other analytic data and analytics product.","Revenues from enterprise risk solutions of $64 million grew 26% from last year, reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, and strong growth in products and services that support the regulatory compliance needs of our financial services customers. Due to the variable nature of project timing, enterprise risk solutions revenue remain subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue grew 97% to $27 million, reflecting the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.","Turning now to expenses. Moody's third quarter expenses were $419 million, an increase of 25% compared to third quarter of 2011 or a 27% increase, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Higher accruals for incentive compensation and Moody's profit sharing plan, reflecting a stronger full year outlook accounting for about half of the year-on-year expense growth.","More specifically, we recorded additional incentive compensation in the third quarter to align with stronger than expected year-to-date financial performance, and the increased full year outlook as reflected in our updated guidance. Therefore, incentive compensation for the third quarter was $59 million versus $28 million in each of the first and second quarters.","Additionally, in the third quarter, we recorded approximately $8 million of profit sharing expense, given the increase in our EPS guidance. As you may remember, our 2012 compensation plan were profit sharing, when our pro forma EPS grows more than 10% from the prior-year period. Our current pro forma EPS guidance results in a growth of over 10% from 2011's pro forma EPS, whereas our guidance at the end of the second quarter did not.","Excluding growth in incentive compensation and profit sharing, expenses for the third quarter were 15% higher from the prior-year period, primarily due to increased headcount from growth in our existing businesses and from acquisitions in late 2011. Moody's reported operating margin expanded 230 basis points year-over-year from 36.9% in the third quarter of 2011 to 39.2% for the current quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 42.7% for the quarter, up from 40.5% for the same period last year.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5% compared with 28.5% for the prior-year period. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to lower taxes in 2011 resulting from the settlement of state tax audit, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign tax planning initiatives in 2012.","Now, I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter of 2012, Moody's repurchased 600,000 shares at a total cost of $25 million and issued 1.2 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plan. Shares outstanding as of September 30, 2012, totaled 223 million, essentially flat from the year earlier.","As of quarter-end, Moody's had $700 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. We now expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $225 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.","As of September 30, Moody's had $1.7 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2012, an increase of $664 million from a year earlier, largely due to our $500 million bond deal in August this year. As of September 30, 2012, approximately 52% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S.","For the first nine months of 2012, free cash flow was $461 million, a decrease of $152 million from a year ago, due in part to payments of approximately $121 million related to the settlement of state and local tax matters as well as movement in other working capital accounts. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray.","Raymond McDaniel","Thanks, Linda. I'll continue with comments on our regulatory environment, which has not changed materially since the update we provided during our second quarter earnings call.","In the U.S., the SEC's rulemaking pursuant to Dodd-Frank is pending. The timing is uncertain regarding final rules relevant to NRSROs as well as the feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocation rating assignments for structured finance products. Both banking and securities regulatory authorities continue to assess their use of ratings and regulation and are in the process of developing potential alternative measures as replacements.","Turning to Europe, as discussed on previous calls, in November 2011, the European Commission released new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry, commonly referred to as CRA3. The European legislative process requires that the European Parliament and the Council of Finance Ministers of the individual EU member states, each produce its own version of the text, and then enter into discussions with the Commission. During these discussions, the three institutions seek to resolve any differences among their respective drafts, and once the compromised document is produced, put to a vote.","In May and June of 2012, the Council and the Parliament respectively finalized their positions on CRA3. The discussions among the three institutions are underway. However, currently we can't predict the timeline for finalization of CRA3 with any degree of precision. Additionally, it's still too early to assess what the likely outcome of these deliberations will be. As always, we will continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that aligns with the G20 statements and directives.","I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance. Moody's outlook for the remainder of 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing, and securitization, and the amount of debt issued.","There's an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, especially as they relate to Europe. And if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody's results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates.","As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our 2012 EPS guidance to a range of $2.95 to $3.05 from the previous range of $2.76 to $2.86. Full year pro forma EPS, which excludes the impact of a legacy tax benefit, is now expected to be in the range of $2.89 to $2.99.","Certain components of our 2012 guidance have also been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions. For Moody's overall, the company now expects full year 2012 revenue to grow in the mid-teens percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also now projected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Full year 2012 operating margin is now projected to be approximately 40% and adjusted operating margin for the year is still expected to be approximately 43%. Our effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 32%.","As Linda mentioned earlier, we now expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $225 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately $40 million to $50 million, and we still expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is now projected to be approximately $15 million.","For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2012 is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is now expected to increase in the low-20s percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single digit percent range.","Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the mid-20s percent range. Revenue from structured finance is expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. Financial institutions revenue is now expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. And public project and infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.","For Moody's Analytics, full year 2012 revenue is still expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is expected to increase in the high-teens to 20% range. Non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Research, data and analytics is now projected to grow in the high-single digit percent range.","While revenue growth is still projected in the low-20s percent range for enterprise risk solutions, reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert as well as growth in the base business. Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 70%, reflecting revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners.","In closing, I'd like to point out a couple of additional positive developments at Moody's. Moody's Investors Service was voted the best credit rating agency in 2012 poll of U.S. fixed-income investors, conducted by the well-known publisher, Institutional Investor. Also this past week, Automatic Data Processing Incorporated, a leading provider of business outsourcing solutions announced that it has chosen to collaborate with Moody's Analytics to enhance widely followed ADP National Employment Report. I am extremely pleased with the accomplishments of both businesses and appreciate the market's recognition of our efforts.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is, Michel Madelain, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics.","We'd be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","Ray, based on the guidance, obviously it implies you're seeing some pretty good momentum going into the fourth quarter. Anything interesting or different you can share with us in terms of what you're seeing in the fourth quarter in terms of assets classes or other activity in the market?","Raymond McDaniel","Not a whole lot of additional color I can give you, Peter, other than we continue to see good issuance pipelines, especially in corporate finance, it's obviously in terms of sequential growth from the third quarter. It's going to be difficult to achieve that matter, because the issuance was so robust in the third quarter, and we have some external events, such as the election in a couple of short months, in the fourth quarter. But nonetheless, we still see healthy pipelines. And barring something really unanticipated, I think we believe the fourth quarter will be another good quarter.","Linda Huber","Let me speak a little bit about what we're seeing in pipelines, and then in high yield and leveraged pipeline. First looking at high grade and all this information comes from Morgan Stanley as of this morning.","October, right now, stands at $78 billion of issuance for U.S. high grades and that has been the strongest October on record. The month could break $100 billion, if some big deals that are said to be in the pipeline come next week. But we did experience a warning regarding potential weather delays, which is something new.","For November, expectations are about $70 billion for U.S. hybrid issuance, last year it was $77 billion and the average is about $63 billion, so a little bit above the average for November. For high yield and leveraged, last week we saw $12 billion in high-yield issuance and $9.3 billion in leverage loan, that's still very active. This week we've seen $7.5 billion both in high yield and in leverage loan. October saw $41 billion in high yields and $32 billion in leverage loans. Our Q3 issuance was a record post of financial crisis for the leveraged area, $112 billion in high-yield issuance for the third quarter and $81 billion in leverage loans.","As Ray said, the fourth quarter will not be as strong as the third quarter, but will still be very active. The list of pipeline so far that can be seen for November is $19 billion in high yield and $10 billion in leverage loans. And again, a bit of concern that the first week of November could be low, due to the weather and then following with the elections, and obviously the usual watch outs for anything changing in the European situation.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","I thought it was particularly noteworthy that it looked like the structured finance market seems like it's got some signs of life. Do you have a view on the sustainability or a broadening of that recovery going into '13?","Raymond McDaniel","The structured finance market has been showing year-over-year sequential growth, pretty steady. And I think that's an indication of good, if not spectacular recovery in that market. Commercial mortgage-backed securities, CLOs, the asset-backed market, covered bonds are the more promising sectors.","We still don't anticipate a big rebound in 2013 in the residential mortgage-backed securities area. But I guess the further reason for optimism in that sector is, we seem to be moving away from some of the more regulatory-driven causes of issuance into more real market issuance, and I would take that as a sign of health.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","And I guess all this gets to the big issue, Ray, which is you've enjoyed very robust performance here in the second half of '12, making the comps more challenging in '13. So do you have any early thoughts in terms of how next year could play out?","Raymond McDaniel","We will provide our outlook for 2013 at the beginning of the year, as we do normally. And so I'll refrain from commenting on our outlook at this point.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","One last try then. On the cost side of equation, Linda, the rate of cost growth obviously has been pretty robust this year in the context of all the reasons you guys have laid out. How do we think about that going forward?","Linda Huber","I just wanted to touch on the actual expense growth for this year. And if you look at the Q3 year-over-year, you'll see that last year we had $335 million of expenses, this year in the third quarter we had $418 million of expenses. The vast majority of that change, $59 million or 70% of that, is compensation. So very important to remember that three times this year we've increased guidance, and the main driver of expense increase is in fact the over-performance and the resulting incentive compensation, which results.","Another cause of expense growth is our acquisitions, which added $18 million to the expenses in the third quarter. Now, some of that breaks out into compensation for new people, about $10 million of it. We had the increase in depreciation and amortization and some other non-comp expenses, and then we have a few other things in there. But again, if you look at the expense increase, which is 25% year-over-year, it would be 15% without the incentive compensation.","So probably the best way to think about it is, if we normalize back to more normal performance last year. We try as hard as we can to have expense growth not exceed, and in fact be less than revenue growth. So we'll see where get to, as Ray said, for that in 2013. But we're mindful of expense growth, but this is a very fast growing business and we are continuing to support it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from William Bird with Lazard.","William Bird - Lazard","Ray, I'm curious, if you think you're seeing much pull-forward effect from fiscal cliff dynamics. And then second, I was wondering, if you could just discuss kind of what needs to happen to buyback more stock?","Raymond McDaniel","I'll start with the pull forward. I think it's clear that we have seen pull-forward throughout this year, including in the third quarter. So firms are looking at the potential for some market uncertainty around the fiscal cliff, potentially as developments occur in Europe. And they are taking advantage of low official rates and good spreads, not historically tight spreads, but good.","That being said, much of the activity that we have seen this year, most of the activity continues to be refinancing, as oppose to issuance for mergers and acquisitions, and business expansion, share repurchase, et cetera. So similar to comments I've made in the last couple of quarters, it has been a very powerful refinancing engine that we have been experiencing over the course of the year. But most of the traditional drivers of debt issuance have really not been very strong this year and so. And that's what we'll be looking for going into 2013, 2014. Linda, do you want to take the share repurchase?","Linda Huber","On share repurchase for the third quarter, as we said, we set $25 million, which is frankly less than we had hoped. We couldn't place our systematic share repurchase program and following our Investor Day, the stock price moved quite rapidly and in fact out of our repurchase zone.","Because we realized that our performance was pretty good, we could not go back into the market opportunistically. So given the revised guidance, we're hoping to get back into share repurchase market here in the fourth quarter and be able to make some progress. But all of that of course is depended on market conditions.","Operator","And we'll continue on to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","I appreciate you guys breaking out the transaction versus relationship across the categories in your press release, I do have one of those similar question. If you could break apart within your four main categories, like the corporate finance breakout for high yield revenues, bank loans, investment grade by percentages, each of the categories?","Linda Huber","Sure, Craig, we can do that. We were thinking of calling Page 14 in the earnings release, the credit table. But going on to the revenue for corporate finance third quarter of 2012; total dollar corporate finance issuance $220.7 million; investment grade comprised of $55 million of that or about 25%; high yield was $52 million or 24% of the corporate finance total; bank loans $36.5 million or 17%; and other accounts $77 million or 35%. The big movement there year-over-year for the third quarter increased in the high-yield percentage, which basically doubled as a component from last year to this year, Craig. So that's a strong driver as well as the increase in the bank loans line.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Like we do it for structured finance and financial institutions, et cetera?","Linda Huber","Going on to structured for third quarter: total issuance $93.1 million, up from $82 million of this quarter last year; so asset-backed securities $25.7 million, 28% of the total; residential mortgage-backed securities, which does include covered bonds, $20.3 million, 22% of the total; commercial real estate finance $23.6 million, which is 25% of the total; and derivatives $23.4 million, which is 25% of the total.","Now, the bigger changes there would be, as Ray had noted in the commercial real estate lines, and also interestingly in the derivatives line, we saw more CLO issuance thus far in 2012 than we did in the entire period of 2008 to 2011. In fact, last week, there were five CLOs. So that market is doing quite well.","Let me go on and go to financial institutions group, total revenue for the quarter $82.7 million, banking about $57 million of that or 69%; insurance $21 million, 26% of it; and managed investments $4.6 million, about 6% of the total; and each of those lines are pretty consistent to what we saw last year.","For PPIF, $77 million for the quarter, $38 million in public finance and sovereign, 49% of the total; munis $4.4 million, 6% of the total; and project and infrastructure $34.5 million, about 45% of the total; so everything now looks relatively similar, little bit of an increase in project and infrastructure. Interestingly some of that out of in Europe, we understand that the ECB bond buying has created a bit of a more favorable environment for that type of issuance in Europe. Is that everything you need, Craig.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","On that front, yes. And If I could ask couple of questions please. One on incentive compensation, you mentioned $59 million up from a year ago, or you have the total numbers, $59 million versus $28 million, each of the first two quarters. First off, how does that breakdown between operating costs and SG&A within the quarter please, so that we can get a sense?","Linda Huber","We don't disclose that Craig. Generally commissions go in SG&A, and the incentive comps attracts to what each individual person is doing for the company, but we don't have that split out.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Can you say if generally is it heavy the one way or the other?","Raymond McDaniel","No, we don't disclose that Craig.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Then how should we think about that number for the fourth quarter assuming you had, say the mid-point of your new guidance here?","Linda Huber","Sure. We did $28 million and $59 million for the third quarter. We're thinking that for the fourth quarter. If we hit the mid-point of our guidance probably want to look at about $40 million for incentive compensation, which also includes a piece for profit sharing.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","And then I also want to ask you generally, just big picture here, when you guys look at your cost aside from incentive compensation, what else do you consider variable. For example, you do or save an incremental 10 extra debt issuance deals here. What's your variable cost aside from incentive compensation, going over little bit extra top T&E expense, but was there anything else really?","Linda Huber","I think the main majority of it would be what does go through the bonus line. I think, as Ray just said that each additional dollar of revenue, once we've covered the fixed cost would probably still come down to about $0.60 on the margin line, but it depends if there is anything unusual going on for that quarter, Craig.","Raymond McDaniel","And pacing of hiring and whether we dial that back or dial that up, it's also source of flexibility, but to the extent that we think the market conditions are reacting to short term cycles, we would want to continue to invest back in our personnel and our business. And similarly for various kinds of projects, whether they are IT-related or other projects, we have the ability in some areas to accelerate or decelerate in response to conditions.","Linda Huber","Craig, something that might interest you, since yearend last year, excluding our acquisitions we've hired about 330 people, that's 7% growth excluding acquisitions. Interestingly, about 200 of those are for Moody's Analytics, 110 or so are for the rating agency, and only 20 of those are for shared services. So 90% plus of the people that we've added this year are all for the revenue driving part of the business, not for the staff part of the business. So that's kind of give you some idea as to the balance and what we're trying to achieve.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","And my last question please. Just you gave out your the backlogs out there. I'm curious, if you could talk a little bit further about the fiscal cliff issue, the debt issuance that's going to get raised here in Washington D.C. The election, just in general, what's your thought as we get later in this year and into early next year? You sense any hesitation out there in debt issuance front, if things get pushed out, or is that all being pull-forward?","Raymond McDaniel","I do think there is some pull-forward. I think firms are being somewhat opportunistic. The environment is good for issuance right now. And so if you're thinking about issuance in the near-term, this is a good time to be doing it.","Historically, we have not seen any correlation in bond issuance activity based on election outcomes. So that, at least in terms of what we've seen in the past would not be an important determinant of issuance activity going forward. And again, the fiscal cliff is going to inevitably create headlines just as what's going on in Europe creates headlines, and that a very short-term windows week-to-week, where the market participants are feeling more optimistic or more pessimistic. So I expect we're going to see choppiness going into the New Year, but nothing that's going to freeze up markets.","Operator","And we'll go to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","First question, given the hiring statistics you just gave out, is that a good sense of how over the long term, sort of the break out investments being made into the businesses are going to be, just in terms if trying to model where the expense growth is going to come next year and the years forward?","Linda Huber","Manav, looking at my colleagues here who are running the lines of business that generate revenue, I think they are probably pretty happy with those total splits. We have had increases on the staff side for regulatory compliance, IT and other such things. And we hope we've come largely thorough that as we have said on previous calls.","We will continue to add headcounts to drive very strong growth in both of these businesses. But it does take investment in people and resources to achieve double-digit revenue growth, which is pretty unusual in terms of the companies that have been reporting this week. We're feeling pretty good about these numbers, but we will need to continue to invest. And hopefully yes, that will continue to go to the revenue generating part of the business.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","In terms of the regulatory compliance expansion of the $15 million that you have got or incremental $15 million that you guided for this year, I understand Europe, we don't know yet, but excluding that, does that incremental $15 million imply that, other than that there is not much more incremental expense required for what we already know about?","Linda Huber","I think we've come through some of that, but not all of it. As Ray stated in his prepared remarks, we do not yet have fully final rules on Dodd-Frank from the SEC. So it would be premature for us to say that we're through everything, yet. And as Ray also said, we don't know what the timing or the final shape of the CRA3 will be which makes it pretty difficult to put numbers on things.","Raymond McDaniel","At this point it's been a bit easier for us to plan and spend around the anticipated SEC rules, because we feel we have a better idea of what the final rules are likely to look like. The CRA3 situation in Europe again is more uncertain, in more of a speculative stage in terms of what the final product is going to look like, and how we will have to react at over what timeframe.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","And one last one, I think you explained why I guess the share buyback guidance came down from what you said last month. I was just curious, if you could explain why the CapEx number is dropping so much?","Linda Huber","Sure. We've basically just re-scheduled some of the things we're planning to do here going into the end of the year. We wait for final Dodd-Frank Rules, and frankly we've held some capacities to deal with that. So it's nothing more than just trying to figure out what has to go first, and what we can do going next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Doug Arthur - Evercore","So two questions, Ray, I'm wondering if you can just update us on CalPERS. There has been a lot of motions and moves between district court and appellate court. And so I'm just interested as to where that stands right now on a timing point of view? Then Linda, there seems like there's a lot of different trends in your financial area right now. Insurance was very strong in the third quarter. Was that a one-off thing or do you see that continuing? And this de-leveraging issue with the banks. Is that likely to keep the banking side of financial institutions slow for a while? So I'm just kind of interested in different trends there.","Raymond McDaniel","Sure, I'll start with CalPERS. There's not a lot new in recent months in the CalPERS litigation. As we mentioned on a prior earnings call, we filed an appeal in the California Court of Appeals seeking reversal of the lower court's decision, which deny our motion to dismiss under this anti-SLAPP statute in California. And the briefing on that appeal is not going to be completed until the end of the year. And after that the court will set a date for all arguments. So currently we don't know when the case will be argued or when it will be decided. So it's moving along quite slowly.","With respect to de-leveraging and the banking sector, I'll make just a quick comment and then Linda or Michel may wish to add to that. The de-leveraging is continuing. We are seeing reduction in bank loans, particularly in Europe and the de-leveraging that's associated with that. We believe that is going to continue for a relatively long time as the banking system retrenches.","The benefit of that as we've talked about is that that encourages corporations and municipal entities to go to the bond market and seek ratings. And our financial institutions area is the area that is most dominated of the ratings businesses by recurring revenue. Majority of our revenue in that area is recurring, and so we are less sensitive to the de-leveraging in that area. We also don't get the benefits of banks leveraging up when they do that, but in this environment we get the benefit of not having revenue reductions in the same degree that there is de-leveraging or retrenching.","Linda Huber","And to follow-up Doug, insurance year-over-year in Q3 moved from $18.5 million last year to $21.3 million this year. So it's a whole $2.8 million difference. It's not enormous. The guidance for FIG now is to increase in the mid-single digits for this year, which is up from flat to slightly up, which is what we had previously. So we expect that the activity will continue. It's not the biggest grower amongst our revenue lines.","Douglas Arthur - Evercore","And just as a follow-up on the de-leveraging in Europe. The Yankee Bond situation where corporations in Europe are coming over to the U.S. to issue, I mean that has been strong, and is that becoming a really sizable sector for you now or not yet?","Raymond McDaniel","Yes, it has been strong this year and much stronger than we've seen in previous years. How enduring a phenomenon that would be I think is somewhat uncertain. Right now, more than interest and risk coming from the U.S. investors than European investors, and so the European issuers have taken advantage of that. Whether that is going to change and the issuance will revert back to the EU going forward is uncertain, but I think we're in a position to rating in either case.","Operator","Bill Warmington with Raymond James, have the next question.","William Warmington - Raymond James","A question for you on Copal, and the strong growth that you're putting up there. Once you anniversary the acquisition, what kind of organic growth rate do you think you can generate there?","Raymond McDaniel","I'll let Mark Almeida address that, Bill.","Mark Almeida","I don't think we've disclosed an outlook for the professional services business, which is where the Copal segment wise for 2013. But it's a relatively high growth business. It won't be our highest growth business, but it's a good strong double-digit growth business. I think that's better as much insight as we can offer at this stage.","William Warmington - Raymond James","Then one question for you on the residential and mortgage-backed security market, just your thoughts on what needs to happen there before we see that market come back in size?","Raymond McDaniel","I guess I'll put it in two categories. One, there are some incremental things that can be done in terms of reducing mortgage qualification limit for that converted Fannie and Freddie. And that would move more of the market to the private label market, and would be more likely to be rated. But then there is the bigger structural question of the role that the government is going to play in the mortgage market on a long-term basis. And that is a politically, and fiscally, very, very changeling side of issues that the government is going to have to deal with. And so that's why we are cautious about any sizable expansion of the RMBS market in the near-term because of the dismal political dynamics.","William Warmington - Raymond James","And then one final question on enterprise risk. Just what products within that segment are driving the growth and how long is the tails on those products?","Raymond McDaniel","When you say tail on the products, do you mean the sale or the actual product placement?","William Warmington - Raymond James","And the ongoing of revenue generated by the product?","Mark Almeida","Yes, well the ERS segment is doing very, very well, largely driven by regulatory driven demand that we're seeing from our banking and insurance customers. And we would expect to continue to see very healthy demand for that product at over the next couple of years.","Operator","And we'll take a follow-up from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","So Ray, just a follow-on to your comments earlier about what's going on in Europe. Is it possible to get any quantification around this concept of disintermediation, and how big you see the market opportunity from that?","Raymond McDaniel","Well, we've talked about it not specifically in the European sense, but in terms of the impact of disintermediation on our overall revenue growth is being a couple of points. And it's both anticipating what is happening from de-leveraging, but it's also looking at the pace at, which we have been getting new rating mandates over the last few years and that has been a reasonably steady pace.","And in Europe coming, it's associated more with the stress in the banking sector, and in places like Asia it has been associated more with economic growth outpacing banking system capacity. So the underlying drivers of the disintermediation changed a bit by geography, but the consequence, the overall number of ratings mandates has been increasing, as I said at a pretty steady rate.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","I guess I was wondering if maybe given the turmoil in Europe, the one or two percentage point incremental revenue from disintermediation, that seems like that potentially could be conservative on the near term basis. What do you think?","Raymond McDaniel","No, I don't think so. I hope I am wrong. But part of the turmoil in Europe is also corporations taking a conservative posture with respect to borrowing and business. And so even though, if they were to need additional capital, or desire additional capital, they are more likely to go to the bond market. They are also in a defensive mode, and so that's an offset.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no additional questions. I would like to turn things back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Raymond McDaniel","I just want to thank you for joining the call today. We look forward to speaking with you, again after the New Year. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel.","Ray McDaniel","Thank you, Salli. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining today\u2019s call. I\u2019ll begin by summarizing Moody\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights and I\u2019ll then speak to recent regulatory developments and finish with comments on our outlook for 2012. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to respond to your questions.","Fourth quarter revenue of $567 million was flat as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. With strong performance by Moody\u2019s Analytics and global structured finance offsetting a decline from the strong prior year period in corporate finance. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $172 million, a 12% decrease from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.43 decreased 26% year-over-year.","For full year 2011, Moody\u2019s revenue of $2.3 billion was a 12% increase from full year 2010. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted Moody\u2019s Investors Service revenue by $28 million and was negligible for Moody\u2019s Analytics. Operating income of $888 million increased 15% from a year ago and included a $4 million favorable impact from foreign currency translations.","Revenue at Moody\u2019s Investors Service was $1.6 billion, an increase of 12% from last year. Moody\u2019s Analytics revenue was $712 million, 14% higher than the prior year. Diluted earnings per share of $2.49 for 2011 increased 16% and included a legacy tax benefit of $0.03 in the second quarter of 2011 as well as other tax benefits of $0.09 in the second and third quarters of 2011 resulting from a favorable tax ruling in a settlement of state tax audits.","I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates.","Linda Huber","Thanks, Ray. I\u2019ll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody\u2019s total revenue for the quarter was essentially flat at $567 million. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. U.S. fourth quarter revenue decreased 3% to $286 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 4% to $281 million and represented 50% of Moody\u2019s total revenue, up from 48% in the year ago period. Recurring revenue of $318 million represented 56% of the total, compared to 52% in the prior year period.","And looking now at each of our businesses, Moody\u2019s Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $367 million, a 4% decrease year-over-year. U.S. revenue decreased 9% over the prior year period, while outside the U.S. revenue increased 2% and represented 44% of total ratings revenue.","Global corporate finance revenue in the fourth quarter decreased 14% from the year ago period to $141 million. Revenue was down 13% in the U.S. while outside the U.S. revenue was lower by 16% year-over-year. The decline in global corporate finance revenue reflected weaker issuance, primarily in speculative grade bonds and loans in both the U.S. and Europe.","Global structured finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $87 million, 14% above the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 13% year-over-year primarily due to strength in asset-backed securities. Most other areas of U.S. structured finance market remained weak. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue rose 15%, driven primarily by European asset-backed and residential mortgage backed securities, as well as covered bonds in Europe and Asia.","Global financial institutions revenue of $67 million increased 2% from the same quarter in 2010, with U.S. revenue declining 7%, while non-U.S. revenue grew 7%.","Global revenue for public, project and Infrastructure declined 6% year-over-year to $72 million. Revenue decreased 14% in the U.S., reflecting a reduction in new financing for projects and infrastructure programs. Non-U.S. revenue increased 14% primarily due to gains in the infrastructure sector.","And turning now to Moody\u2019s Analytics, global revenue for Moody\u2019s Analytics of $200 million is up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2010. U.S. revenue grew by 15% year-over-year to $81 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 7% to $119 million and represented 60% of total Moody\u2019s Analytics revenue. Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $115 million increased 6% from the prior-year period due primarily to higher customer retention rates and represented 58% of total MA revenue.","Revenue from risk management software of $56 million fell 3% from last year\u2019s record revenue in this segment. Due to the variable nature of project timing, risk management software revenue remained subject to quarterly volatility. The December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert had a negligible impact on software revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. Professional services revenue doubled to $29 million reflecting both organic growth and the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.","Moody\u2019s fourth quarter expenses were $395 million, an increase of 7% compared to fourth quarter 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation on fourth quarter expenses was negligible. Moody\u2019s reported operating margin for the quarter was 30.3%, down from 34.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to increased head count and technology investments to support growth initiatives, as well as acquisition related costs. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37% compared with 19.5% for the prior-year period. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to utilization of foreign tax credits and lower state taxes in 2010.","Now I\u2019ll provide an update on capital allocation. Moody\u2019s increased its quarterly dividend on December 14 by 14% to $0.16 per share of common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2011, Moody\u2019s did not repurchase any shares, but did issue 0.4 million shares under employee stock based compensation plans. For the full year 2011, Moody\u2019s repurchased 11 million shares at a total cost of $334 million for an average price of $30.30 per share and issued 2.9 million shares under employee based stock compensation plans.","Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2011, totaled $222 million, representing a 4% decline from a year earlier. As of year-end, Moody\u2019s had $0.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. As of December 31, Moody\u2019s had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $760 million, an increase of $100 million from a year earlier. Approximately 70% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity. Share repurchase remains subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ray.","Ray McDaniel","Thanks, Linda. I\u2019ll continue with an update on regulatory developments. In the U.S., regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the SEC\u2019s summer comment deadline for rule proposals relevant to NRSROs, the SEC recently revised its timetable and is expected to adopt final rules by year-end 2012.","It is also expected to publish its feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products, otherwise known as the Franken Amendment, by about the same time. Both banking and securities regulatory authorities are in the process of reviewing their use of ratings and regulation and considering alternative measures as replacements.","Turing to Europe, Moody\u2019s was registered in the European Union in late October 2011, and as I have indicated on previous calls, the transfer of oversight of registered credit rating agencies to the European Securities Markets Authority, ESMA, became effective in July 2011. Our European operations are therefore under the full examination and oversight authority of ESMA and we expect ESMA to publish the first report on its review of the industry sometime in the second quarter of 2012.","In addition, the European Commission has proposed a new round of regulatory measures for the rating agency industry. Specifically, the suggested measures address, among other ideas, the use of ratings and regulation, business models, competition, rotation of rating agencies and liability. The various concepts the Commission has introduced in its proposal focus on how and to what extent rating agencies operate in the EU.","If implemented as currently constructed, however, the Commission suggested measures may have significant and negative ramifications on the European credit markets. Consequently, the debate on CRA 3 has been active and ongoing since its formal release by the Commission. In particular, on January 24, the European Parliament held a hearing through which it solicited views from a broad spectrum of market participants who generally sounded a cautionary note. Because of the tone of the debate thus far, it is possible that during the coming months, the Commission\u2019s proposals will be amended.","The next stages of the legislative process include deliberation and potential amendments by both the European Parliament and the Council of European Finance Ministers. The Parliament, Council and Commission must all confer and agree on a final text. We expect this process to take anywhere from 4 months to 8 months during which time we will continue to consult with relevant authorities and market participants as to the impact of the specific proposals.","While new rules entail various changes in our rating agency processes and operations and require us to adapt our business, we will not alter our fundamental objective to provide the highest quality independent credit opinions, research and analysis. We will also continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G20\u2019s statements and directives.","Before concluding today\u2019s remarks by reviewing our 2012 outlook, I\u2019ll briefly comment on our acquisitions of a majority stake in Copal Partners and of Barrie & Hibbert during the fourth quarter of 2011. Copal is an India-based, outsource research and consulting business that strongly complements the research, analysis, and professional services offerings of Moody\u2019s Analytics. The acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, a Scotland-based, leading provider of analytical tools for the global insurance industry, is consistent with our ongoing commitment to build a comprehensive suite of enterprise risk management solutions for financial institutions. Together, these acquisitions are expected to be accretive to EPS in 2012.","I will conclude this morning\u2019s prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance for 2012. Moody\u2019s outlook for 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity and consumer borrowing and securitization. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody\u2019s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.","Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. We expect business conditions to remain challenging, particularly early in the year, but still project growth across most areas of our business in 2012. For Moody\u2019s overall, the company expects full year 2012 growth to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also projected to increase in the high single to low double-digit percent range.","Full year 2012 operating margin is projected to be approximately 39%, which includes the full year impact of our fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions. Our effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 33%. We continue \u2013 we expect to continue share repurchase subject to available cash flow, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. The company expects diluted earnings per share for the full year 2012 in the range of $2.62 to $2.72.","For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2012 is expected to increase in the mid-single digit percent range. Within the U.S. MIS revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenue is expected to be about flat.","Corporate finance revenue is forecasted to grow in the high single digit percent range. Revenue from each of structured finance and financial institutions is projected to be flat to slightly down while public, project and Infrastructure finance revenue is expected to increase in the low-teens percent range.","For Moody\u2019s Analytics, full year 2012 revenue is expected to increase in the high teens percent range both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Revenue growth is projected in the mid single digit percent range for research data and analytics and in the low 20%s range for risk management software, reflecting growth in the core business as well as the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert. Professional services revenue is projected to grow by approximately 70%, inclusive of revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners and continued growth in our legacy businesses.","This concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question and answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody\u2019s Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody\u2019s Analytics. We\u2019d be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks. So, Linda, I was hoping you could give us a little more color on the drivers of cost growth, why the acceleration in the fourth quarter?","Linda Huber","Sure, Peter, happy to talk about that. I think first, though, we should note that 2011 was a year of record revenue for Moody\u2019s and we\u2019re back above our 2007 high. So we think we should get that into the mix, Peter.","Let me talk a little bit about fourth quarter 2011 as compared to fourth quarter of 2010. And the fourth quarter of 2010 we put up $0.58 and the number is $0.43 for the fourth quarter of 2011. The main bridge that gets you there is just a difference in the tax rate. We had an abnormally low tax rate in fourth quarter of 2010. As we had said earlier, the tax rate for 2010 was about 19% and we\u2019re running about 37% for the fourth quarter of 2011. So basically we have a doubling of the effective tax rate for the quarter. That change gets you about $0.12.","And then the remainder of the $0.03 to get to the bridge, we have some deal costs from these acquisitions we\u2019ve done in the fourth quarter. We had some other expenses including a sales tax matter and a contribution to our foundation. And then we\u2019ve got some other things in terms of bringing some IT costs and other systems online. So the main driver in the difference for the fourth quarter of 2011 is really the tax rate and there\u2019s not much more to it than that.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","I guess, I was focused, Linda, on the operating expenses, which were up about 7.5% year-to-year versus 3.4% growth in the -?","Linda Huber","Sure. Let me try to do that bridge for you also, Peter. For the fourth quarter of 2010, expenses were $367.7 million and then they were $395 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. So we\u2019re looking at about a $28 million increase over that period. Basically, it splits, as I\u2019ve mentioned, about a third, a third, a third in terms of deal costs. The two deals that we did in the fourth quarter were expensive to get done. We had a success fee in the Copal deal, which is unusual for us to pay, so take $9-ish million on deal costs and other things related to those acquisitions.","Another third of it, another chunk of it would be, as I said, another tax matter, which revolves around sales tax and a donation to our foundation, the sort of two costs in the other category. And then thirdly, we have these systems we\u2019re bringing online and some consulting fees mainly to get ready for Dodd-Frank. So basically those are the three components of the $28 million of expense difference between this year\u2019s fourth quarter and last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Got it. And then could you just \u2013 while we\u2019re on the expenses, tell me what the incentive comp accrual was in the fourth quarter?","Linda Huber","Sure. Incentive comp accrual was actually down from last year, and as we had said, last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we finished very strong in the fourth quarter last year, it was $42.8 million. This year it was only $30.3 million. That was still up sequentially, though, from the third quarter\u2019s $25 million, but more even over the quarters of 2011.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Got it. I guess the \u2013 really the important issue, Linda, is just I\u2019m interested in your perspective on what we could anticipate in terms of long-term margin. You\u2019re guiding to flat margin next year. Are you basically retreating on your expectation that perhaps we could get back to low 40% margins?","Ray McDaniel","Peter, this is Ray. But for the acquisitions that we made in the fourth quarter of 2011, I think we would have been projecting approximately a 40% margin this year.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay. But what about next year, Ray?","Ray McDaniel","Again, subject to whether we engage in additional acquisitions, I would still say that our outlook is to have 40% plus margin and a double-digit growth on average for the firm.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, great. And then, last thing, I will get off, the strength in structured finance, you mentioned specifically I guess the international business, yet the guidance is somewhat cautious and \u2013 with regard to structured finance for 2012. What\u2019s going on in that market? And I guess a corollary to that, you\u2019d mentioned in the past that perhaps you\u2019re gaining a little bit of market share relative to the competition. Do you think that\u2019s still the case?","Ray McDaniel","Well, let me start with 2011 because I did comment during the year, last year that we had what I consider to be some one-off activity in the early part of the year and we that we expected the run rate on that business to decrease. We didn\u2019t \u2013 as it turned out, we really didn\u2019t see that. The business held up throughout the year better than I had anticipated and we are currently looking at that run rate to continue through 2012.","Obviously, there are going to be areas of relative strength and relative weakness in structured finance. For example, we still don\u2019t see any significant RMBS activity here in the U.S. and we will have to see what the impact in Europe is of some of the one-time items that were driving business last year. But the ABS market in particular, both in the U.S. and in Europe, has held up well. And to the extent that there is a willingness to \u2013 well, to the extent that there are interest rates and spreads that make securitization attractive, there is potentially some upside to that business. But right now, we would say that we expect the run rate from 2011 to be reflected in the business in 2012.","As to share, I think that\u2019s more \u2013 probably more driven by which parts of structured finance happen to be active or inactive at any given point in time. There are some areas where we have strength relative to our competitors in terms of our analytic framework and there are some other areas where issuers and investors may prefer the business from our competitors. So it really is driven by which areas are active from quarter-to-quarter.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks, Ray and Linda.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from William Bird with Lazard Capital.","William Bird \u2013 Lazard Capital","Good morning. Ray, I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about the pipeline. What are you seeing in terms of how issuance is developing and kind of as you look at the year, I guess how do you see growth developing in MIS?","Ray McDaniel","Sure, happy to talk about that. You can see from our guidance that we\u2019re expecting both the financial institutions and structured finance areas to be flat, perhaps slightly down, but essentially flat. We do expect to see growth in the public, project and infrastructure finance area and we expect to see that all the way through the year.","The \u2013 probably the most interesting area is corporate finance and I think right now the pipelines could be characterized as steady, but probably not more than steady. A little bit of an uptick in high yield recently. But what we\u2019re seeing, and this is very recent, is an improvement in market tone, volatility has come down, spreads have been coming in, and those are all leading indicators of what helps build the pipeline. So early January, I would say we were pretty cautious about how the pipelines looked and what that meant for the business. As I said, more recently, some of the leading indicators are more promising.","We do still expect that the second half of the year is going to be the stronger half. We do not expect this year to look like last year. So we would not anticipate having strong growth in the first half this year in the corporate area, off of what we saw last year because it was so strong last year.","William Bird \u2013 Lazard Capital","Ray...","Linda Huber","So \u2013 it\u2019s Linda. I just wanted to give you some more details on January and February issuance. January investment grade issuance is on track with 2011, about an $80 billion issuance month for the month of January. Interestingly, there are seven deals in the market today and activity has been very active in February so far. What\u2019s interesting is if you look at the forward calendar for high yield, we see 13 high yield deals in the pipeline, which is better than we\u2019ve seen for quite some time.","Spreads are sort of around 650 basis points or over for high yield right now. If we can get under 600 basis points, we think we\u2019re going to start to see a lot of those deals coming. So conditions are for this moment, and again to follow-up on what Ray said, can change it any moment, but for this moment conditions are looking relatively good and you\u2019ll see a lot of companies coming to market getting record low all-in financing costs, which obviously is very helpful to our business.","Ray McDaniel","And we still think that 2012 is going to be characterized or going to reflect at the macroeconomic conditions and to the extent that there are orderly resolutions of some of the stresses in Europe in particular, that should build confidence. If those resolutions are more disorderly, I think we would see a movement away from risk. So macroeconomics continue to play a big part of the story.","William Bird \u2013 Lazard Capital","Ray, is MIS likely to have positive revenue growth in the first quarter?","Ray McDaniel","Well, we don\u2019t want to try to provide quarterly guidance, but I think what we\u2019re seeing in the first quarter of this year is at this point reflective of what we were seeing in the second half of last year with momentum building slowly throughout the year. So it\u2019s really the second half of this year that I think we\u2019re going to see revenue growth as opposed to the first half.","William Bird \u2013 Lazard Capital","And then, Linda, I was just wondering if you\u2019d talk a little more about expenses, just prospectively, just trying to understand why the flat margins on expected high single-digit, low double-digit revenue growth?","Linda Huber","Sure. I think what Ray was trying to say is our margins would be at 40% and we would have margin expansion but for the interesting effect of accounting for the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done. So we have to report by GAAP and we report with those acquisitions in, so it appears that the margin is flat.","Let\u2019s talk about expenses for 2012. I think you ought to start the year at about $370 million for the first quarter for expenses, and then I think similar to what we advised you in previous years, you should ramp expenses probably by about $40 million over the course of the year. Our expenses tend to move up in the fourth quarter as you\u2019ve obviously adjusted your \u2013 so that would be the way to lay it in for your modeling for 2012.","William Bird \u2013 Lazard Capital","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now hear from Michael Meltz with JPMorgan.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JPMorgan","Thank you. I think two or maybe two-and-half questions for you. On the question that Bill asked, can you just speak a bit more about earnings progression? I guess, Linda, what you\u2019re saying is costs are going to be up pretty big in the first quarter. And I assume revenues will \u2013 even talking first half, if you want to talk that way. But you\u2019re assuming probably pretty low to no revenue growth in the first half, costs up low double-digit, so earnings down pretty big in the first half and then ramping in the second half. Is that the way to think about it?","Linda Huber","Michael, the calendarization of this year is particularly challenging and I may ask Ray to speak to this as well. It\u2019s very hard to know because frankly we were a little more pessimistic about the first quarter, now we\u2019re feeling a bit more optimistic about the first quarter. So we\u2019re going to have to see if these conditions hold. If they do, I think we would feel a little bit better. But I think your view is generally correct that we would expect, as Ray said, the second half to be the stronger half. Ray, anything further?","Ray McDaniel","Yes, in addition to saying that the second half is going to be stronger, I think what you see is the steady progression of expense growth, although not to the same degree as we had in 2011. So that $40 million expense growth should be straight-lined through the year, but revenue stronger in the second half, and again, I would expect that we\u2019re probably going to have the lightest revenue in the first quarter.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then in terms of your MIS guidance for the year, the 4% to 6%, does that essentially imply mostly pricing and little to no volume growth? Can you talk about that?","Ray McDaniel","It\u2019s \u2013 I mean, we do have some pricing included in that. We do expect to have growth in several areas. Where we probably will not see growth is in Europe and if there is an orderly, as I said, an orderly resolution in Europe and a return of confidence, that would provide some upside against our current projections. So we expect to see a stronger profile in the U.S. and in our non-Europe international business at this point.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then my last question. The \u2013 can you speak broadly about what\u2019s in your guidance in terms of regulatory impact? I don\u2019t know if there is any \u2013 it\u2019s probably too early for any top line impact, but is there \u2013 where are regulatory costs trending year-on-year in 2012, please?","Ray McDaniel","Yeah. While I would have hoped that we would have stabilized the incremental increase in costs associated with regulation and compliance in 2012, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s the central case at this point. I think we are going to have incremental compliance and regulatory expense again this year. I think it will be less than we were forecasting for last year, so perhaps in the $10 million to $15 million range as opposed to the $15 million to $25 million range that we were talking about last year.","Linda Huber","And, Michael, a caution on that would be we can\u2019t forecast CRA 3, obviously, but we would see that the earliest that would come into effect is fourth quarter of 2012, but that\u2019s probably a 2013 matter for the most part.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Ray McDaniel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Douglas Arthur \u2013 Evercore","Yeah, Ray, I just wanted to follow-up on your expectation for flat non \u2013 I believe it\u2019s for flat non-U.S. ratings revenue growth in 2012, I think you started to answer that in the last question. Is that mostly because of caution on the European situation?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. That is the big driver of our expectations on the international ratings side, the European situation. We do expect to see growth in other international, Asia, Latin America.","Douglas Arthur \u2013 Evercore","Because this \u2013 I mean you got several boosts to that business in 2011, one you mentioned on the structured side, which lasted longer than expected. The other boost seemingly was from the sort of slow, inevitable move towards disintermediation where more companies are now getting ratings that previously were dependent on bank loan financing and they\u2019re now worried about that pipeline or access. So is that \u2013 you don\u2019t expect that to continue or is it going to level off?","Ray McDaniel","We do expect the disintermediation trend to continue. That I believe is a long-term, secular trend, not only for Europe, but elsewhere internationally. For 2012, the \u2013 we think that both the structured finance business internationally and the financial institutions business internationally are going to be down and the principal reason in both cases is because of our expectations for Europe. So we expect to have a decline in European financial institution revenue and European structured finance revenue compared to 2011. But we expect to have that in both cases largely offset by growth in the U.S.","Douglas Arthur \u2013 Evercore","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners, your line is now open.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","Yes. Hi. A couple things. First, can you update us on the CalPERS, Abu Dhabi court cases first?","Ray McDaniel","Yeah. Sure, Craig. The \u2013 starting with the CalPERS case, I think as you know that the second part of the anti-SLAPP motion was decided earlier in the year. And while we won the first part of the motion, we lost on the second part of the motion, which allows CalPERS to proceed with some discovery. What\u2019s unusual about this is that this decision is immediately appealable and we will be doing so and the case will be stayed until that appeal has been determined.","With respect to Abu Dhabi, discovery was completed in December and we filed a motion for summary judgment in January in that case.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","Okay. Then a housekeeping question here. Linda, can you break down, on a percentage basis, transaction versus non-transaction related revenues within structured finance, corporate financial and PPIF, please? I have a follow up.","Linda Huber","Yes, sure. For the fourth quarter 2011, Craig, for the rating agency, first let me go through CFG, transaction was 65% and relationship was 35%; for structured, 54% transaction and 46% relationship; FIG, 23% transaction, 77% relationship; PPIF, 60% transaction, 40% relationship; rating agency as a whole was 54%, 46%; and total for Moody\u2019s Analytics, 26% transaction, 74% relationship; the balance for the company, 44% transaction and 56% relationship.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","I\u2019m sorry, did I miss the corporate line there?","Linda Huber","If you did, it\u2019s 65%, 35% transaction and relationship.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","Okay. And then the other housekeeping question I\u2019d like to ask, can you break down the percentages by sub segment within the same four, if you would, ABS versus RMBS, CREF, derivatives and just the other three areas, too, please?","Linda Huber","Yes.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","Thank you.","Linda Huber","For Corporate, the revenue split for fourth quarter 2011 were as follows: investment grade was 25% of the revenue, high yield 11% of the revenue, bank loans 15% and other was 49%. For structured, for the fourth quarter of 2011, ABS was 34%, RMBS 27%, commercial real estate 17% and derivatives 23%. Going on to financial institutions, banking was 71% of revenue in the fourth quarter, insurance was 24% and managed investments were 6%. And then finally for PPIF for the fourth quarter, public finance and sovereign were 52% of revenue, munis 8%, project and infrastructure 39%.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","Appreciate that. And then also can you talk about these two acquisitions a little bit further, what we should expect, I mean can you size them for us for this new year and also what the D&A impact is for 2012?","Linda Huber","Sure Craig. I\u2019ll give you the total D&A number first and let Mark get warmed up to explain the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done because I think as a group we feel the analyst community is a little bit light on what we\u2019re trying to accomplish here. The D&A number you should use for 2012 going to be about $100 million. Some of that obviously is partially due to these acquisitions and partially because we\u2019re bringing some more systems online. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark and he\u2019ll give you details.","Mark Almeida","Sure. Craig, just to give you a sense of what we\u2019re doing, as Ray described, we acquired Copal Partners in November and that\u2019s I think an important extension of what we\u2019re doing in the RD&A space. Copal serves substantially the same customer set that we serve with our research and our data and our other related services. So we see this as a very nice synergistic opportunity to expand our footprint with those customers.","And then on the \u2013 with the Barrie & Hibbert acquisition that we closed in December, that\u2019s just a market extension within the software business and it allows us to have a much more compelling offering for insurance companies and will let us take advantage of what we see as a very robust opportunity associated with the Solvency II and related regulations that are being imposed on insurance companies. So we see both of those as very nice fits with various parts of the Moody\u2019s Analytics business.","In terms of the scale, I think we\u2019d indicated before that about half of our revenue growth in 2011 was organic and about half was from acquisitions that we made, primarily the CSI acquisition that we made in late 2010. And that can \u2013 that\u2019ll be \u2013 those proportions will be the same, roughly the same in 2012. So again, you should expect that about half of our revenue growth in 2012 will be organic and about half from these recently acquired businesses.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","And then lastly, if I could slip one more in here. Ray, your optimism for PPIF for 2012, up low-teens, I think you said in your press release, obviously 2011 was up about 2% give or take for your company. Is part of it just making up for that, but also is this the way the calendar falls for the debt maturity to that area 2012 give you the optimism or is there something else going on?","Ray McDaniel","No. I would say the only thing I would add to how you\u2019ve already sized it up, Craig, is that remember early last year there was a pretty significant concern around the public finance sector, the municipal sector here in the U.S. and so we had relatively light performance in U.S. municipals early in the year, which we do not expect to be replayed this year. Other than that, it\u2019s really the global infrastructure story, which is going to be supporting the growth in that business.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll now go to Edward Atorino with Benchmark.","Edward Atorino \u2013 Benchmark","I apologize, would you repeat the cost question, was it $40 million and then throughout the year up?","Linda Huber","Sure. Ed, I assume you\u2019re talking about what\u2019s the 2012 -?","Edward Atorino \u2013 Benchmark","Right.","Linda Huber","Okay, yeah I ask that everybody \u2013","Edward Atorino \u2013 Benchmark","$370 million and \u2013","Linda Huber","$370 million and then ramp it up $40 million to get to the fourth quarter.","Edward Atorino \u2013 Benchmark","Okay. Thanks.","Linda Huber","Sure.","Ray McDaniel","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. And Michael Meltz with JPMorgan.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JPMorgan","Hey. I just wanted one clarification. Linda, I think you just helped us on the cost side here, so you\u2019re saying D&A is going to be up $20-something million year-over-year. That\u2019s about a 100 bps to the margin. Correct?","Linda Huber","Yes.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And what about on \u2013 when we think about free cash flow, how\u2019s CapEx going to trend in 2012 versus 2011?","Linda Huber","Hang on a second. Let me get that for you. I think CapEx for 2011, you probably want to use $60 million to $70 million, Michael.","Michael Meltz \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Linda Huber","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And we have no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Ray McDaniel","I just want to thank everyone for joining the call today and we look forward to speaking to you again in April. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation and have a great rest of your day."],"14801":["Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call July 24, 2015 11:30 AM ET","Executives","Salli Schwartz - Global Head of IR","Ray McDaniel - President & CEO","Linda Huber - EVP & CFO","Michel Madelain - President & COO, Moody's Investors Service","Mark Almeida - President, Moody's Analytics","Analysts","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Bill Bird - FBR","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","Doug Arthur - Huber Research","Denny Galindo - Morgan Stanley","Craig Huber - Huber Research","Tim McHugh - William Blair","Robert Simmons - Janney Capital Markets","Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo","Vincent Hung - Autonomous","Operator","Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the Moody's Corporation Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Salli Schwartz","Thank you. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on this teleconference to discuss Moody's second quarter results for 2015 as well as our updated outlook for full-year 2015. I am Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations.","This morning Moody's released its results for the second quarter of 2015 as well as our updated outlook for full-year 2015. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.","Ray McDaniel, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead this morning's conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Linda Huber, Moody's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin I call your attention to the Safe Harbor language which can be found toward the end of our earnings release.

These, together with the Safe Harbor statement, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements. I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel.","Ray McDaniel","Thanks, Salli. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's second quarter 2015 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights.","On the legal front we continue to address the litigation matters and inquiries disclosed in our SEC filings. As we don't otherwise have any legal or regulatory update to provide at this time I will then conclude our prepared remarks with comments on our updated outlook for 2015. After our remarks will be happy to respond to your questions.","In the second quarter Moody's delivered revenue of $918 million, the 5% increase from the second quarter of 2014 was driven by strong U.S. performance partially offset by challenging European conditions. U.S. revenue was up 18% from the second quarter of 2015 while non-U.S. revenue was down 10% from the prior-year period.","Operating expenses for the second quarter was $499 million, up 8% from the prior-year period. Operating income was $419 million, a 2% increase from the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted operating income defined as operating income less depreciation and amortization was $447 million, up 3% from the same period last year.","Operating margin for the second quarter was 45.7% while adjusted operating margin was 48.7%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.28 increased 14% from the prior-year period's non-GAAP EPS of $1.12 which excluded a $0.36 gain resulting from Moody's acquisition of a controlling interest in ICRA Ltd. in the second quarter of 2014.","Turning to year-to-date performance Moody's revenue for the first six months of 2015 was $1.8 billion, an increase of 9% from the first six months of 2014. Revenue from Moody's Investors Service was $1.2 billion, up 8% from the prior-year period. Revenue from Moody's Analytics was $542 million, up of 11% from a year ago.","Operating expense for the first six months of 2015 was $993 million, up 11% from 2014. Much of this year-to-date growth reflects incremental expense from our 2014 acquisitions. As we approach the end of 2015 the impact of these expenses will moderate. Therefore we are maintaining our full-year guidance for expenses to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range.","Operating income of $791 million increased 6% from 2014. Adjusted operating income of $847 million increased 7% from the prior-year period. Operating margin for the first half of 2015 of 44.3% was down from 45.4% in 2014. Adjusted operating margin of 47.5% was down from 48.2%.","On a constant currency basis and excluding or 2014 acquisitions, operating margin and adjusted operating margin would each have increased approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Earnings per share for the first six months of 2015 was $2.39, up 13% from the prior-year period's non-GAAP EPS of $2.11 which excluded the $0.36 ICRA gain. We are reaffirming our 2015 earnings-per-share guidance of $4.55 to $4.65 despite uneven global growth and foreign currency volatility.","I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda Huber","Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned Moody's total revenue for the second quarter increased 5% to $918 million. On a constant currency basis Moody's total revenue increased 10% year-over-year.","U.S. revenue of $546 million was up 18% from second quarter of 2014. Non-U.S. revenue of $372 million was down 10% and represented 41% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $439 million represented 48% of total revenue.","Looking now at each of our businesses starting with Moody's Investors Service, total MIS revenue for the quarter increased 2% from the prior-year period to a record $639 million. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 5%. U.S. revenue increased 17% to $412 million primarily as a result of strong performance in investment grade, structured finance and public finance.","Revenue outside the U.S. of $227 million declined 17% primarily as a result of a slowdown in European issuance as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Non-U.S. revenue represented 36% of total MIS revenue.","Moving now to the lines of business for MIS, first global Corporate Finance revenue of $320 million in the second quarter was essentially flat to the prior-year period. This result reflected strong U.S. investment grade issuance primarily from increased M&A activity, largely offset by lower levels of non-U.S. speculative grade issuance as well as a challenging prior year comparable in Europe. U.S. Corporate Finance revenue increased 18% while non-U.S. revenue decreased 25%.","Second, global Structured Finance revenue for the second quarter was $121 million, 10% above the prior-year period, primarily the result of strength in U.S. structured credit, RMBS and commercial real estate finance. U.S. Structured Finance revenue was up 20% while non-U.S. revenue was down 10%.","Third, global Financial Institutions revenue was $90 million, decreased 2% compared to the prior-year period, primarily given unfavorable foreign currency translation on a weaker euro, partially offset by stronger U.S. bank rating revenue. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, global Financial Institutions revenue was up 6% from the prior-year period. U.S. Financial Institutions revenue was up 10% while non-U.S. revenue was down 9%.","Fourth, global Public, Project & Infrastructure Finance revenue increased 2% year-over-year to $100 million. Increased U.S. public finance issuance partially offset by a decline in global project and infrastructure revenue against a strong prior-period comparable. U.S. Public, Project & Infrastructure Finance revenue was up 10% while non-U.S. revenue was down 11%.","MIS Other which consists of non-rating revenue from ICRA and Korea Investor Service or KIS contributed $8 million to MIS revenue for the second quarter compared to $3 million in the prior-year period.","Turning now to Moody's Analytics, global revenue for MA of $279 million was up 12% from the second quarter of 2014. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 6%.","U.S. revenue grew by 23% year-over-year to $134 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 4% to $145 million and represented 52% of total MA revenue. Excluding revenue from our 2014 acquisitions of WebEquity Solutions and Lewtan Technologies, MA revenue grew 7%.","Now moving to the lines of business for MA, first global Research, Data & Analytics or RD&A, revenue of $158 million increased 11% from the prior-year period and represented 56% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly due to the October 2014 acquisition of Lewtan Technologies as well as strong performance in the credit research and content licensing business. U.S. RD&A revenue was up 19% and non-U.S. revenue was up 2%.","Second, global Enterprise Risk Solutions or ERS revenue of $83 million grew 24% from last year resulting from strong project delivery across all product offerings as well as the July 2014 acquisition of WebEquity Solutions. ERS revenue is up 44% in the U.S. and 14% outside the U.S.","Trailing 12-months revenue in sales for ERS increased 41, excuse me, 31% and 11% respectively. As we've noted in the past due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility.","Third, global Professional Services revenue declined 4% to $38 million primarily due to the year-over-year decline of the Canadian dollar as well as the effect of exiting certain Copal Amba product lines in late 2014. U.S. Professional Services revenue increased 10% while non-U.S. revenue decreased 10%.","Turning now to expenses Moody's second quarter expenses increased 8% to $499 million, primarily due to expenses from our 2014 acquisitions as well as compensation costs associated with new hires and merit increases. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expenses by 5%. As Ray noted reported operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 45.7% and 48.7% respectively for the second quarter.","On a constant currency basis and excluding our 2014 acquisition, operating margin and adjusted operating margin would have been approximately flat. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.4%, down from 33.1% in the second quarter of 2014. The year-over-year reduction was due to a favorable tax ruling from New York State and a change in the New York City tax law regarding income apportionment.","Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the second quarter of 2015 Moody's repurchased 2.2 million shares at a total cost of $235 million or an average cost of $107.35 per share and issued 374,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan.","Over the first half of 2015 Moody's repurchased 6 million shares at a total cost of $601 million or an average cost of $99.61 per share. Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2015 totaled 200.3 million shares, down 5% from the prior year. As of June 30, 2015 Moody's had $1 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","At quarter end Moody's had $3.1 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $2 billion, up $88 million. Free cash flow in the first six months of 2015 was $554 million, up 32% from the first six months of 2014 primarily due to changes in working capital.","As of June 30, 2015 approximately 67% of Moody's cash holdings were maintained outside the U.S. and with that I'll turn the call back over to Ray.","Ray McDaniel","Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing changes to our updated full-year guidance for 2015. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our second quarter 2015 earnings press release which can be found in the Moody's investor relations website at ir.moodys.com.","Moody's outlook for 2015 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates, currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to some degree of uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from current outlook.","Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. Specifically our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound and the euro of $1.57 to \u00a31 and $1.11 to \u20ac1 respectively. Certain components in Moody's 2015 guidance have been modified to reflect the company's current view of business conditions as follows.","Global MIS revenue for full-year 2015 is still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. However, U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to be approximately flat.","Within MIS Structured Finance revenue is now expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range and Public, Project & Infrastructure Finance revenue is now expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. Global MA revenue for the full-year 2015 is still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Within MA Professional Services revenue is now expected to decrease in the high-single-digit percent range.","The effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 31% to 32%. And capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $100 million to $110 million. Before we move to the question-and-answer session I would like to highlight that Moody's Investors Service was recently voted the best credit rating agency in a 2015 poll of U.S. fixed income investors conducted by publisher Institutional Investor. This is the fourth year in a row MIS has won this award. I appreciate the market's recognition of our efforts and I applaud the accomplishments of those in the MIS business.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investors Service and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We'd be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will go first to Manav Patnaik at Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","There were obviously a lot of moving parts with issuance this quarter. There are two that sort of stuck out to me which I wanted to ask you about. So the first one was I guess you guys mentioned RMBS deliberately in the press release, so maybe just some color there in terms of how broad-based that is for you guys to call that out. And then the other aspect was just in CLOs, the total issuance seemed to have been down but it looks like you guys are doing okay in there. So are there certain market share dynamics that you can highlight there?","Michel Madelain","Well really, so regarding the Structured Finance I think we've seen a good level of activity essentially in some segments of the RMBS market. And we've seen whether it's in the single-family rental space or some of the [indiscernible] as well as some increase in Jumbo activity. So that's really what we had. Can you go back to -b can you maybe restate your other question?","Manav Patnaik","Yes, your performance in the CLO market, like it seems to be minus b.","Michel Madelain","CLO, it's a combination, I think it's essentially driven by our level of engagement in that segment of the market basically. That's really what drove that performance.","Ray McDaniel","And I would just add that the CLO issuance pipeline it remains strong. And some of the recovery in the leverage loan sector in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, probably is going to give the CLO market some legs going into the second half of the year, although we do expect that to eventually slow.","Manav Patnaik","And then Linda, just I think if you can just update us typically on the total OpEx bridge you like to give us through the end of the year. And I'm not sure if you want to, I know you haven't historically, but if I look at the Moody's ratings margins, the MIS margins, clearly it's still healthy but it seems to have some tough comparisons. How, depending on I guess the level of hiring as you mentioned, how should we think about how that margin should progress?","Linda Huber","Sure. I'm sorry, you were looking for what regarding operating expenses?","Manav Patnaik","You know how you last quarter last quarter I think you gave the bridge that it should ramp up to like $40 million by the end of the fourth quarter.","Linda Huber","The view now given what we're seeing at the end of the second quarter on the expense ramp would indicate that we expect that to be about $30 million increase from the second quarter number to the fourth-quarter number. Now we've cautioned that a number of variables can impact that including general expense timing, FX movement and incentive compensation accruals.","I would caution that obviously if we do better than plan generally our incentive compensation accrual would increase. And of course if we do worse than plan the incentive compensation accrual would decrease. So generally, though, we think the midpoint case is about $30 million of ramp.","On MIS margins I think we would note that we are providing some reinvestment in the business which we think is the right thing to do at this point because the businesses, both businesses are performing very strongly and we're really pleased with the growth progress of both businesses. 10% growth constant currency is really pretty remarkable in an overall S&P market which is less than 1% growth for this quarter. So we think we're doing pretty well. We don't give future guidance on margin side division so I think we'd rather just leave that one alone if that's okay.","Operator","We will go next to Bill Bird at FBR.","Bill Bird","I was wondering if you could just give us your general thoughts on the new issue pipeline and maybe any commentary on what you're seeing in Europe post the Greek stand-off? Thank you.","Linda Huber","Sure, Bill. I'll take a shot at that. And again these of the views we gathered yesterday from U.S. capital markets desks of various investment banks. This information first is just for the U.S. dollar market. And it doesn't align with how we report. And these numbers include both financial and non-financial issuers. So again I'll go through the U.S. first and then I'll make some comments on Europe. And we would note the sort of remarkable difference in the two market areas which I'm sure Michel can speak about later regarding Europe.","First of all, in U.S. investment-grade bonds, July was $100 billion month. The first half of 2015 we've seen $700 billion of U.S. investment-grade issuance which is up 20% year-over-year. For the full year the expectation is now $1.25 trillion which is up 15% year-over-year. You'll recall we started this year with a forecast that was supposed to be down 5% to 10%. So again the variability in forecast must be noted as we move through the year.","The state of the U.S. investment-grade market is very strong. February, March, April, May and July have all set monthly record issuance levels and the prevalence of the Jumbo deals have continued to drive U.S. investment-grade activity.","The current pipeline is above average and we are seeing rates which have remained reasonably low and that has driven M&A activity and there is a significant backlog of announced M&A activity that needs to be funded.","Now turning to high-yield bonds, the second part of this $5 billion of issuance in July 1, the first half of 2015 $180 billion which is fat year-over-year. Full year 2015 is expected to be $300 billion which is about flat as well. The current high-yield market is described as okay. That's a technical term. The LBO pipeline continues to underwhelm, it is what we're noting while corporate M&A further accounts for an increase in share of issuance.","And the current pipeline is noted as average. Leverage loans, in July we saw $10 billion of issuance, in the first half of 2015 $190 billion which is down 30% year-over-year and the full year is expected to be $360 billion which is viewed to be down 15% year-over-year.","Interestingly the loan market right now is currently feeling stronger than the high-yield bond market and the lack of supply and continued CLO issuance is forming attractive supply-demand technicals. Right now the pipeline is average to above average, so we're seeing some slight moderation in the conditions that were brought about by the SNC, the shared national credit program that we discussed on the previous call.","Moving now to Europe, the situation in Europe is as different as a number of us have seen it in many years of working here. The euro investment-grade market has been characterized by lower supply due to European market volatility and instability driven by the Greek situation. ","However, reverse Yankee issuance remains very active in the European market and I would caution that we book European, I'm sorry, we book reverse Yankee issuance in the U.S. in the domicile of the issuer as opposed to that those bonds are actually being marketed in Europe. Market tone has gotten stronger following the situation with Greece having some resolution and we see some companies opportunistically issuing in Europe. Specifically Apple has a $1.25 billion sterling issue in the UK market today.","European high yield saw a slowdown in the second quarter given the Greek situation. And there's been no high-yield issuance in July, although some issues are currently being looked at and we expect that the pace of activity may now pick up. So again I think the headline here is broadly divergent conditions between the U.S. which is quite strong and Europe which is a good deal weaker.","Bill Bird","And then separately I just was wondering if you could talk about the margin lift at MA, some of the drivers and whether you think that kind of lift is durable.","Mark Almeida","As we've been discussing we've been making a lot of effort across MA but particularly in Enterprise Risk Solutions to expand the margin. And we're seeing some of that start to come through and we're seeing good performance with our margin expansion effort. So we're pleased with what we're doing. And we are very focused on doing everything we can to sustain that.","I'm not in a position to declare victory and to promise that we're going to be able to continue to drive this degree of margin expansion quarter after quarter. But we're doing everything we can to drive more profitability in the business. And we're optimistic about being able to sustain this over a long period of time.","Operator","And we will go next to Peter Appert at Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert","So Linda you mentioned $30 million cost increase between 2Q and 4Q and I think if I'm doing the arithmetic right this would imply that fourth-quarter cost would be roughly flat on a year-to-year basis. Is that primarily just because of the M&A stuff or is there other factors?","Linda Huber","Peter, we don't like to get into quarter-by-quarter activity so I think it's fair to say that your assumptions there are correct. We are keeping a very close eye on expenses for the rest of the year given the market choppiness that we're seeing. And we're looking to actively address that by putting resources where they need to be.","But generally you're right, we've had a major ramp-up in expenses this quarter because of the quarter-over-quarter change with the acquisition costs coming on. We do expect that that will moderate somewhat as we move through the rest of the year.","Peter Appert","And then Linda, another one of the tax rate the New York City changed. Does that result in a permanent reduction in the rates going forward and how should we think about the tax rate going forward?","Linda Huber","Short. I think you heard the guidance, Peter, on the tax rate and we did take it down by 1 full percentage point. That's probably looks a little bit more exciting than it might actually be in practice because we are very cautious about the tax rate these days given the assertive nature of taxing authorities around the world. It's a good change but we're cautious because one-off activity in any quarter can really change the nature of the tax rate. But we do see a little bit of improvement there but probably not anything to get very excited about.","Ray McDaniel","We are also cautious on that side because of the stronger performance coming out of the U.S. as opposed to our European and international business but Europe in particular. So more revenue in a higher tax jurisdiction calls for caution.","Peter Appert","And then for Mark, the strength in the ERS business, you highlight some of that as early completion of projects. So I'm wondering is it possible to think about how much of that revenue benefit is pull forward and therefore may be more conservative expectations for the second half of the year?","Mark Almeida","Yes, there was some pull forward there, Peter. Not an enormous amount, frankly, but there was certainly some and we've had a very, very good first half in ERS. The top line is up 26% in the first half of this year. So you know what our full-year guidance is and we haven't moved that. So clearly we're looking at not such strength in the second half. It's worth noting that we're up against some pretty difficult comps in the second half as well.","The second half of 2014 was up 35% over the second half of 2013. So we're going up against a strong comp and also we've got the WebEquity acquisition that we did in the middle of last year.","That is now fully in our base or close to being fully in our base so we won't get any bump from acquired revenue in ERS in the second half. So, all of those things are going to have an impact on the growth rate for the rest of this year.","Peter Appert","Can you talk, Mark, though about maybe the momentum in billings as opposed to the trend in revenues as a forward indicator of momentum in that business?","Mark Almeida","Yes, I can tell you that business remains very, very strong. The bookings or the billings have been very good so far year to date. We did have the largest, a very large transaction, our largest transaction ever in fact we booked in the second quarter of 2014. So we didn't have anything of that scale in the second quarter of this year.","So you saw a little bit of a downtick in the trailing 12-month sales growth rate but nevertheless the sales production has been very healthy, in line with our expectations, maybe even a little bit ahead and the pipeline is very healthy. So we are feeling very good about where we are with the business.","Peter Appert","And just one last thing, this is maybe for Ray or Michel. The guidance suggests I think that the international MIS business get stronger in the second half of the year. Is that just a function of comps or is there something specifically you'd call out that might be a driver?","Michel Madelain","Yes, if you look at the various segments we have the only really segment where we see a favorable development is expected in Structured Finance and Project Finance effectively. That's where I would expect to see some improvement from what we've seen to date effectively.","Operator","We will go next to Doug Arthur at Huber Research.","Doug Arthur","Linda, if I'm doing my math correctly which I'm probably not, if the impact on MIS from FX was 5% total if I apply that to the down 17% international, does that suggest that underlying FX adjusted was down about 6% internationally? Is that fair if you scrub out FX, the FX impact on international ratings?","Linda Huber","Doug, let me request that you go on to a second question if you have one while the team takes a look at how that lays out.","Doug Arthur","No, that's good, that's my only question. Thanks.","Linda Huber","Okay.","Ray McDaniel","If we can come up with the answer while we're on the call here we will do that.","Operator","And we will go next to Denny Galindo of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir. ","Denny Galindo","I want to delve a little bit more into the RMBS strength that you called out. We had looked at issuance from a couple of sources that showed covered bonds down 15% to 20% and also private label RMBS down 15% to 20% and you didn't get the exact number but it sounds like it was up.","So I was just kind of curious, are there any one-time fees that you're receiving there or a change in pricing or maybe if you could give us just a little bit more color on the RMBS number?","Ray McDaniel","Yes, as far as the covered bonds are concerned we had a year-on-year decline in the European covered bond component of Structured Finance. The strength was in the U.S. RMBS sector and that related to improved market activity and increased coverage. And as I think Linda had mentioned earlier it covered a collection of different aspects of the mortgage market, the prime component, single-family rentals, some of the agency risk sharing deals. So it was a good strength in U.S. RMBS.","It's still well, well below any kind of levels that we had pre-financial crisis. So it's got a long way to go to get back to where it was.","Denny Galindo","Okay and then moving on to PPIF, I don't think we've talked about that yet. There's been some anecdotal stories about cities not using your service because you've changed the way that asses pensions but yet it sounds like you're increasing your guidance for that line item.","So I was just kind of curious if you could give us a little color on where that strength is coming from? Is this moving away from Moody's talk kind of more talk than action or any thoughts that you have on that topic?","Ray McDaniel","Well, I guess I'm tempted to say you can't believe everything you read. But I think the misunderstanding if there is one would be what we see as strength in our coverage and strong growth as we reported versus what's happening in the broader market.","And that embeds a cyclical shift in the mix from larger issues and issuers that would typically use more ratings to a shift in the issuers who have traditionally used two ratings rather than three or one rating rather than two. That's a cyclical condition and is a market story rather than a Moody's story.","Linda Huber","And if I may, we have a response to Doug's earlier question. Doug you can correct me if I am stating your question incorrectly. I think your math led you to believe that the constant dollar reduction in MIS international revenues was down about 6% and we have taken a look at that and that is about correct. So yes your math is correct. Mr. Galindo, did you have anything further, sir?","Denny Galindo","Yes, I did actually have one more question. Just on the European issuance, we talked a little bit over the last couple of quarters about new mandates there. I know that the strength in issuance is down but are you still getting the same pace of new firms looking to establish new issuer ratings in Europe or has that slowed down this year?","Michel Madelain","Yes, I think we did actually see a slowdown and the slowdown is really related to what we've described happening in bank loan and high-yield where we've seen less activity and that's obviously a significant contributor in overall volume of new mandates.","So we've seen in it such a slowdown in first time mandates. I think what is important, I mean the important question for all of us obviously is that a structural or is that sort of a cyclical situation? And we do believe it's cyclical and really reflect the condition that that market is facing at the moment basically.","Ray McDaniel","The only other thing I would add is that while it's down year-on-year it is up sequentially from the first quarter new mandates.","Operator","And we will go next to Craig Huber at Huber Research.","Craig Huber","A few questions if I could please. Linda, I'm just curious first is housekeeping question here on foreign currency given the dozens of currencies you guys are in, what are you budgeting the currency impact, both the cost and revenues for the third quarter and the full-year?","Linda Huber","Sure. Let me just talk a little bit about what this does for us. And I believe where we were we had said I think we're looking at $1.11 on the euro.","Let me just double check that, and if I have it right looking at the team $1.57 on the pound, yes, correct. So we do have sensitivity to the currencies and our sensitivity is disproportionately heavier on the revenue line for euros, Craig and heavier on the expense line in pounds. So for a while in the second quarter we sort of had everything going the wrong way. We have many employees in London as you know and we do have billings in euros, so there you see some of the issues that we had to deal with.","So the estimated impact of FX for 2015 is we are thinking a 3% to 4% decline in revenue and a 3% to 4% benefit in operating expense. Again as I said $1.57 is what we're looking at for the pound, $1.11 for the euro and the way it lays out is a $0.05 if you will, a $0.05 decline in the euro will give us about $20 million of decline in revenue.","Now that's offset to the positive by a $4 million benefit on the expense line, so overall the EPS impact would be a $0.05 decline. So this is one of the things that makes us concerned regarding the guidance view and we're going to just have to see how this plays out through the rest of the year.","But we had had the euro relatively steady at $1.11. As the Greek situation flared up we dropped back to $1.08 and I think we're back up through $1.09 today but we're very sensitive to this number.","Craig Huber","Secondly, Linda, what was your incentive comp in the second quarter? What was that in the first quarter please?","Linda Huber","Sure. Just one second. So the incentive compensation amount that we booked in the first quarter of this year, Craig, is what you want?","Craig Huber","That and the second, yes.","Linda Huber","It was $38 million in the first quarter and almost $43 million in the second quarter.","Craig Huber","Okay and then as I typically like to ask you Linda can you just give us the breakdown of revenues for the four main categories, high-yield versus investment-grade, etc. and also the other three categories?","Linda Huber","Yes, sure. We'll start with investment-grade and I'll do the comparisons first with the second quarter of 2014. So in investment-grade that's the main story here, Craig.","For the second quarter of 2015 we had about $84 million versus last year's $63 million. And investment-grade comprises 26% of the total revenue in corporate. So we're seeing very good activity in investment-grade as we had mentioned.","Speculative grade last year was $77 million. This year it's $60 million and the percentage declined from 24% to 19%.","Bank loans was $67 million for the second quarter of 2015 versus last year's $75 million. The percentage was down from 24% last year to 21% this year. And other was up a bit from last year, $108 million versus $105 million last year. Percentage of 34% was about the same. So again largely an investment-grade story for this year second quarter of 2015.","Turning to structured, same comparison second quarter of 2015 versus 2014, ABS was up a bit, last year $24 million, this year $26 million. The percentage, though, was 21% of the total structured for the second quarter this year. RMBS was up at $19 million to $21.5 million and consistent at 18% of total structured.","Commercial real estate from $30 million to $32.2 million, consistent at 27% of revenues. Structured credit went from $37.3 million last year to $41.1 million, consistent at 34% of the revenue. So again there you see some movement on the ABS line and the commercial real estate and structured credit line as we mentioned.","FIG, last year we had $92 million total this quarter, this year we had $90.4 million. FIG is always pretty consistent. Banking was $63.7 million last year, $62 million this year, 69% of total FIG revenues. Insurance is down a bit, $24 million last your, $21 million this year. 23% of total revenue versus last year's 26%.","Managed investments about flat at a little over $4 million and 5% of the total and other was about $2.3 million for us and a small piece of the $90 million total. So a little bit weaker in the insurance sector for FIG.","Finally PPIF as compared to last year, $54 million in PFG and sovereign which is up nicely from last year's $44 million. The percentage of the total 54%, Project & Infra conversely is down from last year's $54 million to $45.5 million and that's 46% of the total revenue. So those segments sort of switched places in PPIF for this year and I think that's about it, Craig, if that does it for you.","Craig Huber","So I missed that small municipal structured product line you have in there?","Linda Huber","I'm not sure -- that's rolled up into another segment now and I think you're going to have to chat with Salli about that.","Craig Huber","Rolling it, okay. My other question is for organic revenue if you could just help us with this. Within your research business and also ERS what was the underlying organic revenue growth in each of those excluding those small acquisitions please?","Ray McDaniel","As it happens the benefit we got from acquired revenue almost exactly offset the FX hit. So the constant dollar organic revenue growth rate for MA overall was a little over 12%. And a similar story in RD&A. Overall RD&A growth rate on a GAAP basis was 11% and constant dollar organic was also 11%.","Operator","We will take our next question today from Tim McHugh at William Blair.","Tim McHugh","First I want to ask just on ERS, the increased pace I guess of customer deployments is that just timing of where you're at in the cycle or is there something different you've been doing the last couple of quarters that's I guess accelerating how quickly you can get to that revenue recognition point and customer deployment point?","Ray McDaniel","There is a lot that we're doing to try to speed up the implementation of our projects and thus the recognition of our revenues. And that is an ongoing project, so it's not as though we've done it and we've got a structural change in the business that we're going to be able to sustain from here on out. But it's something we're very focused on and we're pleased with the traction we're getting there.","It is very much a strategic focus for us and it's something we're trying to do. It's a function of the work that we're doing with the product to make the product more, have more standard features built into the product and focus on selling those standard features and standard versions of the product.","So that accelerates or facilitates the implementation of projects. So the short answer to your question is yes and we're making good progress there, but like I said that is an ongoing focus for the management of the business.","Linda Huber","Tim, it's Linda, let me just add one element of clarification. On the finance side and Mark and I and our teams work together very closely on ERS revenue recognition. Software revenue recognition accounting is a very detailed and challenging sort of thing and we're very cautious that we handle revenue recognition appropriately. I think one of the things we've learned to do better is to better match expenses with revenues and to ensure that we stage completion of projects. So I think as a whole the corporation has gotten better at managing this but we're very cognizant of the revenue recognition rules and we're very thoughtful about how we're dealing with those.","Tim McHugh","And ERS in the U.S. the growth rate picked up I guess 19% versus 13% last quarter, steady growth rate there. So I guess what drove the acceleration this quarter versus what you've been seeing?","Ray McDaniel","Well we have the impact of the WebEquity acquisition. That is a very heavily U.S. focused business, so you've got a very significant contribution from WebEquity. But as I said earlier, business generally is very good in MA across-the-board but in ERS specifically and that would be true in inside and outside the U.S.","Operator","Our next question today is from Robert Simmons at Janney.","Robert Simmons","Hi, I'm asking for Joe Foresi. You've talked about reversing the issuance of it. I was wondering if you could quantify that all, like how big a market is that and how long do you expect that to remain strong for you? Any sort of detail would be helpful.","Linda Huber","Sure. Let me just mention that it's very choppy. The strongest month for issuance is probably March, April, and then the market sort of went away as concerns arose about what was happening with Greece. Now that those have somewhat moderated and that doesn't say that those are solved, we are seeing a pickup in potential interest in the reverse Yankee issuance, perhaps spotlighted by as I said the Apple deal in the Sterling market today. It's very hard to predict this because it is very market dependent and we'll have to see how conditions layout.","We would also expect that going into August is seasonally a less active month in the European markets as a whole. So, we may see some hiatus here as we go through August and potentially some strengthening as we move back into the September time period.","But this is a hard one to call and it moved month by month. Therefore we wouldn't be giving guidance on that and we're happy to talk about this a bit further as we get to Investor Day on Wednesday, September 30.","Robert Simmons","Can you quantify at all how big it is for you guys, though, at the time?","Linda Huber","I don't think we've split that out. I don't know if anyone else has any thoughts on that. No, can't give too much more detail on that.","Operator","And we will move next to Bill Warmington at Wells Fargo.","Bill Warmington","So I was hoping that you might be able to talk about some of the international MIS business lines on a constant currency basis. I know you've talked about the group as a whole but it seems like some of those business lines are doing better than the reported revenue would indicate on the surface. Maybe not but it would seem it.","Ray McDaniel","We can give you some information on the FX impact internationally by line of business. I wouldn't be able to break it down more finely done that. But the FX impact on international corporate finance was $11 million, on Structured Finance was $6 million, Financial Institutions was $7 million, PPIF was $4 million. On the MA side, RD&A international it was $7 million, ERS international was $4 million and Professional Services it was $1 million.","Bill Warmington","And then one other question just on the stress testing in Europe I wanted to ask about how the Greek turmoil was impacting demand for those services. I figure you can make a case for it either positive or negative but I wanted to check.","Ray McDaniel","The Greek situation really hasn't had an impact on our work in Europe in any way, frankly. There's lots of demand for what we're doing among European banks and I can't say that the situation in Greece has had any impact at all.","Operator","And we will go next to Vincent Hung at Autonomous.","Vincent Hung","Just one question from me, maybe I missed this but did you see any evidence of a reversal in the disintermediation trend in Europe this quarter?","Ray McDaniel","A reverse in the disintermediation trend?","Vincent Hung","Or re-intermediation?","Ray McDaniel","As we said the number of new mandates that we are seeing year-over-year is down but sequentially first quarter to second quarter is up. We attribute that not to banks becoming particularly aggressive in lending rather than the attractiveness of bond markets but more to a demand question. So I think as we see growth resume in Europe we are going to see an increase in new mandates again.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. McDaniel. I'll turn the conference back over to you, sir.","Ray McDaniel","Okay, I want to thank you for joining us. And as Linda mentioned we look forward to speaking with you on Investor Day which is September 30 and until then I hope everyone enjoys their summer.","Operator","Once again, this does conclude today's Moody's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on this teleconference to discuss Moody's second quarter 2016 results as well as our current outlook for full year 2016. I am Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations and Communications. This morning, Moody's released its results for the second quarter of 2016 as well as our current outlook for full year 2016. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.","Ray McDaniel, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead this morning's conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Linda Huber, Moody's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I call your attention to the Safe Harbor language, which can be found toward the end of our earnings release.

McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Salli. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's second quarter and year-to-date 2016 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. I will then conclude with comments on our current outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","In the second quarter, Moody's revenue of $929 million increased 1% from the second quarter of 2015, despite a challenging year-on-year comparable. Moody's Analytics delivered its 34th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, while Moody's Investors Service attained its second highest quarterly revenue ever, only surpassed by its performance in the same period last year.","Operating expense for the second quarter was $519 million, up 4% in the second quarter of 2015. Operating income was $410 million, a 2% decline from the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by 1%. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, was $441 million, down 1% from the same period last year. Operating margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 44.2%. The adjusted operating margin was 47.5%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.30 was up 2% from the prior year period.","Turning to year-to-date performance, Moody's revenue for the first half of 2016 was $1.7 billion, a decline of 2% from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue declined 1%. Revenue of Moody's Investors Service was $1.2 billion, a decline of 7% from 2015. Revenue of Moody's Analytics was $594 million, 10% higher than the prior-year period.","Operating expense in the first half of 2016 was $1 billion, up 4% from the prior period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, operating expense was up 6%. Operating income of $714 million was down 10% from the first half of 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. Adjusted operating income of $775 million was down 8% from the prior-year period.","Moody's reported operating margin was 40.9% and its adjusted operating margin was 44.4%. The effective tax rate for the first half of 2016 was 32.1%, up from 31.5% from the prior-year period. Despite a good second quarter, we have modestly reduced certain elements of our revenue guidance due to our more cautious outlook for issuance outside the U.S. following the British referendum to leave the European Union and the expected negative impact of foreign currency translation. As a result, we expect to be at the lower end of our $4.55 to $4.65 EPS guidance range.","I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the second quarter was $929 million, up 1% from the prior-year period. U.S. revenue of $546 million was flat to the second quarter of 2015. Non-U.S. revenue of $383 million was up 3% and represented 41% of Moody's total revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MCO revenue was negligible. Recurring revenue of $467 million was up 6% and represented 50% of total revenue.","Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service, total MIS revenue for the quarter was $626 million, down 2% from the prior-year period, but up 19% from the first quarter. U.S. revenue declined 3% to $399 million while non-U.S. revenue of $227 million was flat to the prior period and represented 36% of total Ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.","Moving to the lines of business for MIS, first, global corporate finance revenue of $305 million in the second quarter was down 5% from the prior-year period. This result primarily reflected lower levels of U.S. speculative grade and Asian investment grade issuance despite increased activity from the first quarter. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were down 4% and 6% respectively.","Second, global structured finance revenue for the second quarter was $112 million, down 8% from the prior-year period, as reduced U.S. CLO and CMBS activity was only partially offset by increased European structured finance activity. U.S. structured finance revenue was down 16%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 14%.","Third, global financial institutions revenue of $90 million was down 1% from the prior-year period. U.S. financial institutions revenue was up 7%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 7%.","Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $112 million was up 12% versus the prior-year period, primarily as a result of increased global infrastructure-related issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenues were up 11% and 16% respectively.","MIS Other, which consists of non-rating revenues from ICRA in India and Korea Investors Service contributed $7 million to MIS revenue for the second quarter, down 10% from the prior-year period.","And turning now to Moody's Analytics, global revenue for MA of $303 million was up 9% from the second quarter of 2015. U.S. revenue of $147 million was up 10% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $156 million was up 8% and represented 52% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 1%. Excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew 6%.","Moving now to the lines of business for MA, first, global research, data and analytics, or RD&A, revenue of $168 million was up 7% from the prior-year period and represented 55% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly due to the strength in the sales of credit research and ratings data feeds. U.S. and non-U.S. RD&A revenue was each up 7%.","Second, global enterprise risk solutions or ERS revenue of $98 million was up 17% from last year. The growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of GGY as well as growth across all product lines, with particular strength from regulatory and risk measurement product revenues. U.S. and non-U.S. ERS revenues were up 21% and 15% respectively. Trailing 12-month revenue and sales for ERS increased 11% and 6% respectively. As we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue and sales remain subject to quarterly volatility.","Third, global professional services revenue of $38 million was down 2% from the prior-year period. This result was primarily due to the impact of customer attrition identified last year as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on the credentials and licensing business. U.S. professional services revenue was flat to the prior-year period, while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%.","Turning now to expense, Moody's second quarter expense was $519 million, up 4% from 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs in MA, reflecting additional head count to support business growth and the acquisition of GGY. MIS expense was down slightly compared to the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.","As Ray noted, Moody's reported operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 44.2% and 47.5% respectively for the second quarter. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.9%, up from 30.4% in the second quarter of 2015.","Now, I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the second quarter of 2016, Moody's repurchased 2.3 million shares at a total cost of $224 million or an average cost of $96.60 per share and issued 249,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plans.","Moody's also paid $72 million in dividends during the quarter and, on July 12, announced quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of Moody's common stock payable September 12 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 22.","Over the first half of 2016, Moody's repurchased 5.2 million shares at a total cost of $486 million or an average cost of $92.83 per share. The company also returned $144 million to its shareholders by dividend payments during the same period. Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2016, totaled 192 million, down 4% from June 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, Moody's had $1 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","At quarter end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $2 billion with approximately 78% held outside the U.S. Free cash flow in the first six months of 2016 was $475 million, down 14% from the first six months of 2015, primarily due to lower net income.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing changes to our full-year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on the Moody's Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.","Moody's current outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability, business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the full year could differ materially from our current outlook.","Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.34 to \u00a31 and for the euro of $1.11 to \u20ac1. Based on our current business mix, the annualized impact of a $0.01 decline in the euro against the U.S. dollar equals approximately a $0.01 decline in our annualized EPS. On the other hand, a $0.01 decline in the British pound against the U.S. dollar has a minimal impact to EPS.","As I noted earlier, Moody's is reaffirming our full-year 2016 EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.65 and expects to be toward the lower end of the range. Moody's full-year 2016 revenue is still expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range. Moody's operating expense is still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range.","For MIS, Moody's now expects 2016 revenue to decrease in the low-single-digit percent range, reflecting reduced guidance for our non-U.S. MIS revenue, which we now also expect to decrease in the low-single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is still expected to decrease in the low-single-digit percent range. Structured finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the high-single-digit percent range.","For MA, 2016 revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range.","Before we move to the Q&A, I would like to highlight three items, including investment we made earlier this week in Korea, an award won by MIS and the launch of a new MA product. On Monday, Moody's announced that it acquired full ownership of Korea Investors Service, or KIS, a leading provider of domestic credit ratings in Korea.","Moody's and KIS have had a longstanding and productive relationship since 2001. We believe that an even closer partnership and continued investment in the business will enable us to capitalize on the opportunities for growth and better serve the market in Korea. The acquisition is not expected to have a significant impact on Moody's earnings per share for 2016 and has been funded from international cash on hand.","Additionally, MIS was voted Best Credit Rating Agency in a 2016 poll of the U.S. fixed income investors, conducted by the publisher, Institutional Investor. This is the fifth year in a row that MIS has won this award. I appreciate the market's recognition of our efforts, and I applaud the accomplishments of our MIS colleagues.","And finally, yesterday, we announced the launch of Moody's Analytics Risk Quality score, or MARQ, a tool to help private companies understand their credit profile and support bank lending to small businesses. The MARQ score and the related web portal are a result of our collaboration with Finagraph, a financial technology company, in which we made a minority investment earlier this year.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics; and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investors Service. We'd be pleased to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Hello, everyone. So just coming back to your guidance for a minute here, going through the earnings cycle for the banks, they sounded (16:57) fairly constructive on DCM, rates have trended slower or are low, credit spreads are still pretty reasonable. And I guess we're getting pretty close to the refi pipeline here. So, just wondering like with everything seemingly looking a little bit better at least from our seat, where are you seeing that incremental-like weakness to make you more conservative? So, is there anything else you can add would be great?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. As we said in the prepared remarks, it's really uncertainty about international issuance activity that's driving a somewhat more cautious outlook. And I would have to add that since the Brexit vote on June 23, we haven't seen much activity in international issuance. Average daily issuance volumes are down in really all key markets except for U.S. investment grade. That being said, the timing of the vote does coincide with a seasonal decline in issuance that we typically see in July and August, especially again in the euro market.","So trying to assess, at this point, the decrease in issuance as a result of uncertainty about the Leave vote versus normal seasonal factors actually is a bit difficult. So, hopefully, we are being more cautious than we need to be, but that's what's influencing our thinking, and we also think it's going to have an impact outside the corporate sector in structured finance. So, that's really what's informing our views at this point.","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Alex, I'll go through the normal views on each of the segments that we talk about and then I will ask Rob Fauber to comment a little bit further on your question. So we'll put up now the slide that talks about our usual views from investment bank and capital markets economists. And the points here cover both financial and non-financial U.S. dollar issuance, and their ways of counting things may not align with our revenue categorization.","But looking at U.S. investment grade, the market has been quite resilient post-Brexit. All-in yields are below previous record lows, the 10 year is at 1.59% (19:27) this morning and spreads are quite attractive. M&A-related financing continues to be a strong driver. Favorable market conditions are expected to encourage opportunistic issuance post-earnings blackout. So as Ray said, this is typically a slow period. And full-year estimated issuance forecasts range from flat to up 10%. High-yield new issuance in Q2 was the strongest it's been in a year, but we expect it to see that given that the Brexit situation had backed up that market a bit. We expect as we move forward in the year, the issuance windows may be shorter, so again the risk-on, risk-off phenomenon. Full-year issuance forecasts range from down 10% to down 20%.","Leverage loans, we are pleased to see CLO issuance has started to reemerge, $30 billion of issuance in CLOs year-to-date. The pipeline is categorized as modest, and full-year 2016 estimated issuance forecasts range from down 10% to down 20%.","Looking at Europe, record low coupons as the ECB's corporate buying program continues to help the market and keep the yield flow. U.S. corporate are seeing value in moving to Europe and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year. And supply slowed as we've entered the traditional summer period and many issuers came to market before the Brexit vote on June 23.","European high-yield, the markets reopened after a period of muted (20:55) issuance following the Brexit vote, but again issuance windows are going to be shorter due to the macroeconomic view and the summer slowdown. And investors are moving down to speculative grade securities to search for yield given the low prevailing yield climate right at the moment.","So with that backdrop, I'll ask Rob if he wants to speak a little bit further about how we came to this view on MIS' components and guidance. Rob?","Robert Fauber - President - Moody's Investors Service","Yeah. Thanks, Ray and Linda. I think that covers it well. The only thing I would add to that, as Linda said, we've seen a rebound post Brexit vote. We went a couple of weeks where we had very little issuance. The first activity we saw was from the U.S. investment grade market. We saw Teva (21:45) deal very well received recently. We've seen a pickup then in the U.S. high-yield, European investment grade markets. And this week, as Linda mentioned, we've seen some activity in the European high-yield market. So we have resumed issuance activity. I would say we just balanced out with, as Linda said, the potential for some headline risk in these risk-on, risk-off windows as we go through the year. I think the greatest sensitivity to those windows will be in European leveraged finance.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right, great. Thanks for the lengthy answer. I just have one more quick, since you mentioned Brexit several times here. Just wondering how you're thinking about the Brexit impact when you think about your business right now. So, is this say while the eurozone is going to be in a little bit of a maybe slower growth environment or are there particular technicalities that you need to think about like is the market structurally different post Brexit or will it be when we actually finally get there? And then what do you think in terms of your business, in terms of moving people around, anything that you might have to change on your end?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think we are anticipating what you might characterize as a soft landing, but there is still going to be some structural change even with a soft landing. So we're not anticipating significant contagion effect throughout the rest of the EU or the eurozone. But we do recognize that assuming Brexit moves forward, and we are assuming it will, that we are going to \u2013 there're going to have to be negotiations as far as the depth of participation of the UK in the European market and that's going to affect really a number of firms, particularly in the financial services, financial institutions sector. And we will make appropriate decisions for ourselves and for Moody's, as decisions are being made in terms of the nature of the UK's participation in the European economy on a going forward basis. We really can't do anything until we see some more clarity around those decisions. And so we are obviously attentive and we are preparing for a variety of outcomes, but nothing that I would tell you is on the near-term horizon in terms of changes in our business or how we are approaching the business in Europe.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Fantastic. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. I guess just wanted to know if you could talk a little bit more, maybe Linda or Ray, I guess, on the expense management. You had talked about $50 million of kind of adjustments you made last quarter. Can you talk about there? And then also just with Moody's Analytics, can you elaborate what the higher compensation or kind of additional staff exactly, I guess what type of staff. Is it R&D, salespeople, I guess what they're investing in?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'll let Linda tackle the expense question and then maybe we can turn it over to Mark on the MA side.","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Tim, this is a little tricky to follow. So let me try to lay this out and I'm going to need a paragraph or two here to explain this appropriately. So, last quarter, we told you we've lowered our projected base business spending for the year by about $50 million, and we commented on that that had come from expense management actions and reduced incentive compensation. So, that was $50 million in reduction, which was great. But those savings were entirely offset by the addition of the GGY acquisition, operating expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. So we were down $50 million, but $50 million came back from GGY and FX.","Now since last quarter, we've done better with our cost savings than we thought we would. And additionally, we expect less negative impact from FX. So while we still have the partial offset from adding GGY's expenses, we now think we're going to be about $20 million in lower expenses versus the zero net income impact before. So we continue to work on this. We're very committed to ensuring that our expenses are in the right place, but again the nature of the company is that we can't reduce things immediately given a more challenging revenue quarter like we had in the first quarter, but we do think we've made good progress on bending the curve and moving the run rate, which we'll continue to show you, but probably more heavily in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. So I hope that's thorough enough for you, and sorry, it's not a particularly simple explanation. Does that work for you, Tim?","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. That's great.","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","And then Mark...","Mark E. Almeida - President, Moody's Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. A couple of things, Tim. First, we added a number of people as a result of the GGY acquisition. So, that's the lion share of the head count adds that we've had thus far this year, but we continue to add to support the growth in the business. We've added some additional sales capacity. We're continuing to do that. We've also added some software engineers and product development people because we've got a number of new product development initiatives underway that will be coming to market as we move into next year. So it's, I would characterize other than the GGY adds, a kind of business as usual, as we continue to build out the business.","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Then just a follow-up, Mark, as long as I have you. The new sales-type activity for the ERS business, I know you guys give the trailing 12-month number of 6%, but I think similar to last quarter, you've got a pretty tough comp somewhere in the trailing 12-month. So kind of the new pace of activity, can you give us any sort of color in terms of how the trend line is (28:15)?","Mark E. Almeida - President, Moody's Analytics, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say the trend is good. It's consistent with our expectations. I think the difference we're seeing this year compared with where we were in the first half of last year is that last year, early in the year, we had an unusually large number of very large transactions, multi-million dollar transactions, we had a number of those. And we haven't seen a similar number of similarly large transactions this year. So the pace of closing contracts continues to be quite good, but the average size of the contracts is smaller just because of the absence of some of those very outsized deals that we did last year. But the pipeline is very healthy and again consistent with our expectations. So we feel good about where we are.","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Is there any change in the market that explains the lack of the larger deals or is it just the timing, I mean...?","Mark E. Almeida - President, Moody's Analytics, Inc.","I think it's idiosyncratic to customers in specific situations. I don't think there is anything fundamentally different about the market or demand for what we're doing. It was \u2013 I think the unusual thing frankly is what we saw in the early part of last year and those \u2013 just having a number of very large transactions. It's typical for us to get a very big multi-million dollar \u2013 sort of north of $5 million deal from time to time. We just had a big concentration of those last year.","Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. Linda, just to close the loop on the expense update. So should we think about that incremental $20 million as, I guess what I'm trying to get to is last quarter you gave us that ramp from the first quarter to fourth quarter. Should that just be $20 million less then?","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Manav, let me talk to a little bit about the ramp, because we do have an update on that. We had said $35 million to $45 million ramp for 2016 and that was from Q1 to Q4, as I said. We now expect the ramp to be lower from $25 million to $35 million. That's the result of reduced cost savings, lower bonus funding and favorable FX.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Fair enough. Just on the \u2013 you explained the international situation and the potential uncertainty there. I guess I just wanted to revisit the structured side of the market a bit. I think last quarter, we had \u2013 well I guess, you guys posed a question on whether maybe this was structural or cyclical. I was just wondering if you guys had any updated thoughts on where the structured market sits there today.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'll let Rob comment on this in more detail. But as we observed earlier in the year, we think a lot of what's happening in structured market is cyclical, but there are some elements that could be structural depending on how market participants sort out the economics of some asset classes, as the risk retention rules change. Also we had a strong second quarter in structured in Europe and we will have to see how that plays out in the second half of the year, because some of that strength was concentrated in the UK mortgage sector and we'll have to see how that sector responds to what's been happening on the political side. But I don't know, if Rob has anything else he wants to add on that.","Robert Fauber - President - Moody's Investors Service","Yeah, Ray, I agree with that and I think we did see a significant uptick in activity in the second quarter relative to the first quarter in CMBS in addition to sorting out some of the risk retention issues and I think there was a slowdown in conduit lending earlier in the year that dampened the pipeline a bit. That will be supported on an ongoing basis by the refi wall and I think a regulatory focus by the banks \u2013 on bank commercial real estate exposures.","CLO, we saw a very strong activity towards the end of the quarter, supported by more availability of newly issued loans in the United States. And we do think we saw some Brexit pull-forward. So I think the pipeline may moderate a little bit going forward. And overall, I think we are saying that the market is trying to work through some of these risk retention requirements and I think we will see that in the back half of the year.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Just one more from me. I mean maybe I haven't noticed before, but I guess pointing out the new product introduction, I guess the MARQ score that you referred to. Is there any \u2013 like how should we think about, is that a big market opportunity or was that just a policy? I'm not sure, I'm just trying to understand it is something we should think about in terms of that launch?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I think it's really \u2013 it's not that it's an outsize opportunity that we're anticipating, but really it's one of the early results of our investment with Finagraph and our ability to partner in product development. So we wanted to point that out and in particular because it addresses a part of the market that some of our traditional products really aren't (34:05) focused on in terms of smaller businesses.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll continue on to Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. I guess I'll follow up first on the ERS business just to clarify. It sounds like the way we should think about the progression of revenue through the rest of the year is that the third quarter should be pretty stable relative to the first two quarters and then you still get the seasonal pickup in the fourth quarter of the year or should we actually see a bit of a dip, given you don't have the big contracts coming through?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. You should expect a dip, Andre, because keep in mind, we're guiding in ERS to top line growth in the high-single-digits and obviously we're running well above that thus far this year. Recall that we had that big, very big pull-forward in the fourth quarter of last year. And so our original guidance this year \u2013 when we did our fourth quarter earnings call, our original top line guidance for ERS was low-single-digits. We took that up to high-single-digits at the end of the first quarter after we did the GGY acquisition. So our expectations for this year were fairly modest growth in ERS relative to our historical growth rates because of that big pull-forward we had at the end of last year.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then I guess just to revisit the topic of international partnerships and how things are maturing in some of more emerging opportunities in China and India, and other significant long-term opportunities. Is there any update on conversations around where you see additional opportunities to get more share there or how those markets are maturing for issuance? That would be great.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Sure. With respect to India, the business that we're doing through ICRA is growing nicely. It's meeting our expectations for when we took majority control of ICRA. I think China is a different story in the sense that really not much has developed on the policy and regulatory side in recent months, but we have seen defaults occurring in the Chinese market. And you may recall, we've talked about this before that how that market evolves in terms of the willingness to allow credit problems to be revealed in the market rather than protected whether through the banking system or the government. It's going to be important for the role of particularly credit ratings that we're offering, but also our research. So I'm not obviously rooting for any companies to default, but in terms of a market structure development, I think it's promising to see that distressed companies are being allowed to fail. So, that's a promising development.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. So, Linda, can you give us a little bit of commentary on what you're seeing and what you're expecting in terms of the operating margins for the two segments? I'm noticing that the MIS margin is relatively flat year-to-year, which is pretty impressive given the revenue pressure, the Analytics margin, though (38:17), continue to be relatively soft. I know some of that is GGY, but are there other factors you would call out?","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Peter, you're correct regarding GGY and from \u2013 Mark will comment on this in a moment. But as MARQ's contribution to revenue or Moody's Analytics' contribution to revenue is now 33%, up from last year's 31%. MA finds itself in the position of attracting more overhead because of the revenue split. So, that is one factor that makes us a little tougher for the margin to climb in the MA business. Beyond that, I'll let Mark comment a little future on what he is seeing.","Mark E. Almeida - President, Moody's Analytics, Inc.","Yes, that's absolutely right, Linda. We've got two things hitting the margin. We've got the GGY acquisition. And the dynamics there are that in this year, we are getting more expense than revenue not because it's not a profitable business, but just because of the accounting treatment of the acquired revenue. We take a haircut on that in this year and we've got the integration costs associated with the acquisition as well as some deal costs. So we've got \u2013 it's certainly dilutive to the margin this year from the GGY acquisition. And then we've also got the point that Linda made about our attracting more corporate overhead, as our share of total MCO revenue goes up.","If you adjust for those two things, you'd actually see some modest margin improvement in MA. So, certainly all of the work that we're doing and the plans that we have to achieve margin expansion in MA are in place. We continue to move forward on those. We like the progress we're making. So from an operational perspective, we feel very good about where we are. It's just the way the numbers move around. It's difficult to see that on the P&L in the short run.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Any change, Mark, in terms of your expectations around being able to get to mid-20%s margins and any update in terms of timeframe?","Mark E. Almeida - President, Moody's Analytics, Inc.","No. No. It's still \u2013 that's still our plan. We've got a whole operating plan around that. As that, as you know, is largely an ERS project and it's still very much the plan for the business.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And, Peter, just to emphasize, this is also being exacerbated by the fact that MIS is in a soft period in terms of revenue growth. So, as MIS resumes its growth trajectory, growth pattern that we've seen historically, there will be a more favorable treatment of overhead for Moody's Analytics.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","That's helpful. Thank you. And, Linda, can I ask you one other thing, on the stock buyback front, so you've been repurchasing shares, your cash outlay for share repurchase has exceeded free cash flow in recent years, so the debt level has obviously gone up. I'm wondering how you're thinking about this over the next couple of years in terms of your comfort level with continuing to move the leverage ratio up.","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Peter. We're quite comfortable with the leverage level that we have right now. Obviously, maintaining our rating is very important. That's critical to us. We're being very thoughtful about this because operating cash flow based on net income is down a bit this year. So we've got to be thoughtful about that, but I think we will attempt to stay in the sort of range where we have been. We'll give guidance in February about the actual number for next year, but I think around this neighborhood of $1 billion seems to feel pretty good for us. We'll have to look at it for next year in terms of where all the numbers come out, maybe somewhat lighter, but we're going to have to see what we have going on as we move into next year.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned a pretty negligible impact from the move in FX from the British pound, and based on your mix of pound revenue and expenses, we would have thought I think that would be a greater net benefit to EPS. Could you just give some color on maybe why that's not the case?","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Toni, it's Linda. Thanks for your question, and I get all the complicated answers today. So let me try this. We did in our 2015 Investor Day talk about that only 2% of our revenues are GBP denominated, and 14% of our expenses are. So we did anticipate this question as to why this hasn't been more helpful to our EPS.","So while those numbers are correct, as you move down the P&L, the benefit is not as strong. So currently our entity structure takes away some of that benefit, and reported revenue and expense activities in British pounds essentially offset each other, given the way we have some of our legal entities and tax structuring set up. The existing structure reflects various operational, financial and legal considerations, and we look at those and make adjustments when appropriate.","Following, the Brexit vote, we're frankly going to have to wait and see what happens to see how we best might react to that. But right now, the situation is very unclear. So you're correct, there is a mismatch, but as you move down through the operating structure, we presently have in place, those numbers become more evenly matched. So I hope Toni if it's that thorough enough explanation for you.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I'll just add as this relates to a question that was asked earlier in terms of our reaction corporately to the Brexit vote. This is one of the areas, where we would be looking at whether we can improve the fact that, improve the benefit from the mismatch between revenues and expenses coming out of the UK. And that will involve looking at our operational and legal structures and seeing what we might be able to change in terms of trying to realize the benefits from that revenue cost misalignment.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And I think earlier in the call, in one of the answers you mentioned a bit of a pull-forward in issuance, is there any way to quantify that, or just give a little bit more color on that? Thank you.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I don't know one of my colleagues can quantify that, but we clearly saw a very active second quarter in issuance activity coming out of Europe. The corporate finance was \u2013 and structured finance were both up double-digits in Europe in the second quarter. And we are attributing a portion of that to likely pull-forward. And the fact that post Brexit, we were several weeks without really seeing much of any activity in terms of European issuance, just reinforces that belief that we had some pull-forward.","I would also, I guess, take this opportunity to just highlight that if we are correct about that pull-forward and correct about the slump in issuance activity being a result of Brexit as opposed to just seasonal, we would expect to see a more pronounced saw tooth pattern this year than we might have otherwise expected. So less issuance and revenue in the third quarter, and as a timing matter, probably more than we had anticipated in the fourth quarter. So I think it's not going to change the saw tooth, it's just going to emphasize that.","Mark E. Almeida - President, Moody's Analytics, Inc.","The only thing I would add to that, Ray, we saw the highest level of fundamental issuance activity in Europe, since the first quarter of 2015. And in addition, we had the introduction of the CSPP bond-buying program in early June, which further supported issuance there.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great.","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Just one last thing, Toni, as we look at this. The 10-year treasury has been about 1.56%, 1.59% spreads for financing. For investment grade bonds it might be around 1.44%. So if you are a U.S. corporate, you can issue a 10-year somewhere around 3%, which is historically very, very attractive. The numbers in Europe, the spreads would even be tighter maybe around 100 basis points. So issuance there is even more attractive.","High yield spreads have come in quite a bit. We're looking at about 540 basis points. So the overall conditions are really quite favorable and really good. So we're waiting to see what happens as we come out of this blackout period. But corporates are finding that overall rates and spreads are both very attractive. So we're just going to have to wait and see, what happens as we roll the calendar forward. Traditionally, as you know, August is the weakest time, but it is possible that after Labor Day, we may see additional activity, and we'll see, how that goes for the third quarter.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very helpful. And just lastly, this is sort of a more broad question, but how are you thinking about the potential impacts that Brexit may have on European disintermediation, either positive or negative?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think my view at this point would be that the disintermediation is going to continue, assuming what I described earlier, as a soft landing. Certainly, if there is a more fundamental disruption of the European Union, or participants in the Euro zone that would have at least cyclical and potentially more structural impacts, but we do not anticipate that being the case. And so, I think the disintermediation will continue to be a fundamental driver of the business coming out of Europe.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you. A few questions. First, Linda, just trying to better understand the costs in the quarter. Incentive compensation, I believe, is $32 million in the first quarter. What was in the second quarter, please?","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Incentive comp for the second quarter was $35.6 million, Craig. That was 10% of the total comp expense for the second quarter. And last year that incentive comp expense was $42.8 million. So we are down 17% year-over-year. So as we've said many times before, the incentive comp line takes the first hit, so that we can hold the margin, and frankly, we're pretty pleased about the 44.2% margin in the second quarter.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Okay. And also a currency question. When you think out to third and fourth quarters for currency impact on your total revenues and in your costs. I was just curious what you are budgeting there for 3Q and 4Q, please.","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So for the full year 2016, we are expecting that FX will have about a 1% negative impact on revenue, Craig, and about a 2% benefit on operating expense. So you can sort of work with that to see what you want to do with the balance of the year.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then also I typically like to ask, can you just help us, can you break out the revenues of the four main categories within ratings, the high yield (51:35) investment grade et cetera, the revenues there?","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Craig, given that we have so many analysts these days, we have an exciting announcement for you, that is, in the interest of time, we're going to be posting your revenue breakdown that you like to see under Selected Financial Information under that section of the IR homepage, and you can find that at ir.moodys.com. So you no longer have to write this all down just as soon as we are done with this call, you'll see it all up there for you to take a look at. So, after 12 years, we're finally improving how we handle this process, Craig. So we hope you're pleased.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","That's very helpful. One last quick question here. Ray or Linda, when you look out the next three years to four years, you've talked a lot about the very strong refinancing walls here and stuff. I am curious from a mixed standpoint of revenue, is that not helpful to your margins going forward, it's much more heavily tilted towards refinancing as opposed to a lot more new mandates, where you'd probably have to hire a lot more analyst over time?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. All things being equal, yes, refinancing is margin friendly. I hope that we're seeing a strong drive of new rating mandates and new business and high growth coming out of Moody's Analytics, which would constrain the margin expansion, but we'll have to see. But you are correct, all things being equal, that's going to help margins.","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Craig, it's Linda. Another thing to \u2013 just another quick thing to consider is, as we move through the back half of the year, it is possible we may start seeing pull-forward from 2017, and you're correct that our refinancing walls particularly in the U.S. are much more helpful to us in 2017 and on through the next few years. And that's something we took a look at as we thought about our strategic plans, but we would hope to have margin expansion as we move through the rest of the decade. And we'll hope to have more to say about as we move through the guidance cycles for next year.","But given the pretty attractive situation we have right now with rates, it may be possible that we start to see that 2017 pull-forward even at the end of this year. One thing we would like to make very clear to everyone is that, looking at the back half of the year, here we would expect that the fourth quarter, our expectation is that the fourth quarter will probably be stronger than the third quarter, given the traditional slowdown during the August period. So just something to think about as you look at our normal saw tooth pattern, we think that that will persist.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll continue onto Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. So I was just curious as we look at guidance, I'm wondering it looks like you kind of made the decision to take down sort of the issuance outlook, but you didn't take down the full guidance. I'm wondering what \u2013 is there a discrepancy in a particular thought process behind the differences in the two?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. It's really that we're anticipating \u2013 compared to the first quarter, we're anticipating less revenue, less expense, and as a result guiding toward the lower end of our range while still holding the margin. And all of that happens to be within the ranges that we had previously communicated. So there's movement within the range, but not crossing from mid-single to low-single or high-single to a mid-single, for example.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And then obviously Brexit is going to take a while and there is an extended timeline associated with it. I just want to get your thoughts on any particular either upcoming Brexit milestone, I guess is what I call it or event. And if you think that there might be any kind of unique behavior, in other words, can we see a situation where issuance is still taking place in the U.S., and it's just continuing to the UK. So I just want to get some further thoughts on how you look at both of those?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I mean at this point, I would say that this process is characterized by an absence of milestones.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's very fluid, even in terms of when the Article 50 letter might be delivered. And I think it's going to create \u2013 as Linda described earlier, periods of risk on and risk off. As negotiations move forward, there are elections in France and Germany and the Netherlands next year. There's a constitutional vote in Italy later this year. So there are lots of things that are going to be happening that Brexit may influence or may influence the timing of the lead (56:46) decision in the notice. So I agree, it's going to be protracted process, and it's one that, as I said, looks very fluid at the moment.","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Joe, it's Linda, also to add to that, of course we have the U.S. election in November, which potentially could cause borrowers to step away from the market for a bit of time. However, indications from the ECB seems to be that there is the potential for even further easing given what's happened with Brexit.","So as we thought about this, we kept our range and we indicate the lower end of the range, but I think it would be very fair to say there's an unusual amount of uncertainty around this. And it could break either way, we just don't know. If conditions continue to be very attractive and we see pull-forward in the fourth quarter, this could turn out differently. But we think it's prudent given all of these various factors which are causing a lot of choppiness that we think about it in this manner. And I don't know if Rob Fauber had anything further that he wanted to say about this, but this was a tough set of guidance for us to work through.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Okay. And then just lastly, you talked about maybe some operational changes particularly with the way that you look at the UK. I'm wondering as we look at this on a broader scale, is there any inning (58:23) that you could point out that you're doing sort of internally any different from either a resourcing perspective. Just in preparation for what could be some unusual volatility associated with it again, I guess lack of milestones.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","At this point, we have \u2013 well, since the beginning of the year, we have had a Brexit working group, that working group was expanded after the vote and includes multiple functions and disciplines throughout the organization, operational and accounting and legal, et cetera. It's really in an intelligence gathering phase at this point. There is not a lot that we feel we can appropriately do in terms of any changes to our activities at this point in time. But we want to be prepared to make any appropriate changes depending on how this process plays out. But I do want to emphasize that, however, it plays out, it looks like we're going to have a good long lead-time to respond. So I don't think this is going to be a process that surprises us in terms of some negative consequence for the company that we don't have time to adjust to, well before any decisions become effective.","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And it's probably useful to add that we're conducting business as usual with a very close eye on our expense base. I think you saw that we've guided to 4% expense growth this year and it's pretty simple actually. We're directing head count and other resources towards the Moody's Analytics business in sort of a two-thirds, one-third split with the rating agency getting the one-third, because the rating agency is having a little bit of a softer patch. In fact for the rating agency, Q2 expenses were down 2% year-over-year and most of the expense work that we've been doing comes on the T&E line and other things having to do with both the rating agency and the shared services organization.","So, we are investing in the businesses that are performing well. I think we're being very thoughtful on the rating agency, and we're being really thoughtful on the shared services part of the organization. So we feel good about how we're managing all of this. We continue with the acquisitions, including GGY and the remainder of KIS. But we've had these periods before and we tend to work through them and conditions do change from quarter-to-quarter.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now go to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon, everyone.","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Bill.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, a question for you on Moody's Analytics. Just wanted to ask, if you're seeing any change in the selling environment for ERS and professional services.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, no. We're not Bill. It's very much business as usual to be honest. I've been in London in the last couple of days and spent a lot of time with the sales team. We've got a lot going on. We're very busy. As I said earlier the pipeline is good. So, no.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then for the new MARQ product, does that compete or will it compete with your former parent Dun & Bradstreet or how do you see that evolving?","Mark E. Almeida - President, Moody's Analytics, Inc.","I guess the short answer I think, Bill, is no. But it certainly is a \u2013 it's a step that we're taking in that direction. We think there is some \u2013 it's clear to us that there is some need and some demand from both small companies and from bankers for more and better credit scores and credit analytics. So we are exploring that and as Ray said, we're doing that in collaboration with the Finagraph, in which we made the investment earlier this year.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then last question for me, is just to see if I can get your thoughts on, what to do with that $1.5 billion of offshore cash, a high-class problem I know, but...?","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Bill. It's Linda. In fact 78% of our cash is offshore now compared to 67% last year. And we do look to use that cash to fund acquisitions in fact as we have done the acquisition of the rest of KIS that's been funded by offshore cash, which was great. GGY is a Canadian company, partially funded by offshore cash which is also helpful.","And so right now, we don't have any particular plans for that cash. But we look at all alternatives all the time. If there is a different tax regime in the U.S., potentially we could make some changes there. But right now, we think that this situation is advantageous for us and we continue to look at everything, but we like global acquisitions and it's a place where we continue to look. So we are where we are for right now.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Arthur with Huber Research.","Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks. My question was on pull-forward and I think you guys have covered that pretty comprehensively. So I'll take a pass. Thanks.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks so much. I know it's late. You had given some color on your exposure revenues and expenses to the British pound. Can you just remind us what it is to the euro as well?","Linda S. Huber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think the overall expense \u2013 the overall impact of FX considering the pound and the euro is what I had said before, this is kind of a blended view. We expect 1% negative impact on revenue and a 2% benefit to operating expense. I believe, we've got it right, we were using rates of $1.34 to the pound and $1.10 to the euro in preparing these \u2013 excuse me \u2013 my colleagues have corrected me, $1.11 to the euro in preparing these documents.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. I guess, you said 2% of your revenues last year came from British pound and 14% of expenses again. Can you give us the similar numbers for the euro or I can always follow-up offline?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I don't have that in front of me, but we're happy to follow-up on that. I think this is obvious, but unlike the situation that we have in the UK, we have a lot of portion of revenue in euros and a smaller portion of expense.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That makes sense. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah.

After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to respond to your questions.","In the fourth quarter, Moody\u2019s delivered revenue of $866 million, a decline of 1% from the fourth quarter of 2014, but an increase of 2% on the constant currency basis. Operating expense for the fourth quarter was $533 million, flat to the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating income was $333 million, down 3% from the prior year period. Adjusted operating income defined as operating income less depreciation and amortization was $362 million, also down 3% from the same period last year.","Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 38.5% and the adjusted operating margin was 41.8%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.09, was down 3% from the prior year period. For full-year 2015, Moody\u2019s achieved revenue and EPS growth for the sixth consecutive year, despite difficult market conditions.","Moody\u2019s revenue was $3.5 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year or 9% on a constant currency basis. Revenue of Moody\u2019s Investors Service was $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% from 2014 or 8% on a constant currency basis.","Revenue of Moody\u2019s analytics was $1.2 billion, 8% higher than the prior year period, or 12% on a constant currency basis. Operating expense for full-year 2015 was $2 billion, up 6% from 2014. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating expense by 4%. Operating income of $1.5 billion increased 2% from 2014. Adjusted operating income of $1.6 billion increased 3% from the prior year period.","Operating margin for full-year 2015 was 42.3% and the adjusted operating margin was 45.5%. On a constant currency basis and excluding our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions, operating margin and adjusted operating margin would have increased approximately 40 and 50 basis points respectively year over year.","Full-year 2015 earnings per share of $4.63 increased from $4.61 in 2014. Non-GAAP EPS of $4.60 was up 9% from $4.21 in 2014. In both years, non-GAAP EPS excluded a $0.03 benefit from legacy tax matters. Full-year 2014 non-GAAP EPS also excluded a $0.37 gain, resulting from Moody\u2019s acquisition of a controlling interest is ICRA Limited in the second quarter of 2014.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda Huber","Thanks, Ray. I\u2019ll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody\u2019s total revenue for the fourth quarter decreased 1% to $866 million, but was up 2% on a constant currency basis.","U.S. revenue of $481 million was up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Non-U.S. revenue of $385 million was down 4%, but up 4% on a constant currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 44% of Moody\u2019s total revenue. Recurring revenue of $446 million represented 51% of total revenue.","Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody\u2019s Investors Service, total MIS revenue for the quarter was $545 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but flat on a constant currency basis. U.S. revenue decreased 2% to $338 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $206 million declined 7%, but was up 2% on a constant currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 38% of total ratings revenue.","Moving now to the lines of business for MIS; first, global corporate finance revenue in the fourth quarter was $246 million, down 7% from the prior year period, or 4% on a constant currency basis. This result reflected lower levels of non-U.S. investment grade and global speculative grade bond issuance, partially offset by improved levels of U.S. and European bank loan issuance. U.S. corporate finance revenue increased 1%, while non-U.S. revenue decreased 20%.","Second, global structured finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $114 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but flat on a constant currency basis. Increased activity across most areas of structured finance partially offset lower CLO issuance. U.S. structured finance revenue was down 3% and non-U.S. revenue was down 5%.","Third, global financial institutions revenue of $92 million was up 8% from the prior year period or 13% on a constant currency basis. This revenue was driven primarily by the U.S. insurance and European banking sectors. U.S. financial institutions revenue was up 7% and non-U.S. revenue was up 8%.","Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $85 million was down 5% versus the prior year period or 2% on a constant currency basis, primarily as a result of decreased U.S. public finance activity. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was down 10%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 4%.","MIS Other, which consists of non-rating revenue from Moody\u2019s majority-owned joint ventures ICRA and Korea Investors Service or KIS, contributed $7 million to MIS revenue for the fourth quarter, compared to $8 million in the prior year period.","And turning now to Moody\u2019s Analytics, global revenue for MA of $321 million was up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2014 or 6% on a constant currency basis. U.S. revenue of $143 million was up 6% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $178 million was up 1%, or 6% on a constant currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 56% of total MA revenue.","And moving now to the lines of business for MA; first, global Research, Data & Analytics or RD&A, revenue of $161 million was up 8% from the prior year period or 11% on a constant currency basis, and represented 50% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly due to strong new sales and product upgrades coupled with record customer retention. U.S. revenue was up 10% and non-U.S. revenue was up 5% or 11% on a constant currency basis.","Second, Enterprise Risk Solutions or ERS generated record revenue of $122 million and was up 1% from last year or 4% on a constant currency basis. Growth was driven by strength in the credit assessment and originations and stress testing businesses. U.S. and non-U.S. ERS revenue were each up 1%.","Trailing 12-months revenue and sales for ERS increased 14% and 11% respectively. As we\u2019ve noted in the past, due to the variable nature of product timing - excuse me, project timing and completion, ERS revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility.","Third, global professional services revenue of $38 million, was down 10% from the prior year period or 6% on a constant currency basis. This result was primarily due to lower net new business at Copal Amba as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on the credentials and licensing business. U.S. professional services revenue was down 7%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 11%.","And turning now to expenses, Moody\u2019s fourth quarter expense was $533 million, flat to the prior year period. An increase in compensation expense for merit increases and hiring was entirely offset by reduced incentive compensation. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 3%.","Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 of 38.5% was down from 39.3% in 2014. Adjusted operating margin of 41.8% was down from 42.4%. On a constant currency basis, and excluding our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions, operating margin for the quarter would have been flat year over year and adjusted operating margin would have increased approximately 20 basis points.","Moody\u2019s effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29.4% compared with 28.1% for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to a reduced percentage of income from lower tax rate jurisdictions primarily offset by the favorable resolution of tax audits.","And now I\u2019ll provide an update on capital allocation. On December 15, 2015 Moody\u2019s increased its quarterly dividend by 9% from $0.34 to $0.37 per share of common stock. Over the course of 2015, Moody\u2019s returned $272 million to its shareholders by dividend payments.","With regard to share repurchase, during the fourth quarter of 2015, Moody\u2019s repurchased 2 million shares at a total cost of $193 million or an average cost of $100.09 per share and issued 261,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan.","Full-year 2015, Moody\u2019s repurchased 10.9 million shares for $1.1 billion or $101.14 per share, and issued 3.2 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plan. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2015 totaled 196.1 million shares, down 4% from December 31, 2014.","In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized $1 billion share repurchase program to commence following the completion of the existing program. Including this incremental program as of December 31, 2015, Moody\u2019s had $1.5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","And turning now to Moody\u2019s leverage, in November 2015 Moody\u2019s issued $300 million of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2044. At the end of 2015 Moody\u2019s had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter-end were $2.2 billion, up $555 million from December 31, 2014.","As of December 31, 2015 approximately 68% of Moody\u2019s cash and cash equivalents were maintained outside the U.S. Free cash flow for the full-year of 2015 was $1.1 billion, up 13% from full-year 2014, primarily due to changes in working capital.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ray.","Raymond McDaniel","Thanks, Linda. I\u2019ll conclude this morning\u2019s prepared comments by discussing our full-year guidance for 2016.","Moody\u2019s outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued.","These assumptions are subject to some degree of uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Moody\u2019s guidance assumes foreign currency translation for the British pound of a $1.42 to the pound and for the euro of $1.09 to the euro. For all other currencies, Moody\u2019s assumes end of 2015 exchange rates.","Although we expect continued market volatility, we\u2019re projecting mid-single digit percent revenue growth in 2016 as well as EPS of $4.75 to $4.85. Operating expenses expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Moody\u2019s projects an operating margin of approximately 42% and an adjusted operating margin of approximately 45%.","The effective tax rate is expected to be 32% to 32.5%. 2016 free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion. Moody\u2019s expect share repurchases to be approximately $1 billion, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.","Capital expenditures are projected to be $125 million to $135 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $130 million.","For MIS, we expect 2016 revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Both U.S. and non-U.S. MIS revenue are also expected to increase in mid-single-digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is expected to be flat. Structured finance revenue and public, project and infrastructure finance revenue are each expected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range.","Financial institutions revenue is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. For MA, 2016 revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is expected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range and non-U.S. revenue is expected to be flat.","Research, data and analytics revenue is projected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Enterprise risk solutions revenue is expected to grow in the low-single-digit percent range, following earlier than anticipated recognition of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015. Professional services revenue is expected to decline in the low-single-digit percent range.","This concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody\u2019s Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody\u2019s Analytics. We\u2019d be pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Yes, good afternoon. My first question, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019re anticipating, is just around the issuance assumptions, particularly on the ratings business. Could you just help give us a little bit more color on your underlying assumptions in terms of the global issuance volume forecast and maybe some of the moving pieces within those categories? And it sounds like other than corporate finance, everything else is up nicely, which is sort of contrary to I think what a lot of us were expecting. So just hoping you could shed some color on those pieces there.","Raymond McDaniel","Sure, let me let Linda start this off and if I have anything to add, I will.","Linda Huber","Sure, Manav, Salli is going to put up a new slide, which looks at the summation of views we\u2019ve gotten from a number of investment banks. And we received this on the afternoon of February 3. This is solely U.S. issuance information though. And it is for both financial and nonfinancial bonds and leverage loans. I\u2019ll go through each of the categories that hopefully you could see up on the screen. Finally, I\u2019ll conclude by making some quick comments on the European outlook.","So firstly, investment grade, for January we saw about $125 billion of issuance. And it was the fourth highest volume month ever. However, $46 million of that issuance came from one deal, the Amba\u2019s [ph] deal. We are encouraged by approximately $200 billion in the visible M&A pipeline, but volatility is impacting the pace of that issuance. So the pipeline is healthy, but we do seem to have some backup in the issuance pipeline.","All-in funding costs are generally quite attractive. And lastly, the last point there and it\u2019s just in M&A, shareholder-friendly activities continue to be cited as a use of proceeds. So for the year, we see about $1.2 trillion in investment grade issuance in the U.S., which is about flat year over year. And that\u2019s a reasonable outlook that we can work with.","Moving on to the speculative grade categories, high-yield bonds, January about $7 billion of issuance. The leverage market was soft in December. That tone has continued into January and that makes us cautious. $35 billion is in the forward pipeline, and again we see two classes of issuers, those with higher quality speculative grade names have access and those with lower ratings don\u2019t; continuing headwinds coming from the commodities\u2019 volatility issues and default rate concerns.","And last week, we saw inflows back into high-yield funds, which we hadn\u2019t seen since the start of the year, which may indicate that perhaps we\u2019re establishing some stability which would be helpful.","Though for the year, estimates range pretty widely on high-yield bonds. About $240 billion is the sort of mean number that we\u2019re seeing. That\u2019s down 15% year over year. Last year, I think we did about $275 billion. And this number has come down as we\u2019ve moved to this point in time.","Leverage loans, we saw a $20 billion of issuance left in January and expecting $260 billion, which is down 10% for the year; so we\u2019ve seen low volumes in the high-yield bond markets and loans are about on pace with 2015. Leverage loan activity was consistent week-to-week in January. And banks expect this to continue.","Again we can see $45 billion in the forward pipeline, but the timing of that is very much open to discussion and of taken default could cause the loan space to be impacted negatively, but less so than the high yield bond market; so investment grade in summary in the U.S., about flat this year, high yield bonds down 15% and leverage loans down about 10%.","Now in Europe, just in terms of what we\u2019re seeing there, generally, we see broader views as to what could happen this year in terms of issuance, but generally for Europe from the banks we\u2019re seeing investment grade up about 10%, high yield bonds down about 10%, and leverage loans up about 5%.","In terms of what we are seeing, the ten-year is quite tame at this point about 184, 185, and spreads on U.S. investment grade bonds about 216 bps and in high yield about 765 bps. So spreads have widened, but the ten-years come in, so we think all-in financing costs are relatively attractive.","In Europe, the spread numbers are about 154 basis points for investment grade and for high yield about 538 basis points.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ray. And potentially Michel may have some other color as well.","Raymond McDaniel","The only thing I would add is with respect to new rating mandates. We did have a healthy pace of new mandates throughout the year in 2015 coming in at about 770 new mandates. And that has continued to be a healthy pipeline early this year. So there\u2019s obviously going to be decisions by potential new issuers about when and if they want to get in the market and I agree with Linda\u2019s comments on stability, will encourage them in. But we take that as a good sign in terms of the pipeline of new activity of fresh names.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for that. And so, just one follow-up, in terms of just clarifying your mid-single-digit guidance for the total company and then for the divisions as well, what is the exact FX impact you are assuming in both those for the total? And I presume MA has a bigger hit to the numbers?","Raymond McDaniel","The overall impact of FX would be about 1% unfavorable on revenue and about 2% favorable on expense. I don\u2019t have the breakdown by the individual business units, but that\u2019s for the overall corporation.","Manav Patnaik","Okay.","Linda Huber","Manav, just to sort of put a stake in it for you, we\u2019ve looked at - we budgeted as we said at $1.09 on the euro, the euro has in fact moved up a bit from there; and $1.42 on the pound. The net impact is, if the euro moves down from $1.09 by about $0.01 that hits us about $0.01 in EPS. But as we said, since we finished putting this together and in fact the euro has appreciated versus the dollar. And I don\u2019t know if anyone else has any more specific comments. And that\u2019s\u2026","Manav Patnaik","Okay. All right. Thanks guys. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue.","Linda Huber","Okay.","Raymond McDaniel","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin","Thank you. Good morning.","Linda Huber","Good morning, Andre.","Andre Benjamin","My first question is the one area you didn\u2019t talk about in the detailed rundown is the structured finance pocket. So I\u2019m just wondering what you\u2019re seeing that makes you assume that accelerates the high-single-digit from mid-single-digit guidance last year and report it? And then, how much of that is being driven by a U.S. versus a Europe view?","Raymond McDaniel","Sure. We are really looking at strength in multiple areas of structured finance in 2016, within offset coming from the CLO sector, which we think is going to be softer. And really, I think the most important driver in structured side is the refinancing that has to occur for commercial real estate.","So we expect to have a strong year for CMBS in particular, but also we expect to continue to see growth in the asset-backed and residential mortgage-backed security sectors. That is - and that improvement we anticipate in really all geographies, probably stronger in the U.S. except for the CLO area than in Europe, but we do expect to see growth around the world.","Andre Benjamin","And then, you guys have always done a very good job of controlling cost and delivering on the margin. I guess, no one has the perfect crystal ball on the issuance for the year. If the view in issuance changes to the upside or, god forbid, to the downside, how should we think about how much room left you have there to continue to manage cost since you have already run the ship so tight so far?","Linda Huber","Sure, Andre. Couple of comments. I would note that in the fourth quarter expenses were flat. And with incentive comp, we offset any other increase in compensation. So we\u2019re pretty aggressive about managing expenses as you had noted.","Just a couple of comments. If in fact the top line does pick up, we get pretty good operating leverage on those increases from the top-line. The only incremental piece that we really need to pay would be incentive compensation. So we look at maybe $0.60, $0.70 on the dollar of revenue so that is very helpful.","As you pointed out the top line is the tricky part for this year. And we\u2019re looking at margin being about flat. We finished last year at 42.3% and we\u2019re saying that will be about flat this year. To be perfectly honest, it\u2019s a little tough for us to have the margin come in exactly at where we expect it to. But we are reinvesting in our business and we think flat margin is fine.","From an FX adjusted basis, we\u2019re planning for expenses to increase by about $100 million in 2016 and those are about evenly split between three different things. The first is the roll-forward of the hiring we did at 2015. Second would be the hiring we\u2019re doing in 2016. And the third would really be around technology and real estate changes that we\u2019re making.","On the technology piece, we are investing in our systems. Cyber security is a piece of that, which I think every financial corporation is looking at right now. And then we do have a bit heavier than usual real estate piece. I think you\u2019ve probably seen, we\u2019ve taken two floors over at One World Trade Center at very attractive rates. And the 52nd floor here in this building at 7 World Trade also at very attractive rates. But we do need to get those new floors online here and there will be some expenses associated with that.","So nothing very exciting, but to drive the top line, which we think is pretty healthy, given what other companies are putting up. To drive mid-single-digits we do need to spend some money. And our plans are modest, but we are thinking revenue will be about flat. I don\u2019t know if Ray or the division heads had anything more to say on that.","Raymond McDaniel","No, the only reminder I would make is that our reaction to cyclical changes is going to be less material than anything we see happening that\u2019s more structural in nature. And so, if we do see structural changes in our markets, we are going to react more aggressively on the expense side.","Andre Benjamin","Thank you.","Linda Huber","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Hey, good morning.","Linda Huber","Hi, Alex.","Alex Kramm","Hey, coming back to the guidance for a second. Can you talk about the recurring fees on the rating agency a little bit? First of all, what are you expecting there? But more importantly, when you talk about monitoring fees in particular, I think that\u2019s the biggest piece, how should we be thinking about that from a cyclically challenged perspective if there is one?","I guess, what I\u2019m trying to say is, if there are defaults in the high yield market that are picking up, if issuance slows at one point do monitoring fees start to kind of like roll-off and how should we be thinking about that?","Linda Huber","Alex, let - maybe Ray and I can take a start at that and then we\u2019ll ask Michel to think about it. The monitoring fees are the most constant part of our business. And the average life of debt right now is about seven years. So they moved very slowly. But we do have price increases on those fees year over year on new mandates that we bring on. And we would expect that that line would move to the upside and would move gradually.","I\u2019m not sure that defaults would have much of an impact on that. They\u2019re really two different things. But I\u2019ll ask Ray for his comments.","Raymond McDaniel","Yes. It would not be material. We have, I think as Linda mentioned, we have a trailing 12 months default rate for high yield at little over 3%, and we\u2019re expecting that to increase by year end 2016 to about 4.5%. That 1.2%, 1.3% difference in default rates is not going to be material to the overall monitoring fees we get in, which obviously include not only the high yield sector, but the investment grade sector, and non-corporate monitoring fees as well.","Alex Kramm","Okay, great. And then, secondly, this is small part of your business, but was a little surprised in the professional services guidance. I mean, it seems like last year there was a - the tough comps from shutting down some businesses, that having that down again this year. Anything else going on, there is just a very tough environment, or why is not accelerating now, that you can right size the business it seems?","Linda Huber","Sure, Alex. I\u2019ll take a shot on that for Copal Amba and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark on the training business. So what\u2019s behind this Copal Amba? We had attrition of one large customer account. Now as you aware, you\u2019re quite aware, Alex, the global banks are having some challenges right now. And some of them are responding to that by increasing headcount at Copal Amba, but one large bank went the other way. So we have to lap back.","We are working very hard on restructuring of sales functioning and broadening away from the global banks in terms of the customers that we serve. And that\u2019s going well. We are encouraged by our early progress there. But we did make very good strides integrating the business last year.","We\u2019ve really ramped up our internal efforts of having Copal Amba to support both Moody\u2019s Analytics and the rating agency. So we are very encouraged by that. But as I said, we did have one large bank go the other way, and we\u2019ve got to work through that. Maybe Mark wants to talk a little bit about training.","Mark Almeida","Sure, Alex. In the training business, we had a very good year in 2015 on the sales side in training, which is going to result in much better revenue out of that business in 2016. So that\u2019s the good news. We still have a pretty sizable FX hit in the training business, so which is going to hold down the reported growth rate. But I think we\u2019ve got some - we got much more strength on the training piece of professional services in 2016 than we saw in 2015.","Alex Kramm","Okay, helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert","Thanks, good morning. So maybe for Mark, the strength in the Enterprise Risk Solutions business is noteworthy. I know you pointed out that some of it is timing, but this is the second year in a row we\u2019ve got this timing benefit. So I\u2019m wondering why you\u2019re not a little more upbeat in terms of the revenue growth potential there.","Mark Almeida","I am not more upbeat about 2016, because we had two consecutive years of benefit from timing. We had a big revenue recognition event in the fourth quarter. We knew that was coming. We just didn\u2019t know when it was going to come and it happened to come through in the late part of 2015 rather than in early 2016. So that was good news for 2015, but of course it impacts the 2016 outlook.","The other thing we have going on, Peter, is that we continue to take some FX hits as we roll into 2016 as well. So we are a bit modest in our expectations for ERS in 2016. I\u2019d just remind you that over the last - well, we had 1% growth in the fourth quarter in 2015, but that was off of a very strong 42% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014, so that was pretty good.","If you look at the prior seven quarters, four of those quarters we came in at 24% or better and the other three were 12%, 13% and 14%. So we\u2019ve had a pretty long run now, a very strong growth in the ERS business. And we\u2019re just going to settle out a little bit in 2016 as we kind of get the - as the timing normalizes, if you will.","Peter Appert","What does that suggest then, Mark, in terms of the sustainable growth rate in that business?","Mark Almeida","We continue to feel very good about the sustainability of the business. Again, if you look at on the sales side, sales growth was very healthy in 2015 despite our having taken about two points of FX hit.","The other thing, I would just remind you of, and we\u2019ve spoken about this before, but we told you we are deemphasizing the Implementation Services business. That\u2019s the relatively low margin piece of the ERS business, which has been driving a lot top-line growth for us, but hasn\u2019t been doing much on the margin.","So as we back away from that, we\u2019re going to give up a couple of points of growth on the top line to set ourselves up for more profitable growth going forward. And that\u2019s a little bit - again, if these plans work out the way we\u2019ve organized them, that\u2019s going to be again a bit of a one-time hit to top line growth in 2016, but should set us up for good growth going forward and more profitable growth going forward.","Peter Appert","So on that front, Mark, you\u2019ve talked in the past about this mid-20% margin target. The margin is up just a little bit in 2015. So is the mid-20% target still relevant? Will we see progress towards that goal in 2016? And I\u2019m asking this partly in the context of Linda\u2019s earlier comment about sort of being comfortable with flattish margins. Are you backing away at all from the expectation of margin upside in Analytics?","Mark Almeida","Well, as we\u2019ve said, we are - we view the margin expansion program for MA as something that is going to take place over several years. We view it as a marathon rather than a sprint. So we still have those plans in effect. We have the variety of things that we\u2019re doing, that we believe will position us to run a more profitable business.","The other thing I would note however, Peter, just to keep in mind in the context of Linda\u2019s comments is that, as MA grows and grows faster than the rating agency as we saw in 2015, we do attract more corporate overhead. So we\u2019ve also - we\u2019ve got that offset going on as well. But nevertheless, our plans for driving more profit out of the business are still intact. We\u2019re executing on those plans. We feel good about what we\u2019re doing.","Peter Appert","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll follow-up later. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Bird with FBR.","William Bird","Good morning. Just as a follow-up, Mark, I was wondering if you could size the timing benefit to revenues in ERS on the deliverable that was referenced. And secondly just wondering, if you\u2019re seeing any change in client behavior in terms of their willingness to buy given the context of world volatility. Thank you.","Mark Almeida","As for the first piece, it was about $20 million that we pulled from 2016 into 2015. So it just gives you a sense of the scale of that thing. With respect to your second question, the short answer is no, demand continues to be very healthy. We really haven\u2019t observed any meaningful change in customer behavior.","We haven\u2019t observed sales cycles lengthening or anything like that. The sales pipeline is very, very healthy. So honestly, I can\u2019t say that we\u2019ve observed anything that would suggest that what we\u2019re reading about in the newspapers is impacting demand for what we\u2019re selling.","William Bird","And just as a follow on, can you give us a sense of just the size, rough size, of the implementation business that you are deemphasizing?","Mark Almeida","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve disclosed that in the past. We\u2019ve talked about - if you think about that as kind of the nonrecurring portion of the ERS business or at least a substantial piece of it, you can look at it in those terms. I think we\u2019ve talked about that.","Raymond McDaniel","Yes, and I would also just add that this is not - we\u2019re not stepping away completely from Implementation Services.","Mark Almeida","Yes, yes.","Raymond McDaniel","We will still do some of that, because it supports the product sales.","Mark Almeida","Yes.","Raymond McDaniel","So it\u2019s difficult for us to give you a precise number on that, because we don\u2019t know exactly what that interaction between implementation services and product sales will continue to be.","Mark Almeida","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. I mean to be clear we\u2019re not taking Implementation Services to zero. We\u2019re just not - we\u2019re planning to keep it flat in 2016. But as Ray observed, and he\u2019s quite right, we don\u2019t have complete control over that. A lot of that will be down to what the customers want and what we think is the right thing to do in order to drive growth in the licenses and subscription sides of business.","William Bird","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh","Yes, thanks. I want to ask, emerging markets, just in the past you guys have - it\u2019s basically my math was it added almost a point to growth in the last couple of years just in general, obviously choppier markets there. Can you talk about what\u2019s the outlook there? Have you seen a slowdown in new ability to add new mandates and grow in those markets?","Raymond McDaniel","Michel, do you want to comment on the emerging market.","Michel Madelain","Yes. I think clearly these markets have been, as you know, are subject to a fair amount of stress. And we\u2019ve seen impact notably in Latin America post-Petrobras. And in Asia actually, we have - we continue to have a good pipeline of new mandates, coming out of China notably. Although, the region clearly is subject to some of the economic pressures that you\u2019re very familiar with.","Rise of emerging market, that\u2019s really - the Gulf States and Middle East, and those are small businesses really.","Timothy McHugh","Okay. And as we think about price I know you target 3% to 4% over time. But I guess in the context of the current macro. Can you get, I mean, does still serve for us to think about three or four points of growth from price and the type of environment that we\u2019re expecting for 2016?","Mark Almeida","Yes. We have built in pricing assumptions for 2016 that support our outlook, so we are still able to factor in price. As I\u2019ve said in the past, some of the price does relate to issuance volumes.","So if we change bond fees, and bonds are not issued then changing the bond fee doesn\u2019t really matter. So what we\u2019re going to - what the mix is in terms of issuance and how that aligns with where we feel we are adding particular value and think that we can adjust pricing. So I would stick with our long term comment that we think we can get three to four points on average. And we\u2019ll see this year based on volume.","Timothy McHugh","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes, hi, thank you. Ray, you talked about default rates for high yield. I believe you said in the U.S. 3% going to 4.5% the year out. What are those numbers, please, if you exclude the energy sector?","Raymond McDaniel","If you exclude energy, as of year-end 2015, the 12-month default rate was actually quite low. It was about 1.6%. So with - and we don\u2019t have a - don\u2019t publish a speculative grade forecast by industry. But you can look at that 1.6% ex oil and gas, and metals and mining as compared to the overall default rate of 3.2% as of December.","Craig Huber","Okay. And then also, Ray, just in general, when you look at the corporate debt market out there, both in the U.S. and Europe, are you seeing anything out there that makes you think there\u2019s too much debt in the system out there, whether the coverage ratio is relative to EBITDA, what have you, relative to GDP?","Raymond McDaniel","I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen anything that we characterize as a bubble. There obviously are some parts of the market that have more leverage than others and obviously there is stress in the energy, metals and mining sectors. But looking at the market more broadly, there\u2019s nothing that I would say we\u2019ve identified as being a particular red flag.","Craig Huber","Okay. And then also in your guidance for ratings up mid-single-digit revenue for the year, would you characterize that as back half of the year weighted? And if so, are you also expecting more than normal pull forward, if any debt issuance from the refinancing wall in 2017 coming into the back half of 2016? I mean, how do you sort of see this either playing out in terms of the cadence of the revenue growth or lack thereof as the year progresses to get to that mid-single-digit number for ratings? Thanks.","Raymond McDaniel","Yes. I\u2019ve thought for a while that the second-half of the year offers more potential probably than the first-half of the year and in part, because we do have the refinancing build from 2017 through 2019 coming closer on the horizon. And also just because we\u2019ve been through a recent period of really strong volatility in the markets, and I think markets looking for more stability in energy and seeing where spreads settle that\u2019s going to encourage. The stability itself will encourage issuance in addition to the refinancing walls that will be coming closer.","Craig Huber","Okay. But a last question, Linda, I typically ask you. Can you break down the revenues by your four major categories within ratings, high-yield versus bank loan versus investment grade in the fourth quarter?","Linda Huber","Sure, Craig. We can do that. So we\u2019re doing Q4 2015 and the first line of business is corporate finance. So we\u2019re going to look at four different areas: investment grade, spec grade, bank loans and other. The total revenue for this category for the fourth quarter was $246 million. So investment grade was $71 million, about flat from the fourth quarter last year in terms of percentages, little bit down on dollar basis.","Spec grade decreased to $26.5 million from last year\u2019s $34.1 million in the fourth quarter. Bank loan interestingly increased in the fourth quarter of 2015 to $44 million from last year\u2019s $37 million. And bank loans were 18% of this total corporate line. Other was $104.4 million, down from last year\u2019s $112 million, and represented 42% of splits.","And again corporates represented 45% of the MIS revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015. Moving on to structured, we\u2019ll go through five different lines. The total for structured is $114 million in 2015. First, to look at ABF and that was about $24 million, up a little bit from last year\u2019s $22 million. Second is residential mortgage-backed securities, $23 million, up a bit from last year\u2019s $20 million; commercial real estate, $37.5 million, up from last year\u2019s about $36 million; and structured credit at about $30 million, down from last year\u2019s $40 million; and others are pretty negligible, so again that all comes to $214 million.","If we move on to FIG, total is about $92 million for the fourth quarter, and we look at banking, insurance, managed investments and other. So banking is about $61 million, about flat from last year\u2019s $60 million. Insurance at about $24 million is up nicely from last year\u2019s $19 million. Managed investments at $4.4 million, was flat to last year. And other at two-and-change was also flat to last year.","And then lastly we go to PPIF, total is $85 million here. We\u2019ve got three categories, which include PFG and sovereign first, which is about $46 million. Last year we\u2019re about $48 million on this line for the fourth quarter. Project and infrastructure is the second category, about $40 million here, which is down from last year\u2019s $42 million. And then other is negligible really in both periods. So I think that\u2019s the total split of the big categories. Craig, does that get it done for you?","Craig Huber","Yes, perfect. Thank you.","Linda Huber","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research.","Doug Arthur","Linda, you mentioned that you dropped incentive comp or controlled that pretty aggressively in the fourth quarter. Can you give us some idea of the numbers there? Thanks.","Linda Huber","Sure. So for fourth quarter of 2015 incentive compensation was 13% of our total comp expenses of $336 million for the quarter, which was just about flat to what we did for last year, but the components were quite different.","For this year we put up $44 million in the fourth quarter for incentive compensation. Last year we put up $53 million. So this was delta of almost $9 million. The fourth quarter of 2015 didn\u2019t come in as strong as we might have liked, and therefore the incentive compensation accrual backed off by quite a bit.","Also what was interesting is last year we did have $7 million of profit sharing in the fourth quarter. And for this fourth quarter we did not have any profit sharing. And so that saved another $7 million, so really $16 million there, reduction in those two lines.","Now, on salaries and benefits, we did move up from $255 million last year to about $272 million this year. So again, that increase in salaries and benefits were - that was completely offset by what happened with the incentive compensation. Stock-based comp was about flat at $20.5 million, so not much going on differently there.","But, I think, what we want to demonstrate here, Doug, is we pulled the incentive comp lever pretty hard if things are a little bit weaker than we think. And the first reduction there goes to unfortunately to the employees. So that\u2019s how we handled it. I hope that\u2019s helpful.","Doug Arthur","Yes. No, that\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William Warmington","Good afternoon, everyone.","Raymond McDaniel","Hi, Bill.","William Warmington","So I have a question for you on MIS. If you look at total MIS growth rate on a two-year basis, and by that I mean you just take the growth of a quarter and add it to the growth rate of a quarter year ago, it had been moving at about mid-teens for the first three quarters of 2015 and then the fourth quarter just reported it dropped to about 4%.","And if we assume - and that 4% would line up with the guidance for MIS for 2016 - if we assume that that 4% two-year comp is kind of the target for 2016 and we go through by the quarters and keeping that 4%, it would imply Q1 will be about - down about 10%, Q2 up about 2%, Q3 up about 4%, and Q4 up about 7% to 8%.","And I just wanted to run that by you to see of that is how the methodology was okay or maybe you could suggest a better one in terms of looking at how to think about the progression of MIS throughout the year given the uncertainties of the market.","Raymond McDaniel","Bill, it\u2019s Ray. I have to be honest; I didn\u2019t quite keep up with all the math. But maybe what I can do to be helpful is to remind listeners that our revenue typically follows a saw-tooth pattern with the second and fourth quarters being stronger, first and third quarters being softer.","We did not see that pattern strongly in 2015, because of weakness in the fourth quarter. And I would anticipate at this point in time that we would be back to more of the traditional saw-tooth going into 2016. So second and fourth quarters - and I would also anticipate that, as I mentioned a little while ago, that we may see momentum picking up in the second-half of the year this year.","William Warmington","Yes. Okay. Ray, a couple of housekeeping items then, I wanted to just double check to see what the organic constant currency growth was for the company. I know that we don\u2019t have a lot coming in from acquisitions with Lewtan and Copal, but I thought I\u2019d ask for that.","Raymond McDaniel","I don\u2019t have the organic constant currency. I had quoted that overall growth was 9% for the corporation on a constant currency basis. So we picked up about 4, 4.5 points on a constant currency basis, but I don\u2019t have the organic\/inorganic breakouts. Mark, do you have?","Mark Almeida","Yes. For MA, well, we were - as reported, we were up 8% for the year, organic constant currency would have been almost 10%.","William Warmington","Got it. Thank you. And the last question was - on the mandates you mentioned 770 in 2015 for the year. I just wanted to double check, what were the new mandates in 2014, 2013 if we haven\u2019t had those?","Mark Almeida","I don\u2019t have them in front of me but they were about a 1000 each year. So we were down from those peak years and those were peak years, those were record years for new mandates. But the 770 compares quite favorably to years prior to 2013. So we\u2019re sort of in a middle range at this point between the peak and the historical run rate.","William Warmington","Got it. All right, well, thank you very much.","Mark Almeida","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Warren Gardiner with Evercore Investments.","Warren Gardiner","Hey, good morning. Thank you. So I just - I know that M&A can kind of drive these both kinds of services. And we kind of saw that in 2015 with the nice benefit to revenue for ratings. But I was just curious if we stay in kind of a choppier backdrop, how you guys could potentially benefit if at all from structuring related services?","Linda Huber","Warren, it\u2019s Linda. I think you had said M&A activity. I\u2019m assuming you mean for the economy as a whole has been helpful to us in terms of bond issuance. You wanted us to comment on that. I\u2019m not sure we were quite clear on the second part of your question there.","Warren Gardiner","Oh, I was just saying sort of additional services related to M&A may have kind of helped you guys this year. And I was wondering if [Technical Difficulty] that was somewhat true with respect to potentially restructuring if things were to get choppier.","Linda Huber","Sure. M&A has been a wind at our back. And as I noted earlier, we got about $200 billion in the investment grade M&A pipeline. And we got about $35 billion in the high yield pipeline. That\u2019s kind of sitting there waiting to move. We\u2019ve seen this situation before. We\u2019re in a risk off part of the market. We\u2019ve had a lot of volatility.","But these pipelines will move eventually. We\u2019ll wait and see where things go with the Fed potentially in March. But when we can see the pipelines there it does give us some view to be a bit more optimistic. The timing is the tricky saying and that\u2019s why at Moody\u2019s we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, because it\u2019s very difficult to predict.","But we do expect that M&A is continuing and that a lot of companies have bridge loans in place for financing and eventually they\u2019re going to have to be taken out; so it\u2019s a matter of when and I\u2019ll let Ray say some more about that.","Raymond McDaniel","No, I was just going to ask Michel Madelain if he wanted to comment on our rating assessment services and the materiality of that compared to the overall MIS business?","Michel Madelain","Yes. Ray, Thank you. Typically, in M&A transaction we sometimes provide some rating assessment of the - designed to provide some indication of the impact of the transaction on the rating we have outstanding. Those are small and - the overall amount of fees and total fees, the total services are really small in relation to the overall revenue line. And they\u2019re not really moving the dial basically from that perspective.","Warren Gardiner","Yes. Okay.","Raymond McDaniel","And, Warren, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what you were getting at. But if it was I hope that was satisfactory.","Warren Gardiner","Yes. That was helpful. Thanks a lot. That\u2019s all I have now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. So just wanted to come at issuance a different way to kind of close out the call; as far as swing-factors are concerned on the issuance question for what the outlook could be for 2016, what do you think the most important swing factor is? Is it the stability? I assume you\u2019re expecting one or two interest rate hikes. Is it M&A? Is it the back-half of the year? I\u2019m just wondering as an outsider what we should think about as being kind of the most important thing to look at.","Raymond McDaniel","I think it\u2019s - first of all, some stability, so that companies feel that they have visibility in what their issuance would look like. Obviously, rates and spreads are relevant. I don\u2019t think that movement on the short-term rates is going to be particularly impactful. It\u2019s really looking more the long-term rates for the bond issuance. And it also has to do with economic momentum in the economy and refinancing needs. So if we have relatively wide spreads or volatility in the market, and we don\u2019t see a lot of economic momentum to encourage capital expenditure and business expansion and we don\u2019t have refinancing needs, then issuance is going to be more subdued.","But when that combination of factors starts to come into better alignment, stability, spreads narrowing and the need to refinance either for business expansion or they need to finance either for refinancing or business expansion, that\u2019s the virtuous cycle.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. Okay.","Linda Huber","And let me just comment a little bit more on our various sectors here and Michel may be helpful to this discussion. So we said for investment grade issuance looks to be about flat. In high yield bonds for 2015, we did $183 million of revenue, that\u2019s about 5% of the corporation\u2019s revenue, again high yield in 2015 only 5% of the corporation\u2019s revenue. Bank loans a little over $200 million, about 6% of the corporation\u2019s revenue.","And in the fourth quarter of 2015, as I had said to Craig, our spec-grade revenue was down to $26.5 million. We thought very hard about high yield for 2016. And we think that the Q4 run rate in 2015, we hope it\u2019s low. So we have reduced our high yield view. We\u2019ve been very thoughtful about the quite as bad as it was in the fourth quarter of 2015. We are watching this very carefully. It\u2019s probably the trickiest line we have to work with here.","And I might invite, Michel, to say a little bit more about his thoughts on that, because that really has been I think the biggest challenge for us in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about 2016.","Michel, you want to add some color.","Michel Madelain","Yes. I mean, what I\u2019d say is that really, when you think about investment grade, I mean the factors that Ray mentioned and you discussed earlier, which M&A, the economy are clearly the key drivers here. I think when you go to our heel [ph] then the impact of market sentiment and the overall - the spreads and the risk-on, risk-off sort of changes we see in, are probably much more impactful. And therefore, much more difficult - it\u2019s much more difficult to predict the volumes that we should expect. And there the sort of idiosyncratic credit factors are playing a bigger role.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. And just building on it, I\u2019m going to take a crack at this question, because I know it\u2019s a difficult one. Is there anything in particular you\u2019d point out when you went through your guidance process this year versus other years, that you did differently that might shed some light on how comfortable we can become with the issuance guidance for 2016?","Raymond McDaniel","I guess, the short answer is no. We really didn\u2019t do anything differently than we normally do. It\u2019s a combination of internal work and speaking with other market participants to get their consensus views and we build our forecast off of that.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Denny Galindo with Morgan Stanley.","Denny Galindo","Hi, there.","Linda Huber","Hi, Denny.","Denny Galindo","Just I wanted to - just real quickly, since we\u2019ve been on here for a while. But I wanted to talk a little bit about the high yield line item. It does seem like it might be a swing factor this year. Could that actually benefit if you have this big wall of investment-grade maturities in 2016 and 2017, and some of that\u2019s downgraded into high yield? Is that something kind of - it\u2019s almost like a fallen angel effect. Is that something that could end up helping you in the high yield line item this year? Or maybe you could comment on that idea.","Raymond McDaniel","Well, I guess it would help the high yield line item. It wouldn\u2019t help the investment grade line item. But I think your - the serious part of an answer to your question would be that we really wouldn\u2019t expect a material commercial difference based on investment grade names falling into the spec-grade range. We have both frequent issuer pricing agreements and we have transaction based pricing. And so, it\u2019s possible to see more frequent issuers dropping into the spec-grade range, but I think that would be very much at the margin and would not impact our - the financial part of our business as opposed to the Analytics.","Denny Galindo","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, lastly, someone did ask about restructuring, and it\u2019s kind of the credit assessment part of the fees, said that was kind of minimal as it relates to M&A. Are there any additional revenue streams you would benefit from, if they had like a distress debt exchange or defaults or anything that occurs in a more difficult credit environment that doesn\u2019t typically occur in a more favorable credit environment? Is that a meaningful amount so that moves the needle at all or is it relatively small as well?","Raymond McDaniel","No, I think it\u2019s really, as Linda was pointing out, that to the extent that having companies in distress drives a portion of the mergers and acquisition activity we see in the market, that can be helpful in terms of new financing to handle that M&A. But otherwise, no, I don\u2019t think it really is going to have a big impact.","Denny Galindo","Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks, guys.","Raymond McDaniel","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous.","Vincent Hung","Hi, how is it going?","Raymond McDaniel","Hi, Vincent.","Vincent Hung","Sorry, but to go back to high yield again, within the flat corporate finance guidance, what is the actual revenue growth assumption you have in there? And I got that pricing is harder to take in this sort of environment.","Raymond McDaniel","In terms of our outlook, we made, as you saw, we expect corporate finance to be flat. We would expect the investment grade sector to be a bit stronger than the spec-grade or bank loans. But we haven\u2019t broken that out into further detail. The second part of your question, I apologize, just slipped my mind.","Vincent Hung","Just around pricing and high yield and bank loans probably more difficult\u2026","Raymond McDaniel","Yes. Now, the pricing is - the pricing opportunities are similar. I think we provide a lot of value in the spec-grade market with our research and ratings. And so, yes, these are companies that have more difficult financial circumstances in many cases, but it\u2019s also where marketability of their bonds and the commentary that we offer I think provides quite a bit of value to them.","Vincent Hung","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Hey, good afternoon now. Kind of a high level question for you here, so if you look at the S&P 500 medium firm net debt to EBITDA, I think it\u2019s at the highest level since 2004. U.S. corporate debt outstanding has gone up by about 50% since 2008. So, I guess, given that backdrop and given where we are in the credit cycle. How does your view of corporate leverage kind of influence your medium and long term view of the issuance outlook?","Raymond McDaniel","Michel, do you want to offer any initial comments on that.","Michel Madelain","Yes, maybe, I think you are right in pointing to the fact that a number of metrics point to relatively high leverage in the system today for this entity. I think the - what\u2019s we\u2019re more focused on obviously are the sort of indicators of credit stress. We\u2019re looking at liquidity, covenant protections and default - prediction of defaults. And then, what we see is a slight uptick, I mean, we\u2019ve seen a lot of things getting movement [ph] in energy and mining space. And we have a slight uptick in the other sectors, but they remain - compared to historical standards well controlled.","Now, in terms of the size of the debt, what we - to the extent these companies continue to operate these debts will end up - have to be refinanced. And that\u2019s obviously a positive development. And as we\u2019ve said before, we continue to build our portfolio of credits we have in CFG. And that\u2019s also a positive for this line of business.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Thank you.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Ray McDaniel for any additional or closing remarks.","Raymond McDaniel","Sure. Just before I close I want to turn it to Linda for a moment.","Linda Huber","Yes. We didn\u2019t get any further questions on expenses for 2016, and just to make sure that we\u2019re level-setting, we often comment on the expense ramp, but this time in the year we hadn\u2019t done that yet. So I want to make sure that everybody\u2019s on the same page with that.","Over the course of 2016, we are looking at expenses to generally ramp from $35 million to $45 million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. We would caution everyone that expense timing, FX movements, and particularly incentive compensation, can move that number around, as we\u2019ve seen in previous years.","We\u2019ll continue to manage the costs carefully. We have about $50 million of expense flexibility that we can move on. If we did encounter more dramatic situation, we could probably about double that, but we are not expecting anything like that. And as the year progresses, of course, those amounts come down.","Similarly, we didn\u2019t have any questions on the tax rate. We are looking at 32% to 32.5%. We can\u2019t do exactly the same thing on the tax rate every year, because we are impacted by individual audit results. So we do expect with U.S. being the balance of our income potentially for 2016 that we might have a little bit more to pay on the tax rate, so again 32% to 32.5%.","And our CapEx guidance, I think most of you saw had moved up a bit, and that is primarily because of some things that we\u2019re doing in technology and real estate, as we had said before, but just wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of those numbers, so that can assist in your modeling effort. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ray.","Raymond McDaniel","Okay. Thanks, Linda. And just in ending the call, I do want to announce that we will be hosting our Annual Investor Day this year on Wednesday, September 28, here in New York. And more information about that will be available on the Investor Relations website as we get closer to the event. So thanks for joining the call today and we look forward to speaking with you again in April. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes Moody\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2015 earnings call.

Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on this teleconference to discuss Moody's third quarter 2016 results as well as our current outlook for full year 2016. I am Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations and Communications.","This morning, Moody's released its results for the third quarter of 2016 as well as our current outlook for full year 2016. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com. Ray McDaniel, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead this morning's conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Linda Huber, Moody's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I call your attention to the Safe Harbor language, which can be found toward the end of our earnings release.

Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I will begin by summarizing Moody's third quarter and year-to-date 2016 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. I will then conclude with a litigation update and comments on our current outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to respond to your questions.","In the third quarter Moody's revenue of $917 million increased 10% primarily as a result of record third quarter revenue from Moody's Investor Service driven by higher leverage finance issuance in U.S. public finance plant activity as well as solid growth for Moody's Analytics. Operating expense for the third quarter was $520 million, up 7% in the third quarter of 2015 and included an $8.4 million restructuring charge associated with cost management initiatives. Operating income was $398 million, a 14% increase from the prior year period. The impact of foreign currency translation on operating income was negligible.","Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization and the aforementioned restructuring charge, was $439 million, up 16% from the same period last year. The reported operating margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 43.3% and the adjusted operating margin was 47.8%.","GAAP EPS of $1.31 was up 15% from the third quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS of a $1.34 was up 21%. Third quarter 2016 non-GAAP EPS excludes $0.03 impact from the restructuring charge. Third quarter 2015 non-GAAP EPS excludes $0.03 benefit from a legacy tax matter.","Turning to year-to-date performance. Moody's revenue for the first nine months of 2016 was $2.7 billion, an increase of 2% from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by 1%. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $1.8 billion, a decline of 1% from 2015. Revenue at Moody's Analytics was $899 million, 8% higher than the prior year period. Operating expense in the first nine months of 2016 was $1.6 billion, up 5% from the prior year. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%. Operating income was $1.1 billion, down 2% from the first nine months of 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. Adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion was down 1% from the prior year period. Moody's reported operating margin was 41.8% and its adjusted operating margin was 45.7%. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was 31.5% down from 31.7% in the same period in 2015.","In light of the strong third quarter performance coupled with continued expense management, we are increasing our full-year 2016 GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $4.76 to $4.86, which includes an anticipated non-cash foreign exchange gain of $0.18 related to a subsidiary reorganization, offset in part by a $0.04 restructuring charge. Excluding the gain on the restructuring charge, the non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $4.62 to $4.72.","I will turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda Huber","Thanks Ray. I will begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the third quarter was $917 million, up 10% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue of $546 million was up 13% from the third quarter of 2015. Non-U.S. revenue of $371 million was up 5% and represented 40% of Moody's total revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Moody's revenue by 1%. Recurring revenue of $460 million was up 3% and represented 50% of total revenue.","Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investor Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter $612 million, up 12% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue increased 11% to $391 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $221 million was up 13% to the prior year period and represented 36% of total ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.","Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue for the third quarter of $300 million was up 21% from the prior year period. This result primarily reflected higher levels of bank loan and speculative grade bond issuance. A strong investor demand and tighter credit spreads drove debt refinancing activities. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were up 16% and 32% respectively.","Second, global structured finance revenue for the third quarter was $104 million, down 7% from the prior year period as reduced U.S. CMBS and CLO activity was only partially offset by increased U.S. RMBS and REIT activity. U.S. and non-U.S. structured finance revenues were down 9% and 4% respectively","Third, global financial institutions' revenue of $96 million was up 7% from the prior year period as a result of increased Asian bank issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions' revenues were up 2% and 11% respectively.","Fourth, global public project and infrastructure finance revenues of $105 million was up 16% versus the prior year period, primarily driven by strong U.S. public finance issuance. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was up 29% while non-U.S. revenue was down 8%.","MIS other, which consists of non-trading revenue from ICRA in India and Korea Investor Service, contributed to $8 million to MIS revenue for the third quarter, up 4% from the prior year period.","And turning now to Moody's Analytics, global revenue for MA of $305 million was up 6% from the third quarter of 2015. U.S. revenue of $154 million was up 19% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $150 million was down 4% and represented 49% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 3%. Excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew 3%.","Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research data and analytics. Our RD&A revenue of $168 million was up 6% from the prior year period and represented 55% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly driven by strong sales of credit research and ratings data feeds. U.S. RD&A revenue was up 14% while non-U.S. revenue was down 4%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted RD&A revenue by 3%.","Second, global enterprise risk solutions or ERS, revenue of $100 million was up 10% from last year. The growth was driven primarily by the March 2016 acquisition of GGY as well as growth in the credit assessment and stress testing product lines. The US ERS revenue was up 39% while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted ERS revenue by 4%. Trailing 12-month revenue and sales for ERS increased 10% and 5% respectively. As we have noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue and sales remains subject to quarterly volatility.","Third, global professional services revenue of $36 million was down 3% from the prior year period. U.S. professional services revenue was up 6% while non-U.S. revenue was down 7%.","Turning now to expenses. Moody's third quarter expense was $520 million, up 7% from 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to additional headcount in MA to support business growth and from March acquisition of GGY, the restructuring charge and increased incentive compensation across the company. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.","Moody's reported operating margin increased 140 basis points to 43.3% in the third quarter and adjusted operating margin increased by 250 basis points to 47.8%. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%, down from 32% in the third quarter of 2015.","Now, I will provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter of 2016, Moody's repurchased 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $193 million or an average cost of $103 per share and issued 798,000 shares as part of its employee stock based compensation plans. Moody's also paid $71 million in dividends during the quarter. On October 18, Moody's announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of Moody's common stock payable December 12 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 21.","Over the first nine months of 2016, Moody's repurchased 7.1 million shares at a total cost of $679 million or an average cost of $95.51 per share and issued 2.7 million shares as part of its employee stock based compensation plan. Additionally, Moody's returned $215 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the first nine months of 2016.","Outstanding shares as of September 30, 2016 totals 191.2 million, down 3% from September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, Moody's had $787 million of share repurchase authority remaining.","At quarter-end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program which is backstopped by an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter-end were $2.1 billion with approximately 80% held outside the U.S. Free cash flow in the first nine months of 2016 was $772 million, down 7% from the first nine months of 2015, primarily due to lower net income.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Ray.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. Thanks Linda. As we disclosed in today's earnings release, on September 29 we received a letter from the Department of Justice indicating that it is preparing a civil complaint against Moody's alleging violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act in connection with ratings MIS assigned to RMBS and CDOs leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.","As we have previously disclosed, following the global credit crisis of 2008, Moody's periodically received subpoenas and inquiries from various governmental authorities, including the DOJ and state's attorneys generals. The DOJ has advised us that their investigation remains ongoing and may expand to include additional periods. A number of state's attorneys generals have also indicated they expect to pursue similar claims under state law. Moody's is continuing to respond to the DOJ and states subpoenas and inquiries. As I hope you will appreciate, I am not going to be able to add anything beyond what I have just said and what we disclosed in our earnings release.","I will conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for 2016. The full list of Moody's guidance is included in our third quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on the Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.","Moody's current outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.30 to UKP 1 and for the Euro of $1.12 to EUR 1.","Moody's third quarter movements in foreign exchange rates have had no meaningful impact on the full year 2016 outlook. As I noted earlier, Moody's is increasing its full year 2016 GAAP EPS guidance range to $4.76 to $4.86. Excluding the foreign exchange gain and restructuring charge I mentioned earlier, the non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $4.62 to $4.72.","The company now expects share repurchases to be approximately $750 million subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $120 million.","For MIS, Moody's now expects 2016 revenue to be approximately flat reflecting increased guidance for non-U.S. MIS revenue which we also now expect to be approximately flat. U.S. revenue is still expected to be approximately flat. Corporate finance revenue is now expected to be approximately flat and structured finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the mid single-digit percent range. Financial institutions' revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range. For Moody's Analytics, we are not anticipating any changes to the outlook items we provided on September 28, 2016.","This concludes our prepared remarks and joining Lind and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investor Service. We will be pleased to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert","Good morning. So Linda, perhaps could you talk about what we should think about in terms of incremental legal costs, potentially on a near-term basis? And also how you think about the pace of buyback activity given the potential call on your cash?","Linda Huber","Sure, Peter. Good morning. We are not going to comment on incremental legal costs because as Ray said we have just received this piece of correspondence. Also, calls on our cash, we have said that we are going to repurchase $750 million of shares this year and so we will go from there. As you see on page 13 of the earnings release, we do have $2 billion of cash on hand and we do have our borrowing lines and CPA program.","Peter Appert","Sure. Got it. And then one other question, the guidance for 4Q would imply a bit slower operating environment. Can you just talk for a second about what influences you are thinking in that regard?","Linda Huber","Sure. Maybe we will turn that over to Rob.","Ray McDaniel","Yes. Peter, it's Ray. And I will let Rob comment on this in more detail, but I think the punch line is, we do think that some of the strength in the third quarter was pulled forward from the fourth quarter, We had a very strong close in late September and some of that issuance appears to have been opportunistically pulled into a very attractive issuance environment.","Rob, I don't know if you have any more detail you can add to that.","Rob Fauber","That's right. And I think I would characterize, there is continued good market access here in the U.S. and we expect that will continue through the election and even potentially beyond. Selective access, I would say, in Europe and healthy issuance in Asia. And we have a healthy new mandate pipeline as well. But as Ray said, we have incorporated some potential volatility and fewer, what we call, [indiscernible] days in the fourth quarter into our thinking.","Peter Appert","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Tony Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Tony Kaplan","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about, just given the strong performance in corporate finance, any way to frame the pull forward that just discussed? How much was from fourth quarter? How much, maybe, from 2017? Or maybe just how much larger it was than you were expecting in third quarter?","Ray McDaniel","I think broadly speaking, we think the strength in the third quarter was pulled forward of near term issuance that would have been occurring probably in the fourth quarter and early in 2017 otherwise. Looking out into 2017, we think that issuing conditions are probably going to be attractive and that may encourage pull forward from 2018 and beyond. Part of the reason why we are optimistic about the current outlook for issuance conditions is driven by the fact that we think the default rate in the speculative grade arena is probably peaking right about now over the next month or so and it's going to moderate and come down, which should help spread. So even if official rates are moving up somewhat, we think there is an opportunity for spread tightening and an attractive issuance environment.","Tony Kaplan","Got it. And then on the margin side, MIS margins were strong. It seemed like that was mainly revenue flow through. Anything else to call out there? And then in MA, you have, I guess, margin contraction year-over-year for the last two quarters, partially because of the corporate allocation and things like that, but should we be expecting, I guess, similar contraction in MA margins in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Linda Huber","Tony, thanks. This is Linda. You are right. MIS flow-through was helpful to us. You will note that we also called out continued expense control. And as you saw, we put $0.03 through in a restructuring charge. We are seeing good results from the cost controls that we have mentioned before. Those are particularly in effect for MIS and for shared services. And we feel that that's, as I said, starting to have an impact on our numbers, which is great.","For Mark, who will comment in a minute, the unfortunate result of Mark's success is that he does get to carry more of the overhead burden and he will talk a little bit more about the margin outlook for his business.","Mark Almeida","Yes, Tony. Right, the MA margin was held down by the increased share of overhead allocation that we are getting this year. And also remember we have the GGY acquisition which is hitting us this year. So I can tell you that when we adjust for those things, the work that we do in looking at this on a pro forma basis and adjusting for the acquisition and assuming that we add the constant share of overhead expense, we see modest margin expansion so far this year.","Tony Kaplan","Terrific. Thanks guys.","Operator","We will take our next question from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Tim McHugh","Yes. Thanks. Ray, I just want to follow-up to the comments as you looked into 2017 and I guess also the comment about pull forward. You have talked before about the refinancing potential in 2017. Is that part of what you felt got pulled forward? Or was it really just timing within the quarters? I guess I am trying to think about that going into next year.","Ray McDaniel","Yes. As I mentioned, our belief is that it was more fourth quarter and maybe early 2017 issuance getting pulled into the third quarter. So I do not anticipate that we are going to see a large amount of 2017 refinancing, having already gone through in the third quarter of 2016. And again, if issuance conditions are as we are speculating, that is probably going to encourage pull forward out of 2018 and into 2017.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thanks. And on ERS, the trailing 12-month sales numbers have kind of been in the mid single-digits for two quarters. I know there is the rolling 12-month number. So the different things to drop in and come out of that number. But I guess recent bookings, I would be curios for any more color there. Is it still supportive of thinking about that business as a double-digit organic kind of growth business as we go into next year? Or is new sales activity, is that more representative of what we should think about for ERS?","Ray McDaniel","No. Tim, I think it is. We do continue to think of this as a double-digit growth business particularly and recall what Steve talked about at Investor Day, particularly focusing on those areas of the business that we are really trying to drive, particularly around software licenses, software subscriptions and software maintenance. As we told you, we are de-emphasizing the implementation services business that low margin business that frankly we don't particularly want and don't particularly need given our market position now. So when we focus on the core aspects of the ERS business, we are seeing good strong bookings there, certainly in the double-digits and getting up towards the mid-teens.","Tim McHugh","When you say double-digits to mid-teens, is that for the total ERS? Or are you just saying the software piece is growing at that pace, but total practice revenue might be lower because you are not doing as much of the implementation?","Ray McDaniel","Correct. Yes. It would be the latter. Ignoring the sort of the flatness that we are seeing in the implementation services business and just looking at those parts of the business that we are emphasizing, that's where we are seeing the double-digit or mid teens type growth.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thank you.","Ray McDaniel","Yes.","Operator","We will take our next question from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Andre Benjamin","Thanks. Good morning. Just on the issuance side, as you talk to your capital markets, that counterparts to form the view about the pipeline on the potential forecasts. So maybe talk a little bit about the level of confidence or lack thereof that you are hearing from them around those ranges as they talk to their customers? And this is really more a question around talent, are they really confident in the baseline that comes from refi. M&A and those products, et cetera? Or do you sense a greater uncertainty relative to, say, a month or two ago, whatever timeframe you want to use as a reference?","Linda Huber","Sure. Andre, it's Linda. I will take a shot at this and I will talk about the views that we get from the various investment banks. The view, first will cover the U.S. and then outside the U.S., this will span financial and non-financial U.S. dollar issuance.","Before I start that, though, I think the market is cheered by some larger M&A deal talk that has happened today and recently. So I think that tends to improve confidence. But let's go through these categories. Investment grade third quarter 2016 issuance was up 20%. Issuers are taking advantage of historically low rates and strong investor demand.","We do expect, though, lighter periods of issuance expected in the fourth quarter because of the following three factors, earnings blackouts will continue through October, U.S. elections obviously are November 8 and the Federal Open Market Committee meetings are December 13 and 14. For full year 2016, we expect issuance in the year up 10%. you will recall that originally these projections had been for issuance to be sort of flat to down 10%. So this is better than had been anticipated at the beginning of the year.","Yield third-quarter 2016 issuance was up 35% which is a very big number. There again, strong investor demand, good pricing and opportunistic issuance coming through, very favorable factors. Issuance volumes have moderated over the last two to three weeks as spec rate market activity has shifted in favor of loans, in other words shifting toward leverage loans versus bonds. And for the full year, we are expecting that the year will be down 5% on high yield, which is less bad than some of those initial indications had been back in January.","Leverage loans third quarter 2016 issuance up 50%, a very large number. Leverage loan market continues to exhibit strength on the back of an opportunistic wave of refinancing activity and growing CLO issuance. Our CLO pipeline is very strong right now and full year 2016 issuance expected to end the year up 10%. Again, that's far more favorable than what was predicted at the beginning of the year.","In Europe, investment grade ECB's purchasing program continues to underpin the market. DOE's purchase program also has officially begun and so you see a lot of U.S. corporates doing reverse Yankee issues over in Europe as a heavy component of the supply there in Europe.","The high yield market is also accommodative for issuers and a large portion of deal flow is coming from refinancing activity. September of 2016, on the high yield front in Europe was second highest month on record. And we do have some caution driven by concerns around potentially ECB tapering and the timing and extent of any U.S. rate rises, some renewed speculation on the hard Brexit and its rhetoric and regional European referendums and elections coming up.","So, I think, generally much better than we had expected. I think Rob might want to comment a little bit that we continue to see growing strength through the middle and the end of September which was perhaps a bit better than we had expected even at Investor Day.","So Rob?","Rob Fauber","Yes. The only thing I might add to that, Linda, is that in the investment grade space, we have seen continued interest from foreign investors who were looking for yield. And it's interesting, when you look at the funds flow both in high yield while last week we saw a small outflow, the prior two weeks were almost $4 billion in inflows and over $11 billion in inflows year-to-date. Similarly on the bank loan side, that asset class has seen its 11th straight week of inflows and that's the longest streak since 2014 and almost $3 billion over the last 11 weeks. So I think that really supports the market technicals.","Linda Huber","Thanks. Andre, anything else we can do for you on that front","Andre Benjamin","No. That was it.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Warren Gardiner from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Warren Gardiner","Yes. Thank you. I was a little surprised to see the recurring revenues and ratings were down, I think, a couple of percentage points sequentially, just given the strong debt issuance you guys had this last quarter and of course this quarter as well. So just kind of wondering how to think about that into 4Q, especially given some of that strong issuance we had towards the end of the quarter?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. It was really a combination of a few factors. We had a couple of one-off items this quarter that negatively impacted 3Q recurring revenues. We also saw a little bit of softness in CP outstandings and that's due, I think, in part to some of the money market regulations and that in turn dampened the activity fees that show up as recurring revenue for us and we had a little bit of FX drag. So all that kind of contributed. If you exclude those items, that recurring revenue would have between 3%, 3.5%, which I think is fairly comparable to last quarter.","Warren Gardiner","Okay. Thanks. And then could you just remind me what your leverage cap is and where you guys stand today with respect to keeping your current rating and maybe where you could go and still maintain investment grade?","Linda Huber","Sure. Warren, it's Linda. I think we are pretty happy with our current leverage levels, given our ratings by other companies. We have some room but we are pretty comfortable with where we are right now. We do have, several people have noted a piece of debt coming due in 2017, we continue to take a look at that. That does have a call feature on it. And so we would have to look at the break-evens there. So we continue to watch that one. And we are, as you know, now able to issue CPs. We are paying some attention to that. That allows us to turn the dials a little bit more finely than a large public debt issuance, a term issuance might provide. So we will see, but we are pretty happy with where we are and we like our rating where it is. So really no change.","Warren Gardiner","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Manav Patnaik. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik","Yes. Good afternoon guys. Just on the insurance front, can you just touch on the structured outlook that you increased a bit? I think you talked obviously positively at the Investor Day. Was there anything incremental to that? Like was it Sprint spectrum bonds or whatever that's been coming to the market, just curious there?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. I mean probably the biggest contributor to the improved outlook is CLO activity. The pipeline for CLOs is quite strong right now. Rob, I don't know if there any other factors that you would point to?","Rob Fauber","Yes. That's right, Ray. We have seen a mix of some of these reset deals. The leverage lending market has obviously picked up and that supported greater supply in the market. And we have seen a good gradation bid for some of the CLO assets that supported that activity.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And then, Mark, just in terms of the non-U.S. RD&A business that declined, just curious what's going on there?","Mark Almeida","Yes. One, we got crushed by FX. The pound took a beating and you are seeing that in the numbers. We also had kind of an odd ball one-ff last year in the third quarter, we had a strong third quarter last year, reflecting some one-off business that we had done, some large one off business that we have done in some of the smaller segments of RD&A and those didn't recur in the third quarter this year. So that's really what you are seeing there. But the underlying business continues to be quite strong .We feel very comfortable with where we are there.","Manav Patnaik","Do those one-offs continue? Or was that just this quarter's performance?","Mark Almeida","No. They were one-offs in the third quarter that were recognized in the third quarter of 2015. So we had kind of the lapping phenomenon.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And then just broadly, I just want to understand how you guys define material information or materiality? Just trying to understand, because I presume after this request there is going be a lot of back and forth and I guess is that why you toned down the buyback program because I guess you are not allowed to do that while that's going on? Just curious on how we should think of that?","Mark Almeida","We currently have a programmatic repurchase plan in place that continues. When we come to renew that, we will look at all the appropriate conditions and information that we normally do in terms of renewal. So that's the story on the buyback.","Linda Huber","Yes. Manav, to extend a little further on that, we are operating our share repurchase program under a pre-existing 10b5-1 plan, as you know and we are in the market today and we will take a look. We said we think we will spend about $750 million this year and we are pretty happy with that. So I think that's about it.","Manav Patnaik","So the reduction in the buyback then, is that fair to assume it's from, I guess, the discretionary aspect of the buyback that you had to that 10b5-1?","Linda Huber","Yes. I think saying that we are going to do $750 million for this year is probably about what everybody needs to know in order to model that and we are pretty comfortable with where we are. We have reduced the share count from by 3% from last year of September, as we said in the script.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. All right. Thank you guys.","Operator","We will take our next question from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Bill Warmington","Good afternoon everyone.","Ray McDaniel","Hi Bill.","Bill Warmington","And shout out to John Goggins, just when I thought I was out they pull me back in. The first question for you is on the strong Asian issuance. I just wanted to ask you if in terms of what you are seeing there, how much is going towards refinancing of the debt and whether you are seeing some portion of that go to fund some investment that could actually spur some growth?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. I mean a lot of the activity was coming from Chinese banks, asset management firms and of course there refinancing included in that, but I do think we are seeing new money issuance coming out of Asia. And yes, I would say all things being equal, that's a good sign for potential growth.","Rob, I don't know if there is anything else to add to that?","Rob Fauber","Well, a little bit of a mix shift from on-shore borrowings to offshore in this quarter. Cross border issuance from the Chinese property sector, which had been going into the domestic markets a bit in the second quarter. We saw some of the big oil and gas corporates across APAC and some increased issuance from Australia and some healthy first mandate activity.","Bill Warmington","Yes. So the second question for you on margins. You talked at the Investor Day about a five-year target getting to the mid-40s for the operating margin. You had very strong flow through this past quarter. Potentially you have some higher legal expenses coming. I just wanted to bring that up as a question in terms of, does it change the trajectory of that margin target?","Linda Huber","Bill, it's Linda. We don't expect that it will change the trajectory. I think if we noted at Investor Day, we are being prudent about what we think for 2017 and 2018 margin expansion. I think we had noted, we expected that to be perhaps backend loaded over the next few years. And you are right, we do expect to get back to the mid-40s on the simple margin.","I want to state very clearly that we have been very careful on our cost controls. An interesting thing for you to think about Bill, just looking at headcount growth year-over-year at the end of September, the rating agencies head count has grown only 1% and shared services headcount has grown only 1% from this time last year.","We have invested in growth for Moody's Analytics, because that business is moving along really nicely, but we are being very cautious about what we are doing in terms of headcount growth because that's the major component of our expense increases, as you know. So we are being very cautious and legal expenses will fall as they do, but nothing that exciting to comment on there, other than that we are all being very careful about the pace of expenses.","Bill Warmington","Okay. Well, thank you very much for the insight.","Operator","We will take our next question from Vincent Hong from Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Vincent Hong","Hi. Sorry, the answer to this one is probably no, but any sense on timing on this DOJ stuff? Would you expect it to be as prolonged as what S&P experienced?","Ray McDaniel","We don't really have any information I can give you on that at this time.","Vincent Hong","Okay. Last one, how many new mandates did you get this quarter?","Ray McDaniel","About 225 to 227 new mandates. It was up from the second quarter and up from prior year.","Vincent Hong","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. As you work through the planning for next year, what are some key areas of investment you are looking at? And is there any difference between what you are expecting in 2017 for investments versus 2016?","Linda Huber","Sure. Joe, it's Linda. It looks pretty much the same. We are looking to invest in technology to support what MIS is doing to ensure that our rating analysts are as efficient as they can be and that we are handling our regulatory requirements as efficiently as we can for those analysts. So that continues.","We are pleased that perhaps that rate of technology spending might be largely having peaked in 2016. So we will have to see how that goes, but we don't have the forecast for 2017 baked yet fully.","For Moody's Analytics, markets running a very nicely growing business and we will continue to invest in that business. And for the commercial operation for Moody's Investor Service, we want to be thoughtful about the ability to do business with us in a constructive way. So we might continue to invest there.","But the investment outlook, I suspect we will look pretty much like it has. But again very cautious eye on expense control and we will talk more about potential for margin expansion for 2017 when we give guidance for 2017. But we would like to be able to show some margin expansion, but we are going to have to see. And I don't know if Ray or others of my colleagues want to comment any further on that.","Ray McDaniel","No. The only thing I would say is probably a notable variable would be, as we look at some of the international markets and market opening in some key emerging markets like China, if that occurs more quickly that might invite investment sooner. If it continues to be at the pace it has been at, we probably would accommodate that with the spending that that you have seen already.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. And as you run through economic variables for 2017, I know you talked about it potentially being a positive issuance environment, can you give us any early thoughts on what your expectations are for some of those variables like interest rates or others that could impact issuance in 2017?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. I mean at a macro level, just looking at GDP, the GDP growth is, I think we are anticipating it's going to stabilize, albeit at fairly low levels in the developed markets. So somewhere around 2% in the U.S. Less than that in Europe. And then for the G20 emerging markets, more in the 5% range. So, it's good in that there is growth in the key markets that we operate in, but it is not going to be fast-paced growth in our estimation.","We would also expect to see a gradual normalization of monetary policy in the U.S., but I think that will be gradual. And we are going to continue to see accommodative monetary policy outside the U.S. So I think that's going to feature in continuation of low rates in a number of markets.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. And then just a last one from me. Can we get any updates on your outlook for Brexit in Europe? Thanks.","Ray McDaniel","Yes. It's going to be a continuing uncertainty, I think. There's a certain amount of rhetoric that is contributing to the uncertainty. I think the rhetoric may be a bit stronger than the reality when we finally see what kind of negotiations go into the divorce and re-marriage in Europe with the U.K.","But the reason I say I think we are in for some prolonged uncertainty is really driven by just the political timing with elections in key countries throughout next year and I think that's going to impact the pace at which negotiations can be conducted. Those countries include the Netherlands, France, Germany. So we will probably see more progress late next year then we will early in the year.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm","Yes. Hi, good morning. I heard your comments on DOJ obviously, but I will ask my question anyway just hopefully broad enough that you can answer it. Two questions, actually. So one, when I read your disclosure this morning you mentioned FIRREA, you mentioned RMBS and you mentioned CDOs which sound fairly consistent with what S&P has settled on. So you have studied, I am sure, their case very details. So any anything in the latter that you saw that suggest that it's a different scope or beyond the scope or less of a scope? And then secondly, maybe just can you just remind us, you have been very strong on not settling cases in the past. You have settled a few. So maybe just a general view and how that has evolved the last few years as you have seen some of these cases? Thank you.","Ray McDaniel","No. I don't think it would be appropriate for me to comment on this at this point. The disclosure we made was based on the letter we received and that's about as much as I can say. And I do understand the curiosity and I realize it's probably frustrating for me to keep referring you back to our disclosures. But I think that's the most appropriate course.","Alex Kramm","Fair enough. I get it. Secondly, somebody brought up the Sprint deal that just went off this week. Rob, maybe this is for you. Any more detail you can give us in terms of, do you think this is something new? And do you think another the pipeline of deals like this could go off? And by the way, is this captured in IG or is this a structure deal? How does it work from a financial perspective?","Rob Fauber","Yes. I am not sure I would say this is a trend. This was one particular transaction. This wasn't in the structured area. We have seen some esoteric types of transactions. We have seen your handset transactions and so on. So there's some of that kind of activity going on. But I am not sure that what spread that would be a trend.","Alex Kramm","All right. And then just lastly, real quick for Linda. You mentioned the expenses a few times. I think every quarter you have updated us on the ramp you expect. Can you just give us, I know there is only one quarter left but can you just give us your latest and greatest in terms of absolute dollars and how that's changed over the course of the year? Thank you.","Linda Huber","Sure, Alex. We had said the expense ramp from the first quarter to the fourth quarter will be $25 million to $35 million and we expect that that will hold maybe towards the higher end of the range.","Alex Kramm","All right. Fantastic. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. In the release you talked a little bit about increasing incentive compensation across the company. Can you just give us a little bit more color? Is that something we should expect to continue going forward?","Linda Huber","Sure, Jeff. Incentive compensation for the third quarter, we did have to take up a bit. In fact that incentive compensation was about $43 million and that ran ahead of the second quarter of $35.6 million and also ahead of last year's $32.9 million. So given the strong performance particularly at MIS, we have had to accrue about $10 million of additional incentive compensation which did offset some of the other cost savings that we had. Going forward for the fourth quarter, this is a bit of a wild card. I would model about $40 million is probably a reasonable number, but we could break a few million dollars either below that or above that.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And I am sorry to go back to the DOJ issue, but can you tell us what the reserve policy has been? What you have reserved against cases similar to this? And also, historically what insurance would reimburse you for typically for these, if there are any settlements? Thanks.","Linda Huber","Sure. Just quickly and then Ray will comment. U.S. GAAP, we can't reserve for anything that is not probable or estimable and since we don't have any information on that front, we can't have any reserves on this matter. Also we do have insurance coverage, but we are not going to comment on that either.","And I will see if Ray has anything further to add.","Ray McDaniel","No, I don't on those items.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Craig Huber","Yes. Thank you. Linda, the restructuring charge you guys took in the quarter, it's been quite some time since last time you did that. Can you just give us a little more detail what part of the company that's pertaining to please?","Linda Huber","Sure. The restructuring charge was modest, $8 million and change. We don't do that too often. As we have said before, we are watching expenses particularly carefully. And I think I commented earlier on what we are doing with headcount management, both in MIS and shared services. So I think, Craig, it's fair to say that most of that restructuring charge accrued to shared services and to MIS.","Ray McDaniel","And it was in multiple areas, modest actions in multiple areas.","Craig Huber","Okay. And then Ray, towards the outlook for structured finance, just as we think out over the next six-plus months, maybe RMBS, CMBS, what are some of your sort of outlook there and the underlying factors that might drive it materially better or worse than we have seen in recent quarters?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. Rob may want to comment on this, but what I would look for really is how some of the work being done to structure transactions in light of the risk retention rules and efforts being made to try and create structures that are still economically attractive and comply with those rules is going to be the big variable going into 2017. We have begun to see some ideas and actions around how to address the risk retention rules. But again, we just have to watch and see what the range is what the banks ultimately land on.","Rob Fauber","The only thing I might add to that, Ray, is so we have a healthy CMBS pipeline. You asked about CMBS, right now as issuers are looking to get in front of the risk retention deadline. So while January could be a bit light, I think we will see debt issuance in the first half of 2017 in CMBS supported by this upcoming maturity wall that we can see.","Craig Huber","I was also going to ask about maturity wall on the corporate finance side here data you showed increased this over the next four years. Ray, just remind us, in the transaction revenues for the corporate loan historically, what's the general range of how much that business historically comes from refinancing?","Ray McDaniel","Rob, do you have the --","Rob Fauber","I think we said at Investor Day for U.S. and European fundamental, which is what we shared, I think it was in the 35% of transaction revenue.","Ray McDaniel","30% to 40%.","Rob Fauber","In that ramp.","Ray McDaniel","Yes.","Craig Huber","Okay. Great. Whatever your litigation costs are in the fourth quarter, I assume that's obviously embedded in your outlook here for your costs for the full year, right?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. Our legal costs are included in our outlook, yes.","Craig Huber","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ashley Serrao","Good afternoon. I just want to first clarify the messaging on expenses here. In face of elevated litigation costs, is the message that there isn't a lot you can do on the incentive front in the near term or accelerating some of the future expense talked about at the Analyst Day? Or given this letter, are you reevaluating some additional levers you can pull?","Ray McDaniel","Just to adjust the premise of the question, we have not said that we have increased litigation costs. We have not commented on that.","Linda Huber","Yes. Ashley, it's Linda. We will continue with our expense plans. The guidance for the remainder of the year includes everything that we can see right now. Again, we are being very cautious, particularly on headcount. We are being very thoughtful on the businesses and the support services that have had perhaps more challenging conditions earlier this year. But we are continuing on doing what we are doing. The conditions in the business, both of the businesses are very good. The third quarter was quite strong, as you can see, record MIS revenue in the third quarter. So we are going to keep doing what we are doing and in early February, we will give guidance for 2017.","Ashley Serrao","Okay. And I don't know if you can answer this, but I am going to try. So how should we think about the maximum settlement you can fund today given your U.S. liquidity sources without having to repatriate foreign cash?","Ray McDaniel","No. As we said, we have commented to the extent that we feel is appropriate in our disclosures already.","Ashley Serrao","Okay. And then just final question, what's you view and current appetite to do M&A as long as these investigations continue?","Ray McDaniel","Well, we have been engaged in M&A activity on a regular basis. I think we would continue to look for attractive assets to acquire. So I don't see any change in our thinking or behavior going forward than what you have seen in recent years.","Ashley Serrao","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","I would like to turn the conference back over to Ray for additional remarks.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. I just want to thank everybody for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you again in the New Year. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes Moody's third quarter 2016 earnings call.

I'll begin by summarizing Moody's second quarter 2013 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights, and I'll then speak to recent regulatory developments and finish with comments on our outlook for 2013. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to respond to your questions.","Second quarter revenue of $756 million increased 18% over the second quarter of 2012, reflecting continued strong operating performance across the company. Operating expenses for the second quarter were $405 million, a 12% increase from the second quarter of 2012. Operating income for the second quarter was $351 million, a 26% increase from the prior year period. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income less depreciation and amortization was $374 million, up 24% from the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter increased 32% from the prior year period to $1.","Our full year 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance range remains $3.49 to $3.59. We are pleased to announce that we've increased our annualized dividend to $1 per share. We also now anticipate total 2013 share repurchases of approximately $1 billion.","Turning to year-to-date performance, revenue for the first 6 months of 2013 was $1.5 billion, a 16% increase from the first 6 months of 2012. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $1.1 billion for the first 6 months of 2013, an increase of 18% from a year ago. Moody's Analytics revenue of $429 million was 9% higher than the prior year period.","Operating expenses for the first 6 months of 2013 were $857 million, up 16% from 2012. Operating income was $631 million, increased 15% from $548 million in 2012. Adjusted operating income was $678 million, a 14% increase from the prior year period. First half operating expenses, operating margin and adjusted operating margin all include our first quarter litigation settlement charge. Diluted earnings per share of $1.83 for the first 6 months of 2013, which included a $0.14 charge related to the settlement, increased 20% from the prior year period. Excluding the settlement, diluted earnings per share of $1.97 for the first 6 months of 2013 grew 30% year-over-year.","I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda S. Huber","Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the quarter increased 18% to $756 million. Foreign currency translation for the quarter was negligible. U.S. second quarter revenue increased 18% to $408 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 18% to $348 million and represented 46% of Moody's total revenue for the quarter.","Recurring revenue grew 7% to $362 million and represented 48% of total revenue, down from 53% from the prior year period.","Looking now at each of our businesses, starting first with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $537 million, up 22% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue for MIS increased 21% over the prior year period to $313 million. MIS revenue outside of the U.S., $224 million, increased 22% and represented 42% of total ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.","Moving now to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue in the second quarter increased 37% from the year-ago period to $263 million. Revenue was up 28% year-over-year in the U.S. as a result of strong investment-grade and high-yield bond issuance, as well as bank loan issuance as corporations continue to take advantage of historically low interest rates. Non-U.S. revenue was up 52%, driven by European speculative grade bond issuers shifting their bank debt to the public bond market. Second, global structured finance revenue for the quarter was $97 million, up 7% from the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 29% year-over-year due to strength in issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue was down 17% against the prior year period, primarily reflecting weaker issuance volumes in European residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. Third, global financial institutions revenue of $85 million increased 9% from the same quarter of 2012. U.S. revenue was up 9%, reflecting stronger banking activity, while non-U.S. revenue was up 8%, driven by increased issuance by insurance companies. Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue rose 14% year-over-year to $93 million. U.S. and non-U.S. revenue were up 8% and 31%, respectively from the prior year period due to gains in project and infrastructure finance globally.","Turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue from Moody's Analytics of $219 million was up 10% from the second quarter of 2012. This year-over-year growth was entirely organic as we have not made any acquisitions in the past year. U.S. revenue grew by 8% year-over-year to $95 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 11% to $124 million and represented 56% of total Moody's Analytics revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MA revenue was also negligible.","Moving to the lines of business for MA. First, global research, data and analytics revenue of $130 million increased 7% from the prior year period and represented 60% of total MA revenue. Our customer retention rate remains strong in the mid-90s percent range, and we continue to see solid demand for MA's research offering. Research, Data and Analytics, U.S. revenue was up 6% and non-U.S. revenue was up 9% as compared to the second quarter of 2012. Second, global enterprise risk solutions revenue of $60 million grew 17% from the same period last year, driven by strong growth in products and services that support regulatory and compliance activities at banks and insurance companies. Enterprise risk solutions revenue was up 12% in the U.S. and non-U.S. revenue was up 19% against the prior year period. As we noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, enterprise risk solutions revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility.","On a separate note, subscription revenue, which includes MA's research, data and analytics business and certain products within MA's enterprise risk solutions business was up 10% for the second quarter of 2013. Global professional services revenue grew 7% to $28 million, reflecting solid growth and revenue from Copal Partners, partially offset by softness in the training and certification business. U.S. revenue increased 23%, while non-U.S. revenue increased by 3% year-over-year.","Turning now to expenses, Moody's second quarter expenses were $405 million, an increase of 12% compared to the second quarter of 2012, reflecting increased headcount, annual compensation increases and higher technology expenses. The impact of foreign currency translation on operating expenses for the quarter was negligible. Moody's reported operating margin for the quarter was 46.4%, up from 43.5% in the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted operating margin was 49.5% for the quarter, up from 46.9% for the same period last year. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.2% compared with 33.6% for the prior year period.","And now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the second quarter of 2013, Moody's repurchased 4.1 million shares at a total cost of $259.1 million, and issued 1.7 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2013, totaled 220.4 million, reflecting a 1% decrease from the year earlier. At the end of the second quarter, Moody's had $1.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under our current program. As of June 30, 2013, Moody's had $1.6 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2013, were $1.6 billion, an increase of $808.9 million from the year earlier. At the end of the second quarter, approximately 61% of our cash holdings were maintained outside the U.S. Free cash flow of $351 million for the first 6 months of 2013 increased $137 million from a year ago, primarily due to strong operating performance in the first half of 2013, as well as tax payments made in 2012, which related to prior tax years.","And I'll now turn the call back over to Ray.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Okay. Thanks, Linda. I'll continue with an update on regulatory developments. First in the U.S. On May 14, the Securities and Exchange Commission hosted a full day roundtable on the various proposals made in its study relating to assigning credit ratings for structured finance products that are commonly referred to as the Franken Amendment study. The roundtable was comprised of 3 panels and panel participants were asked to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various business models.","Turning to Europe, CRA3 was adopted earlier in the spring of 2013 and went into force as of June 20. We have implemented the requisite policies and procedures accordingly. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing our full year guidance for 2013.","Moody's outlook for 2013 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability, business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. There's an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, and if actual conditions differ, Moody's results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. As I mentioned, earlier, our full year 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance range remains at $3.49 to $3.59. For Moody's overall, the company still expects full year 2013 revenue to grow in the high-single-digit percent range.","Full year 2013 operating expenses are still projected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Full year 2013 operating margin is still projected to be 41% to 42%, and adjusted operating margin for the year is still expected to be 44% to 45%. Guidance ranges for operating expenses, operating margin and adjusted operating margin all include the first quarter 2013 litigation settlement charge. The effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 32%. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders, and we have increased our annualized dividend by 25% to $1 per share.","Full year 2013 total share repurchases are now expected to be approximately $1 billion, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately $50 million. We still expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is still projected to be in the $10 million to $15 million range. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $850 million. We have modified certain components of 2013 guidance to reflect the company's current view of business conditions.","For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2013 is still expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. Both U.S. and non-U.S. MIS revenue are also now expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the low-teens percent range. Revenue from structured finance is now expected to decrease in the low-single-digit percent range, while revenue from financial institutions is still expected to grow in the low-single-digit percent range. Public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is still expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range.","For MA, full year 2013 revenue is still expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is now expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. Non-U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Revenue from research, data and analytics is still projected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range, while revenue for enterprise risk solutions is still expected to grow in the low-double-digit percent range. Professional services revenue is still expected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session are Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investor Service, and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We'd be pleased to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Patrick O'Shaughnessy at Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So my first question -- can you talk just a little bit more, provide some commentary around your capital return plan? So increasing your share repurchase from $0.5 billion to $1 billion, bumping up your dividend return policy. Can you just talk about what some of the -- just thinking underlying those moves was?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Sure. I'll make some general comments and then see if Linda has anything she would like to add. It's -- it's really a recognition that we have an opportunity and sufficient financial flexibility to be able to return capital to shareholders on a more accelerated basis than we had anticipated earlier in the year. So this is -- we think, an opportunity for us to get cash back into the hands of shareholders, and we think that's our obligation, consistent with the need to maintain sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility for uncertainties in the future.","Linda S. Huber","Yes, it's Linda. Ray is right. We have a cash-rich balance sheet, about $1.6 billion in cash on the balance sheet, and our net debt is effectively 0. We took a look at our dividend rate and with the recent increase in our stock price, the dividend yield had been about 1.3%. This brings it up to about 1.6%, and our payout to about 25%. So we feel that, that's appropriate recognition of the progress that we've made. And on share repurchase, because our investors seem to prefer both methods of returning capital to shareholders, we think that this is a prudent step for us to take and a good time for us to do it.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right, that's very helpful color. And then a follow-up question for me. So certainly we saw corporate issuance dry up a little bit in June, and I think July has been pretty slow so far as well. Can you talk about what sort of issuance backlog that you've been seeing, and just how the different rate environment that we're facing today as oppose to, let's say, April and May, how that's impacting corporate issuers?","Linda S. Huber","Sure. This is going to take a minute to go through, so let me talk to you about how we're going to do this. We're going to first discuss investment grade, then I'd like to talk a bit about high yield and then thirdly, leveraged loans. And for each of the categories, I'd like to talk about what we're seeing in deals last week and this week, the pipeline, the fund flow and then certain market observations. And as you acknowledged, we did see a bit of what we're calling the June swoon. But we would acknowledge that last week, the deal issuance rate looks a good deal better. Last week, we saw $16 billion in issuance, which was mostly driven by financials who have already reported second quarter earnings. And it's important to note, we try to make the same point every year. We're still in a corporate blackout period for many issuers, particularly the industrial issuers. This week, expectations are for another $15 billion of investment-grade issuance. We have $9 billion of issuance year-to-date -- I'm sorry, week-to-date. And I would note that there are 6 investment-grade deals in the market today with the 10-year at about 2.57%. On average, over the last 5 years, the 10-year has been about 2.73%. So you can take whatever you'd like from that, but we are below the 5-year average. The pipeline for several banks indicates that the forward calendar is building, and the pipeline was described by several of those banks as strong. Issuance is likely to be robust in the near term as issuers emerge from blackout periods and there is note that there may be a potentially busier August than is usually expected. Generally August is one of the slower months. However, banks are still forecasting a pullback in issuance from the record volumes in the first half. Second half is looking at $250 billion to $350 billion, versus the first half of $550 billion in issuance, and this does include financials as well as industrials. Now fund flows into high-yield bond funds have recently reversed. Last week, Lipper reported $1 billion of fund flows into investment grade. That's the third week of returned inflow following the June swoon, and the year-to-date total inflow is $38 billion. Market observations in high grade include issuers getting comfortable with the slightly higher interest rate environment and from a historical perspective, rates remain attractive. And we do see that some issuers are looking at refinancing 2014 and '15 in the back half following the period of volatility that we've seen. Also I would note M&A dialogue is picking up, but the focus for that is on later this year or 2014. That concludes investment grade, and now I'll move to high yield.","In high yield, last week, we saw $7 billion of issuance from 16 issuers. It was the busiest week since May of this year. Last week's deals -- excuse me, this week's deals, $3 billion week-to-date. And the issuance pipeline is currently running 25% up versus 2012 year-to-date. Again, second half is expected to slow a bit, $75 billion to $150 billion and in the second half versus $200 billion in the first half. But 200 -- 2013 levels are at or slightly below the 2012 record amount. Fund flows, again, have reversed in high yield. Dramatic outflows in May and June have normalized and even turned positive last week. Year-to-date, still showing net outflows though of $12 billion. Market observations are that yields remain at near all-time lows with high yield index yielding 6.3% versus the 5-year average of 9.04%. And it's an attractive asset class for fixed income investors as rates rise given shorter duration, less price volatility and low levels of default.","Now looking at leveraged loans. Last week, we saw 8 deals. This week, $900 million of issuance week-to-date. The pipeline, year-to-date volume of $350 billion is up 70% from 2012. Second half expectation is $150 billion. That implies also somewhat of a reduction in the pace of supply from first half $350 billion. Fund flows last week in leveraged loans reported the 57th consecutive week of 100 of inflows at $1.7 billion. That's the largest weekly inflow on record by the way. And year-to-date, inflows are at $30 billion. That's more than 3x what we saw in 2012, where the inflow was $9 billion. Market observations include that demand continues to be strong given the feature of protection against rising rates offered by flexible rate leveraged loan paper.","So Patrick, sorry for the length of all that, but hope it's pretty complete.","Raymond W. McDaniel","And I would just add -- I would just add a very brief comment to the comprehensive review that Linda has just offered. As we saw rates moving out of Treasuries and spreads moving out in June, they certainly have come back in somewhat. Though they're not back to where they were in May, but Treasuries and rates have come back in and spreads have come back in. I think more than a question of the pipeline, it was a question of uncertainty about where rates would stabilize. And once that stability became more apparent, in part because of further comments from the Fed, I think there was more confidence in having those pipelines unlocked. And so what I think we're going to be looking at for the rest of this year is not a concern about bond issuance volumes with rates where they are currently are, but some level of market anxiety about the uncertainty of accommodative monetary policy, how long and how accommodative. And so in looking at our forecast, we assume there is going to continue to be some level of market anxiety around that. And probably, as we've seen frequently over the past few years, periods of good market activity and then periods of relative dormancy depending on, among other things, official comments.","Operator","And we'll go next to William Bird at Lazard.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Ray, I was wondering if you could just comment. I know there's been shorter duration issuance recently. How does that impact your business?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, it's good from the standpoint that there is more turnover of refinancing. The velocity of the refinancing increases with the shorter term securities. And interestingly, we had not seen a big jump in very long-dated issuance, even earlier when rates were at their lowest point, firms we're still -- I'd put it a little bit casually, but they were taking the free money rather than the cheap money. And so we have seen the term structure remain towards the short end. And that's, as I said, good from a refinancing perspective.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And Ray, bigger picture. Can you talk about just what your point of view is on whether the structural tailwinds in your business can overcome some of the macro choppiness to enable positive growth?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes. I think we -- I think we can continue to see growth. I think the business is well supported on the rating agency side from the disintermediation trends, certainly, that are going on in Europe, but also in Asia, Latin America and somewhat surprisingly at least to me, in the U.S., it continues apace. And the Moody's Analytics business is really not impacted by the interest rate cycle, the business cycle, the way the rating agency business is. So we expect we're going to be able to continue to get good growth out of MA.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And Ray, your second half outlook implies kind of a flattish growth profile at MIS. And Linda's comments sound like the pipeline is still pretty good. I guess are you assuming just kind of more of the same or just from a macro level, what's assumed in the second half in your outlook?","Raymond W. McDaniel","I think what we're recognizing and looking at some consensus opinions in the market from economists and other institutions, a greater than usual degree of uncertainty in terms of where rates might go, how spreads might react to changes in, again, quantitative easing or expectations for interest rate increases. If the market is concerned that accommodative monetary policy is going to be curtailed before we have self-sustaining momentum in terms of GDP growth, that's not going to be good for issuers. But if we do have a market view that we have achieved self-sustaining economic growth, I think we're going to see good levels of issuance even if we do have curtailment of quantitative easing because there's going to be borrowing for merger and acquisitions, and capital expenditure and share repurchase. As we've talked about in other calls, all these drivers, traditional drivers of issuance that had been relatively dormant in recent years.","Linda S. Huber","And Bill, it's Linda. Following up on what Ray said, I think your observation is correct. The pipelines look pretty good, pretty strong. But again, we don't control when those pipelines move. And I think what Ray is trying to indicate to you is, we'll probably have some good weeks and we'll probably have some less good weeks, and that's what results from market choppiness. That's on the MIS side. I think we probably should make the observation that for MA, one part of that business, the enterprise of our software business traditionally sees much stronger revenue growth in the fourth quarter, and that seasonality is helpful to us. We are thinking about though the strong numbers that the rating agency put up in the back half of last year, and several of the analysts have observed that we do have tougher comps in the back half of the year, which is something that we're thinking about. On the other hand, we're going to be back to talk to you at Investor Day, which is 8 weeks from today. So we'll see where we get to, and we'll freshen up our observations at that time.","Operator","We'll go next to Manav Patnaik at Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The -- just firstly, on the guidance. I mean, clearly, the big high level sort of guidance ranges were unchanged, but at the same team, you doubled the expectation of share repurchases. So I just wanted to get a sense of what your thought process was in factoring in those increased share repurchases and why maybe the EPS range didn't narrow or increase? Is there something in terms of the number of shares you expect to issue that offset that impact? Just curious there.","Linda S. Huber","Manav, I think we talked about why we left guidance where it is. On share repurchase, we've added expectation of approximately another $500 million. But that will be in the back half of the year. And looking at that, just looking at the weighted average counts and so on, we'll probably see that the biggest accretive effect of that when we get into 2014. So in other words, we're back-end loaded here. And we decided to leave guidance where it is. And again, we'll see how it works out. But your observation is correct. We will be taking out additional shares. We expect to. But again, that will be occurring in the back half of the year.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just to focus on the comments you made on ERS. Can you maybe just give us a quick update on some of the key events or points that occurred this quarter? I mean, clearly, the 17% growth in all organic was pretty -- was pretty impressive.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, let me ask Mark Almeida if he'd like to comment on that.","Mark E. Almeida","Yes, Manav, we did. We had a very good quarter in ERS. It was really -- and we've talked about this before. It's a function of timing. When we get the work done on our various projects that are in flight. We had a number of projects that completed during the second quarter. So we recognized a lot of revenue there. But the business is strong, driven by regulatory activity and regulatory requirements that are being placed on banks. We're seeing a lot of strength, particularly in the U.S. relating to the Dodd-Frank stress testing rules, as well as the Federal Reserve CCAR provisions. So we're seeing some very good strength in the business from both a sales standpoint. But as you observed, good project completion resulting in more revenue recognition in the quarter.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And one final one, just on the rating agency side. Linda, in the past, you've talked about some of the number of new issuers to the market, like the stats there. Can you maybe give us 1 or 2 line just on how those trends are tracking thus far?","Linda S. Huber","Manav, I don't have those handy. Perhaps Ray, can give us a little bit more color. But they continue to be pretty good on what we've heard. We're looking to get more of that information together for Investor Day, but let me see if Ray has anything else to add.","Raymond W. McDaniel","No, I'm just going to add, and I will ask Michel Madelain if he would like to comment on this. But I think the new mandates have been continuing at a relatively steady pace. So no spikes in new mandates, but it also continues to be a good pipeline for us. And Michel, if you have something to add, please do.","Michel A. Madelain","No, I think what you said it's really -- we continue to see strength in Europe and emerging markets and the pipeline has been very strong, and so that trend has continued.","Linda S. Huber","Yes, I think, Manav, again, one way to look at evidence of disintermediation is to look at that European CFG revenue growth number, and that would be one way to try to measure what's going on there.","Operator","And we'll go next to Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","The margin performance was very impressive this quarter in the context of the revenue stream. So I'm wondering, Linda, if this causes you to rethink the potential margin upside in the business over the next couple of years.","Linda S. Huber","Peter, I'm going to ask Ray to comment some more after I do. But I think we're pretty happy with where we are on margin, and I think we're going to continue to stick to the story we have that over the longer term, we're kind of looking at low- to mid-40s, and we're happy with the progress that we've made. And I think we're pretty pleased with how the business has been performing on the margin line, as you noted. Ray?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Just 2 quick reminders. One is that the -- because of the over plan performance that we had last year, and as a result, the above plan incentive compensation we had last year, we did have an ability to expand margin this year more aggressively based on resetting of incentive compensation back to target. So we don't expect to see that kind of margin expansion going forward. And the other question will be the relative growth rates of MIS and Moody's Analytics because the Moody's Analytics business is a lower margin business. So we have to -- there is the uncertainty of the relative rates of growth of the 2 businesses in looking out over a number of years.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Fair enough. Ray, can you give us an update on how you're seeing the legal environment? Currently, you have -- there is a somewhat high-profile suit filed recently, any further settlements or dismissals that you can share with us?","Raymond W. McDaniel","No. There really hasn't been a lot of activity. We've had more than 50 cases filed, ratings-related cases filed since 2007, and a little more than 3 dozen of those have been resolved, most of them because they were dismissed or voluntarily withdrawn. We did have a couple of new complaints this year, and a couple of what are called summonses with notice, which are -- you should think of them as placeholders for possibly filing a complaint in the future. But those don't necessarily end up being actual cases. But that's been about it.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","How about in terms of legal expenses? Would it be running at a relatively constant level at this point?","Linda S. Huber","Peter, it's Linda. I'll talk a little bit about expenses as a whole, but we're not going to go into legal expenses per se. Probably worth noting that as Ray stated in the updated guidance, we're expecting expenses to be in the mid-single digits for growth rate for all of 2013. Second quarter, we popped up a little bit to a 12% growth rate. And that was about a $43 million increase. We expected that someone would ask for some color on that. So about 1\/2 of that was compensation-related. The impact of hiring increases, annual compensation increases, some incentive compensation accruals. Another 25% of that was probably best viewed as professional service cost increases for IT and other things related to that. We did note that we're now in compliance on both CRA3 and Dodd-Frank, and we had spent some money to get that done. The other 25% is basically other stuff. So expenses as a whole, I think it's pretty moderate in that we're expecting low-single-digit growth rates over the rest of the year. And just to be sure, we're absolutely clear so that folks can see how to model this. Looking at the number that we have here for the second quarter, it's $405 million. We're still looking at about a $50-ish million ramp over the course of the year, approximately more or less. So if you want to think about how to model expenses as a whole, that might help you out a little bit.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And Linda, do you have the actual incentive comp accrual for the quarter?","Linda S. Huber","Yes, I do. It was $34.3 million, Peter. And I think we have said -- we're hoping to have that be a little bit flatter this year. First quarter was $30.7 million, and this is just the incentive comp. This quarter, $34.3 million. I think we had guided folks to about $135 million for the rest of the year. With a strong health warning there that if we do better than we expect in the back half, of course, incentive compensation would increase commensurately.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And one last thing, just in terms of the structured finance market, strength in the U.S., weakness in Europe, any commentary in terms of just tone of market and expectations that things might get better going into '14?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, with respect to Europe, I would characterize it as hopeful that things will get better in '14. And I think that, that securitization does have an important role to play potentially in Europe as they are looking towards an economic recovery and giving companies additional opportunities to access the capital markets, whether it's capital raising or liquidity purposes. I think the securitization can be part of a longer-term solution. But right now, there's -- there's just not a lot of demand, and there are alternative funding sources. As we've -- I think we mentioned in the previous quarter's call, for example, in the U.K., the Funding for Lending program that they have in place. So in the near term, there are alternatives to the securitization market. Longer term, I would expect this is going to be part of a solution to the sluggish growth rates. Whether that's in 2014 or not, I don't know.","Operator","And we'll move next to Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I think at this point, just a few follow-ups. Just wanted to first come back to the whole higher rate interest rate question that obviously has been asked a lot here recently. But just hoping if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of, what is coming out when you talk to corporates and bankers? I know it's a difficult question to answer, but what should be the things that we should be looking for in terms of absolute level of rates or increases and pace of rate increases for people to really change their mind in terms of how they think about refinancing or just general issuance going forward. And then related to that, how are you -- yourself, thinking about it right now in terms of looking at the budget maybe for next year and going forward?","Linda S. Huber","Sure, Alex. I'll take a shot at this, and then I'll ask Ray if he has anything further to add. None of us are fixed income capital market traders or desk participants. So I think the information that we gave earlier as to what we're hearing is probably the best indication. I think to sum it up, the pipelines look good. They look strong. And I think the 10-year, at approximately 2.56%, 2.58% today, because there will be 10-year sales later on this week, that's below the 5-year average of 2.73%. And we'll see how that plays out. I think that's probably about the best we can do in terms of where we think things are and what will be moving. High yield is, of course, very rate dependent. As issuance -- as all-in cost come in below 6%, we usually see the high-yield market run very strong, and we have seen some indications that, that may happen or it may not. Leveraged loans, as I had said earlier, are running very strong, both in terms of fund inflows and buyer attraction for that paper, which is floating rate. So with all of that, I think your guess is as good as ours, and I'll see if Ray wants to add anything else.","Raymond W. McDaniel","The only thing I would add is just to repeat the views of some economists, including our own. That for now, they really don't think the Fed wants the 10-year Treasury yield to be much above the 2.5% mark. And if that's correct, that is still an attractive environment for issuance by historical measures. Now obviously, if spreads widen out, that would be affected. But right now, they have been coming back in from where they went to in June. So reason for cautious optimism there on the rate side.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I appreciate it. It's a difficult question to ask. But then on the second part of the question, anything that you would say, how you would respond or when you would think you need to respond or is it too early to tell at this juncture?","Raymond W. McDaniel","If we're talking about a cyclical movement that has an impact on bond issuance, candidly, I don't think we would do a whole lot to respond. Our business, we have to monitor the debt that's outstanding. We would expect that the debt is -- that additional debt is going to be issued in the future. And so it's not a structural change in our business. It's a cyclical change, if it occurs. And as I said before, a rising rate environment that is accompanied by business confidence and economic activity is not worrisome. What is worrisome is sort of what we saw in June, where there was fear of rising rates and widening spreads because the rate environment was not -- or the anticipated rate environment was not aligned with a sense that we had self-sustaining economic recovery.","Linda S. Huber","Alex, we'll also put in a plug on Monday at The Wall Street Journal with some information based on data of ours, in terms of broadening out of use of proceeds in terms of bond issuance. You may want to take a look at that. A little bit of a pickup in M&A. A little bit of pickup in capital expenditures. And those are one of the things -- those are some of the things that we're looking for. Also, as Ray has commented on before, the worst thing for us is a stagflation environment and inflation remains quite reasonably low at this point. So it all boils down to the question of when these pipelines move and encouraged by seeing 6 deals in the market today, 3 financials and 3 industrials. And we'll see what happens. But again, we have 2 parts to this business, and the Moody's Analytics business is performing pretty well.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Well, then, maybe as a segue, I'll just go into Moody's Analytics business, which is to say, I think somebody asked about it already. But just following-up on the ERS side, for one, you took the U.S. guidance up. And secondly, you noted that you obviously had a very good strong quarter. I think, Linda, last time I talked to you about this, you were actually noting that you're starting to engage in or at least try to engage with like higher deals, pitching higher -- larger deals. Anything to talk about, like where's that coming from or are you having success -- I mean, is there a big change in this business whether this could actually have accelerating growth from here?","Mark E. Almeida","Yes, it's Mark. I would say that we are having success there. We are -- certainly, in the U.S. as I said earlier, business is picking up largely in response to work that we're doing for banks related to the various stress testing requirements that are being imposed on them. That's been a very nice driver of growth in this market, and that's why you're seeing some healthier results here. In terms of the deal size, we -- the average size of deals probably remained about where it was. We do rather routinely win some very large scale transactions. But I don't know that at least thus far, it has not substantially moved the needle, if you look at the business overall. But certainly, I think the opportunity is there, again, related to the various regulatory requirements that are being imposed. That's presenting a lot of opportunity for us here in the U.S. as well as overseas. So I think that we're very optimistic about the business. We have -- we've been saying for some time that we think that this is a business that should grow at a low-double digit to mid-teens kind of rate over the long run. And certainly, what we're seeing in the environment, what we're hearing from customers, suggests to us that, that's going to be very achievable.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then just last one for me. Obviously, it seems like there's been a lot more discussion around restructuring the agencies, like Fannie and Freddie, in terms of bill proposals and things like that. So from what you've seen so far, any indication of how that would change the business for you? Are there other things that you would like to see? And maybe in general, how involved you are in those discussions in terms of lobbying and things like that. And any color would be great.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, obviously, we're aware of bills that have been introduced in Congress, including the Corker-Warner bill. I think it's still going to be a long process. It's not something that we are going to involve ourselves in from a lobbying perspective. Our job is to understand what the policy decisions are and to make whatever credit judgments that are appropriate based on those policy decisions, but not to push for one outcome or another. That being said, if there is a larger private label market for mortgage-backed securities, that's going to be beneficial. So we will watch that with interest, but without lobbying in any particular direction.","Linda S. Huber","And Alex, it's Linda. There were 2 interesting things that came through the news overnight. And Ray may be able to speak to these with -- or Michel, with greater detail than I can. One was a proposal that perhaps they might be looking to be some relief on one of the 17g-5 related rules of holding 5% on balance sheet of structured deals. Secondly was an announcement that one -- one of the GSEs had done a securitization of its own -- part of its own balance sheet, and maybe Ray can talk a little or Michel can talk a little bit more about those. But we are seeing some news flow in those areas.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, I don't have a lot actually to add to what Linda raised, other than that the observation that I think the experimentation, if you will, with some new securities and financial innovation is probably a positive. We've been through a period where there hasn't been a lot of financial innovation, and testing with some of these new securities types is -- I think is supportive of longer-term growth in some key markets like housing. So that's -- that's really all I -- I'm -- other than what I've seen in the papers, I don't have any additional insight I can offer on those.","Operator","We'll move next to Craig Huber at Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Linda, can you hear me?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, we can.","Linda S. Huber","Yes we can, Craig.","Craig Huber","Can you break down for us on a percent basis or in dollars your 4 main categories within ratings, break out high yield versus bank loans, investment grade, et cetera, and do it for all 4 areas, please? That's my first question.","Linda S. Huber","Sure, Craig. CFJ -- CFG, excuse me, and we're comparing second quarter 2013 over second quarter 2012, investment grade up nicely. Last year, about $42 million, this year about $60 million. That's up -- it's up 43%. It represents 23% of the total CFG revenues, which is about $263 million. Spec grade up to $57 million, which is 22% of the CFG total. And that's up 80% over last year's 2012. Again, if one is looking for indication of where -- what does disintermediation look like, that's it. Bank loans up to $53 million, 20% of total CFG. And there, we're up 51% over last year. Other is 35% of CFG. It's about $93 million. Going on to look at some of the other areas, structured, Craig, total of $97 million of revenue for second quarter. First-line is ABS, about $25.5 million. That's about 26% of the total. Now that is actually down from last year's $29.1 million. RMBS, $18.7 million, also down a little bit from last year. Commercial real estate, $30.7 million, a big increase from last year's $18.2 million. And derivatives at $22.3 million, about flat to last year's $21.5 million. That makes up 23% of the total SFG line of $97.2 million. Going on to third category FIG, total of $84.5 million. Banking is $57.5 million. It's 68% of the total, the lion's share. Insurance, $23.3 million. It's 28%, and managed investments of $3.6 million is 4% of the FIG line. Lastly, public project and infrastructure. PFG and sovereigns, $43.6 million, about flat from last year and 47% of the revenue line there. Munis at 43-point -- excuse me, $4.3 million, again, $4.3 million, about 5% of the total for PPIF. And project and infrastructure at $44.8 million, up nicely, 39% from last year. And that makes up 48% or about 1\/2 of total PPIF. Do you want to do MA as well, Craig?","Craig Huber","I think we all have that.","Linda S. Huber","Okay. Good. All right.","Craig Huber","I'm okay there. My next question, if I could, please. Can you -- as you think back over the last year, Ray or Linda, within your corporate finance segment, how much of your revenues there on the transaction side have been derived from refinancings versus growth capital? And how do those percentages vary versus, say, the prior 10 years on average?","Raymond W. McDaniel","I'm going to have to give you some approximate numbers, but a little more than 1\/2 of the activity, I think, this year has been refinancing with M&A and share repurchase ticking up a little bit. Really not on the CapEx side though. So it's still dominated in terms of refinancing. But we are seeing borrowing for other purposes that is a bit stronger than what we've seen the last couple of years.","Craig Huber","Okay. So it's not significantly higher than, say, 50% coming from refinancing to the best of your estimate?","Raymond W. McDaniel","No. I think that's correct. It's above 50%, but I don't think it's significantly above at this point.","Craig Huber","Okay. And then if we could just switch to legal costs. What is your best sense of when you think your legal costs on a year-over-year basis will start dropping?","Linda S. Huber","Craig, it's Linda. We're still not going to talk about legal costs. But we did talk openly about our expense outlook so.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Craig, the only thing I can really tell you is, there is a lot of uncertainty around this because we, obviously, are working to have cases dismissed as early as possible. Sometimes, we succeed. Sometimes, they move on to the discovery process, which becomes more expensive. So it really depends on what our success rate looks like with early dismissals and -- I just -- I can't give you a good forecast on that.","Craig Huber","Another question, please. As you look out over, say, the next 3 years, let's say, here in U.S. investment grade, bank loans and high yield, can you just talk about how much has to actually get refinanced and that's still outstanding and how that maybe looks versus where we're at today for this calendar year?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, for 2014 and 2015, a lot of what would have matured has been refinanced. And that's why we talk about these other drivers being important to the corporate finance growth story here in the U.S. going forward. It's a different situation as we look at corporates elsewhere around the world. But the U.S. market is an important market for us. So it is worth focusing on. That being said, there remains a lot of refinancing that has to occur in 2016, 2017. Some comments that we made earlier in the call about the fact that borrowing over the last few years has been a relatively short-term nature, and that borrowing is going to come around for refinancing again. So -- and the investment-grade market tends to refinance at a much steadier rate than the high-yield market. So that's -- we would expect to see refinancing over the next couple of years coming out of investment-grade market in similar ways to what we've seen in previous years.","Linda S. Huber","And Craig, you can take a look for those wall of refinancing charts in our updated analyst presentation. And we'll show that again, take another look at that, again, when we do Investor Day in 2 months.","Craig Huber","One final question, if I could. Your guidance for your 4 broad areas within your ratings business, as those guidance numbers, the infrastructure finance, corporate finance, et cetera, what are you most concerned about for the back half of the year? I mean, what -- in terms of, which ones you think have more potential upside than the others? And vice versa, where you're most concerned about on your guidance?","Raymond W. McDaniel","I'm not concerned about any particular business line. I'm really more focused, as I think probably everybody is at this point, on the macroeconomic situation. Whether -- how the market will respond to curtailment of quantitative easing if and when it begins. Predictions that it might happen in September. Predictions that it might happen at the end of the year, and market reaction to that. And I think there is going to be appropriately a lot of attention coming from policymakers to make sure that the market reaction is not unfavorable, and that we don't have a tightening of financial conditions in a way that would turn our recovery back in the wrong direction. So it's not individual business lines. It's more the macro situation at this point, Craig.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Arthur at Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Ray, just one question. I was -- the corporate finance internationally accelerated in the quarter. I think it was up sort of 30-ish in Q1 and up 52% in Q2. And you talked about disintermediation or Linda did. How does the comp look going forward there? And you think that disintermediation in the bond market in Europe is really accelerating at this point?","Raymond W. McDaniel","I think it's going to continue. We're going to continue to see new mandates. I don't anticipate it accelerating. It's been steady, and it's been strong. And that's, obviously, good news from a bond market volume perspective. Many of the credits are in the high-yield sector. I expect that, that will continue since the investment-grade credits had largely been in the bond market for a number of years already. And for some different reasons, I would expect to see a similar result as we look at the emerging market economies in Asia, Latin America, for example, where growth is outstripping banking system capacity. And -- and that's leading to disintermediation as well. I don't know, Linda or Michel, if you have anything else you'd like to add to that?","Michel A. Madelain","I mean, the only thing is that one of the underlying factor in Europe is clearly the condition of the banking system and their inability to basically meet the demands of a number of those issuers. And that's actually true for the high-yield market, basically. So there is an element of -- there's a cyclical element as well as a structural element at play here.","Linda S. Huber","And Doug, pretty frequent stories in the press that particularly in the periphery, lesser credits have a difficult time with bank financing and are looking to go to the spec grade market. So to follow-up on what Michel and Ray have said, we think that trend will continue.","Operator","We'll move next to Edward Atorino of Benchmark.","Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Just about everything in the world has been asked. You've got a lot of shares you could buy, take out I think 14 million to 15 million shares. I mean, are you going to have offsetting issuance or is that really a potential over the next couple of years?","Linda S. Huber","Ed, it's Linda. We tend to have issuance more focused in the front half of the year, and we try to keep our equity utilization below 2% for the employees here. So we're looking, as we said, to overall have a reduction in the outstanding shares. And thus far, we've been able to do that. And I'll ask Ray if he wants to comment any further on that.","Raymond W. McDaniel","No, just -- just I think Linda's comments stand on their own. The original guidance that we had given for approximately $500 million in share repurchase was largely to offset issuance. But that would not be the case with the -- with additional repurchases.","Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","I mean, can you conceivably buy 14 million shares of stock?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, conceivably, yes.","Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay.","Linda S. Huber","We'll have to see where the price...","Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","I don't want to be a wise guy and say, when?","Raymond W. McDaniel","No, we're not going to say that.","Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","I got it. Okay.","Linda S. Huber","We're working on it, Ed.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. McDaniel for any closing remarks.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Thank you.

After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","In the second quarter, Moody's achieved record revenue of $1.2 billion, up 17% from the second quarter of 2017. This result reflected strong performance at Moody's Analytics driven by contribution from Bureau Van Dijk. Moody's Investor Service record performance was primarily attributable to robust bank loan and collateralized loan obligation or CLO market activity as well as recurring revenue growth as 2017's new rating mandates became monitored credits.","Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2018 totaled $641 million, up 19% from the prior year period, including 11 percentage points attributable to Bureau Van Dijk operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and nonrecurring acquisition-related expenses.","Operating income was $534 million, up 16% from the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating income of $584 million was up 17%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income and adjusted operating income by 2% each. The operating margin was 45.4% and the adjusted operating margin was 49.7%.","Moody's diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.94 per share, up 20% from the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $2.04, up 32% and excludes $0.10 per share related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses. Second quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS primarily excludes a $0.13 foreign currency hedge gain.","Turning to first half performance, Moody's revenue for the first half of 2018 was $2.3 billion, up 17% from the prior year period, including 8 percentage points of growth attributable to Bureau Van Dijk. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion, up 7%, and non-U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion, up 30%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted Moody's revenue by 2%.","Moody's Investors Service first half revenue of $1.5 billion was up 9% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue was $885 million, up 6%, and non-U.S. revenue was $588 million, up 13%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted MIS revenue by 2%.","Moody's Analytics revenue for the first half of 2018 was $830 million, a 34% increase over the prior year. U.S. revenue of $339 million was up 9% and non-U.S. revenue of $491 million was up 58%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted MA revenue by 3%. Organic MA revenue for the first half of 2018 was $676 million, up 9% from the prior year period.","Moody's Corporation operating expenses for the first half of 2018 were $1.3 billion, up 19% from the prior year period, including 12 percentage points attributable to Bureau Van Dijk operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and nonrecurring acquisition related expenses. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted expenses by 2%.","Operating income was $1 billion, up 13% from the first half of 2017. Adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion was up 15%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income and adjusted operating income by 3% each. Moody's operating margin was 44.5% and its adjusted operating margin was 48.9%.","The effective tax rate for the first half of 2018 was 19.4%, down from 27.8% in the prior year period. The decline was primarily due to lower U.S. statutory tax rate and net uncertain tax position benefits related to a statute of limitations expiration and audit settlement.","We are reaffirming our full-year 2018 guidance of $7.20 to $7.40 per diluted EPS and $7.65 to $7.85 for adjusted diluted EPS.","I will now turn the call back over to Steve to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Stephen Maire","Thanks Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the Company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the second quarter was a record $1.2 billion, up 17%, including 8 percentage points of growth attributable to Bureau Van Dijk. U.S. revenue of $625 million was up 10%. Non-U.S. revenue of $550 million was up 27% and represents 47% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $613 million was up 25% and represented 52% of total revenue. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted Moody's revenue by 1%.","Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $752 million, up 10%. U.S. revenue increased 9% to $451 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $300 million was up 10% and represented 40% of total MIS revenue. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted MIS revenue by 1%.","Moving to the lines of business for MIS; first, corporate finance revenue for the second quarter was $378 million, up 6%. This result reflected strong bank loan issuance in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by a decline in global investment grade and U.S. high-yield bonds. U.S. corporate finance revenue was up 10% and non-U.S. revenue was approximately flat.","Second, structured finance revenue totaled $142 million, up 19%, driven by a broad strength in securitization markets, with particularly strong contribution from CLOs. U.S. and non-U.S. structured finance revenues were up 14% and 28% respectively.","Third, financial institutions revenue of $121 million was up 18%. This result was driven by strong contribution from the global insurance sector as well as the U.S. and Asia banking sectors. U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions revenue were up 24% and 13% respectively.","Fourth, public project and infrastructure finance revenue of $108 million was up 3%. This result was primarily driven by contributions from EMEA infrastructure finance and sovereign and sub-sovereign issuers, partially offset by a decline in U.S. municipal issuance. U.S. public project and infrastructure finance revenue was down 7%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 21%.","Turning now to Moody's Analytics, total revenue for MA of $423 million was up 35%. U.S. revenue of $174 million was up 12%. Non-U.S. revenue of $249 million was up 57% and represented 59% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted MA revenue by 2%. Organic MA revenue for the second quarter of 2018 was $343 million, up 9% from the prior-year period.","Moving now to the lines of business for MA; first, research, data and analytics or RD&A revenue of $280 million was up 55%. U.S. RD&A revenue was $118 million, up 16%, and non-U.S. RD&A revenue of $162 million more than doubled. Bureau van Dijk's revenue contribution of approximately $80 million reflects a $6 million reduction from the deferred revenue adjustment required under acquisition accounting rules. Organic RD&A revenue was $200 million, up 11%, and was driven by strength in sales of ratings, data feeds, and credit research.","Second, enterprise risk solutions or ERS revenue of $106 million was up 8% from the prior year period. This result was driven by continued strong demand for subscription products, particularly in the risk analytics and insurance segments. U.S. ERS revenue was up 5% and non-U.S. revenue was up 11%. Trailing 12-months revenue for ERS increased 8% while sales were approximately flat.","The ERS sales performance is affected by the shift in the business mix to higher-margin products. As this transition continues from one-time perpetual software licenses to SaaS or software-as-a-service subscriptions, there is a near-term impact on our overall results. This conversion to subscriptions will contribute to a larger, more stable and more profitable base of recurring revenue.","To provide further transparency into our progress on this transition, starting with this earnings call we are disclosing trailing 12-month sales and revenue by contract type. At the end of the second quarter of 2018, trailing 12-month subscription sales are up 11% versus the prior year period, while one-time sales inclusive of perpetual licenses and service fees are down 25%. During the same 12-month period, ERS revenue from subscriptions was up 12% and one-time revenues rose 1%.","Moving on to professional services, revenue of $37 million was up 5%, driven by strong new sales and improved customer retention. U.S. and non-U.S. professional services revenues were up 1% and 8% respectively.","Turning now to operating expenses, Moody's second quarter operating expenses were $641 million, up 19%. 11 percentage points of this increase were attributable to Bureau Van Dijk operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and acquisition related expenses. Other drivers of the expense growth included additional compensation expense for merit increases and hiring. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted operating expenses by 1%.","On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new ASC 606 revenue accounting standard using the modified retrospective approach. The impact of adoption was immaterial to Moody's Corporation revenues and expenses in the second quarter and in the first half of 2018. The impact of ASC 606 is expected to be immaterial to Moody's Corporation in the remainder of the year. However, it could create quarterly volatility in revenues or expenses at the line of business or segment level.","As Ray mentioned, Moody's operating margin was 45.4% and the adjusted operating margin was 49.7%. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, down from 32.1% in the prior year period. The decline in the tax rate primarily reflects a lower U.S. statutory tax rate.","Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the second quarter of 2018, Moody's repurchased approximately 200,000 shares at total cost of $38 million, or an average cost of $167.05 per share. Moody's also issued approximately 200,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plans. Moody's returned $85 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the second quarter of 2018, and on July 9th, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share of Moody's common stock. This dividend will be payable on September 10, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 20, 2018.","Over the first half of 2018, Moody's repurchased approximately 500,000 shares at a total cost of $81 million, or an average cost of $163.80 per share, and issued a net 1.4 million shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. The net amount includes shares withheld for employee payroll taxes. Moody's also returned $169 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the first half of 2018.","Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2018 totaled 191.9 million, approximately flat to a year ago. As of June 30, 2018, Moody's had approximately $450 million of share repurchase authority remaining. In June 2018, Moody's issued $300 million of 3.25% senior unsecured notes due 2021, the proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of an outstanding term loan. At quarter end, Moody's had $5.3 billion of outstanding debt and $910 million of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility.","Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter-end were $1.4 billion, with approximately 76% held outside the U.S. Cash flow from operations for the first half of 2018 was $777 million, an increase from a negative $41 million in the first half of 2017. Free cash flow for the first half of 2018 was $739 million, an increase from a negative $83 million in the prior year period. These increases in cash flow were largely due to payments the Company made in the first quarter of 2017 pursuant to its 2016 settlement with the Department of Justice and various states attorneys general.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Ray.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Thanks Steve. I'd like to provide some highlights on our progress with Bureau Van Dijk integration and synergy activities. As we approach the August anniversary of the Bureau Van Dijk acquisition, our integration activities remain on track. The legacy Bureau Van Dijk business continues to perform well as we align sales operations practices and centralize shared service activities such as finance and human resource management.","Our joint marketing efforts are starting to bear fruit with significant recent sales wins in both the U.S. and Asia. In the first half of 2018, we rebranded Bureau Van Dijk's bank financials product to Moody's Analytics BankFocus and continued to invest in content and functionality enhancements, leveraging Moody's expertise. WE are very pleased with the performance of the legacy business and the progress we are making against the synergies that we anticipated when we announced the transaction.","I will now discuss certain components of our full-year guidance for 2018. A complete list of Moody's guidance is included in Table 12 of our second quarter 2018 earnings press release, which can be found on the Moody's Investor Relations Web-site at ir.moodys.com.","Moody's outlook for 2018 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.","Our outlook assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.32 to GBP 1 and for the euro of $1.17 to EUR 1. Full year 2018 guidance is reaffirmed at $7.20 to $7.40 for diluted EPS and $7.65 to $7.85 for adjusted diluted EPS, reflecting Moody's expectations for continued strong operating performance. Moody's now expects revenue to increase in the high single-digit percent range. Operating expenses are now also expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range. Operating margin is now expected to be approximately 44% and adjusted operating margin is now expected to be 48% to 49%.","Before turning to the Q&A, I would like to provide a couple of updates on Moody's corporate social responsibility or CSR strategy as well as highlight a few awards that we have recently won. First, on Moody's CSR strategy, earlier this week Moody's published its annual CSR report, detailing the Company's progress and delivering on its goal of empowering people around the world to create a better future for themselves, their communities and the environment.","As part of its focus on empowering people with financial knowledge, Moody's recently announced Reshape Tomorrow, an initiative to partner with organizations around the world to help small business owners overcome some of the challenges of growing their enterprises. The report details Moody's ongoing initiatives to support financial empowerment as well as each of its other areas of focus, activating an environmentally sustainable future and helping young people reach their potential. I want to thank our employees for bringing Moody's CSR purpose to life through their time, expertise, and passion. For more information and to view the report, please see the CSR press release that we issued on July 24 or visit moodys.com\/CSR.","Finally, I am proud to mention some positive recognition that we have received in the market. Moody's Investors Service was recently named the #1 credit rating agency in Institutional Investor's 2018 All-America Fixed-Income Research poll. This marks our seventh year in a row winning this title. Additionally, MIS was recently named the Best Credit Rating Agency in Mexico in 2018 by Capital Finance International. This represents our first such award in the Latin American region.","Moody's Analytics was named category leader in the prestigious Chartis FinTech Quadrant and RiskTech Quadrant for work in three product areas, credit risk, CECL technology, and balance sheet management. In 2018 Risk Technology Awards, MA was also recognized as provider of the year in three areas, credit data, wholesale credit modeling, and credit stress testing. For the second year in a row, MA's structured finance portal was named CLO Data Provider of the Year at the GlobalCapital U.S. Securitization Awards. And The Asian Banker cited Moody's Analytics as the best risk technology implementation of the year in two areas, regulatory compliance reporting and asset liability management. So, congratulations to our colleagues at both MIS and MA.","This concludes our prepared remarks, and joining Steve and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics, and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investors Service. We'd be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Manav Patnaik at Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","My first question is just to touch a little bit on the guidance. It sounds like the total Company revenue growth revisions is led by the Moody's Analytics business. So, I was wondering if you could just go through why the organic growth is lower. I would have expected total obviously because of the FX, but is there something else going on in there?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","I'll let my colleagues weigh in with any color that they want to offer, Manav, but really I think the most important element of any of the revenue adjustments that we have made, or almost all of them that we have made, starts with a discussion about FX. And while FX has been favorable compared to 2017, it is unfavorable compared to our beginning of the year and Q1 assumptions for exchange rates. So, that has driven the adjustments in multiple lines of our guidance, and we are able to continue to project EPS within the existing ranges because it's had an impact both on revenue and on expense, and so they have moved in tandem.","Stephen Maire","Just some additional context on the FX, Manav, just to highlight how it's impacting, so the rate that we were using when we first put out our guidance in February, it was the spot rate at the time which was $1.23 to the euro. Our updated forecast is now using what are currently spot rates of $1.17. So, it was $1.25 rather then and it came down to $1.17. So $0.08 have come off the euro since we've put out our guidance in February, so that's driving part of it.","And then the other thing I would point to as well, if you look at the euro price performance last year, in the first half of the year, it averaged about $1.08 and then strengthened pretty meaningfully and it would average $1.18 in the second half of the year. So, on both ends, it's been a challenge for us, and that's been reflected in what you are seeing on the guides.","Manav Patnaik","And I guess just to follow-up on that, so what is the FX impact, how many points in the total Company and by segment? And I guess, does that answer also then imply the organic growth reduction in Moody's Analytics was also all FX?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","It's primarily FX, yes. There is a small adjustment for ERS, but the rest of the story is FX, Manav.","Mark E. Almeida","Yes, so that\u2019s right, Manav. It's Mark. It's almost entirely FX. We had a couple of million dollars that we took down ERS due to the underlying business, but substantially it's 100% FX.","Manav Patnaik","And just the assumption of how many points FX is hitting the line?","Stephen Maire","So, in our current forecast, you\u2019ve got about 1% or 2% on revenue and op income favorable and about 1% unfavorable on expense. So, less of a tailwind than it was coming into the year.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. And then just one last one for me, so it sounds like when you look at S&P's results, it sounds like FIG was the standout here in the quarter. Is that something unique to Moody's going on or is that -- is it one of those things that can fluctuate quarter to quarter?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","I'll let Rob comment on that, but you are correct, we did have strength in financial institutions, both in the insurance sector and in important parts of the banking sector. Rob?","Robert Fauber","Yes, that's right. I think we have described FIG as traditionally a relationship-based segment, but in recent years as we have grown this franchise, we\u2019ve expanded more beyond the traditional bank customer base and added more insurers, non-bank financial companies asset managers and the like, and that contributed to the growth in 2Q because we had good revenue growth driven by a variety of factors here.","One was, as Ray just noted, strong issuance by the insurance sector, particularly in the U.S. and Asia, and that was driven both by M&A and some balance sheet management activities. In banking, we saw some increased supply from infrequent issuers, and remember that was a story we had a bit last year as well as some solid issuance out of Southeast Asia, and then first-time issuers such as FinCos and LeaseCos, so that's those non-bank financial companies I have talked about, and in terms of first-time mandates, just to give you a sense, in the financial institution segment, we've added some dedicated commercial resource to focus on this space, and we have signed over 100 FTMs globally through the first half of 2018.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","First-time mandates.","Robert Fauber","Yes, first-time mandates, sorry.","Manav Patnaik","All right, great. Thanks for the color there.","Operator","We'll go next to Alex Kramm at UBS.","Alex Kramm","Just staying on the guidance for a minute, if we can switch to Moody's Investment Services for a little bit, obviously you moved a couple of things around there. Can you maybe just give us a little bit of a sense where you may be a little bit more conservative in your outlook, where you may have more or less visibility? The thing in particular that some investors have brought up to me today that they thought structured finance you should have had a little bit more room to revise the guidance there. So just wondering if you feel like that's an area in particular where you're being conservative or what you're seeing out there?","Robert Fauber","Alex, I'll take that one. You're right, overall we had a few changes to the segment and that was driven by a combination of kind of the market conditions as well as the FX unfavorability that Ray mentioned obviously at the MIS level that kept us within the mid-single digit range.","In structured finance, I don't tend to think we're being conservative. We're trying to be as accurate as we can here. We've had a continuation of the trend we saw in the first quarter of 2018, with further strength coming from CLOs, and that was the primary support for our guidance. And we've said I think in terms of CLOs, we'll probably see a bit of a surge in activity once we get past Labor Day.","In corporate finance, again similar trend that we saw in first quarter of 2018, we've seen some weaker issues -- conditions in parts of the corporate finance market, and that's U.S. high-yield in Greater China, along with again a little bit less FX tailwind than we had projected.","In the public, project and infrastructure finance segment, we've seen some continued softness in U.S. PFG and that led to the decrease in our guide there. But overall, we expect, just back to that FX theme, kind of little to no benefit in FX in the second half and that's versus the modest benefit that we had projected in April that Ray touched on, and that impacts all the segments and it's factored into our guidance.","Stephen Maire","And let me just jump in, Alex, and provide the update that we typically do on these calls, from what we're hearing from the investment banks where we go around and query a handful of them to give their current market views and what they are saying. This is a slide that's up on the Webcast now. Views are from a variety of investment banks as I mentioned and they are from both financial and non-financial. It's U.S. dollar which this first slide is, doesn't necessarily align with Moody's revenue categorization. So it's not apples to apples but hopefully this will give you a little bit of a sense for what the banks are seeing.","So on investment grade, expecting full year to be down approximately 5% to 10%, that's not a big shift from where they had been earlier in the year. There's been increased volatility in the markets, as everyone is aware, and that's sidelined some issuers. Just to put some color around the increase of volatility, the average VIX for all of 2017 was 11. The average so far for 2018 has been 16. So, 2018 has been 16, so pretty significant move up just in terms of the total market environment volatility there.","Credit spreads have widened since the beginning of the year, but still remain relatively low by historical standard. Looking at the Bloomberg Barclays Agg, it's currently sitting about 20 basis points wide from where we were coming into the year, but we are 10 basis points off the wides where we were a few weeks ago. But for some context there, the 10-year average, we're still 60 basis points below that, so again on historical basis still relatively attractive.","They've seen some cash repatriaters have been out of the market, particularly in the tech sector, not surprising there. Bank issuance has been strong recently post earnings reports and they are expecting some non-financial corporate to hit the market, access the market post Labor Day, which is typically the trend that you see.","I would also comment that a large portion of the pipeline they are seeing is comprised of M&A. So moving on the high yield also down 5% to 10%, equity market volatility, and interest rate hikes has slowed issuance in this asset class, and issuance that they have seen has primarily been due to refinancings.","High-yield spreads have widened for the beginning of the year despite limited issuance. The pipelines are light with some rotation out of bonds into loans, which has really been the story so far this year. So, loans, their forecast for full year is flat to down, but that's off a very high base. It was a record blockbuster 2017 for this product.","Leveraged loan market remains robust. The spreads have widened a bit, similar to high-yield investment grade. Primarily that's being driven by just lot of new issuance that's coming on to the market. But quoting Ray, issuance clearly does still remain attractive in a rising rate environment, which we're in here in the U.S.","Repricings and refinancing activity have continued to be the main drivers of issuance and M&A size is the next largest. So full year slightly down, as I said, from 2017 levels but there could be some upside based on what we're seeing on the M&A front.","One thing I would point out here as well on fund flows into this asset class. We got 9 billion year-to-date and that compares to 10 billion for our full year 2017. So there continues to be a lot of capital coming into this asset class, which has been supporting it.","Moving to Europe, on the investment grade side, issuance is down double-digits so far year-to-date. The pipeline is relatively soft. The ECB is still in the market, although that's expected to end by the end of the year, although yesterday they did comment that they don't plan to move rates until next summer at the earliest, of course market and data dependent.","Their spreads have moved wider, similar to the U.S. in the beginning of the year, but still remain tight by historical standards, and they continue to see growth in GDP and corporate profits, which is encouraging of course.","On the spec rate side, both high-yield and leveraged loan markets are fundamentally sound, they described it, though issuance levels faced tough comps over what we saw in 2017 and spreads have also widened but remain attractive on historical basis. Healthy pipeline, M&A, seems to be the driver there. And then political uncertainty, their potential for increased trade protectionism that we're seeing, are causing some caution in that market.","So hope that helps to round out a little bit, and I don't know, Rob, if you have anything else you want to add.","Robert Fauber","Yes, maybe Alex, just to try to sort of answer your question around our view on corporate, just given where we're seeing high yield so far this year and the rotation from high yield into bank loans, I think we'd probably be at in our own view to be kind of at the lower end of those estimates, street estimates that Steve just gave you on high yield, and probably towards the higher end on bank loans.","Alex Kramm","That's great. Thank you. And then just maybe shifting gears quickly to Mark, on BVD, maybe it would be helpful to parse out the moving pieces here that you saw. When I look at the adjusted numbers, meaning adding back the revenue recognition math, I think, A, last quarter was 83.5 million and you did 86 million this quarter, which is I think if you analyze it, it's nice double-digit growth, but you also had FX work against you, and I think last quarter you had something slip. So, long story short, maybe you can just give us a little bit of a view what the kind of like clean growth rates are that you're seeing right now, healthy double digits, is it accelerating, how would you feel about the remainder of the year?","Mark E. Almeida","So, Alex, happy to do that. Apples to apples, Bureau Van Dijk's first half revenue growth is just over 12%, and that's in constant dollars, so there's no FX noise in there. It reflects the add-back of the haircut. But we're very pleased with 12%. That's a nice improvement over the Company's growth rate prior to our having acquired. So the underlying business is performing very, very well. We're very pleased with what's going on there. We don't see any sluggishness at all, in fact just the opposite.","Alex Kramm","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Toni Kaplan at Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","Can you give us an update on what you think is going on in issuance with respect to pull-forward? And also, can you talk about whether you see the widening spreads that you just discussed, has that made your MIS guidance a bit more cautious, do you see sort of the widening spreads continuing?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","It's Ray. I do think we're going to continue to see spreads widen out a bit, as we have a consensus view around perhaps two more interest rate increases this year. If the markets continue to perform as they have, however default rates are expected to remain low, our forecast for default rates has been declining on a 12 months forward basis. So that is going to help constrain any substantial spread widening. So, we're expecting wider spreads but we're also expecting on an absolute basis for borrowing conditions to remain attractive.","In terms of pull-forward, yes, we have had a lot of pull forward of what would have been maturing debt in 2018. That was pulled forward largely into 2016, 2017. So, what's really been supporting the market this year is M&A activity and borrowing for share repurchase, et cetera, a bit of a tick up in capital expenditure as well.","Whether we will see pull forward of 2019, 2020 maturities into an environment where there are expectations for rising rates or whether corporations will more broadly choose to ride it out, we're just going to have to see. So, we obviously will pay close attention to that.","Toni Kaplan","That's helpful. And you've mentioned in the past that you probably see the most operating leverage within U.S. corporate finance. I was wondering if you could talk about how much operating leverage you get in the structured business and if there's a need to add staff when the market is going as well as it is now. Thanks.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","I guess my first comment in terms of the operating leverage that comes out of any of our business lines has to do with what the nature of the issuance environment is. If we're getting a lot of first-time issuers, a lot of first-time mandates, as we have been, there is less operating leverage because we are adding staff to address those new relationships, those new credits that we are rating. If it is refinancing activity or additional borrowing by institutions that we already have rating relationships with and they are ramping up their capital markets activity, there is more operating leverage there.","I would also say, because of the transactional nature of structured finance, it tends to have less operating leverage opportunity. As the number of transactions increases, again we need more people to rate those transactions. So there are circumstances where we can get additional operating leverage in structured finance, but I don't think that's a natural condition of that business as volumes increase.","Operator","Our next question is from Joseph Foresi at Cantor Fitzgerald.","Michael Reid","This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Just wondering if you could into some detail on QuantCube and the investment there?","Robert Fauber","This is Rob. We made a small minority investment in QuantCube this quarter. They are a firm that focuses on artificial intelligence with a big data platform and we started to work with them around collecting alternative data and building models and insights into both macro, and also we're working with them around some of the environmental, social and governance initiatives that we have underway. So, it was a way for us to kind of partner with an innovative technology company and augment our capabilities and get some ultimately we think some interesting data that we can work into our analytics and our research.","Michael Reid","Okay. And then, could you give us any detail on the outlook and progress in Asia and if there's anything new there to call out?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Yes, the Asia business overall is doing well. You saw that we benefited from in particular in the financial institutions area in Asia this quarter. I guess more structurally, China continues to be an important area of focus. We are in process of applying for a domestic license in China to rate in the invested Chinese bond market. The pace at which that application will be evaluated and hopefully ultimately approved is uncertain. And it's also, honestly, some of the uncertainty comes from the macro environment and the geopolitical environment and whether there will be any delays or breakthroughs on that front which could have an impact not only on ourselves but on the pace of entry for foreign firms in a number of areas and the pace of opening of the Chinese market.","Operator","We'll go next to Peter Appert at Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert","So Mark, at the risk of sounding ungrateful for your hard work, it feels like the margin performance in Analytics continues to lag relative to what we might expect given the magnitude of revenue gains and the incremental contribution from BVD. So, can you talk about the trajectory in margins?","Mark E. Almeida","Yes. I guess we see it differently, Peter. Bureau Van Dijk is definitely helping the MA margin, and that's despite the fact that we are spending money to bring Bureau Van Dijk up to public company standards and it's also despite that continued haircut on the top line that we've got due to the accounting.","For the first six months of this year, if you look at Bureau Van Dijk just on a standalone basis, its margin is north of 30%, and the legacy MA business ignoring Bureau Van Dijk is just about 23%. So, in the aggregate we're about 25%. So we are seeing some good lift from Bureau Van Dijk. And if not for that deferred revenue haircut of $16 million year-to-date, you'd see Bureau Van Dijk's margin would be up over 35%, and that would take MA up above 26.","So, all of that is consistent with what we've expected. And again, I'd remind you that we are spending money at Bureau Van Dijk as we move them from being a private equity owned company to a unit of public company. Also, keep in mind, we've owned the company for less than a year and the P&L impact of our expense and revenue synergies are only just starting to hit the P&L. So I think there's a lot more positive margin impact that we're going to see from Bureau Van Dijk, especially as we get into next year.","You also have to bear in mind that Bureau Van Dijk, it represents, thus far represents less than 20% of total MA revenue for the first six months of this year. So, as profitable as Bureau Van Dijk is, it's just not having that much impact yet. It has having good impact. As I said, it's impact is consistent with what we expected. We're very pleased with how things are going there and we think there's more runway for us on the margin.","And then also I'd add that on a standalone basis, we're continuing to do our work in the rest of Moody's Analytics to expand the margin and we'd like the trajectory we're on there. We're continuing to make good, steady, gradual progress to raise the margin. Again, I'd remind you to look at our adjusted operating margin on a trailing 12-months basis rather than looking at discrete quarters because it's not unusual to have a little bit of idiosyncrasy on the expense line in any given quarter. But again, on a trailing 12-months basis, we're making very steady progress and we expect to continue to make very steady progress.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Just as a point of emphasis, Peter, I would also underscore Mark's initial comments about the investment we're making in Bureau Van Dijk to make sure that its systems and processes are consistent with a public company asset, and it's not one-off expenses. Those expenses, even the ones that will continue, are not going to grow as Bureau Van Dijk grows. We're going to have those installed and that's an expense that we are taking on now that is going to form a base going forward that doesn't have to grow as the overall Bureau Van Dijk business grows. And I would also emphasize, this is all consistent with our acquisition model, and the performance we've been expecting to see, it's coming through.","Mark E. Almeida","Right. And of course also the synergies that we talked about when we acquired the company.","Peter Appert","Right, great. Thank you for all those points. That's very helpful. So I guess, just two quick follow-ups, Mark. The implication would be then as we cycle through the deferred revenue issue in the second half, we should see a pretty dramatic step-up in terms of the year-to-year and I guess quarter to quarter margin performance. So something, from what you said earlier, it sounds like something like 500 basis points perhaps of incremental margin specifically from BVD, so that was point one. Point two then is, maybe I'm remembering incorrectly, but I thought that BVD pre-acquisition was closer to 50% margin. So is the haircut in margin that dramatic from the incremental cost of being part of a public company?","Mark E. Almeida","Again, I think that we did not expect or intend to continue to run Bureau Van Dijk at anything like the kinds of margins that it was running at when it was owned by private equity. We knew there was work that we were going to have to do, particularly in the short run, but the nature of the business is such, and this was Ray's point, the nature of the business is such that there is an awful lot of operating leverage to be realized as we accelerate the growth on the top line. We've seen good top line acceleration, as I mentioned earlier, and we feel very confident about sustaining that over the coming years. So, I don't know that we'll be at the levels that the company was at when it was in the hands of private equity, but it will be a very nicely profitable business and additive to the margin of MA overall.","Stephen Maire","And one comment I would make on it as well, Peter, it's not an exact apple to apples comparison, because the number you were citing was in IFRS accounting, and there are some accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS that impact the margin. Specifically, the costs of developing software were capitalized under IFRS and they are expensed under GAAP. It doesn't meet the criteria. So that shaved a couple of points off the margin versus what you saw there. So it's not exactly apples to apples, I guess is the one point I would make.","Peter Appert","Yes, okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Jeff Silber at BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Silber","I know this isn't going to have a direct impact on your business but I'm curious about the noise and uncertainty going around with the trade wars and tariffs. Are you seeing any pushback or perhaps uncertainty on the part of your clients to issue more debt or any other part of your business being affected?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","It's hard to tell specifically who might decide to sit on the sidelines who otherwise would have issued debt as a result of tariffs or trade frictions. What we can look at though and what our economists can forecast are the implications for GDP from different kinds of trade scenarios. And in terms of the tariffs that have already been announced, the impact is very, very minimal in our forecast, 0.1%.","If other elements of the tariffs that had been discussed but not implemented were implemented, that would add another 0.1%. And if we had a full-out trade war, as our economists [say] [ph], Trade Armageddon, that would start moving us toward 0.5% impact in their estimation, so just to give you a sense of dimension of this.","Jeffrey Silber","Right. That's very helpful, and I think you've always said that the issuance trends can be more tied to changes in GDP, if I remember correctly.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Yes. Over time, absolutely, I think that's what we would link it to, correct.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay, great. And then just sorry to go back to guidance, just one more question and this is minor, but you took your CapEx guidance down for the year. Is it something that's being deferred to next year, if you could give us a little bit more color? Thanks so much.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","We're deferring a couple of projects that are not essential to the growth of the business, and we're probably going to take some of those projects in and modularize them, take them on in pieces. So we just paused and we're going to be looking at that in the context of our 2019 planning and budgeting.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay, fair enough. Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll go next to Tim McHugh at William Blair.","Timothy McHugh","Just one question maybe, the reasons for the ERS being a little softer than you had I guess planned?","Mark E. Almeida","Yes, Tim, it's Mark. It's very much as Steve described earlier on the call. The situation as we make this transition from selling traditional software sold on a perpetual license basis and doing these large implementation projects moving more to a SaaS model, what we're seeing is the trade-off there is that the first year fees when you're selling on a subscription basis are just at a much lower level than the fees we would have been realizing if we were selling on a perpetual license basis. Now, we make that up over a couple of year period because we are charging those subscription fees year in and year out, so over a three or four-year period we're even and then we pull ahead after that.","So, as that transition is occurring, what we're seeing is that the decline in those one-time fees is happening a little bit more quickly than we're seeing the ramp-up in the subscription fees. So it's really just the timing thing of not getting the one-time fees and not realizing the subscription fees at quite the same pace that we had based our guidance on. So, as I said, that's a couple of million dollars on the ERS line, and so that together with the FX impact has caused us to bring down the outlook there.","Operator","We'll take our next question today from Craig Huber at Huber Research.","Craig Huber","Ray or Rob, would you give us a little bit more update on the outlook I guess on the bank loan sector we were expecting in the second half of the year, just above and beyond what you said investment banks were thinking, what do you guys think of the outlook into the second half of the year, how it will impact your ratings business? Then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Rob, you want to take that?","Robert Fauber","So, I think first of all, just in terms of where we are on bank loans, obviously bank loan issuance picked up in the quarter pretty significantly versus the first quarter of 2018. And Steve mentioned, we've seen a rotation out of high-yield and into bank loans with some very strong demand for that floating-rate paper. Getting speculation about half of U.S. interest rates have very strong bid from CLOs.","I'd note that the use of proceeds has shifted from the first half of this year \u2013 in the first half of this year versus the first half of last year. We're certainly seeing more M&A driven financing, while the refi and amended extend has declined as a percent of the total.","In Europe, pretty similar drivers in a particularly notable pickup in that acquisition financing, which continue the trend that we saw in the first quarter of 2018. There's a nice backlog of M&A financing in the European leverage finance space.","I'd also note, this area has been a real focus for us. We've got a very experienced leveraged finance and CLO team. We have added some commercial resource to focusing specifically on the loan market, both in the U.S. and Europe, to make sure that we're addressing all this demand.","You mentioned kind of view for the second half. It's interesting that when we look at what issuance did last year, we saw actually a fairly meaningful deceleration in bank loan issuance in the second half of 2017 from the first half of 2017. And so, we're expecting something similar this year. That means that despite a decline in issuance volumes in the second half of this year from the first half on a sequential basis, we do think we can see revenue growth over the same period last year, and we've included that in our guidance.","And that then also ties back to this mix shift I talked about. That revenue growth is going to be supported by the shift to this more M&A driven activity and less of the refi. We have said that's true in the U.S. and especially in EMEA.","Craig Huber","My other question, Ray or Rob, corporate sector out there, are you seeing anything out there, there's lot of worries with some investors, there's too much debt in the corporate market, are you seeing any signs at all, whether it'd be in the U.S. or Europe, that there's too much high-yield or investment-grade debt out there, with the various ratios of course? And I guess somebody should ask, what's an update on the CFO search please? Thanks.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","With respect to leverage levels, again, we are not seeing anything that would indicate a dramatic increase in leverage. To your point though, Craig, the markets have definitely been open for increasingly lower rated credits. And so, even though we may not see leverage increasing by rating category, we are seeing lower rated credits getting into the market, and those will be riskier names obviously. So, that's how we're lining it up. As far as CFO search is concerned, I think we'll be in a position to make an announcement shortly.","Craig Huber","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Let's take our next question from Bill Warmington at Wells Fargo.","William Warmington","So, a couple of questions for you on BVD. Ray, in your comments, initially you mentioned some U.S. and Asia sales wins, and I was just going to ask for some color there, and don't hold back, it ain't bragging if you've done it.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","As long as we're going to claim credit, I'll let Mark do that.","Mark E. Almeida","Bill, what we're talking about there is, we're seeing some very nice wins by leveraging the Moody's Analytics sales and distribution capacity in the U.S. and Asia. That was an area that we identified as a potential synergy, given our customer relationships in those markets being deeper than those of Bureau Van Dijk, our brand having more resonance and recognition among customers in those markets than was true with Bureau Van Dijk. So, we've had some very nice sizable wins in both markets and we feel very good about what's happening there. So we just wanted to highlight those because, as I said, they were consistent with some of the plans we had going into this project from the outset.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","And you'll recall that at the time of acquisition, about 75% of Bureau Van Dijk's business was in Europe. And so, getting sales outside of that area of real strength for Bureau Van Dijk historically is particularly interesting for us.","Mark E. Almeida","Yes. And I should add to that as well. Bureau Van Dijk had a product, has a product that competed with a product that we offer in ERS. We have joined forces there. One of the big wins we had in Asia recently was where we went to market with a joint proposal offering both the Moody's Analytics option as well as the Bureau Van Dijk option, and we had a very successful win there. So, we're seeing good progress on a couple of different fronts through our collaboration with Bureau Van Dijk in Asia. So we're very pleased with that.","William Warmington","You had also mentioned the rebranding on the Orbis Bank Focus as Moody's Analytics BankFocus. I was hoping to ask for an update on the 2018 launch. And then also you had talked about targeting the interbank credit market initially. Is that still the go-to-market strategy there?","Mark E. Almeida","Yes, that's a fundamental part of what we're doing with BankFocus. I would characterize it as early days. I think we are making good progress there, again, both on reaching out to the market, getting in front of our customers, by our customers I mean Moody's Analytics relationships, introducing them to the product, applying some of both the Moody's Analytics knowhow to that product and adding some new features and functionality to the product. So, I think there is good work going on both on the sales side as well as the product development side. And as I said, it's early days but we like the trajectory and we continue to be bullish about the opportunity there.","William Warmington","All right, thank you very much and I wish everybody a good weekend.","Operator","We'll go next to Vincent Hung at Autonomous.","Vincent Hung","Just one for me, so you gave us the first-time mandates for FIG, what the issuer trends like for the other ratings categories?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Let me see if I can get Rob to give you some color on that.","Robert Fauber","Very strong new mandate growth that continued from the first quarter into the second quarter, also up versus the prior year quarter, so both on a sequential and a prior year basis. We're now looking at, we now have over 600 new mandates through the first half of the year. We had last year something like 1,040 for the full year of 2017. So a very strong pace in the first half of 2018.","We did get the question earlier about pull-forward. We may have seen a little bit of pull-forward of these first-time mandates into the first half of 2018 from the second half amidst obviously a rising rate environment and spreads no longer narrowing. So there may have been a little bit of pull-forward within the calendar year, but very strong.","The regions outside the U.S. that slowed from what was a pretty torrid pace of growth last year, and interestingly, first time mandates in APAC actually declined in second quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year, and that's primarily as we saw the kind of cooling down of the market conditions for corporate finance in Greater China in the first half of 2018. But overall, a very good story.","Operator","And with no additional questions at this time, Mr. McDaniel, I'll turn things back over to you, sir.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Okay, just want to thank you all again for joining today's call and we look forward to speaking with you in the fall.

At the request of the Company, we will open the conference up for questions and answers following today\u2019s presentation.","I will now turn the conference over to Steve Maire, Global Head of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Steve Maire","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us this teleconference to discuss Moody\u2019s third quarter 2017 results, as well as our current outlook for full year 2017. I am Steve Maire, Global Head of Investor Relations and Communications.","This morning, Moody\u2019s released its results for the third quarter of 2017 as well as our current outlook for full year 2017. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.","Ray McDaniel, Moody\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead this morning\u2019s conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Linda Huber, Moody\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I call your attention to the Safe Harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings release. Today\u2019s remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today\u2019s call.","I\u2019ll begin by summarizing Moody\u2019s third quarter and year-to-date 2017 financial results. Linda will follow with additional third quarter financial details and operating highlights. I will then conclude with comments on our current outlook for 2017. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to respond to your questions.","Before addressing our financial results, I want to begin by saying that we\u2019re pleased to have closed the Bureau van Dijk acquisition and are excited to welcome our new Bureau van Dijk colleagues to Moody\u2019s. While we\u2019ve owned the company for only 12 weeks, our experience thus is far is very positive and the operations of Bureau van Dijk are proving to be in line with our expectations. Our integration efforts are on track and we remain confident about achieving the synergy targets that we communicated when we announced the acquisition.","Starting from this earnings release, results and guidance will include Bureau van Dijk from the August 10th acquisition close date. Also, as we previously communicated, we\u2019re now excluding the amortization of all acquisition-related intangibles from our diluted EPS metric. This includes amortization of intangibles from Bureau van Dijk as well as earlier acquisitions.","In the third quarter, Moody\u2019s achieved a record $1.1 billion in quarterly revenue, up 16% from the third quarter of 2016. Operating expenses for the third quarter totaled $618 million, up 19% of which Bureau van Dijk operating expenses and acquisition-related expenses constituted 8 percentage points. Operating income was $445 million, up 12%, and adjusted operating income of $499 million was up 14%. We are defining adjusted operating income as operating income before depreciation and amortization as well as and Bureau van Dijk acquisition-related expenses. The operating margin was 41.9%, down from 43.3% in the third quarter of 2016. The adjusted operating margin was 46.9%, down from 47.8%.","Moody\u2019s diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.63 per share, up 24% from the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.52, up 10%. Third quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS excludes a $44 million or $0.23 per share gain from a foreign currency hedge associated with the Bureau van Dijk acquisition, $14 million or $0.08 related to the amortization of all acquisition-related intangibles, and $9 million or $0.04 per share of acquisition-related expenses. Third quarter 2016 adjusted diluted EPS excludes $6 million or $0.04 per share related to amortization of all acquisition-related intangibles and $6 million or $0.03 per share from a restructuring charge.","Turning to year-to-date performance. Moody\u2019s revenue for the first nine months of 2017 was $3 billion, up 14% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue was $1.7 billion, up 10%, while non-U.S. revenue was $1.3 billion, up 20%. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. Revenue at Moody\u2019s Investors Service of almost $2.1 billion was up 16% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue was $1.3 billion, up 12%, while non-U.S. revenue was $787 million, up 24%. Revenue at Moody\u2019s Analytics was $990 million, a 10% increase over the prior year period. U.S. revenue of $471 million was up 6%, while non-U.S. revenue of $518 million was up 14%. Excluding Bureau van Dijk, organic MA revenue was $959 million, up 7% from the prior year period.","Operating expenses for the first nine months of 2017 totaled almost $1.7 billion, up 9% from the prior year period of which Bureau van Dijk operating expenses and acquisition-related expenses constituted 3 percentage points. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 1%.","Operating income was $1.3 billion, up 21%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by 1%. Adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion was also up 21%. Moody\u2019s operating margin was 44.3% and adjusted operating margin was 48.4%.","The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2017 was 29%, down from the 31.5% in the prior year period. The decline was primarily due to a non-cash non-taxable gain related to a strategic realignment and expansion involving Moody\u2019s Chinese affiliate, CCXI, as well as a benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard for equity compensation.","Primarily due to the strength of the underlying business performance for the first nine months of the year, we are raising our full year 2017 diluted EPS guidance to a range of $6.18 to $6.33. This range includes the $0.36 per share purchase price hedge gain, $0.31 per share CCXI Gain, a $0.23 per share related to amortization of all acquisition-related intangibles and $0.11 per share of Bureau van Dijk acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these items, we anticipate full-year adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.85 to $6. Both ranges are up approximately $0.50 from prior guidance.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda Huber","Thanks, Ray.","I\u2019ll begin with revenue at the Company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody\u2019s total revenue for the third quarter was a record $1.1 billion, up 16%, U.S. revenue of $588 million was up 8%, non-U.S. revenue of $475 million was up 28% and represented 45% of Moody\u2019s total revenue. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted Moody\u2019s revenue by 1%. Recurring revenue of $535 million was up 16% and represented 50% of total revenue.","Looking now at each of our business is starting with Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $694 million, up 13%., U.S. revenue increased 9% to $428 million, non-U.S. revenue of $267 million was up 21% and represented 38% of total MIS revenue. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted MIS revenue by 1%.","And moving now to the lines of business for MIS. First, corporate finance revenue for the third quarter was $350 million, up 17%. This result reflected strong U.S. investment grade and Asian speculative grade bond issuance as well as a strong contribution from the U.S. rated bank loans. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were each up 17%.","Second, structured finance revenue totaled $128 million, up 23% primarily driven by strong CLO issuance and an increase in U.S. CMBS rated transactions. U.S. and non-U.S. structured finance revenues were up 25% and 19%, respectively.","Third, financial institutions revenue of $102 million was up 7%; this result was largely driven by an increase in banking issuance from infrequent issuers in EMEA. U.S. financial institutions revenue was down 2%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 13%.","Fourth, public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $109.2 million was up 4%. This result was primarily driven by increased infrastructure finance activity in EMEA and Asia, offset by a decrease in U.S. public finance issuance. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was down 16%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 53%.","Finally, MIS other which consists of non-ratings revenue from ICRA in India and Korea Investors Service, contributed $4 million to MIS revenue for third, down 41%, the decline is attributable to the divesture of a non-core subsidiary of ICRA in late 2016.","Turning now to Moody\u2019s Analytics. Total revenue for MA of $369 million was up 21%. U.S. revenue of $161 million was up 4%. Non-U.S. revenue of $208 million was up 38% and represented 56% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted MA revenue by 1%. Excluding Bureau van Dijk, total organic MA revenue for the third quarter of 2017 was $339 million, up 11% from the third quarter of 2016.","Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, research, data and analytics, or RD&A, revenue of $218 million was up 30% and represented 59% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly driven by the addition of Bureau van Dijk as well as strength the credit research and data feeds businesses. U.S. and non-U.S. RD&A revenues were up 7% and 65% respectively. Excluding Bureau van Dijk, global organic RD&A revenue was $188 million, up 12% from the third quarter of 2016. Bureau van Dijk\u2019s revenue contribution for the third quarter was reduced $14 million as a result of a deferred revenue adjustment required as part of acquisition accounting.","Second, enterprise risk solutions or ERS revenue of $113 million was up 11% from the prior-year period. U.S. ERS revenue was down 4%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 21%. Trailing 12 months revenue and sales for ERS increased 6% and 7%, respectively. We continue to make progress on shifting the mix of the ERS business to emphasize higher margin products with trailing 12-month product sales of 17% and services sales down 18%.","Third, professional services revenue of $38 million was up 6%. U.S. and non-U.S. professional services revenue were up 5% and 6%, respectively.","And turning now to operating expenses. Moody\u2019s third quarter operating expenses totaled $618 million, up 19% of which Bureau van Dijk operating expenses and acquisition-related expenses constituted 8 percentage points. The overall increase was primarily attributable to higher accruals for incentive compensation, Bureau van Dijk operating expenses, amortization of intangibles from the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk, and acquisition-related expenses. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible.","As Ray mentioned, Moody\u2019s operating margin was 41.9%, down 140 basis points from 43.3% in the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating margin was 46.9%, down 90 basis points from 47.8%.","Moody\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.4%, up from 30.5% in the prior year period. This increase is primarily due to an increase in the rate of non-U.S. taxes and the tax on the purchase price hedge gain, partially offset by a tax benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard for equity compensation.","And now, I\u2019ll provide an update on capital allocation. During third quarter of 2017, Moody\u2019s repurchased approximately 200,000 shares at a total cost of $29 million for an average cost of $130.75 per share. Moody\u2019s also issued approximately 300,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. Moody\u2019s returned $73 million to its shareholders via dividend payments in the third quarter of 2017; and on October 23rd, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share of Moody\u2019s common stock. This dividend will be payable on December 12, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 21, 2017.","Over the first nine months of 2017, Moody\u2019s repurchased 1.4 million shares at a total cost of $164 million or an average cost of $116.70 per share, and issued approximately 2.2 million shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. Moody\u2019s also returned $218 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the first nine months of 2017. Outstanding shares as of September 30, 2017 totaled 191.1 million, approximately flat to a year-ago. As of September 30, 2017, Moody\u2019s had approximately $600 million of share repurchase authority remaining.","I\u2019ll now walk you through the financing of the Bureau van Dijk acquisition which closed on August 10, 2017 at a purchase price of approximately \u20ac3 billion or US$3.5 billion. Moody\u2019s issued approximately $1.8 billion of debt including $1 billion of notes, a $500 million term loan and $300 million of commercial paper at a combined blended interest rate of approximately 2.6% pretax. The incremental financing expense associated with these items amounted to $0.03 per share in the third quarter. The balance of the purchase price was funded by $1.4 billion of offshore cash, approximately $300 million of U.S. cash on hand, and an approximate $100 million purchase price hedge gain due to the appreciation of the euro from the acquisition announcement date to the close date. At quarter-end, Moody\u2019s had $5.7 billion of outstanding debt and approximately $700 million of additional borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility.","Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter- end were $1.1 billion, with approximately 74% held outside the U.S. Cash flow from operations for the first nine months of 2017 was $343 million, a decline of $889 million from the first nine months of 2016. Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2017 was $273 million, a decline of $804 million from the prior year period. These declines in cash flow were due to payments the Company made in the first quarter of 2017 pursuant to its 2016 settlement with the Department of Justice and various states attorneys general.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ray.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. Thanks, Linda.","I\u2019ll conclude this morning\u2019s prepared comments by discussing the changes to our full-year guidance for 2017. Complete list of Moody\u2019s guidance is included in Table 12 of our third quarter 2017 earnings press release, which can be found on the Moody\u2019s Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.","Moody\u2019s outlook for 2017 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions, and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and the results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.","Our outlook assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.34 to \u00a31 and for the euro of $1.18 to \u20ac1.","Moody\u2019s full year 2017 guidance incorporates Bureau van Dijk\u2019s results starting from the acquisition close date of August 10, 2017. Bureau van Dijk\u2019s revenue contribution for full year 2017 will be reduced by an estimated $39 million, $14 million in the third quarter and an estimated $25 million in the fourth quarter, as a result of a deferred revenue adjustment required as part of the acquisition accounting.","Moody\u2019s now expects full year 2017 diluted EPS to be $6.18 to $6.33, including the purchase price hedge gain, CCXI Gain, amortization of all acquisition-related intangibles and acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these items, full-year 2017 adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be $5.85 to $6.00. Both ranges include an estimated $0.20 per share tax benefit related to the adoption of the new accounting standard for equity compensation.","Moody\u2019s now expects revenue to increase in the low-teens percent range. Operating expenses are now expected to decrease in the 20% to 25% range. Excluding the 2016 settlement and restructuring charges and acquisition-related expenses, adjusted operating expenses are now expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range. Depreciation and amortization expense is now expected to be approximately $160 million. Free cash flow is now expected to be approximately $600 million.","For MIS, Moody\u2019s now expects 2017 revenue to increase in the low-teens percent range. U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range and non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now expected to increase in the low-20s percent range. Structured finance revenue is now expected to increase approximately 10%. Financial institutions revenue is now expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range. Public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to be approximately flat.","For MA, Moody\u2019s now expects 2017 revenue to increase in the low-teens percent range. Non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low-20s percent range. Excluding Bureau van Dijk, MA revenue is still expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range. RD&A revenue is now expected to increase in the low-20s percent range. Excluding Bureau van Dijk, our RD&A revenue is still expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody\u2019s Analytics, and Rob Fauber, President of Moody\u2019s Investors Service. We\u2019ll be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Toni Kaplan at Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","Hi. Good morning. With regard to the latest tax reform proposal, how are you thinking about the change in issuance if interest deductibility is capped at 30% of EBITDA?","Ray McDaniel","I\u2019ll offer some initial comments and my colleagues may wish to add their thoughts as well. I don\u2019t anticipate this is going to make a big difference in issuance levels. Certainly, with the 30% interest deductibility cap, there will be some impact on more speculative grade companies that may reach that cap. But, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to fundamentally change the capital structure or thinking about debt issuance and leverage at these firms. I would also point out that the benefit we would get from moving to a 20% tax rate would be much more substantial than what I would anticipate being any decrease in revenue from reduced debt issuance.","So, I think it\u2019s positive. And we will whether the current form this bill goes through and obviously take close attention to any change that happen along the way. I\u2019d also note that I look favorably at the five-year carry-forward that\u2019s been proposed as part of this, in terms mitigating any changes in the attractiveness of debt assurance.","Linda Huber","Toni, it\u2019s Linda and [indiscernible] after me. I think we do want to make sure that everyone continues to understand the 20% proposed corporate tax rate would be dramatically beneficial for Moody\u2019s if in fact that rate did come to pass. To think about the math, everyone should look at 1% decrease in our estimated tax rate, would be $0.07 to $0.08 in EPS. So, please use whatever rate you would like to, but in any case that would be quite a wind at our back because we\u2019re a pretty full tax payer.","Toni Kaplan","And just wanted to ask, you had a great quarter in ratings, but it looked like the incremental margins on MIS were a little bit lower than prior quarters. And I think in the release, you mentioned an increase in incentive comp accruals as one of the drivers. Are there other drivers to call out, and could you give you the incentive comp expense for the quarter? Thanks.","Linda Huber","As you see, we\u2019ve increased guidance pretty significantly at this point in the year. That requires that we have a catch-up in terms of our percentage completion of our performance on that new target. For the corporation as a whole, we\u2019ve adjusted incentive compensation. We had to add $35.6 million to that amount. That includes incentive compensation. And then, in salaries and benefit, we\u2019ve also had to add approximately $22 million; this will include about $5 million we\u2019re thinking of global profit sharing for the firm. And I\u2019ll let Rob talk to the question on the MIS margin.","Rob Fauber","Yes. That is right, Linda. The growth in MIS expenses, as Linda said, primarily due to the higher incentive comp accruals. If you look at our year-to-date adjusted operating margin versus prior year, you\u2019ll see about 300 basis points of margin expansion. And taking account of the catch-up accrual for incentive comp that Linda talked and last year\u2019s restructuring charge that you can see, our adjusted operating margins is largely consistent -- for the third quarter is largely consistent with that year-to-date figure.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Alex Kramm at UBS.","Alex Kramm","Just maybe just to come back on the tax side, again. Thanks for the color. We know this is obviously early days, we\u2019ll see what changes. But like, when you mentioned Ray on the spec rate side there could be some impact, do you have some more like numbers you can share with us like when you look at your rated debt today, how many of those companies would be hitting those thresholds? And then secondarily on the taxes, are there other things that you didn\u2019t mention to the earlier question that we should be thinking about? For example, yesterday, private equity companies got pretty hard in the market because there\u2019s some worry. Obviously, those are big users of debt as [ph] the companies private et cetera. Is that something we should be thinking about as well?","Ray McDaniel","Well, just in terms of the overall outlook, as we\u2019re looking at the end of this year and going into next year, we obviously have some movements or anticipated movements in official rates. But, the spreads remain tight. And in fact, the default rate forecast is for the default rate to be declining over the next 12 months, which should further encourage tight spreads. So, there\u2019s some -- there are some good news items around the debt issuance profile, even as we look at potentially rising rate environment and as we look at coming off very fulsome years for debt issuance, both in the bond and loan sectors. So, I\u2019m not anticipating that either the tax reform or other conditions in the market are going to be generating a strong directional change in 2018 issuance. So, I don\u2019t have anything else I can add on the tax reform proposal itself, but that would be a more general outlook.","Linda Huber","And Alex, just to give you some view -- our view on the high yield default rates, the one year forecast as of the end of September, globally, high yield default rates of 1.9%, U.S. 2.3%, and euro view [ph] 1.3%. So, again pretty benign outlook there on high yield default rate.","Alex Kramm","Okay, good. Thank you. And then just secondly on BVD. You put out that 8-K last week, the confusion with some of these numbers and I think some people wondered if there is some seasonally in that business. So, maybe, can you just talk about how that business is tracking, now that you own it? How we should be thinking about, maybe not just the fourth quarter but also how the year next year progresses, is a steady increasing business or is there seasonality? And then, a very quick one, on the amortization add back, [ph] what\u2019s the amortization add back [ph] in EPS points for the fourth quarter, because I can\u2019t really make sense of the 23 for the full year?","Linda Huber","Okay. So, the way we\u2019re going to deal with this, Alex, is Mark is going to speak first about the view of the growth -- view on the outlook for the business and how we\u2019re doing. And I\u2019m going to take care of some housekeeping on the exciting topics of deferred revenue haircut and conversion from such difference to U.S. GAAP. But before that, Mark has a good part. So, Mark, go ahead.","Mark Almeida","Alex, the BVD business is performing very, very well, very much in line with our expectations, as Ray said. I think probably, the most informative thing you might do is look at the amount of revenue we recognized for that business in the third quarter, carrying in mind, we only had seven weeks of the business and add back in the deferred revenue adjustment. And then, if you annualize that number, you get a very nice number that I think will compare very favorably to what we showed in that 8-K filing. So, I think if you do that math, you\u2019ll see some very nice acceleration in revenue growth. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019re already very engaged with the business and working on a number of new sales opportunities, new product development opportunities. So, everything is going very, very well from an operational standpoint, and we remain very enthusiastic about the business.","Ray McDaniel","One specific I would just add is that I don\u2019t think we see a lot of seasonality in the business, there is some, but not a lot of seasonality, to answer the specific question you were asking. Sorry, Linda.","Linda Huber","Okay. So, accounting class begins now. Deferred revenue haircut. So, the first part of this is, this was fully expected and the adjustment is required by acquisition accounting. It gets amortized as a revenue reduction over the remaining period of customer contracts that were inherited as of the acquisition date. So, this is going to affect us in 2017 and to some extent into 2018. So, what we need to do is fair value all the assets and the liabilities acquired. And the fair value of the deferred revenue is the cost to sell [ph] those contracts plus a reasonable profit margin. So, the total estimated impact, the total deferred revenue haircut is expected to be about $52 million. And as a result, BVD\u2019s revenue contribution will be reduced by about $39 million for this year and an estimated $13 million, which will continue through August of next year for fiscal year 2018. The quarterly impact is $14 million in Q3 and $25 million in Q4. The percent impact for PP&A, Alex, is $0.04.","Alex Kramm","Excellent. Sorry, keep going.","Linda Huber","Okay. So, part two, transitioning from Dutch IFRS to U.S. GAAP, we had to do a couple of things. These have no impact on the economic value of the business, nor how it\u2019s doing. We had to capitalize software and income taxes. And that requires a higher hurdle under U.S. GAAP; and income taxes, we had to put up a small reserve for uncertain tax positions, and that is not required under IFRS. So, those two things, small accounting changes, but that\u2019s it. Anything else we can do for you?","Alex Kramm","No, I think I got plenty. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Manav Patnaik at Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Linda, maybe just to continue that. The margin profile on BVD, I mean, in the past you -- in the presentation, you talked about that being north of 50% on the IFRS standards. So, can you maybe just give us a little accounting on how that gets impacted for year one? And I\u2019m guessing there is just -- I guess, what I\u2019m assuming is there is a natural step down from the 51% because of that expense change and then there\u2019s probably another step down for year one, because of the deferred revenue change. So, maybe just some color there?","Linda Huber","Sure. So, what\u2019s happening is the EBITDA margin under U.S. GAAP is 44%; previously, we\u2019ve spoken about approximately 51%. Those are counting adjustments; they don\u2019t reflect any change in the underlying operating performance of the business. And Mark may want to speak some more about that.","Mark Almeida","I\u2019d only say that what Linda said is correct. There is some accounting phenomena that we\u2019re reporting here but the economics of the business are very much in line with what we expected and what we talked about when we announced the acquisition.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. And then, Ray, you talked about obviously 2018, not having much of an impact from the current proposed the tax reforms. I was just curious, if you had a longer term view. I guess, a lot of the stuff that we\u2019re reading from our credit analysts in-house and the papers and so forth, as you know the reduction in the tax rate, some of the deductibility, et cetera, et cetera will lower leverage and so, probably, over a decade close that reduction. Do you view that or is that something else to do that from your point of view?","Ray McDaniel","The interest deductibility cap first of all should have essentially no impact on the investment grade sector, and should not have a significant impact for the higher rated portion of the speculative grade sector. So, it\u2019s real, when you get more deeply into speculative grade that those was caps may make a difference. And that\u2019s a part of the market that tends to be quite cyclical anyway. I would also -- I would say that a strong economic environment, where firms are investing back in their business are identifying opportunities for growth, is a positive environment, not only for those firms but for the rating side of the business as well. So, if we have an environment in which firms are on their front foot in terms of thinking about growth and investment, mergers and acquisitions et cetera, I think that\u2019s going to be a benign to positive environment for the ratings part of our business.","Linda Huber","Manav, it\u2019s Linda. I wanted to just go back to your earlier part of the question on BVD and its performance, further wanted to add, we have talked about $45 million in synergies forward by 2019, $80 million in synergies by 2021. We view that we are on track with those synergies. And Mark, may want to speak a little bit more about some of the things that we\u2019re working, on that front.","Mark Almeida","Yes. We\u2019re making very good progress on both expense and revenue synergies. We\u2019re already very engaged from a sales perspective. We\u2019ve won business together with customers in multiple parts of the world. We\u2019ve displaced a competitor recently with a joint selling effort in the Middle East. BVD closed its largest-ever sale in the United States last month. And we\u2019ve got new product development activities going on jointly. So, we feel good about what\u2019s happening from a revenue and sales perspective. On the expense side, we\u2019re making good progress on realizing expense synergies. We\u2019re consolidating office locations. We\u2019re already co-located in New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong, and we\u2019re moving forward with other offices as well. So, I think both, on the revenue and the expense side, we are very much on track to deliver on the synergies that we talked about.","Linda Huber","Yes. And I would add, I\u2019m very pleased with Mark and his team. We\u2019re coming in a little bit lighter on the acquisition and integration -- on the integration costs than we had expected. And in order that everyone can model this appropriately, I want to make very clear, in terms of the entirety of the Bureau van Dijk acquisition. Purchase price amortization associated with the entire deal will be $1.3 billion, annual amortization expense is $70 million per year and total annual amortization expense is $95 million from all of our legacy acquisitions. And in a minute, if someone is interested, I\u2019ll walk through the guidance change and the different components of that. I expect we\u2019ll get to another question on that. So with that Manav, anything further or we\u2019ll move on to another question.","Manav Patnaik","I\u2019ll wait for someone to ask the question you want them to ask and take it down.","Linda Huber","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Anj Singh at Credit Suisse.","Anj Singh","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you give us a sense of what pieces of your guidance are benefitting or taking it from FX moves versus last quarter? Just trying to see how the expectations for the underlying strength may have changed on a constant currency basis.","Linda Huber","Sure. So, we have a special bonus slide here in terms of looking at what is going on with our guidance, and let me step through this. So, that slide should be up right now, if you\u2019re looking at the webcast. So, we had started with full year 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance of a range of $5.35 to $5.50. We have noted that we have now -- we have the addition of legacy amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and that is $0.12 for the change in guidance for this year or it accounts for about 25% of the $0.50 step up in terms of our guidance. The legacy MCO business weighted pretty heavily toward the MIS business that\u2019s given us about $0.28 of the guidance increase. And again, that\u2019s about 55% of this amount. So, you should very much expect that that part of the business has driven the majority of this increase in guidance. And then, lastly, Bureau van Dijk\u2019s performance adds about $0.10 in terms of what we\u2019re looking for on the addition to the guidance this year or about 20% of that step up. All together, if you add those, you get to about $0.50. The new range is $5.85 to $6 and we\u2019ve got a couple of footnotes here in terms of things that have been included. And I think we\u2019ve got about $0.04 of FX impact in here, and the accounting team is nodding. So, that\u2019s good. So, it has a minimal effect in terms of the $0.50 increase, so less, certainly than 10% in this, increase is attributable to FX.","Anj Singh","And then for a second question on RD&A, looking at your guidance, seems to imply some continued acceleration on an organic basis for 4Q. And I know last quarter, you folks have been a bit measured on the characterization of the improvement that was happening in that business last quarter. So, any updated thoughts on the go forward outlook and any color you can share there?","Ray McDaniel","I would just say that you\u2019re right. We\u2019ve had acceleration in RD&A in the third quarter. And if you look at where our guidance was for RD&A before the Bureau van Dijk acquisition that would imply that we\u2019d have continued acceleration into the fourth quarter. So, that remains our view. And the business is performing well, we\u2019re pleased by what\u2019s happening there, and we expect to carry on and deliver good results there.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Tim McHugh at William Blair.","Tim McHugh","Just want to ask about the international part of the credit rating business. It\u2019s been very strong I guess all year, but you\u2019ve been asked this throughout the year, but just revisiting. How much do you put on secular [technical difficult] in that piece versus I guess just favorable conditions or as well as I guess currency helping you there?","Ray McDaniel","Rob, do you want to take that?","Rob Fauber","I\u2019ll just talk a little bit also about kind of the components of this very strong non-U.S. growth story because I think it\u2019s a mix of some of the factors that you cited. Specifically, this quarter, we had much stronger revenue growth outside the U.S. We had real strength in Asian corporate and infrastructure. Obviously, the Asian corporate story importantly, part of that is China, we think that is a long-term trend; that surge we\u2019re seeing in infrastructure issuance also something that I think would be a longer term secular trend. Europe, we saw real strength across the board, across all of our fundamental franchise, and we\u2019re seeing reduced geopolitical risk there, and steady economic recovery. So, again, I think that will contribute to I think very constructive market conditions overall.","Linda Huber","Tim, if you want -- it\u2019s Linda, I\u2019ll step through the market here that we get from the investment banks, just so everybody can think about this a little bit. Again, these are from some of the major investment and commercial banks that we talk to and that this might not align with Moody\u2019s revenue characterizations. But for investment grade bonds so far this year we\u2019ve seen $1.1 trillion in issuance; that\u2019s year-to-date. And the view for the year is flat to up 5%. You\u2019ll recall, when we started last year, the view for this year was supposed to be flat to down 10. So, I would strongly urge that everybody think about that these early estimates for the coming years are often directionally pretty far off from where we end up.","Commenting on what banks are seeing now, investment grade bond issuance remains on pace, October issuance of $120 billion was the largest October on record. November is expected to be greater than $75 billion. Spreads remain three-year tight, and the current state of the market is robust. For high yield bonds, $250 billion of issuance this year, up 10% to 15% for the full year expected. High yield bond issuance remains substantially above last year\u2019s levels. Similar to investment grade market, high yield spreads are near three-year right, low volatility in the face of everything going on geopolitically. That\u2019s contributed to an issuer-friendly environment. And we talked about the relatively reasonable, maybe even benign default outlook for high yield for the coming year.","Leveraged loans, this is the start of the show, $550 billion so far this year, up 40% is expected for the full year 2017. Leveraged loan market conditions are very strong with the benign outlook on the prospect for rising rates, heavy refinancing and re-pricing activity as issuers capitalize on strong investor demand and CLO issuance is at $90 billion, which is up 80% year-to-date. Headed over to Europe, same view again, this is the coming from the banks, investment grade. We\u2019ve seen a busy period of investment grade and bond issuance. We expect -- they expect that for the remainder of the year, spreads and rates remain near historic lows. There are positive investor fund flows. The European central bank has talked about lengthy period for QE. And Eurozone GDP growth is running at the fastest pace in seven years and that will also continue to support the market despite that the inflation has been quite quiet. Bank of England raised rates yesterday, the first time in a decade but indicated that another rate increase isn\u2019t imminent due to concerns around the potential impact of Brexit.","And on secular trend in Europe, general market sentiment remains very positive with the strong pipeline across both, high yield bonds and leverage loans. Credit spreads continue to compress, and that\u2019s offering issuers record low rates. We would also note that U.S. rates are a good deal above European and other rates, which may serve to keep a bit of ceiling on U.S. rates. We also note a new nominee as the Fed head. We\u2019re well were that the forward covers right now are showing us that the probably of December 17 rate hike is about 88%. So, we will see where that goes. And again, the views particularly on the spread front at very attractive level. Don\u2019t know if Rob wants to say any more about that but I think that pretty much caps what the banks are seeing in terms of issuance.","Rob Fauber","Yes. The only other thing I would add Linda is obviously recent announcement by the ECB with the planned reduction of their asset purchases and I think our view is that it\u2019s a pretty gradual stuff towards eventually normalized monetary conditions. And we expect that the impact on market financing conditions will be moderate at most. And as Linda said, they have also signaled they intend to kind of hold on rates beyond the monetary stimulus program. So that will continue to support some attractive issuance conditions combined with economic growth in many parts of Europe.","Tim McHugh","And just one follow-up on BVD. Linda, you gave some helpful kind of bridge in terms of the profit margin versus what we might have thought before for that business. What about versus that 8-K but it was like $70 million per quarter or kind $140 million of revenue? And then, Mark\u2019s approach, he encouraged us to use one in five, [ph] more than $80 million on a run rate. Is there something different versus that statement I guess or that 8-K that we looked at versus what you will now see can bridge that at all for us?","Linda Huber","Sure, I\u2019ll let Mark talk about that.","Mark Almeida","Tim, it\u2019s Mark. I think the difference is, we\u2019re seeing acceleration in the sales performance of the business, which is slowing through the revenue over time. So, I think that\u2019s basically what\u2019s going on. The second half of last year was a little light from a sales perspective and that flowed into first half revenue in 2017. But as I said, we\u2019re seeing acceleration, significant acceleration. And that\u2019s what I think explains the difference between what you saw in the 8-K and what we\u2019re talking about today.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Joseph Foresi at Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. Another BVD question for you. You talked about the business performing well and maybe even a couple of takeaways. Can you just maybe dive in a little bit deeper into those takeaways? What\u2019s causing them, why would someone switch away from their other vendor and do you expect more of those to come?","Mark Almeida","What I was referring to was we\u2019ve had a couple of situations already where we\u2019ve gone to customers with a joint product offering. So, BVD product together with the Moody\u2019s Analytics product just offering a more complete or more comprehensive solution to customers\u2019 information needs. And I mean, frankly, that was part of the one of the important premises of the acquisition was that we thought there were opportunities for us to do that, and so we\u2019re seeing that. So, by joining our product offerings together, we\u2019re finding that we\u2019re able to meet a broader set of needs or broader set of customers. And as a result, we\u2019re able to displace some competitors. So, we\u2019ve had a couple of examples of that already. And it\u2019s still early days. We think there is a lot more opportunities there for us.","Joseph Foresi","Got it.","Linda Huber","And Joe, let me explain just one of the things. The 8-K that couple of people have mentioned, that 8-K is a bit of an unusual formatting of looking at numbers. And it is by regulation, required to be, BVD management\u2019s projections from their audited 2016 financial statements, which you\u2019ll recall are in a different -- they\u2019re in Dutch IFRS, we\u2019re in U.S. GAAP. And our growth expectations you\u2019ll recall, we have revenue synergies as well that we are looking at. So, when you add those synergies in, you can get to the bridge between the two. And as we said before, we still expect those synergies to come along, as Mark has said. So, I just want to make sure that that is well understood.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. My second question is just on 2018. It sounds like you\u2019re fairly comfortable with the impact of what the tax reform will be and issuance. It sounds like you got a ticker in Analytics business with BVD. So, I guess I\u2019m wondering what areas or what do you think are the great unknown as you head into next year, particularly on the margin side but a little bit on the demand front as well, what are you concerned about? Thanks.","Ray McDaniel","Rob, why don\u2019t you tackle what you\u2019re seeing on the rating side and then Linda can jump in.","Rob Fauber","Yes. I\u2019ll provide a balanced answer here with both some of the support as well as some of the risk. So, we plan to provide a view on 2018 on our 4Q earnings call, as we always do. And that allows us account for Christmas [ph] through the end of the year and other factors like Wall Street estimates and updated macro assumptions. But that said, we certainly see some themes that will shape our outlook. And Ray\u2019s touched on a few of these. But, we see support for issuance growth coming from a number of factors that includes economic growth, continued M&A volumes, modest geopolitical risks, improving commodity prices in a low and actually declining, as Ray and Linda pointed to declining default environment. And, we continue to enjoy some very constructive market conditions; Linda touched on that. And we think that should carry over in to next year.","The question marks for us as we look into next year. Asia\u2019s ability to grow off of a very robust issuance growth in 2017, further growth in the U.S. investment grid sector off some very robust recent levels, the potential of deceleration of reifi activity that we\u2019ve seen in 2017, particularly in the bank loan space, and whether we will see an improvement in U.S. public finance refunding activity, which has been down pretty sharply throughout this year. The last thing I would point to is just the potential increase in volatility poses a risk. If you think about this past year, we really didn\u2019t see any kind of shutdowns, market shutdowns where the market closed for one or two weeks. And so, if we were to see that that would obviously provide some downside.","Linda Huber","Sure. And Joe, we\u2019re not going to be brave enough to forecast an estimated tax rate for next year, yet. We\u2019re working with about 30% for this year. And again, if we do see any reduction in the tax rate, again, $0.07 to $0.08 for each percentage that the tax rate -- corporate tax rate might come down, that would be a benefit to us, if that does in fact happen.","We would note that we continue to have the ability to price, and we do insist on value for our issuers in terms of price, but the 3% to 4% view continues. And we would also note that growth and interest rate increases are not necessarily a bad condition for Moody\u2019s. We\u2019ve often shown that in 2008-2009 and 2012-2013, when interest rates went up more than 100 basis points during those year-long periods, MIS\u2019s revenue in fact increased. And if we do see some growth in the economy, we may see some increase in issuance for capital expenditures, which has really been lacking as the use of proceeds. In recent years, we\u2019ve been working mostly on refinancing and also payments to shareholders, as well as M&A activity. So, we would love to see a broadening in use of proceeds. And again, as rates move up, as has been speculated about, that is not necessarily a negative condition for Moody\u2019s if that is brought about by strong or good growth in the economy. And Ray may have some other thoughts.","Ray McDaniel","I think that\u2019s pretty comprehensive. So, why don\u2019t we see what other questions we got?","Joseph Foresi","Great.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Craig Huber at Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes. Hi. Couple of questions. How would you characterize the M&A environment here in the U.S. and Europe today versus a year ago?","Ray McDaniel","It\u2019s been pretty good. We obviously had a period of very heavy M&A volume in really in last couple of years. I would anticipate the M&A environment to remain positive as companies are enjoying economic growth and thinking about investment and building out their businesses. So, I think we should be looking at a good environment for M&A on a going forward basis.","Mark Almeida","The only other thing I\u2019d add to that Ray, obviously, we\u2019ve got a robust equity market, which I think will be healthy for M&A. And M&A has become an increasingly important driver of some of the recent bank loan activity that we\u2019ve been seeing, as we\u2019ve been seeing the modest deceleration in some of that refi activity.","Ray McDaniel","And some of that may convert over to bond activity.","Craig Huber","And I also wanted to ask, obviously, every year there\u2019s some degree of pull forward for refinancings and stuff. How would you characterize that for your book of business this year? I mean, how much should we -- you feel that\u2019s borrowed for the future years, how much more so than usual?","Ray McDaniel","Well, in terms of pull forward from 2018, I think that has been very strong. So, a lot of maturing debt for 2018 has been part of the 2017 story. What we\u2019re looking at though is, again, a substantial build of the refinancing walls, each year. So, the fact that 2018 now doesn\u2019t have much refinancing in its profile, we look to 2019, 2020, and the walls build every year, from 2018 out. So, it really becomes I think more of a question of will firms seek opportunistically to pull forward from multi-year refinancing walls. And that is what we\u2019ve been seeing to-date, I think. But, we\u2019ll have to keep an eye on whether that\u2019s going to continue to characterize the refinancing profile going forward.","Craig Huber","Just a quick housekeeping question, if I may. Linda, the incentive compensation for the first three quarters this year, what was it each quarter? And I was just -- I think you said $20 million profit share. And is that included in the number you\u2019re going to give us, or how does that break into the wall here?","Linda Huber","Profit sharing goes in the salary line. So, for the year, if you look at profit sharing, the numbers that we put up, sequentially for first quarter, we went $52 million; second quarter, $51 million; and then, the number pops up to $78.4 million for the third quarter. And we\u2019re thinking for the fourth quarter, if we had to eyeball this, Craig, the team is thinking 60ish, depending on whether we have another very strong quarter in the fourth quarter that would take us beyond the guidance we\u2019ve just given you, could be higher, but 60ish, given what we\u2019re seeing right now. So, hope that\u2019s helpful to you.","Craig Huber","Is it 20 in those numbers, Linda?","Linda Huber","The 20\u2026.","Ray McDaniel","The profit sharing was 5...","Linda Huber","Again, that\u2019s in the salary and ben line. So, we do have that in already. Yes.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jeff Silber at BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","I know it\u2019s late. I got a couple of numbers questions. Linda, I know you\u2019re dying to talk about the amortization but I\u2019m not going to go there unless you\u2019d really want to. Just in terms of the calculation of the adjusted diluted EPS. Is it possible to give it what it was historically for 4Q 2016 and for 2016, just so we know what the base we\u2019re looking at?","Linda Huber","I think we don\u2019t really want to go into historical pro forma here, if that\u2019s okay.","Ray McDaniel","I think it would -- I don\u2019t have the number in front of me. But, I think you would just be looking at what the legacy purchase price amortization would be as an add-on to the existing adjusted numbers. But, I don\u2019t have that number in front of me.","Jeff Silber","So, let me ask the question another way. If I\u2019m looking at growth in adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter, how do you think that will compare to the year-over-year growth we just saw in the third quarter?","Linda Huber","I\u2019m not sure we want to give guidance on the fourth quarter specifically, Jeff. I think we\u2019re viewing that. We will probably be up from last year\u2019s fourth quarter for the rating agencies, but potentially, sequentially down from this year. I think Rob, may have some more color, he wants to give you on that. Mark may want to get some color on MA. But, I\u2019m not sure we want to get all the way into quarterly guidance for the fourth quarter. Rob, is that about directionally correct?","Rob Fauber","Yes. That\u2019s exactly right, Linda.","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. I want to ask a fourth quarter question, how about a 2017 question, what should we be modeling for interest expense for the year?","Linda Huber","Sure. I can get that for you in just a second. And anticipating the expense ramp question, we would expect that excluding the BVD, the first quarter to the fourth quarter expense ramp would be $55 million to $65 million. We had had a lower number obviously when we talked with you before. If you include BVD, the expense ramp is $120 million to $130 million. Both of those numbers are up from $40 million to $50 million previously. We have the addition of BVD, we have the incentive compensation. And so, I just want to make sure everybody can model that correctly. And, did you want the full 2017 financing cost or do you want the quarter?","Jeff Silber","I\u2019ll take whatever you want to give us.","Linda Huber","Okay. So, year-to-date, the financing costs, the expense on the borrowing running about a $140 million; and for the quarter -- we have the schedule in the earnings release, if you want to take a look at it, it\u2019s about $49 million. ","Jeff Silber","I\u2019m sorry I missed that. Thanks so much.","Linda Huber","Okay.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll hear from Conor Fitzgerald at Goldman Sachs. ","Conor Fitzgerald","Hi. Good morning. I just want to talk about the longer term trajectory of margins in Moody\u2019s Analytics. Where do you think that could track over the next couple of years, now that you\u2019ve closed BVD?","Ray McDaniel","Sure Mark you want to take that?","Mark Almeida","Sure. Well, I think you really have to decompose that into two pieces. We have to think about the trajectory of margins for the legacy business and then think about what the impact of BVD is? We\u2019ve talked about work that we\u2019re doing to drive margin expansion in the legacy business, principally by expanding the profitability in the ERS segment. We are continuing to make progress on that, we delivered good results in the quarter. The margin expansion, you saw in the quarter, about half of that was due to BVD and the other half was organic. And that\u2019s true, if you look at the nine-month margin expansion in MA as well. So, we\u2019ve got a plan, we\u2019re executing on the plan, and we\u2019re continuing to see the kinds of results there that we expected, and we\u2019ll continue to pursue those efforts over the coming quarters and years.","Then separately, you\u2019ve got the Bureau van Dijk effect. That\u2019s a high margin business. It\u2019s going to be accretive to the MA margin. And so, we expect that that\u2019s going to be a boost to profitability in Moody\u2019s Analytics. So, we\u2019ve got two things going on, both of them I think are moving us in a very positive direction, and we\u2019ll continue to pursue our efforts on both sides.","Conor Fitzgerald","Got it, thanks. And then, I appreciate your comments around the 30% cap on interest flexibility will have much of an impact. Can you give us a sense around how sensitive you think the market is, if that cap declined to say 25%?","Ray McDaniel","Obviously, you\u2019re starting to work your way up into higher speculative grade issuers, if you\u2019re 25% or 20%. So, I can\u2019t quantify that for you. But, yes, you are obviously going to be moving up toward the investment grade market, as hypothetical caps come down.","Linda Huber","Conor, we would point that Germany, and I believe the UK is working on the 30% EBITDA cap. So that is somewhat of the view that is looked upon in other countries, maybe where that prospective number has come from.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Bill Warmington at Wells Fargo.","Bill Warmington","Good afternoon, everyone. And first of all, welcome to Steve Maire. I think that Salli got the better side of that job. So, a couple of questions on BVD, if I may. The first is, you mentioned the revenue deceleration -- growth deceleration in 2016 and 2017, and then the reacceleration in 2017. And I wanted to ask, if you changed anything in the sales force structure organization that was helping to drive that?","Mark Almeida","The short answer, Bill, is no. What we\u2019re talking about here, these were things that really predated our involvement in Bureau van Dijk. They had discontinued a product and began to build a new product to replace it, which we are actually working with them on and helping bring a better product to the market. The effect of that has been -- was elevated attrition in the legacy product, which having work through that, we\u2019re now seeing the business begin to accelerate. So, what we\u2019re observing here didn\u2019t really have anything to do with our acquisition of the company. It was a historical thing that we were aware of and prepared for as we got involved with the company.","Bill Warmington","You mentioned some early revenue synergies that you\u2019re seeing taking place. I want to ask about Orbis Bank Focus, and that\u2019s one that I\u2019ve heard talked about as potentially being a viable or alternative to S&P Global\u2019s SNL?","Mark Almeida","Yes. That\u2019s right. Again, that\u2019s a product that we are working together with Bureau van Dijk, on. We\u2019ve got a lot of experience in that area working with the rating agency in providing very extensive statistical coverage for rated banks. We know from talking to our customers that there is demand for alternative products that would cover a much larger universe of banks. Bureau van Dijk had started to build out a product for that market. We\u2019re now working together with them to build out what we think will be a better product and we will be coming to market with that product shortly. So, that is an important product development synergy for us.","Operator","We will go next to Vincent Hung at Autonomous.","Vincent Hung","Hi. Maybe I missed this. Can you talk about the source of the strength in professional services? ","Linda Huber","Mark will speak to professional services.","Mark Almeida","Yes. You\u2019re right. We were up in professional services this quarter for the first time in a while frankly. And it was attributable to strength in both of our professional services businesses. Both, our financial training and certification business did well and was up in the quarter as was the Moody\u2019s Analytics knowledge service businesses, our India outsourced research and analytics unit. So, both of those businesses had a string of difficult quarters but have made some very good progress. We think we\u2019ve turned things around in both of those areas. And we\u2019re hopeful that the third quarter results are something that we\u2019re going to be able to continue over the coming quarters as well.","Vincent Hung","And the announced a couple of investments in last couple of weeks in CompStak SecurityScorecard. Could you just talk about these? And also, should we be expecting a lot more of these smaller strategic investments?","Ray McDaniel","I\u2019ll let Rob talk about our interest in couple of these areas and Mark as well. But, as a broad comment, we\u2019re looking at both, adjacent kinds of assessments businesses and adjacent asset classes. Those would be two ways I might think of categorizing where we would investment and where we have interest. And I\u2019ll turn it over to my collogues, more specially on these couple of investments.","Rob Fauber","Yes. In the examples, SecurityScorecard, we saw that as an opportunity to gain some exposure to a growing and very relevant space, cyber security and cyber ratings where ultimately, we think we may be able to partner to add value to both their business and ours.","Mark Almeida","With CompStak, that\u2019s a company that we think is doing some very creative work with advanced technologies to solve a longstanding information transparency problem in commercial real estate market. And as we\u2019ve been quite involved and quite interested in commercial real estate from a couple of different perspectives for some time, we\u2019re very enthusiastic about using their data to expand our product offering for that market. So, the CompStak opportunity is an exciting and an interesting one for us. As far as the likelihood of our doing more of these, I mean, I think these are situations that we generally look at opportunistically. When there is an opportunity to get involved with a company that\u2019s doing interesting work in a market that is attractive to us. We\u2019ll pursue that, but -- and I\u2019m not sure I would characterize this as a fundamental strategy; it\u2019s just something that we want to be thoughtful and creative about.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Peter Appert at Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert","Thanks. So, on the MIS margins, performance has been pretty impressive here in 2017, obviously. And I\u2019m wondering about your confidence and the sustainability of the margin leverage in the context of what could be slower revenue growth in 2018?","Linda Huber","Peter, it\u2019s Linda. I\u2019m going to let Rob get warmed up here. But, I\u2019d probably have to get out some of these drag points that we have, just to make sure that everybody understands what\u2019s happening in MIS. I\u2019m going to ask Rob to touch on the fact that we\u2019ve had 6% recurring revenue growth in MIS and Rob can talk about that. So, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re happy with. Secondly, he\u2019s been shy so far to talk about the new mandates we\u2019ve seen in the third quarter of 2017. He\u2019s got 264 new mandates, up 18% from the third quarter of last year; that\u2019s a 40% increase in the year-to-date period. And he\u2019s got expectation for more than 900 new mandates for the full year of 2017. So, with that preamble, I\u2019ll let Rob pick it up from here.","Rob Fauber","Yes. That\u2019s right. Maybe one other interesting point around first time mandate is that -- and this maybe get us back to Tim\u2019s question around the outlook for Asia over the longer term, but, first on mandates out of Asia. Through the year-to-date period or now, within 20% of what we\u2019ve seen in the United States, a very strong story around disintermediation and new issuers coming to the market.","Look, on expenses, I think generally, the margin profile I think is sustainable. On one hand, we have to continue to make investments in the business. Obviously, we\u2019ve had a lot of issuance volume. It helps when that issuance volume is in the form of refinancing activity. But, we\u2019re constantly looking at ways that we can continue to drive efficiency across MIS as well.","Ray McDaniel","I would just add, we\u2019ve talked about this before. But, while the new rating mandates do not generally drive the highest margin component of the ratings business, they are a very high quality source of revenue, because it establishes new relationships and translates over time into monitoring fees and additional ratings. So, that\u2019s really I think the best quality revenue that we get as those new rating relationships. ","Peter Appert","Got it. Thank you. And then, Linda, can you just remind me in terms of the plan around repurchase? I know you\u2019ve dialed it back obviously because of the incremental debt load. But, when does it get dialed back out?","Linda Huber","Sure. Peter, we\u2019ve said for 2017 and we also expect for 2018 to have share repurchase fee about $200 million. And we\u2019re on pace for that for 2017. We\u2019ve made commitments that we\u2019re going to delever back to more normalized level, reflecting our BBB plus rating and we\u2019re on path to do that as well. So, we\u2019ll hope to get to around, and this is an approximate number, $200 million this year, Peter. And we are we\u2019re right now thinking about $200 million for next year to honor our commitments on deleveraging.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy at Raymond James. ","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Hey. So, credit spreads and credit market volatility are basically at record lows around the globe. Does your research team chop most of this up to low default rates that you talked about earlier or are there other factors that play like Central Bank bond buying? And as some of that bond buying might wind down in the future, maybe we see spreads and volatility pick back up.","Ray McDaniel","Yes. I think you\u2019re exactly right. There is no one factor that is driving the narrow credit spreads that we\u2019re seeing. I do think the low default rate environment and low default rate expectation going forward is a central component. But in terms of looking at supply-demand, what\u2019s happened -- happening with Central Banks and government involvement in the markets, you would have to also consider that as a factor.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Fair enough. And then for my follow-up. President Trump\u2019s nominated the next Fed Chairperson has been a pretty vocal champion of GSE reform in the past. To what extent would his confirmation change your view on the likelihood of GSE reform and maybe potential upside in RMBS?","Ray McDaniel","I\u2019ve been -- this is not a corporate view, it\u2019s a personal view. I\u2019ve been pessimistic about the likelihood of substantial reform of the GSEs. I may be surprised with the new Fed Chair. But, at the moment, I\u2019m going to maintain my existing opinion.","Operator","We have no additional questions at this time. Mr. McDaniel, I\u2019ll turn the program back over to you, sir.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. Let me just turn to Linda for one second.","Linda Huber","Yes, sure. I just wanted to for all you accounting fans out there, make sure that everyone knows that they should take a look at our purchase price amortization tables in the 10-Q which will be release shortly. And also, we had received a question regarding the new rule standard 606, as far as a housekeeping matter I wanted to touch on. We note that we may have some accounting -- some balance sheet adjustments in the first quarter of 2018. You will see an estimate as to what we think about that in the 10-Q that we\u2019re about to release. We don\u2019t think that that will have a material impact on 2018 but we have to continue to do our work. We do see that standard 606 still may introduce a bit of quarterly volatility, but over the full year should not be material. And again, you\u2019ll see that some companies including us will have some estimate ranges in this quarter\u2019s Q. You should take a look at that. And as you have further questions, we\u2019ll have more to state about that as we go into the first quarter of next year, but just wanted to call that out for everyone who is thinking about that revenue recognition standard 606.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ray.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. Yes, thanks Linda. Just before we end the call, I want to remind everyone that we\u2019ll be hosting our next Investor Day on February 28, 2018 here in New York. The event will be webcast live, and we\u2019ll have presentations from management and be showcasing the important aspects of the Company\u2019s business. So, thank you very much everyone for joining the call today. And we look forward to speaking with you again in the New Year.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, once again, this does conclude today\u2019s Moody\u2019s third quarter 2017 earnings call.

At the request of the company, we will open the conference up for question-and-answer following the presentation.","I will now turn the conference over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Shivani Kak","Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on this teleconference to discuss Moody's third quarter 2019 results as well as our current outlook for full year 2019. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations.","This morning, Moody's released its results for the third quarter of 2019 as well as an update to our current outlook for full year 2019. The earnings press release and the presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.","Ray McDaniel, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer will lead this morning's conference call.

I'll begin by summarizing Moody's third quarter 2019 financial results and provide an update on the execution of our strategy. Mark Kaye will then follow with further details on our third quarter results and comment on our revised outlook for 2019. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","I'd like to start by providing select highlights for the quarter. First, Moody's has achieved substantial revenue growth with Moody's Investors Service attaining its second highest quarterly revenue result ever as well as continued strength in Moody's Analytics which has now delivered double-digit growth in eight of the past nine quarters.","Second, the adjusted operating margin of 49.5% was up 190 basis points as compared to the prior year period. Next in light of stronger-than-anticipated top-line growth and disciplined expense management, we're raising our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $8.05 to $8.20.","And finally, since our last earnings call, we continue to execute on our long-term strategy of targeted investment in regional and product expansion opportunities. In addition, I am pleased that Moody's has bolstered its leadership in ESG engagement and disclosure.","Moving on to third quarter 2019 results. Robust performance across both business segments resulted in a 15% revenue increase from Moody's overall driven by 16% growth in MIS and 13% growth in MA. Moody's adjusted operating income of $614 million was up 19% from the prior year period and the adjusted operating margin of 49.5% was up 190 basis points. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 27% driven by strong business performance.","We continue to enhance our core ratings and analytics businesses, while pursuing strategic growth opportunities both down the corporate credit pyramid and across into new geographies and adjacent product areas. I'd like to take a few minutes to review several key initiatives Moody's has undertaken in the last few months in line with our strategic priorities.","I'll speak -- I'll first speak to our enhanced regional presence in China and Latin America. Starting with China we forecast the domestic ratings market to generate industry-wide revenue of approximately $270 million in 2019. And for our joint venture, CCXI to have market share in the low 40s percent range up from the high 30s during 2018.","With CCXI we are well-positioned with 30% ownership stake in China's largest domestic rating agency, which has approximately 1,700 rated customers including approximately 40 new public ratings year-to-date. ","In addition, earlier this week we announced that we acquired a minority stake in SingTel Green Finance. SingTel obtains data from more than 1,200 publicly listed companies in China to provide environmental data and analytics green bond verification and green finance solutions to Chinese banks, institutional investors, corporate and policy research organizations. The SingTel investment complements our recent acquisitions of majority stakes in Vigeo Eiris and Four Twenty Seven and advances our global commitment to establishing transparent standards for evaluating ESG risks.","Moving to Latin America. Last month we launched Moody's Local. Subject to regulatory approvals this new platform will provide domestic ratings and research for financial institutions, corporates, local governments and other sectors in Peru, Panama and Bolivia. From this foundation, we look forward to further expanding our presence in domestic markets across the region. To learn more about Moody's Local, please visit moodyslocal.com.","Shifting to our expansion down the credit pyramid and into business adjacencies. In the third quarter, we added new product capabilities to further enhance our portfolio. First, at Bureau van Dijk, we launched Compliance Catalyst 2, an enhanced platform to streamline customer identity analysis, facilitating compliance with know-your-customer, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and related rules and regulations.","Second, earlier this month, we acquired ABS Suite, a software platform used by issuers and trustees to administer and report on asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities programs. This acquisition strengthens MA's leading position in securitized markets, serving issuers dealers and investors with data analytics and operational tools.","Third, MIS's public finance rating group use data and analytics from Four Twenty Seven to analyze U.S. local government heat stress exposure and credit risk. This demonstrates our ability to integrate ESG data into credit analysis and research. Finally, our acquisition of RiskFirst, which closed in July, provides MA with the award-winning PFaroe platform, a leading solution for asset managers and pension plan sponsors, supporting more than 3000 plans in more than $1.4 trillion in assets.","RiskFirst offers extensive unique data and advanced analytics for management of long-dated assets and liabilities. These new capabilities demonstrate our ability and commitment to enhancing the relevance of Moody's brand to an ever-expending range of analytical disciplines, simulating the growth prospects of our business. Issuance and activity increased after four consecutive quarters of decline and was a key driver of our third quarter operating performance.","Central bank actions and falling benchmark rates created issuer friendly market conditions, overcoming continued geopolitical uncertainty and various global growth forecasts. Strong corporate fixed rate bond issuance, driven by opportunistic and M&A-related financing, aided MIS in delivering robust growth in the third quarter. Corporate finance was a significant driver of MIS' year-over-year performance.","So I'd like to spend another minute on U.S. investment grade and high-yield bond issuance as well as bank loan issuance in the third quarter. Due to the flattening of the yield curve in the third quarter, fixed income market issuance was strong across all asset classes, relatively lower financing costs drove increases in investment grade and high-yield bond issuance by 45% and more than 100% respectively.","Issuance of floating rate loans, which has slightly higher year-over-year financing cost, increased by 21%, reversing a string of year-over-year declines in the prior four quarters. In light of a delayed Brexit, it is important to reiterate that since the U.K. referendum in June 2016, Moody's has taken steps to ensure that we have appropriate operational capacity, both in the EU 27 and the U.K. We have also adjusted our processes to conduct credit rating activities effectively and without interruption, irrespective of the outcome of the Brexit process. In short, we are prepared for the delayed scenario. And in the event of a no-deal Brexit, MIS is ready to carry out operations in the EU 27 and the U.K.","I'd like to review a few recent initiatives that underscore our commitment to a sustainable future. First, I am proud to announce that Moody's has published its inaugural Sustainability Accounting Standards Board index on moodys.com\/csr, which includes information consistent with SASB's objectives. Second, senior management participated in multiple UN Global Compact events related to ESG during UN General Assembly week. MIS in partnership with Climate Bonds Initiative also hosted a briefing during Climate Week New York City on pace and cost of carbon transition and the financial tools deployed to facilitate it.","Third, MIS is hosting an ESG conference in London next week, together with Vigeo Eiris and Four Twenty Seven, where key industry figures will share their insights on important ESG themes and the impact on global credit markets. Finally, Moody's announced Pathway to Prosperity, a collaboration between our affiliate Finagraph and America's Small Business Development Centers. Pathway to Prosperity is a financial empowerment initiative dedicated to helping entrepreneurs overcome the challenges of growing a small business.","I'll now turn the call over to Mark Kaye to provide further details on our third quarter performance and our updated outlook for 2019.","Mark Kaye","Thank you, Ray. For MIS, third quarter revenue was up 16% from the prior year period and above the 10% increase in overall debt issuance due to a favorable mix of debt issuers. As Ray mentioned earlier, issuance growth was skewed towards fixed-rate activity, given lower benchmark interest rates. Moreover, results were bolstered by elevated levels of borrowing among infrequent issuers.","MIS also benefited from strong U.S. public finance issuance, including increases in refunding supply taxable transactions. Strong business performance resulted in 250 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in the third quarter. MA achieved an overall revenue growth rate of 13%, reflecting strong contributions from each business. This enabled 80 basis points of improvement in the adjusted operating margin compared to the third quarter of 2018. Organic MA revenue was up 10% from the prior year period.","RD&A revenue grew 13% due to strong demand for Bureau van Dijk solutions that address customer identity requirements as well as sales of credit research and ratings data feeds.","On an organic basis RD&A delivered double-digit revenue growth of 10%. In ERS revenue grew 16% for the quarter or 13% organically led by strong demand for our new credit assessment and loan origination platform along with products that enable compliance with new accounting standards for banks and insurers.","Trailing 12 months ERS revenue was up 5%, while sales were up 10%. As Ray mentioned earlier, MA has now delivered double-digit growth in eight of the last nine quarters. I'd like to highlight the robust performance of ERS thus far this year. The increase in ERS recurring revenue base, which has grown by $160 million since 2015 remains a significant driver of MA revenue.","Recurring revenue as a share of the total ERS business was 78% on a trailing 12-month basis through the third quarter. This demonstrates the continuing shift in the ERS business mix. On a trailing 12-month basis as of the third quarter, subscription sales increased 16%, while sales of one-time products and services declined 6%. The strategic shift to expand our subscription business will support ongoing scalability and drive future operating leverage in MA.","We remain disciplined in managing expenses to drive strong operating performance. In the third quarter, total operating expenses increased 13% with approximately 10 percentage points related to incentive compensation operating expenses attributable to acquisitions completed within the last year a captive insurance company settlement and an impairment charge related to the planned divestiture of Max.","Year-to-date total operating expenses increased 11% with approximately nine percentage points related to the restructuring charge, operating expenses attributable to acquisitions, high accruals for incentive compensation, the captive insurance company settlements and the Max impairment charge.","Details regarding the captive insurance company litigation matter were previously disclosed in our Form 10-Q filings and that disclosure will be updated to reflect the settlement in our upcoming Form 10-Q that we plan on filing later this week.","I'll now discuss Moody's updated full year 2019 guidance. Moody's outlook for 2019 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors. These include, but are not limited to interest in foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions and the level of debt capital markets activity. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.","Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast for the remainder of 2019 reflects U.S. exchange rates for the British pound of $1.23 and for the euro $1.09. We now anticipate that both Moody's revenue and operating expenses will increase in the high single-digit percent range with operating expense guidance reflecting depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, captive insurance company settlement and impairment charge related to the planned divestiture of Max and acquisition-related expenses.","Of note, we do not expect a significant ramp-up in expenses from the first to the fourth quarter of 2019 as we realize savings from the restructuring program. The full year 2019 operating and adjusted operating margins are forecast to be approximately 42% and 48% respectively. We're targeting net interest expense to be approximately $195 million. The full year effective tax rate is now anticipated to be in the range of 21.5% to 22.5%.","Diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS are forecast to increase to $7.20 to $7.35 and $8.05 to $8.20 respectively. Share repurchases are anticipated to be approximately $1 billion. For full list of our guidance please refer to table 12 of our earnings release.","For MIS, we have revised our full year revenue outlook to be in the mid-single-digit percent range, due to the support of market conditions that Ray spoke about earlier. We anticipate U.S. revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Non-U.S. revenue is now forecast to increase in the low single-digit percent range.","Our estimate for 2019 debt issuance is approximately flat when compared to 2018. We forecast stronger activity from fixed-rate corporate bonds in the public sector as well as continued support from debt funded M&A. We expect lower conditions from floating rate bank loans and CLOs and assume ongoing low benchmark rates and accommodative monetary policy.","Our estimate to achieve approximately 900 first-time mandates in 2019 remains on track. The MIS adjusted operating margin expectation is still approximately 58% for 2019. For MA, we anticipate total revenue to increase in the low double-digit percent range given strong sales growth across all business lines bolstered by stable recurring revenue. We continue to expect the MA adjusted operating margin to expand 150 to 250 basis points to the 28% to 29% range in 2019. Full year 2019 guidance reflects the aggregate impact of announced acquisitions as well as the planned divestiture of Max.","Before turning the call back over to Ray I would like to emphasize a few key takeaways from the quarter. Moody's core business continues to grow. As noted earlier, we are actively pursuing innovation and extension into business adjacencies in regional geographies.","These efforts reflect our ability and commitment to enhance the relevance and growth prospects of both MIS and MA. Last, we are pleased to raise adjusted diluted EPS guidance, due to stronger-than-anticipated revenue growth, and disciplined expense management.","I will now turn the call back over to Ray, for his final remarks.","Ray McDaniel","Thanks Mark. Before turning to Q&A, I'd like to take a few minutes to introduce the incoming presence of Moody's Analytics and Moody's Investors Service. Effective November 1 Steve Tulenko will assume the role of President of Moody's Analytics.","Steve joined Moody's in 1990. And he is currently the Executive Director of ERS, a role he has held since 2013. He previously led sales, customer service and marketing for M&A.","Prior to the formation of MA, he held various sales, product development, and product strategy roles at MIS. Steve comes to this role with deep leadership experience and domain expertise.","Also effective November 1, with Rob Fauber assuming the role of Chief Operating Officer, Mike West will succeed Rob as President of Moody's Investors Service. Mike joined Moody's in 1998. And he is currently the Head of MIS, Ratings & Research.","Previously Mike served as both the Head of Global Corporate, and of Structured Finance. Earlier in his career, he was responsible for the research strategy for the Ratings businesses and before that, led Corporate Finance, for the European Middle East Africa region.","European Corporates in the EMEA leveraged finance business. Mike's extensive leadership experience in MIS makes him ideally suited to lead the ratings business. I would like to congratulate Steve and Mark on their new -- Steve and Mike on their new roles.","I'm confident that with Rob Fauber in his new role, as Chief Operating Officer. We are positioned to continue strengthening Moody's ability to offer trusted insights and standards. And thereby support informed decisions that promote progress, through clarity, knowledge, and fairness.","Listed on this slide are the conferences that we expect to attend in the next two months in New York City, Boston and San Francisco. Investors will be able to meet Steve Tulenko at the Barclays Global TMT Conference in mid-December.","Please contact your bank representative to request a meeting with Moody's management at these events. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that Moody's will be hosting its next Investor Day, on March 11 2020 in New York City.","The event, which will be webcast live, will feature presentations from management and showcase important aspects of the company's business. This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Mark Kaye and me, for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida and Rob Fauber.","We'd be pleased to take your questions, Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Cho with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Cho","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question I appreciate the update the 2019 debt issuance. I was hoping you can provide some commentary on your 2020 outlook as well? And maybe some of the assumptions, you're baking in there today?","Ray McDaniel","Sure. We'd be happy to offer some preliminary comments. I'll turn to Rob, for issuance commentary.","Rob Fauber","Yeah. So for 2020, like we were -- like we talked about and we were asked the same question a year ago, in October. We like to get to the end of the year, so we can see where the current year issuance ends up.","And then be able to triangulate both our own bottoms-up build. And forecast with what we're seeing from The Street, in terms of their forecast. So, that said, as really for the last two years we see both tailwinds and headwinds to issuance.","We got low -- very low benchmark rates obviously, but amidst a weaker global macro backdrop. And that leads us to kind of think that issuance, could be at roughly similar levels in 2020 as to what we've seen this year.","But I'd also say, as we've seen in recent years, the mix of issuance, is also quite important to our overall revenues. And we may be able to see our way towards mid-single-digit growth in issuance next year, if we see a few things, heading into the end of this year and into next year.","And that includes the escalation of the U.S. China trade tensions that I think would remove a key threat to global growth. A slightly more settled picture in Europe and that includes resolution of the Brexit uncertainty. And an improvement in growth sentiments, amidst what is clearly some accommodative monetary policy.","And also the potential for more pull forward from the existing maturity walls. So we're going to be looking to see whether this gets us more comfortable with growth particularly, in the corporate market.","And of course, the downside risks around global recession end of cycle concerns any kind of risk of sentiment or widening of spreads, could provide some headwinds. So, we'll provide a more fulsome view on our next earnings call. But that's kind of a -- out of saddle reaction.","Michael Cho","Okay. Great. Thanks. That's great color. Just wanted to follow-up Ray, I mean you highlighted some of the progress that you made in recent months and recent years on Moody's key initiatives along the strategic priorities. I guess if, I just take a step back and topline trends certainly seems to be favorable in the near term does that change your posture when thinking about categories as well as priorities of organic reinvestments in M&A?","Ray McDaniel","No. It really doesn't. Our strategy is built with a long-term view. The initiatives that we have been pursuing are tightly aligned with that strategy. And so -- while we're enjoying favorable market conditions now the investment is really looking into the longer-term future, whether it's organic or the inorganic opportunities we've seen. So, it's very much stay the course approach.","Michael Cho","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you very much. So my first question maybe you could just ask on Moody's Analytics, the double-digit growth has been pretty consistent as you pointed out. Is there any reason that that 10% organic number is not sustainable looking out into the future?","Mark Almeida","Manav, it's Mark thanks for the question. I would say that, we feel very good about the performance of the business and we're bullish on the business. I would say over short periods of time, you do need to be aware of some of the quarterly patterns we're seeing in ERS revenues.","If you go back and look at ERS revenue going back to the beginning of 2018, when the new accounting standard was introduced, you actually see some pretty interesting behavior. The ASC 606 is more sensitive to product mix than frankly we anticipated when that standard was introduced. And so, you see some ups and downs in the ERS growth from quarter-to-quarter under 606.","So again I think in the -- over the long run, we feel very good about the outlook for MA and its status as a double-digit growth business. But in the short run I think you're going to see a little bit of noise from that accounting standard.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. Okay. And Ray, if I could just ask on China I mean that slide you put up I mean the -- I guess what you did in Latin America by putting the Moody's brand on the local side like is that ultimately the plan for China?","Ray McDaniel","Right now as far as we're concerned the investment in CCXI is the most favorable approach for us in domestic China. And CCXI has a very well-known brand in China. I would also emphasize that the Chinese character of the joint venture, I think is an important element of our investment there. And so I would anticipate using the CCXI brand for the foreseeable future whether we retain our current stake or change the level of our investment.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","Ray, just hoping you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes of the guidance change. You had a solid quarter, this quarter but only raised the guidance sort of modestly. Was that because of the higher tax rate or is there anything else that you'd call out in terms of what you're expecting for the fourth quarter?","Ray McDaniel","Well there are number of puts and takes as you might imagine. But I'll turn this over to Mark Kaye for some color commentary.","Mark Kaye","I think there are really two that we want to keep in here -- in mind here Toni. First is FX. We are incurring roughly a $0.04 headwind from our FX assumption as of the end of September visited the comparable period last year. The delay in Max is probably worth another $0.01 or so. And then as we look at results emerge or early indications of results emerging in the month of October, we feel probably more comfortable saying that we're in that upper probably 1\/3 of the guidance range, where we anticipate completing the year.","Toni Kaplan","Yes. It's great. And then just given some of the political debates going on right now and the rating agencies back in the news about the business model, any comments on the overall regulatory environment? And how you're thinking about any potential change in market structure or would you expect sort of the regular business as usual?","Ray McDaniel","Well, I think it's important to remember that over the last decade the business model for the ratings industry has been examined very closely. And it's been looked at by regulatory authorities in multiple jurisdictions. And certainly scrutinized by the SEC. And in that context, the conclusion that the existing business model was the best for all market participants. And that the emphasis should be on transparency and compliance with regulation and inspection and review to assure that that compliance occurs was really determined to be the best outcome for all market participants.","I have -- those of you who've been on this call in past years, I have always acknowledged that there are conflicts of interest inherent with the business model as there are with many, many business models in different industries. The conflicts of interest have to be managed, that's why we have public disclosure of our methodologies which market participants can review. They can see whether they agree or disagree with our analytical approach. And they can see whether we're adhering to the analytical approach that we have published.","So, the business model allows for us to engage in a very important public good, which is the free simultaneous release of credit ratings to all market participants big or small. There is no other model that allows for that. And so, we emphasize the managing of the conflict of interest that is inherent in the business and the public good that comes from that. Unless we can find someone, who really doesn't care about our conclusions or our research or our analysis and still wants to write us a check, we're not going to be able to find a business model that doesn't have some conflicts.","Toni Kaplan","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew Nicholas","Hi. Good morning. I guess I just want to start with SingTel green finance acquisition you announced this week. Just curious if you could talk a little bit more about that. And maybe more broadly if you could kind of frame where demand for ESG is in China relative to where you see it in Europe and in the U.S.?","Ray McDaniel","Yeah. Rob has been closest to this. So, I'm going to invite him to make a couple of remarks.","Rob Fauber","Yeah. So, it's a small minority investment. It's really at the intersection of our efforts in both China and ESG. China is the second largest green bond market globally, after the U.S. It's over $40 billion of issuance last year. And the government there recently announced some new requirements for publicly listed companies to make disclosures around ESG risks starting in 2020.","So, SingTel is a provider of ESG and green finance data and analytics. They're normally based in China, but they're focused on China. They collect currently data on over 1,200 listed Chinese companies and that number is growing. They were in fact the first Chinese signatory of the UN's principles for responsible investment.","So, this investment I think is going to help SingTel accelerate its coverage and adoption in the Chinese market and its ability to serve Chinese market participants. And it's also going to enhance Moody's global ESG offerings. It is going to give us access to what we think is going to be some pretty valuable and rich Chinese content sets around ESG.","We see the green finance market as an important one in China. As I said, it's a clear policy focus. The data and analytics market serving that is in its infancy. So we're pretty excited about getting into this market in the kind of nascent stages with a -- what we think is a prominent Chinese player much like we did with CCXI years ago in the rating business.","Andrew Nicholas","Great. Thank you. That's helpful color. And then, just a couple of housekeeping items. First, do you have an update on when you expect the Max sale to close?","And then second, I was hoping you could size the one-time license delivery in ERS in the quarter?","Ray McDaniel","With respect to Max, I think we would anticipate it closing in the first half of November.","Mark Kaye","As relates to the license delivery in ERS, we don't specifically break out that. I wouldn't say it is material enough to influence the directional guidance the numbers that we provided.","Andrew Nicholas","Perfect, and thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Bill Warmington","Good afternoon, everyone. So a question for you on Moody's Local, Peru, Panama and Bolivia. just wanted to know if you could share with us how much revenue is coming out of Latin America currently? And whether the thought here is to -- an ability to accelerate the revenue growth there? And maybe talk a little bit about what's behind the timing?","Ray McDaniel","Sure. Go ahead Rob.","Rob Fauber","Yeah. Bill, it's Rob. And one thing I -- distinction I wanted to draw between what we've done with Moody's Local and the earlier question with CCXI and the branding. These are wholly-owned subsidiaries that we have in Latin America. So, we've decided to take a bit of a new approach in the region around the domestic bond markets, because -- and it's interesting you look at the overall rating opportunity in Latin America, a meaningful part of that is coming from the domestic bond markets. So we rebranded as Moody's Local and the focus is going to be providing as the name says, local ratings in local language to meet specific local needs. And we think that is going to help us better capture this domestic rating revenue opportunity across the region.","I would say, the Moody's Local platform itself in terms of revenues is quite small. The Latin America -- the overall Latin America for MIS is actually a fairly small part of the overall total of our revenues. But the first step here was the repositioning of the equilibrium businesses. And I think you're going to see us continue to expand on that platform in the coming 12 to 24 months to best serve that market.","Bill Warmington","And then on -- for my follow-up I wanted to check in on Reis, just ask about new products that have been introduced and also ask if you're seeing some success going after the U.S. bank market?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. Reis is performing very much as we expected. But I'll just remind you that we recognized when we acquired Reis that that was a business that did require some work and some effort particularly around product strategy. We've done a tremendous amount of work there. We feel like we are moving forward nicely.","One of the things we're very excited about in Reis is that, as we're spending more time with more customers in the commercial real estate space, it's very clear that there is a lot of demand for better data solutions and more advanced analytical tools. And that's exactly why we bought Reis because we thought that they provided the data foundation to which we could apply our analytical skills and really upgrade the practice of risk management in commercial real estate.","So it's moving very much as we expected. We remain bullish and excited about the business. We think there's a big opportunity there. But frankly there's a lot of work for us yet to do there. We've accomplished a lot but still there's a lot on our to-do list.","Bill Warmington","Yes. So I just wanted to say to Steve, Rob and Mike, congratulations on the promotions. And to Mark Almeida, congratulations on a great run and happy trails. Thank you.","Ray McDaniel","Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Christian Bolu","Good morning. Maybe on ESG. You spoke a lot about efforts around ESG. Help us understand kind of how in aggregate your target offering compares to your main competitor? Maybe also speak to kind of how you plan to sort of monetize these efforts over time? And then any sort of color around how you think the revenue opportunity evolves over the next two to three years?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. Let me start and then I'll see if my colleagues want to add anything. When we're looking at the ESG space. First of all were looking at a much more fragmented market than some of the core markets that we operate in. So there are large number of competitors. There are not a lot of established standards. There is a move towards standards that I think is going to be helpful for the ESG sector.","And looking at ESG, I think it's very important obviously, to separate out the E from the S from the G. We have made efforts, particularly in the environmental area. Although, Vigeo Eiris in particular, provide some broader ESG assessment rather than just environmental.","But SingTel and Four Twenty Seven are more in the environmental sector. And also support other work that we're doing and other products that we're developing whether it's in Moody's Analytics or Moody's Investors Service.","So you can see that Four Twenty Seven for example, aligns very nicely with some of our commercial real estate efforts both in the Rating agency and in Moody's Analytics. I would also point out just to temper expectations that we are looking at markets that in some ways are just beginning to monetize.","And what those addressable markets will ultimately become has fair amount of uncertainty around it. Nonetheless, and one of the reasons why we're bullish about this is that, regardless of how each sector in the ESG space might evolve. We think there is a relevance to the other work we do in our core businesses so that the investments will not be stranded no matter what.","Rob Fauber","Exactly. Maybe just to build on that a little bit that's exactly right, Ray. In some ways this is a good investment as R&D into the rating agency and we've rolled out some new tools, corporate governance and carbon transition assessment tools that are topic and sector-specific. And when we think that meets the needs of fixed income investors.","And then, I think Ray is right. I mean we're going to be monetizing this both through the businesses that we've acquired, but also through the integration of the data and the analytics in products in services in both MA and MIS. Maybe just to spotlight a little bit. And there's also the growth of what I think I'll call the labeled bond market started as the green bond market, but really has gone beyond that into -- more broadly into sustainability. And that market has been growing quite rapidly.","So label bond volumes are going to hit something like $280 billion of issuance this year. Something like $220 billion, $230 billion of that is in green bonds and another $40 billion to $50 billion is in social and sustainability. So that's an emerging area. And then you've got sustainability in green-linked loans. And that's probably something like another $70 billion. So you can see your way to about $350 billion of this labeled bond issuance. And there are few drivers for that you've got investor demand for ESG compliant securities.","You've got the market focus on climate risk and you've got issuers also wanting to demonstrate their own sustainability credentials. So we think we're really well placed in this market with the Vigeo Eiris acquisition, because that's given us a leadership position in the label bond space that we're going to continue to build on. Just to give you a sense through the first three quarters of this year, we signed a little over a 100 second-party opinion mandates Vigeo Eiris did 53 all of last year.","In this past quarter, we actually -- Vigeo Eiris actually issued a second-party opinion on the first gender bond in Latin America. And that's going to finance winter-led SMEs in Panama. So in general, we're pretty excited about the opportunity in front of us. To leverage all of this I think we should see some growth. But as Ray said, it's fragmented and we're going to have to see how the market evolves over the next one, two, three years.","Christian Bolu","Great. Thanks for the very comprehensive answers. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on earlier question on China. I believe there's a recent article in Bloomberg suggesting Moody's having an issue with Chinese government in terms of recent stake in CCXI. So not sure how accurate that is, but it would be great to get a sort of comment around the relationship with the Chinese government plans for CCXI? And any updated thoughts around going fully on the JV versus going stand-alone like your peers?","Raymond McDaniel","Well the relationship with Chinese authorities for us is really with regulatory authorities more so than the policymakers in other areas of the government. And that relationship with the regulatory authorities has always been constructive and continues to be. I think we're able to have good dialogue at both the staff level and at the leadership level at the major regulatory institutions. And are able to be pretty candid in sharing our thoughts and views and hearing their thoughts and views.","That being said, I think it's difficult to completely separate the relationship with the authorities from what's going on at a geopolitical level. And so we're behaving conservatively in terms of how we are thinking about the pace and the nature of the opportunity in China. We remain committed to CCXI. We remain committed to providing ratings and research services and Moody's Analytics products in the cross-border markets into large financial institutions in China and we'll continue to do so. And we're very satisfied with our stake in CCXI. It's a good business and we're proud to be there.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. My first question is just on margins. How do you think about the margin profile heading into 2020? Can you remind us of some of the drivers? And I know in the past we've talked about the analytics business is potentially continuing to move their margins up. Maybe we can get an update there?","Mark Kaye","I'll start with the broader view for MCOs and I'm going to ask Mark Almeida to talk about MA specifically. As we sort of think about margins both for the third quarter and year-to-date, there's really two items that are worth keeping in mind. First is margin expansion in the third quarter would have been 260 basis points on an organic basis. The inorganic acquisitions and ongoing investments that we've made in year-to-date and obviously in the third quarter. It really impacts the margin negatively by around 70 bps.","The second thing I'd keep in mind is sort of FX movements across time periods they tend to swing margins in different directions depending on the rates and the underlying movements themselves. As I try to think forward, margins are principally driven by underlying growth in the business itself. And that's really been the primary driver of the performance this quarter and certainly is our expectation to be the primary driver of performance in the -- in future periods.","And then lastly, we do have the opportunity not necessarily through margins, but through ongoing capital management activities to use the tools that we have to drive our EPS growth and accretion. You've certainly seen us take some of those steps with the management of our debt and interest rate portfolio in the first three quarters of 2019.","Ray McDaniel","So, in MA, I would just make a couple of notes. We continue to deliver consistent and gradual margin expansion in MA. With this latest quarter, we've now delivered nine consecutive quarters of margin expansion both on a trailing 12 months and on a year-on-year basis.","And over that period of nine quarters, we've taken the margin up by more than 500 basis points. So, we're very happy with what we've done there. We're doing it in a number of different ways. We're -- certainly as MA grows, we're seeing operating leverage come through. Also we are realizing the positive margin impact from ongoing adjustments we're making in our product portfolio.","And third we continue to execute on operational improvements across the business. We think we're disciplined business people and we would expect to continue to apply rigor to our oversight of the operation. So, we see a number of things contributing to margin expansion and we're going to continue to be working at all of them.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. And then my second follow-up is just on China. What's your liability in that region to the -- I guess the joint ventures in the subsidiaries? Are they separate entities? And then my second part of that question is how do you view your risk from a ratings perspective versus the rest of the world? Thanks.","Ray McDaniel","Yes. I mean CCXI is a separate company. We are a 30% investor. So, obviously, a minority shareholder in CCXI. We don't have management control. We are not directing the ratings that is being done on the ground by employees at CCXI who are not Moody's employees.","So, in that respect you should think of us as a financial investor in the entity. We're obviously happy to provide assistance where it's appropriate to do so. But that's not in the form of controlling ratings or research for the entity.","They have done well in the domestic market in terms of their performance, as we all know the ratings of the domestic market -- rating agencies in China are generally higher than what you would see from the international rating agencies providing ratings on a global scale.","But in that context what I would emphasize is the importance of correctly force ranking the credits that are receiving ratings. So, the lower end of the rating spectrum has the higher default risk entities and the upper end has the lower default risk entities almost regardless of the absolute levels that those ratings are assigned.","So, I think that's what we look for, at least, in the early stages of the development of that domestic market to see that domestic rating industry is doing a good job of that forced ranking.","Joseph Foresi","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Craig Huber","Thank you. Two quick housekeeping questions. First, Mark what was the incentive comp in the quarter? What was it a year ago? And then also did I hear you correctly say you thought that costs for the fourth quarter would likely be similar to the first quarter level? I have a follow-up.","Mark Kaye","Thanks Craig. Incentive compensation for the third quarter of 2019 was $65 million. The comparable number for the third quarter of 2018 was $43 million. From an expense ramp perspective, from the first to the fourth quarter of 2019, we're expecting less than $10 million. And we do expect that obviously fourth quarter expenses to be below both the second and third quarter level as we start to realize savings from the restructuring program and other cost control initiatives.","Craig Huber","Okay. Then Ray I wanted to ask you your updated thoughts on the debt issuance environment right now when you sort of think about the credit spreads in the U.S. and Europe if you think about your outlook for default rates the economic outlook? And then how you sort of -- what you sort of sense now in the debt issuance environment?","Ray McDaniel","Rob offered I think some very good thoughts on this earlier in the call. But what we're seeing obviously is an accommodative environment for debt issuance. There are limits to the positive attributes of low interest rates, especially as we look outside the United States where negative interest rates are increasingly important feature of the debt markets.","And I would observe that the reason for negative interest rates is I would actually characterize negative interest rates as a headwind as opposed to a tailwind, because it's a policy and market response to expectations for very low or negative growth. And so -- while low interest rates are positive, this trend to ultra-low rates and negative rates, I think, we would have to count -- I would at least count it as a headwind.","That being said, the default rate is low. It continues -- average, even though it's going to uptick in our view in 2020. It's still going to be, if our forecast is correct, conducive of good market activity. What will be very interesting to see in 2020 is whether this favorable mix in debt issuance that we've seen in 2019 continues.","Obviously, the infrequent issuers acting opportunistically have been a characteristic of the 2019 debt market profile. And we will be very interested observers as to whether that mix that we've seen this year continues in 2020 or shifts to more frequent issuers, less opportunistic refinancing, et cetera.","Craig Huber","And then, my last question, Ray, if I could ask. Your guidance for the year -- the updated guidance adjusted EPS of $8.05 to $8.20. I mean, historically you guys are typically conservative with your outlook. It seems to me like that might be the case here again in the remaining part of this year.","I'm just wondering what you're sensing? What's in your budget here to make the top of the range only $8.20, because, I mean, just look at the math you've done $6.29 of adjusted EPS through nine months and as far as $1.90 $1.91 of EPS in the fourth quarter. Decently below what you had each of the first three quarters, are you basically forecasting transaction revenues, for example, in your ratings area to be down versus what you had, let's say, the two middle quarters fairly meaningful?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. I mean, there are a number of puts and takes to this as you would expect. And Mark Kaye offered some commentary earlier about the impact of FX, the divestiture of Max. And I would add to that, that we're hopeful and expect that we're going to have a solid quarter for the fourth quarter. The early numbers on October are encouraging.","And as Mark said, those early numbers, although they are preliminary, are leaning us more to the upper end of that $8.05 to $8.20 range. If we're looking for what could go wrong as opposed to what could go right, I would have to say that if we saw a pull forward into the September-October period from what would've come in November and December, we may not see as much strength as people are anticipating for closing out the year. So the amount of opportunistic financing that goes on in these last couple of months is obviously an important factor. So I'll leave it at that unless Mark Kaye wants to add anymore. And so\u2026","Craig Huber","What about the positive case to that though on top of the negative intentionally? But what's the positive case of that where things could come in better than this top of your range here?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. No, I mean, it certainly could. We can continue to have strength in the form of opportunistic refinancing, especially by infrequent issuers that would be very beneficial for the business. The timing of some of the product sales on the Moody's Analytics side can be influential and could help the fourth quarter. Maybe, Rob wants to offer a couple of comments on what the pipeline looks like. That might be helpful.","Rob Fauber","Yes. Sure, Ray. So in the U.S., I'd say, that in the investment-grade market we're still seeing pretty strong investor appetite. You saw earlier this week a mid-sized acquisition finance deal get done that was heavily oversubscribed. So that's good to see. My sense is, we're going to have active weeks heading into Thanksgiving here in the United States. I'd say the same for investment grade in Europe, pretty strong pipeline. We've got U.S. issuers also looking to tap the euro market, given where rates are there.","For leveraged finance, really both in the U.S. and Europe, we've seen some bifurcation of market sentiments. So you've got very strong demand for the larger more well-known spec grade issuers in that Ba category. And you can see that with the Ba index at record lows in terms of yield. We saw a recent print in Europe for a Ba2 name, it was the lowest coupon ever in the high-yield space.","So, in general, I'd expect issuance to continue in November and early December. Ray talked about the pull forward. There's also the potential, I guess, that some deals in the pipeline could slide into Q1. Just given the expectation for accommodative conditions to continue well into next year.","So the other thing I would mention is that in the U.S. public finance market, which is -- we saw very good issuance this quarter that continues to be active. And we're seeing this trend of taxable refunding because you've got very low funding costs and that means the economics are favoring the refunding of tax exempt debt with taxable debt. So if we see that keep up that could provide maybe some upside to our outlook.","Craig Huber","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","George Tong","Hi, thanks good morning. Global issuance volume is on track to be flat this year. And you mentioned that volumes next year could be flat to possibly up mid-single digits. Can you comment on how the pricing environment and rating should change depending on issuance growth, and if you've seen improving pricing power especially among infrequent issuers?","Ray McDaniel","No, I think that the impact of pricing \u2013 well, first of all when we talked about three points of contribution from price that's assuming a static debt market profile both in terms of the issuance volumes and the mix of frequent and infrequent issuers. So when we see growth, for example, in infrequent issuers we get more benefit because they are being priced on a transactional basis as opposed to on a long-term basis.","And that's why the pricing even though we can talk about pricing at a relatively -- in a relatively simple way, it's impacted potentially materially up or down by both issuance and by mix because some of the pricing does relate to bonds actually being issued. And so if they're not, there's no price impact. So I don't see any change in course around that in 2020. And we'll have to watch carefully to see what the insurance levels and mix are and the impact on price from that.","Rob Fauber","Yeah. The other thing I'd add just to clarify, I think our initial thinking where we sit now is more around flattish for next year. And when I commented on mid-single-digit it was -- what would you have to believe to be able to get there.","George Tong","Got it. That's helpful. On margins you've previously indicated that long-term EBITDA margin should be in the high 40s. Your margins are already in that range currently, so do you have a view that margins can go above 50% longer term or are there factors that could prevent that?","Ray McDaniel","I think the biggest factor that would prevent that would be the relatively higher growth rate year-on-year coming out of Moody's Analytics. And Moody's Analytics well, obviously, it's been consistently expanding margins over the last few years. It's still a lower margin business than the credit rating agency. So its accelerated growth should act to keep margins from expanding too aggressively.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Henry Chien with BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Henry Chien","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the opportunity related to China. I know there's the investment in CCXI. I was curious to hear any updated thoughts on the outlook for the offshore bond market? And whether that's I guess looking to be as sizable as an opportunity as somewhat exciting.","Ray McDaniel","Yeah. I mean we have a very robust business in the cross-border bond market coming out of China. Not surprisingly this is with China's largest corporate and financial institutions for the most part including both private and state-owned enterprises. We continue to get new rating mandates coming from China that has been a steady stream. And just to try and balance that commentary a little. If China is going to have some relative sluggishness in its economic growth and I emphasize relative because it's pretty good by global standards obviously. That may slow at least cyclically some of the cross-border activity coming out of China both for new rating mandates and for entities that are already rated and thinking about whether they want to raise additional debt.","So we'll just have to watch that and see. Obviously having the trade negotiations completed in some kind of a positive way would be helpful to the global economy. It would also be helpful to the Chinese economy. And as a result, I think helpful to our cross-border business.","Henry Chien","Yeah, okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","And now we' take our last question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead your line is open.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, thank you for squeezing me in. Just a couple of housekeeping items I want to ask Mark, just to kind of start. I saw the guidance for repos has tweaked down a little bit just from the range from 1.3 to -- 1 to 1.3 down to 1. Is there any reason you could point to for that? Has there been more deployed on acquisitions or anything in terms of why that would come down. The cash flow is really good from the company and the numbers are better than expected.","Mark Kaye","Shlomo, thanks for the question. Our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. I think this is a reflection of consistency in the way that we manage our cash repatriation efforts as well as an evaluation of our global cash needs. Let's make the point that we do expect the $300 million differential to be incremental for 2020 and we'll finalize the exact amount later this year when we give that guidance.","Shlomo Rosenbaum ","Okay. And just -- also from Mark, just want to talk about these negative interest rates what are the opportunities for Moody's as a company to tap into those negative interest rates and get paid to hold someone else's money?","Mark Kaye","Sure. I'd definitely think negative interest rates from a individual treasure perspective, provide an interesting opportunity to manage one's own debt portfolio. We have seen a lot of reverse Yankee issuance taking place certainly earlier this year. So you can see treasurers actively engaged in that market.","And then, of course, being able to bring it back to the U.S. to deploy potentially higher-yielding opportunities. It is something we look at. Maybe to pivot again back to the way that we think about capital management here, really first and foremost they're investing in growth opportunities as Ray mentioned reinvestment acquisitions. And then to the extent that we don't have additional opportunities for growth.","Either they don't meet our strategic objectives or which don't meet our financial hurdles to return that capital back to shareholders either through dividends or through share repurchase. It's not just a matter of raising capital, it's making sure we have good use for that capital.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. If you don't mind can I squeeze in one more for Ray? Just for perspective Ray. If there was no incremental growth in some of the China initiatives you're talking about or in any of the ESG initiatives that you're talking about. There is no incremental growth from today over the next three years. Would there be any material change in outlook for this company in terms of performance?","Ray McDaniel","You mean financial growth?","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Yeah. I mean, just if you guys did not -- if everything stayed the same in those two things realistically, is this company's growth rate going to change very much in the next several years?","Ray McDaniel","With respect to the ESG space, I don't think it is going to be large enough over a three-year period that in and of itself it's going to turn the dial for the organization. I think it's going to enhance the relevance of a number of our products and our credit ratings and research and analysis. But even if there is good robust growth in these sectors that have not yet really monetized themselves. I think that's going to be a longer-term process in terms of actually turning the dial for Moody's Corporation as a whole.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And that's the same thing for China and any of the initiatives there?","Ray McDaniel","China, I guess, would be a little more of a wildcard. Certainly, the domestic bond market in China is large and the demand for analytical products and solutions that come out of Moody's Analytics that come out of -- increasingly come out of Moody's Investors Service is there.","So it's really a question of how we're participating. And keeping in mind that fully participating in that market is participating in the domestic market for domestic investors. The domestic market for international investors looking to put capital to work in China and the true cross-border market. And we're focused on all three, the domestic market through CCXI and the other markets on our own.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Ray McDaniel for any additional and closing remarks.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. First of all, I want to thank everyone for joining. And secondly, I want to thank Mark Almeida for many decades of very skillful service on behalf of Moody's. I thank Mark for myself personally for the leadership team really for the organization as a whole.","He has been a tremendous executive for us, has kept in the growth of Moody's Analytics for the last 12 plus years -- service before that. And has just consistently provided outstanding work as an executive and he's been a great friend.","So, thank you very much Mark. And we appreciate your help with this transition and the best to you going forward.","Mark Almeida","Thank you, Ray.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. Thanks everyone for joining. We'll talk to you again in the New Year.","Operator","This concludes Moody's third quarter 2019 earnings call.

I'll begin by summarizing Moody's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. I'll conclude with comments on our outlook for 2014. And after our prepared remarks, we'll respond to your questions.","Moody's delivered strong financial performance throughout 2013, including revenue growth in all lines of business, margin expansion and EPS growth of 18%. Fourth quarter revenue of $779 million increased 3% over the fourth quarter of 2012, and reflected growth in Moody's Investor Service despite challenging year-on-year comparisons, as well as continued strong growth from all lines of business of Moody's Analytics.","Operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $467 million, a 5% decline from the fourth quarter of 2012. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $312 million, a 20% increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted operating income, which excludes depreciation and amortization, as well as a goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2012, was $335 million, up 13% from the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share of $0.94 for the fourth quarter increased 34% from the prior-year period. Excluding a legacy tax benefit of $0.09, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $0.85, a 21% increase from the fourth quarter of 2012.","For full year 2013, Moody's revenue of $3 billion increased 9% from full year 2012. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $2.1 billion for 2013, an increase of 9% from last year. Moody's Analytics revenue of $913 million was also 9% higher than the prior year. Operating expenses for full year 2013 were $1.7 billion, up 5% from 2012. Operating income of $1.2 billion increased 15% from 2012. Full year 2013 adjusted operating income of $1.3 billion increased 12% from the prior year.","Reported diluted earnings per share of $3.60 for the full year 2013 grew 18% from $3.05 in 2012. Excluding a litigation settlement charge of $0.14 in the first quarter of 2013 and a legacy tax benefit of $0.09 in the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as a legacy tax benefit of $0.06 in the third quarter of 2012, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.65 for the full year 2013 grew 22% from $2.99 in 2012.","I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide additional commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda S. Huber","Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 3% to $779 million. The impact of foreign currency translation for the quarter was negligible. Fourth quarter U.S. revenue of $417 million and non-U.S. revenue of $362 million both increased 3% from the fourth quarter of 2012. Non-U.S. revenue represented 46% of Moody's total revenue compared to 47% in the year-ago period. Recurring revenue of $390 million represented 50% of total revenue, up from 46% in the prior-year period.","Looking now at each of our segments, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue from the quarter was $523 million, up 1% from the prior-year period. U.S. revenue for MIS declined 2% to $300 million over the prior-year period. Revenue outside the U.S. of $223 million increased 5% and represented 43% of total ratings revenue, up from 41% in the prior-year period. The impact of foreign currency translation for the quarter was negligible.","Moving on to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue in the fourth quarter declined 1% from the year-ago period to $243 million. In the U.S., revenue was down 9% year-over-year, reflecting a contraction in U.S. bond issuance against a strong prior-year period. Outside the U.S., revenue was up 15% year-over-year as a result of higher investment grade issuance in Asia and speculative grade issuance in Europe, as well as increased revenue from monitoring fees for outstanding ratings.","Second, global structured finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $109 million, 6% above the prior-year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 15% year-over-year, primarily due to increased CMBS and reissuance, as interest rates, credit spreads and risk appetite were favorable. International finance revenue was down 8% against the prior-year period, driven by declines in revenue of European RMBS and Asian CMBS.","Third, global financial institutions revenue of $89 million increased 3% from the same quarter of 2012, primarily reflecting increased revenue from asset management companies. U.S. revenue was up 6% and non-U.S. revenue was up 1% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.","Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue declined 3% year-over-year to $83 million. Revenue was down 6% in the U.S., primarily due to declines in public finance and project finance issuance, partially offset by increased issuance in infrastructure finance, while non-U.S. revenue increased 1%.","Turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $256 million was up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2012. U.S. revenue grew by 21% year-over-year to $117 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 1% to $140 million and represented 54% of total Moody's Analytics revenue, down from 59% in the fourth quarter last year. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible.","And moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research, data and analytics or RD&A. Revenue of $138 million increased 9% from the prior-year period and represented 54% of total MA revenue. We continue to see a mid-90% customer retention rate, as well as strong new sales of research products. U.S. revenue was up 8%, and non-U.S. revenue was up 10% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.","Second, enterprise risk solutions or ERS. Revenue of $85 million grew 7% from last year, driven by strong growth in products and services that support bank stress testing activities. Revenue was up 48% in the U.S., while non-U.S. revenue was down 10% against the prior-year period. As we have previously noted, ERS revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility due to the variable nature of project timing and completion. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenue and sales for ERS have increased 8% and 14%, respectively.","Third, global professional services revenue grew 16% to $33 million, reflecting continued growth within Copal, as well as the acquisition of Amba Investment Services in December 2013. U.S. revenue increased 54%, and non-U.S. revenue increased 6% year-over-year.","Turning now to expenses. Moody's fourth quarter expenses were $467 million, a decline of $27 million or 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. This decline was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense, lower legal accruals and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2013, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. The year-over-year reduction in expenses was partially offset by increased compensation expense due to additional headcount and pension costs in 2013. The impact of foreign currency translation on operating expenses for the quarter was negligible. Moody's reported operating margin for the quarter expanded 550 basis points year-over-year from 34.5% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 40% in 2013. Adjusted operating margin was 43% for the quarter, up from 39.3% in the same period last year, an expansion of 370 basis points.","Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.6% compared with 31.5% for the prior-year period. The decline in the effective tax rate was primarily due to lower U.S. taxes on foreign income.","And now, I'll provide an update on capital allocation.","Moody's increased its quarterly dividend on December 17 by 12% to $0.28 per share of common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2013, Moody's repurchased 2 million shares at a total cost of $146 million, and issued 0.9 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. For the full year 2013, Moody's repurchased 14 million shares at a total cost of $893 million or an average price of $62.90 per share, and issued 50 -- excuse me, 5.5 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2013, totaled $214 million, a 4% decline from the prior-year period. As of December 31, 2013, Moody's had $784 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. Also as of December 31, Moody's had $2.1 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving debt facilities. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at year end were $2.1 billion, an increase of $333 million from a year earlier, due in part to Moody's August 2013 bond offering of $500 million of senior unsecured notes. Full year 2013 free cash flow was $885 million, an increase of $106 million or 14% from a year ago. Cash holdings maintained outside of the U.S. at the end of the fourth quarter were $1.2 billion or 59% of total cash holdings.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance for 2014. Moody's outlook for 2014 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability, business investment spending, mergers and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. There's an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ, Moody's results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates.","While we anticipate variable market conditions in 2014, we nonetheless expect revenue growth across all areas of our business. For Moody's overall, we expect full year 2014 revenue to grow in the high single-digit percent range. Full year 2014 operating expenses are projected to increase in the mid single-digit percent range, reflecting the full year impact of 2013 hires, as well as investments in our business. These include products development initiatives, particularly in credit research and enterprise risk solutions, where demand for our capabilities is particularly strong. We're also expanding our presence in important international markets. Even including these investments, our full year 2014 operating margin is expected to expand 50 to 150 basis points to be between 42% and 43%, up from 41.5% in 2013. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be between 45% and 46%, up from 44.7% in 2013. The effective tax rate is expected to increase to approximately 33% due to various tax law changes. The company expects diluted earnings per share for the full year 2014 of $3.90 to $4. We have endeavored to return capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","Over the course of 2013, Moody's increased its annualized declared dividend by 40% from $0.80 to $1.12. For 2014, we expect share repurchases of approximately $1 billion subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.","Full year 2014 capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $90 million, reflecting ongoing infrastructure maintenance, fit-out of additional floors at our 7 World Trade Center headquarters and investments in our business for efficiency and growth.","We expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Growth in compliance and regulatory expense is projected to be less than $5 million. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $900 million.","For the global MIS business, revenue for full year 2014 is expected to increase in the mid single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range. Corporate finance and public project and infrastructure finance revenues are both projected to grow in the high single-digit percent range. Revenue from structured finance is expected to grow in the low single-digit percent range, while revenue from financial institutions is expected to grow in the mid single-digit range.","For MA, full year 2014 revenue is expected to increase in the low-teens percent range, inclusive of our December 2013 acquisition of Amba Investment Services. On an organic basis, MA revenue is expected to expand in the high single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range. Non-U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Revenue from research, data and analytics is projected to grow in the high single-digit percent range, while revenue for enterprise risk solutions is projected to grow in the low-teens percent range. Revenue from professional services is projected to grow in the mid-40s percent range, which includes the recent acquisition of Amba. Organically, professional services revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investor Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We'd be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today from William Bird with FBR.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Ray, I was wondering if you could talk about just how you see debt issuance developing in 2014, and what you view as some of the key swing categories as you think about your outlook?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Sure. As I think you can glean from our guidance, we do expect international activity, particularly in the corporate sector, to be stronger than growth in the U.S. Looking at, I think, market consensus, we would expect in the U.S. to see modestly down volumes and issuance counts. And Linda may wish to give some additional color on that. And it's really -- in terms of the variables here, for corporate finance, as we've talked about before, it's really a question of both interest rates and how that affects refinancing activity, as well as if we do have a rising rate environment, is that associated with business confidence and borrowing for non-refinancing reasons, whether it be M&A or capital expenditure or share repurchase. So that would be a significant swing factor. And I would also say that, as always, the amount of activity in the securitization markets and the question about whether there's going to be a recovery in European securitization off of what was a relatively quiet year last year would be the second area I'd look to as an important variable.","Linda S. Huber","Bill, it's Linda. I think, we see unusual differences between U.S. and non-U.S. trends in the issuance markets right now. Let me go through, within the U.S. for this week, we see about 15 billion of issuance, but we would remind everyone that we're still in blackout period at this point. January looks like about 100 billion of U.S. investment-grade issuance, which may be down 10% year-over-year. And for the full year, most projections are at about 900 billion, which is sort of flattish to down 5%, again, in the U.S. But we've seen very good fund flows into bond funds so far this year. $9 billion has moved into bond funds. And interestingly, as the market has wobbled and there've been a resurgence of risk factors, interest rates have come back in. As of this morning, the 10 year is at 2 67, the 5 year is at 1 47, and that is helpful in terms of issuance trends. So we would expect that perhaps even beginning next week, things will start to pick up. Thus far in the year, we've seen investment grades skewed heavily towards financials in the U.S. And we've seen very heavy issuance from Yankee issuers, in other words, issuers coming from outside the U.S. Pipelines of investment grade in the U.S. right now would be characterized as light to average. Looking at high yield, we've seen about $10 billion this week. January looks to be at about $30 billion. The year is projected at about $300 billion. Again, in the U.S., that's down a little bit from last year but I'll ask Michel Madelain to comment as we move through this. Again, it's a different story outside the U.S. The issuance levels all-in for high yield are at 5.91% this morning. Again, issuance levels under 6% are very helpful to the high-yield market. And so we'll see what happens with M&A activity and so on, but pipelines are characterized as average. And leveraged loans continue to be the -- very much the bright spot this week, $15 billion of leveraged loans. January at $50 billion, which is up 40% year-over-year. The year's forecast is $400 billion, which is down a bit but we'll see how that plays out. Leveraged loan market has started the year in great shape. Inflows have been very strong, $460 million for the week. The asset class has not seen a weekly outflow since June of 2012, as investors continue to look at floating rate paper as the attractive place to be. And the pipeline there is termed to be robust in leveraged loans. So with all of that, might be interesting for you to hear from Michel, to hear his observations on the difference between U.S. and the international market.","Michel A. Madelain","Thank you, Linda. William, I think, that's the main point we have in front of us, is these contrast between the U.S. and non-U.S. U.S., what we have is a situation with obviously more challenging comparables because of what we've seen this year and an expectation of a contraction of issuance in investment grade and also high-yield bonds. Internationally, what we see especially in Europe is the fact that we expect to benefit from a continuation of disintermediation and bringing new transaction, as well as improving economic conditions. So again, both factors are helping to generate additional flow of new bonds basically.","Linda S. Huber","Bill, that might be more than what you wanted but that's the story.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Well said, well spoken. And how do you expect expenses to phase in, in 2014?","Linda S. Huber","Sure. As we said, expenses in -- growing in mid single-digits for 2014. And the reason for that, Bill, we've got businesses which are performing very strongly here. We're very pleased with our businesses' performances in 2013 and the outlook for '14. We think we have some good opportunities, and so looking at expense growth in the mid single-digits. For the first quarter, I'll make this easy. I think, what we'd look at on a GAAP basis is probably expenses in the first quarter somewhere around $450 million. And then, we're looking at a ramp again over the course of the year, probably $35 million to $40 million of increase by the time we get to the fourth quarter. So again, modest increase in expenses over the course of the year with the fourth quarter being the highest. Again, with the traditional ramp that Moody's sees at $35 million to $40 million, starting off of the base at around $450 million in the first quarter if things play out as we expect.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Ray, the international numbers are particularly impressive, I think. Is it possible to break out the impact or quantify the impact of this whole disintermediation thesis versus just secular growth or cyclical growth in the market? And then, I'm wondering, also related to that, if you have any statistics you can share with us on number of new issuers you're seeing in the international markets?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Sure. The contribution from disintermediation is, again, probably 2 to 3 points of revenue as we've talked about previously. And that has been fairly steady over the last few years. We had a particularly strong year last year for new mandates. And I think the number of new mandates was over 500 last year. So it was a strong year. We -- the trends that are influencing that, the deleveraging pressure on financial institutions, particularly in Europe, continues. I think, that, also, the interest of corporate borrowers to diversify their access to capital continues. So it looks like a powerful story and a long-term story as opposed to a cyclical story.","Linda S. Huber","Peter, it's Linda. I think, as we finished the fourth quarter, our new mandates might have even been a bit higher than what Ray stated, maybe around 800 new mandates. But that has been wind at our backs, as we said, and we're pleased with the international issuance pace also in Asia, as well as in Europe.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","How would that 800 compare with '12, Linda? Do you know?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Let me just clarify that the numbers we have, we have net and gross numbers, and so we have to be clear about that. But I'm sorry, your question, Peter?","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","How -- whichever number it is, how it compared to the prior year?","Raymond W. McDaniel","It was up by several hundred.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Excellent. And then, in terms of the stepped-up pace of buyback activity, so if I'm calculating this right, if you do $1 billion of buyback and, call it, a couple hundred million of dividend payments, that will likely exceed the free cash flow. So should I read into this a willingness maybe to use a little bit more leverage not just near term but over the next several years in terms of maintaining a higher level of buybacks? The question really is the $1 billion level a number we might expect on a continuing basis?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, that's going to be subject to a number of factors and ongoing review of how our financial performance is, what our other opportunities are for use of capital. I will say that I think we have the capacity to continue to repurchase at that rate, absent something unexpected. So there's certainly that potential.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, last thing, pricing, anything different in '14 than what you've done in the last couple of years?","Linda S. Huber","Peter, it's Linda. I don't think so. As we have guided in our previous discussions with investors on the 4-box growth chart, we've said pricing is 3% to 4% of our growth, and we continue to look at that for 2014.","Operator","We'll go to Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So my first question is, obviously, we've had a pretty big upheaval in the emerging markets to start 2014. Have you seen any of that have an impact on new issuers kind of coming to market, or your conversations with companies that are based in emerging markets?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, the turmoil in the emerging markets certainly has had an impact on short-term pipelines and issuance levels. I don't think that, that is going to remain a story for the full year. And I would expect that we're going to see -- continue to see good activity in the Yankee market, as Linda mentioned. But also, with -- I think, with the realization that interest rates in the U.S. may not be moving as far, as fast as people had feared, will bring some more stability to the emerging market side of the equation.","Linda S. Huber","Patrick, it's Linda. I think, as I had mentioned in the earlier remarks, the elevation in the VIX and various other things has resulted in the U.S. rates coming in about 30 basis points, which is attractive for issuers. So we'll see how that is viewed. But we thought that the markets might be waiting for some of this end-of-year data before issuers take another step, but we will see how things pan out as we move through February.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, second question for me. So I think, there's been a number of articles these last few days about the Volcker Rule and its impact on CLOs, and it certainly looks like the CLO market has dried up a little bit. But from your commentary, it sounds like the leveraged loan market still remains pretty robust. So can you just provide some commentary on your level of concern about how the Volcker Rule is impacting CLOs and what the banks can hold and how you see things playing out there?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, I mean, I think, we have seen a market reaction, both in terms of the pull forward of CLO activity and quite a bit of debate about how the Volcker Rule will ultimately impact this market. I'm pretty optimistic that a resolution is going to be found that is going to allow banks to continue to issue CLOs and to have the treatment of that economically work for them in terms of what's on the balance sheet. The commentary from policymakers and regulatory officials, I think, has recognized that challenge and they're looking for a solution that's not going to be disruptive to the market.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. That's helpful. And then, last one for me. Just on your fourth quarter repurchases, did about $145 million to get to $893 million for the year. Obviously, it came in a little bit below your $1 billion guidance. Was there something about the market conditions in the fourth quarter that slowed the pace or what was going on with that?","Linda S. Huber","Sure. It's Linda. As we've talked about before, we put in place our repurchase grid shortly after we give the previous quarter's earnings. So we have to do that during a window period. And our stock price, we were very fortunate, had a rather dramatic increase in the fourth quarter. So we didn't get as much done as we wanted to, but we'll take another look as we move through this period and see how we do for 2014.","Operator","Next is Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just want to ask a few about Moody's Analytics. To start with, I guess, the RD&A part, I know you said it was kind of high retention and strong new sales. But can you give us any more color on what type of products? Are there new products? I guess, what's driving the strong new sales right now, and anything you've done or what's behind it just to know if it's sustainable.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Sure. I'm going to turn this over to Mark Almeida.","Mark E. Almeida","In the RD&A business, we've seen good sales volume really across the product portfolio. Demand continues to be very strong for the rating agency, research and data, which are the biggest pieces of the business. So when they do well, the RD&A segment does well. We've also seen good new sales production in the economics business, particularly in the fourth quarter. So I think that, overall, there's just been very good demand for what we're doing in the business. We've done a bit of new product innovation and have introduced a couple of new ways of delivering our content in a packaged way. So that's helped as well. But the retention has really been quite strong. And given the size of the business, that's very, very beneficial.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, my only other question here, ERS, you gave a commentary about U.S. versus international revenue, I guess, which can be lumpy. But if we looked at the bookings numbers or trailing sales numbers that you gave, are you -- is there a similar distinction between U.S. versus international performance? Or was that just the timing of revenue recognition for that business?","Mark E. Almeida","No, it's entirely a timing phenomenon there. The sales production is much more consistent from region to region. But the revenue results are -- can be wildly different because they're driven by what projects get done and when they get completed. And so we just had a number of very large projects that got completed in the fourth quarter in the U.S. And by contrast, in the fourth quarter last year, we had some very big projects outside the U.S. getting done. So as you said, purely a timing phenomenon.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess one more if I could, I forgot, I may have missed it, but can you tell us what the incentive comp was for the quarter?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Sure.","Linda S. Huber","Sure. Let me take that out. Incentive compensation for the quarter was $47 million, and that was down from about $60 million in this quarter last year. The actual change was $12.7 million. So while we had a good and strong fourth quarter, it was not as strong as last year's fourth quarter where we had to catch up a bit on our incentive compensation.","Operator","And we'll go to Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, a couple -- you made a couple of comments about expanded headcount going into '14. Linda, is there any numbers you can give around that?","Linda S. Huber","Sure. Happy to do that. We're looking at -- for 2013, we had a headcount increase of about 9% for the previous year, and that excluded the acquisition that we had done with Amba. So looking to 2014, we're looking at sort of a similar rate of headcount increase. But one of the things that we're noting is that about 80% of that increase is to the lines of business, in other words, not the support function. So that 80% ratio is important. We're looking to make sure that the businesses are appropriately staffed for the investments we're making and the strong growth that we've seen.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, just one follow-up on revenues. I think the press release implied that 40 -- roughly 43% of MIS revenues in the quarter were international. When you look specifically at the corporate finance where international was particularly strong, is it a similar percent there or is it slightly higher?","Linda S. Huber","Sure. For the corporate finance line for Q4 of 2013, international was 39% of the total, and U.S. was 61% of the total for the fourth quarter 2013. And the year's numbers, the percentages look about the same.","Operator","And next is Edward Atorino with Benchmark.","Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","My questions have been answered.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll now go to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to try and understand the operating expense guidance that you gave by division and maybe more specifically, I guess, the skew with the contribution of Amba. Like how should we think about what the incremental expense contribution there would be on the MA side?","Linda S. Huber","Sure, Manav. You may not be too happy with this answer, but I think we're going to stick with our mid single-digit, and you can probably infer from what I said regarding the headcount numbers that we're looking to have the stronger growth rates in expense be in the operating division lines, which we think is appropriate to drive the growth. But we'd rather not get into that level of detail, if that's okay.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then, I guess, in terms of the issuance by plan, et cetera, that you guys see. I mean, I think, last year, you're taking a shot at sort of the initial quarterly phasing maybe of how that might play out, would you care to take a shot at that now?","Raymond W. McDaniel","I think the revenue pattern, which is going to relate to the issuance pattern, is going to be similar to what we saw in 2013 with relatively stronger quarters in the second and fourth quarter. That is a typical pattern. It has not been consistently followed in recent years but it has been a pattern we've seen historically, and we are anticipating that 2014 is going to look somewhat like 2013 in terms of that sawtooth.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then last one for me. I guess, you don't have any slide on any regulatory or any other update. Nothing to report there, basically?","Raymond W. McDaniel","No. We are in the process of being inspected and reviewed, examined by regulators in different jurisdictions around the world. We've gone through significant effort to make sure that we are complying with new rules and regulations, and those are largely complete, although not fully complete and we'll have to continue to develop some new compliance programs. But it's nothing that, I think, is at the policy level at this point. It's really more about inspections, examinations and compliance.","Operator","And we'll go to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","I've got some housekeeping questions here first. Linda, this 33% tax rate guidance for 2014, can you just give us a further update, why it's come up roughly 150 basis points?","Linda S. Huber","Sure, Craig. We did extraordinarily well on the tax rate in 2013, and we had some things, that we don't expect to repeat, break our way. Predicting the effective tax rate is one of the hardest things that we do because at this point in the year, the tax rate is difficult to forecast because we have some tax law changes that are said to be happening, and they are in flux. So for example, there are 2 pieces in the U.S. that you might want to look up. One is the extension of look-through provisions and the second is R&D tax credits, both of those at the present time are not expected to be extended in the U.S. Now that may change. That has changed in previous years. But we're taking a conservative view, and we're planning that those 2 factors will not be extended. So those things, along with a couple of other factors, are causing us to ask you to look at an effective tax rate of 33% for 2014. We understand that's up from 2013, and we'll continue to work on it in our usual conservative manner. But that's what we're working with right now, and we can only plan for the best that we know.","Craig Huber","And then, also, I was just wondering, your thoughts here, Ray or Linda, as you know, your main competitor, S&P's transaction revenues were down about 12% in the quarter. Yours were down about 5.5%. Do you guys view that as just noise or is there's some market share you're picking that you want to really highlight here?","Raymond W. McDaniel","We've had some improvements in market share, for example, in European structured finance. But their -- I can only speak to our numbers. I wouldn't speak to our competitors. And trying to look at this on a longer term basis, though, I think we have to look at the mix, both geographically and by security type, and areas where we are traditionally strong are more active in certain quarters than in others and vice versa. So it does take some time to try and get through the noise. And so I would -- I'm cautious about predicting any long-term trends out of this.","Craig Huber","A couple of more questions, please. Can you just give us an update on the legal front, particularly the Calpers case, please?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Not a lot to report on the Calpers case. The matter is still in the California courts. We filed an appeal, a court appeal, seeking a reversal of the lower court decision denying our motion to dismiss under this anti-SLAPP statute. And the briefing on the appeal was completed a few months ago, and we don't know when the case will be argued or decided at this point.","Craig Huber","My last question. Linda, can you just help break apart the revenues, a little finer detail here within your ratings business. Like within corporate finance, for example, can you break out the percentages or dollars for high-yield versus bank loans and also the other 3 large categories, please?","Linda S. Huber","Sure, Craig. So what we're looking at here is fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to the fourth quarter of '12, and I'll start with the corporate finance line, as you asked for, Craig. So investment grade, it was 23% of the total CFG line, which was about $243 million. The high yield portion of 2014's revenue was 21% or $50 million, which is down from 24% in 2012. Bank loans were at 20%, which is the same as last year, and other was 37%, up a bit from last year's 34%. Moving on to the other lines of business now, turning to structured finance, asset-backed securities, 25% of structured revenue line of about $109 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, that was down a bit from last year's 28%. RMBS was 19% of structured revenues for the fourth quarter, that's flat to last year. Commercial real estate finance was 32%, up from last year's 28%. We had spoken about that earlier. And structured credit, what's also known as derivatives, was 24% of that total, about flat to last year's 25%. Going on to financial institutions, about $89 million of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2013. And banking was about 71% of that total or about $64 million. That was down a bit from last year's 73%. Insurance was 22% of the number, flat to last year's 22%, and managed investments was 6% of the total, which was up a bit from last year's 5%. Moving on last to public project and infrastructure, total number for the quarter was about $83 million. Public finance and sovereign, 43% or $35 million, which was down from last year's 47%. Munis was about 5% of the total, down a bit from last year's 6%. And project and infrastructure, as we have noted, at about $43 million, up to 52% of the total, down from last year's -- excuse me, up from last year's 47%.","Craig Huber","If I could just ask one follow-up there. The sovereign piece of that public finance and sovereign line, how insignificant right now, I guess, for the full year was sovereign?","Linda S. Huber","I think, we...","Raymond W. McDaniel","We don't disclose the dollar figures but it's small.","Linda S. Huber","Yes, I think, a few percent, Craig, is what we've said before. It's frankly not particularly material.","Operator","And we'll go to Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Real quick. I guess, only a couple of follow-ups. On the guidance, I think, the one thing to dig in a little bit, if you may, on the structured side, obviously, that's the lowest growth and you talked about it a little bit. Is it just conservatism and considering that, that business has been so lumpy and so uncertain, I mean, there's been times when we thought they were green shoots and then markets like RMBS kind of collapsed again, and maybe more recently, it's like ABS has been a little bit more in demand. Can you just talk about what you're seeing out there, what we should be looking for and if there is a resurgence like where you expect it to come and what we should be looking for?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Well, I guess, to answer the beginning part of your question, I hope our guidance is conservative on structured. And there are a lot of uncertainties, as we talked about earlier, what happens with CLOs from a regulatory perspective, what is going to happen with the residential mortgage-backed securities market and its pace of growth. The European market, which has been very soft and whether that's going to experience a recovery in 2014. There are some good reasons to believe that each of these can break in a favorable way, but they remain uncertainties at this point. And then, I guess, the last item I'd just point to is actually the economics of doing these transactions, which can be subject to interest rates and spreads between high-grade and lower-grade securities. So there is just an economics question in terms of when it's attractive to issue these securities.","Linda S. Huber","Alex, it's Linda. I'd also continue to point out that, as we said, the greatest strength we're seeing is in the commercial real estate line, which had moved up nicely in the fourth quarter. And also, REITs. So those are the places where we're seeing strength. As you pointed out, RMBS is, for the fourth quarter, is about flat from last year. And it would probably be fair if we ask Michel if he had anything further that he could add that Ray and I have not mentioned.","Michel A. Madelain","Nothing much. I think, you covered pretty much -- the other place where we see some potential improvement is ABS in Europe basically, is one place but...","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, maybe just lastly, just to come back on the tax rate and maybe it's not a fair question but, I mean, obviously -- the incremental color there but if I think about your guidance and you're looking at stronger growth next year, or this year, in outside of the U.S. And I think about tax rate changes in the U.K. for example, rates are going down. And then, in general, rates seem to be lower outside of the U.S. Shouldn't conceptually that still be a helpful driver? Or do you think you've exhausted all those opportunities already?","Linda S. Huber","Well, Alex, we're going to continue to work hard on it and look region-by-region at what we can do. On the tax rate, again, we take a conservative approach to this. I spoke a little bit about some of the U.S. things that are pending but for right now, we don't have an extension of previous provisions. In Europe, we do see some countervailing trends. There have been changes in the U.K., which have been -- had the result of moving things up a bit in terms of rates in the U.K., so you might want to take a look at that. But again, if we have progress on the tax line and if we have a change to the estimated tax rate, we will be happy to tell you about that in future quarter calls if we get that. But again, we understand that this is an important factor. If you look at the difference, it looks like it will cost us about $0.12 in EPS, and we're mindful that, that is a change that's not helpful. But we'll continue to work at it, as we said.","Operator","And we'll now go to Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question, Ray, on how you're thinking about M&A and whether your pipeline going into '14 is stronger versus '13. It seems like there are a lot more assets out on the market. Maybe give us a sense of what your feel is there?","Raymond W. McDaniel","I think, our internal pipeline would look similar in 2014 to 2013. We've talked about this before. We look at a lot of potential opportunities and we're very -- we think we're very vigorous in the assets that we actually choose to pursue. And I've said before also, I think the likelihood of doing something transformative is relatively low. So we would be looking more for assets that have the kind of size and synergies that we've seen with our recent acquisitions, whether it's Amba, Copal or going back a couple of years to some of the acquisitions we made in the enterprise risk solutions business.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. Just a quick follow-up, I'll turn it over. Could you maybe compare your competitive positioning and exposure within the U.S. versus the European structured finance market?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Sure. And I'll ask Michel to offer his views on this. We -- at a high level, we have a very good position in both markets. There are areas where we have traditionally been stronger and that includes commercial mortgage-backed securities, CLOs, the residential mortgage-backed securities market in Europe. And so you can see where we're strong and the markets are active, we obviously benefit from that. Conversely, European RMBS, which has been quite dormant, especially in the U.K., is an area where, if it were more active, I think, the strength we have in that market would come and help our top line certainly. Michel, did you want to...","Michel A. Madelain","No. I mean, only point I would add is covered bonds [ph] mainly where, so we have a very strong position and [indiscernible] have been very soft lately and we benefit or gain from [indiscernible].","Operator","And we'll now go to Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First question, I mentioned in your current views on the opportunity to rate debt in Asia. How much of the international revenue did that account for in 2013? And do you have any view on where that could go based on either the macro or a conversation that you're having with clients in the region?","Raymond W. McDaniel","Yes, our -- the -- our Asian revenue is still relatively small. It is -- I'll put out a number and my colleagues will correct me. I think it's about 13% of our total. And it's an area of growth, but it's an area where disintermediation has been lagging behind what we've seen in Europe and certainly the United States. So we've got good opportunities there. They are multiple types of opportunities, though, some of it on the ratings side of the business. And in the ratings side of the business, some of it in domestic markets such as Korea, China, India, and obviously, the cross-border markets as large firms in those countries access the international bond markets. We also have good opportunities in Moody's Analytics in the Asian markets, both with research, and in particular, with our enterprise risk solutions business. Do we have a number on that?","Linda S. Huber","Yes, we've got the -- for the overall corporation for the year, Ray's right, we're looking at low double-digits for international growth. And in terms of what we're seeing with the 2 businesses, I think, we might invite Michel and maybe Mark to speak a bit more about that, if they'd like to.","Michel A. Madelain","Yes, in Asia for us, corporate finance is really where we see the biggest opportunity and the biggest growth. And actually, last -- this year, we've seen among the highest growth rate in the business in that region actually. So that's all I have.","Mark E. Almeida","In MA, I would just -- I'd endorse what Ray said. It's a good market for us. And in particular, the research business in Asia has picked up nicely in 2013. Still relatively small scale but very healthy growth rate. So that's very good to see, very profitable business.","Linda S. Huber","So Andre, I think, in total, we're looking at 9% revenue growth for the company and we've just said low double-digits, you might infer that Asia is growing a little bit more rapidly on the whole across the businesses than maybe we're seeing in some of the other regions. But again, I would caution that's coming off of a small number, as Ray had said.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And any light that you'd be able to shed on what gives you confidence that the public project and infrastructure finance business is going to grow high single-digit next year? I know we just came off the first down quarter in some time, it's been pretty strong previously. Is it just the macro trends or is there something else specific that you're seeing in the pipeline?","Michel A. Madelain","What you have in that segment is really several businesses with very different dynamics. You have U.S. public finance, where we actually expect to continue to see a contraction of volumes this year. And this is offset by positive development in infrastructure and project outside of the U.S., similar to what we've seen this year.","Linda S. Huber","And Andre, going from memory, oftentimes, U.S. municipalities have to get their budgets in order. So I think, traditionally, we see that business is stronger toward the middle of the year than in the first quarter, so that's a trend we'll have to watch as well.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Ray McDaniel for any additional or closing remarks.","Raymond W. McDaniel","Okay. Thank you very much. I just want to mention that on Tuesday, September 30, we'll be hosting our Annual Investor Day. It will be at our headquarters here in lower Manhattan.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on this teleconference to discuss Moody's second quarter 2017 results as well as our current outlook for full year 2017. I am Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations and Communications.","This morning, Moody's released its results for the second quarter of 2017 as well as our current outlook for full year 2017. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our Web-site at ir.moodys.com.

I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Thank you, Salli. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's second quarter and first half 2017 financial results. Linda will follow with additional second quarter financial details and operating highlights. I will then conclude with comments on our current outlook for 2017. And after our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","Before addressing our financial results, I want to begin by saying that we still anticipate completing our proposed acquisition of Bureau Van Dijk in the third quarter. Beginning with our next earnings call, we should be able to discuss our financial results and guidance including the operations of Bureau Van Dijk. For this call however, we will limit our remarks to what we have disclosed in our earnings release this morning.","In the second quarter, Moody's achieved a record $1 billion in quarterly revenue, up 8% from the second quarter of 2016. Operating expense in the second quarter was $543 million, up 5%. Operating income was $458 million, up 12%, and adjusted operating income of $497 million was up 13%. We are defining adjusted operating income as operating income before depreciation, amortization and Bureau Van Dijk acquisition related expenses. The operating margin was 45.7%, up from 44.2% in the second quarter of 2016. The adjusted operating margin was 49.7%, up from 47.5%.","Moody's diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.61 per share, up 24% from the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.51, up 16%. Second quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS excludes the $41 million or $0.13 per share unrealized gain from a euro-denominated purchase price hedge relating to the pending Bureau Van Dijk acquisition as well as $7 million or $0.03 per share of acquisition related expenses.","Turning to the first half performance, Moody's revenue for the first half 2017 was almost $2 billion, up 13% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion, up 12%, while non-U.S. revenue was $830 million, up 15%. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible.","Moody's Investors Service first half revenue of almost $1.4 billion was up 18% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue was $835 million, up 14%, while non-U.S. revenue was $520 million, up 25%. Moody's Analytics revenue for the first half of 2017 was $621 million, a 4% increase over the prior year. U.S. revenue of $311 million was up 7%, while non-U.S. revenue of $310 million was up 2%.","Operating expense for the first half of 2017 was almost $1.1 billion, up 4% from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%. Operating income was $901 million, up 26%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by 1%. Adjusted operating income of $973 million was up 25%. Moody's operating margin was 45.6% and its adjusted operating margin was 49.2%.","The effective tax rate for the first half of 2017 was 27.8%, down from 32.1% in the prior year period. The decline was primarily due to a non-cash non-taxable gain related to a strategic realignment and expansion involving Moody's Chinese affiliate, CCXI, as well as a benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard for equity compensation.","Given the strength of the first half and a supportive market environment, we are raising our full year 2017 diluted EPS guidance to a range of $5.69 to $5.84. This range includes the $0.31 per share CCXI gain, the $0.13 per share purchase price hedge gain, and $0.10 per share of Bureau Van Dijk acquisition related expenses. Excluding these items, we anticipate full-year adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.50.","I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda S. Huber","Thanks Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the Company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the second quarter was a record $1 billion, up 8%. U.S. revenue of $568 million was up 4%. Non-U.S. revenue of $433 million was up 13% and represented 43% of Moody's total revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on Moody's revenue was negligible. Recurring revenue of $489 million was up 6% and represented 49% of total revenue.","Looking now to each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service, total MIS revenue for the quarter was $687 million, up 10%. U.S. revenue increased 3% to $412 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $274 million was up 21% and represented 40% of total MIS revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.","Moving now to the lines of business for MIS; first, corporate finance revenue for the second quarter was $356 million, up 17%. This result reflected a favorable mix within each of U.S. leveraged finance and EMEA investment grade issuance as well as strong growth in EMEA bank loan and Asian bond issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were up 6% and 40% respectively.","Second, structured finance revenue totaled $119 million, up 7%, primarily driven by the continued strength of U.S. CLO issuance. U.S. structured finance revenue was up 12% while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%.","Third, financial institutions revenue of $102 million was up 14%. This result was largely driven by an increase in issuance from infrequent issuers in EMEA. U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions revenue were up 8% and 20% respectively.","Fourth, public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $105 million was down 7%. This result was primarily driven by a decline in U.S. issuance and a change in mix of European infrastructure issuance. The revenue decline was partially offset by strong growth in infrastructure issuance in Asia. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was down 12% while non-U.S. revenue was up 4%.","Finally, MIS Other, which consist of non-rating revenue from ICRA in India and Korea Investor Service, contributed $5 million to MIS revenue for the second quarter, down 37%. The decline is attributable to the divestiture of a non-core subsidiary of ICRA in late 2016.","Turning now to Moody's Analytics, total revenue for MA of $314 million was up 3.5%. U.S. revenue of $155 million was up 6%. Non-U.S. revenue of $158 million was up 1% and represented 50% of total MA revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MA revenue was negligible.","And now moving to the lines of business for MA; first, research, data and analytics, or RD&A, revenue of $181 million was up 7% and represented 58% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly driven by strength in sales of credit research and ratings data feeds. U.S. and non-U.S. RD&A revenues were up 6% and 10% respectively.","Second, enterprise risk solutions, or ERS, revenue of $97 million was flat to the prior year period. This result was primarily due to the timing of revenue recognition for customer projects, many of which are expected to complete in the second half of the year. U.S. ERS revenue was up 7% while non-U.S. revenue was down 5%. Trailing 12-month revenue and sales for ERS increased 6% and 14% respectively, primarily due to the 2016 acquisition of GGY. We continue to make progress on shifting the mix of the ERS business to emphasize higher-margin product with trailing 12-month product sales of 21% and services sales declining by 4%.","Third, professional services revenue of $36 million was down 5%. U.S. professional services revenue was up 6% while non-U.S. revenue was down 10%.","And turning now to operating expenses, Moody's second quarter operating expense was $543 million, up 5%. The increase was primarily attributable to annual salary increases, higher accruals for incentive compensation, and expenses related to the pending acquisition of Bureau Van Dijk. This increase was partially offset by a decline in non-compensation expense and a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 2%.","As Ray mentioned, Moody's operating margin was 45.7%, up 150 basis points from 44.2% in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating margin was 49.7%, up 220 basis points from 47.5% a year ago. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.1%, up from 31.9% in the prior year period.","Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the second quarter of 2017, Moody's repurchased approximately 700,000 shares at a total cost of $79.5 million or an average cost of $115.35 per share. Moody's also issued approximately 400,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan.","Moody's returned $73 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the second quarter of 2017, and on July 11 the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share of Moody's common stock. This dividend will be payable on September 12, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 22, 2017.","Over the first half of 2017, Moody's repurchased 1.2 million shares at a total cost of $134.5 million or an average cost of $114.06 per share, and issued approximately 1.9 million shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. Moody's also returned $145 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the first half. Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2017 totaled 191 million, down 1% from a year ago. As of June 30, 2017, Moody's had approximately $600 million of share repurchase authority remaining.","As part of Moody's financing of the pending acquisition of Bureau van Dijk, on June 12, 2017, Moody's closed its issuance of $1 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of $500 million of 2.625% notes due 2023 and $500 million of 3.25% notes due 2028. Prior to issuing these notes, Moody's had an undrawn bridge loan facility. The incremental financing expenses associated with these items amounted to $0.03 per share in the second quarter. At quarter end, Moody's had $4.9 billion of outstanding debt and $1.5 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility and undrawn term loan.","Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were almost $3.4 billion, with approximately 58% held outside the U.S. Cash flow from operations for the first half of 2017 was negative $48 million, a decline from a positive $546 million in the first half of 2016. Free cash flow for the first half of 2017 was negative $91 million, a decline from positive $492 million in the prior year period. The declines in cash flow from operations and free cash flow were due to payments the Company made in the first quarter 2017 pursuant to its 2016 settlement with the Department of Justice and various states attorneys general.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Okay, thanks Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for 2017. A complete list of Moody's guidance is included in Table 11 of our second quarter 2017 earnings press release, which can be found on the Moody's Investor Relations Web-site at ir.moodys.com.","Moody's outlook for 2017 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions, and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and the results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.","Our outlook assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.30 to GBP1 and for the euro of $1.14 to EUR1. As I noted previously, this guidance does not include revenue and operating expense estimates related to our pending acquisition of Bureau Van Dijk.","Moody's now expects full year 2017 diluted EPS to be $5.69 to $5.84, including the CCXI gain, the purchase price hedge gain, and acquisition related expenses for Bureau Van Dijk. Excluding these items, full-year 2017 adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be $5.35 to $5.50. Both ranges include an estimated $0.16 per share tax benefit due to the adoption of the new accounting standard for equity compensation as well as an estimated $0.10 per share impact from financing expenses related to the pending acquisition of Bureau Van Dijk, and an estimated $0.04 per share impact related to reduction in share repurchase activity as a consequence of financing the acquisition.","The adjusted operating margin is now expected to be approximately 47%. Moody's now expects full year 2017 revenue to increase in the high single-digit percent range.","For MIS, full year 2017 revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range also. U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the mid single-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low teens percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now expected to increase in the low teens percent range. Financial institutions revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range.","For MA, full-year 2017 revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the mid single-digit percent range and non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range. RD&A revenue is now expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range.","Before turning to Q&A, a reminder that we continue to expect our previously announced acquisition of Bureau Van Dijk to close in the third quarter of 2017. As a result, we are not able to provide any updates for you regarding the pending acquisition beyond what we have said in the earnings release.","This concludes our prepared remarks, and so joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics, and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investors Service. We'd be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","Within corporate finance, you had a very strong first half and you've increased guidance for the year. Could you give some additional color on the drivers? Is it just issuance related or is pricing or share gains also playing a factor there? And also, just which regions have been very strong? It looks like the non-U.S. business is where you're really expecting the benefit?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","I'll turn this over to Rob to provide some color, but you are correct, we had very strong performance in the leveraged loan and spec rate portions of the market and the non-U.S. growth was very strong as well. So Rob, I don't know if you wanted to provide any color commentary on that.","Robert Fauber","The first point there in regards to kind of the drivers of revenue growth, there were a few things that played into it for this quarter. First, we had a very favorable mix of issuance. And by this, I mean that we saw very strong issuance from issuers who are typically infrequent issuers rather than issuers on relationship based arrangements with us. As Ray mentioned, U.S. bank loans, we saw a very healthy activity there. And we benefitted from issuance that was a bit more broad-based than last year where we had several kind of super-jumbo transactions included in the volume. So, this broader issuance generally leads to better revenue yield. We had very strong growth in first time mandates also contributing to that favorable mix. And as Ray mentioned, some pockets of very strong issuance growth, particularly outside the United States, EMEA bank loans, Asian corporate finance, Canada, to spotlight three.","Toni Kaplan","Okay, great. And then you raised the MA guidance to high singles from mid and basically because of the RD&A line, and so could you just give us some color on why your confidence has increased in that business segment, and so what's really driving your higher confidence for that for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Mark E. Almeida","Sure. This is Mark. We're getting some benefit from the stronger pound and euro, but on a constant dollar basis, growth is pushing up from high single-digits to double-digits and we're seeing good underlying performance in the business with better-than-expected yield from price, new sales production and net upgrades, somewhat offset by higher attrition. So overall, the business is firm across all of the different product areas, and it's just pushing us up slightly from high single to the lower end of double-digits.","Operator","Thank you, and we'll go next to Alex Kramm from UBS.","Alex Kramm","Just maybe stepping back and asking more broadly about the guidance here, obviously a great first half of the year. If I look at typical seasonality, I think the guidance suggests a slowdown that's usually a little bit bigger than what we would expect typically. So maybe just some commentary around what is conservatism or are there actually any particular areas that make you think that some of the current run rates are not sustainable and some of this was more one-time than usual?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","We certainly think that there has been pull-forward into the first half, including the second quarter. How much opportunistic financing is still going to occur in the second half pulling forward from 2018, we'll just have to see, but borrowing conditions do remain good, rates are low, spreads are narrow. So, that's all positive.","Also, I would say in terms of the second half, we're cognizant of the fact that we are going to be compared against a strong second half in 2016. And so while we think there's going to be healthy activity, the comparables are more challenging in the second half.","Alex Kramm","All right, makes sense. And then maybe just shifting gears away from earnings for a second here, I wanted to ask you about BVD. When you had the call and you were pointing out the strong growth that these guys had, I think like 9% CAGR or so plus, I think there was a sense that a lot of that was true growth and very little pricing, and I think there's an expectation that you can do more there down the line. When we do our own channel checks, it actually sounds like pricing has been a fairly healthy component. In some cases, maybe there was even a goal to like, you renew or do you want to have now maybe close to like 10% increases from time to time again. These might be one-off conversations, but the point is, can you just compare and contrast what we may have heard and kind of like the sense that you'll have post the call now that you maybe have spent a little bit more time?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Yes, I mean to answer generally, I think the answer is the same as how we think about pricing for the rest of Moody's Corporation. We are going to be very focused on what kind of additional value can be provided, the synergies that we talked about, and that any pricing that we would seek to increase would be associated with the growth in value of the product and data that we're making available.","Operator","Thank you, and we'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","The first question is just around guidance. I was wondering if you could maybe flesh out the benefit you had from FX both on the top line and EPS.","Linda S. Huber","Sure, Manav. Hang on just one second.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","It was not material in the second quarter. It was negligible on revenue and I think it was 1% on expense.","Linda S. Huber","And Manav, to anticipate, if you're wondering about the full 2017 outlook, we're expecting a 2% favorable impact on revenue growth, and as Ray had said, a minimal slightly unfavorable impact on expense growth. Does that help you out?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","That's for the full year.","Manav Patnaik","Yes, great. That's what I was looking for. Okay, and then just broadly I guess maybe tying into the typical expense ramp that you usually give us Linda, it sounds like you're generally a little bit [indiscernible] in the second half, understanding that [indiscernible] and so forth, but what is I guess the cost control focus look like now at the Company?","Linda S. Huber","Sure, Manav. In answering the ramp question, looking at the first quarter expense run rate to the fourth quarter, now we're looking at a ramp of $40 million to $50 million, and previously we had said $30 million to $40 million. Some of that is because our projects are stretching out a little bit further into the year and we do expect some hiring in some of the businesses. However, we're keeping very close, very tight handle on hiring around here and we do continue very much to focus on expense controls, focus on T&E, but particularly using caution in hiring particularly in the higher cost areas and looking to substitute where possible in other locations. So, we continue that focus throughout the year.","Operator","Thank you, and we'll go next to Tim McHugh from William Blair.","Timothy McHugh","Maybe just to ask on Europe, I think in the past you've had somewhat of a mixed view of the opportunity there given GDP growth versus the secular trend. Obviously trends are very strong lately I guess, found out from one of the earlier questions. Has your view of the importance there or the pace of growth that we could expect to see during the next few years internationally changed at all or improved at all?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","No, I think for both Europe and the U.S., we expect growth to be modest, GDP growth, and then debt growth to be modest. But the mix of debt that is in the banking system versus the capital markets, we certainly expect to continue to see this intermediation trend continue. And that is the European story, actually a global story, but it's definitely a European story as well.","And given the caution in Europe about the pace at which they might engage in any tapering, I think we're going to continue to see a good market environment, good market tone going forward. And that is a little more optimistic than I had been at certain points in the past.","Linda S. Huber","Tim, it's Linda. Let me just interject here. The issuers we're hearing from, a number of the investment banks that we talk to, and then Rob Fauber may have some more granular color for you, but looking at the European markets, and again this is not a Moody's view but rather what we're hearing from the banks, they are saying they are expecting the second half of 2017 volumes to be in line with first half activity as issuance volumes pick back up after the post-summer slowdown.","As Ray had noted, the spreads in rates remained very attractive and we'll see what happens with the tapering. In spec rate in Europe, the leveraged loan market remains robust, but some softness crept into high-yield given where we are in the calendar year, as is typical with the summer issuance weakening a bit.","Most of the refinancing expected in 2017 may have already occurred, but fundamentals are improving, economic growth looks reasonable, and there's the overhang of uncertainty from Brexit. Maybe Rob might want to speak a little bit more specifically about what he's seeing in MIS.","Robert Fauber","The only other thing I would add to that and echo Ray and Linda's comments, we've seen very strong issuance growth there. That continued through the French and U.K. elections. Lots of investor interest, lots of cash to invest there. And we've also seen a pickup in first time mandate activity in EMEA, recent activity about 2x what we have been seeing over the last year or two. So a very good indicator about first-time issuers coming into the market, and as Ray said, that this in the year should trend.","Timothy McHugh","Okay, great. And can I follow-up on RD&A? Mark, I understand kind of the metrics you gave in terms of new sales and pricing, but I guess one part is, can you comment on where you've seen higher attrition? And secondarily, the improved sales that's leading to the higher revenue growth, given there's a bunch of different solutions you provide within RD&A, can you elaborate on what parts I guess of that segment are seeing a stronger demand or stronger growth?","Mark E. Almeida","On the attrition point, I would characterize the higher attrition as very idiosyncratic, a couple of selective cases of attrition but not anything systematic, either by product or customer type or geography. On the positive side, this strength in the business, as I said earlier, is really across the board. We're seeing good sales production and pricing power and customer upgrades and new sales production in really all of our product areas. So I really can't pinpoint it to any one thing, but it's just better-than-expected performance along a number of dimensions and across a number of businesses.","And just to be clear, we're seeing good solid performance and I wouldn't characterize what we're seeing as a dramatic improvement in the business. We expected the business to do well. It's doing a bit better than we expected, and if I say, that's pushing us into double-digit growth, and again it's no one geography or product area that I can really point to.","Operator","Thank you and we'll go next to Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Silber","Now that it looks like down in D.C. we're moving away from healthcare reform back to tax reform, I'm just wondering if you're hearing any updates about the potential change in the deductibility of corporate interest expense and what the impact might be on your business?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","I have not heard anything that is in the public discourse about the tax reform expectations, and really there are just a large number of variables and until we see how the different trade-offs are made and interact with each other, it's going to be difficult to predict.","Linda S. Huber","[Tim] [ph], it's Linda. I just also wanted to reiterate, we've said this before but I just want to make sure you have it handy, if it does happen that corporate tax rates move downward, a 1% change in our estimated tax rate is equal to $0.07 to $0.08 of EPS. So, if you want to play around with potential scenarios, you can do it with that guideline.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay, that's helpful. And then actually a couple of numbers questions for you, Linda. What share count is embedded in your guidance for the year and can you give us an update on what your expected interest expense is for the year as well? Thanks so much.","Linda S. Huber","So I'm not going to give you a share count for the year. You can take a look at the share count that we have. We have said that given that we are committed to delevering given the acquisition expense of Bureau Van Dijk, we are reducing the guidance on our share repurchases to approximately $200 million for both 2017 and 2018, and job one for Moody's right now is to delever from the financing cost for Bureau Van Dijk. So you can do some math there, Jeff, and I think you probably could come up with something that looks reasonable. I'm sorry, your second question was?","Jeffrey Silber","Was on interest expense.","Linda S. Huber","Sure. So in thinking about interest expense, we have been running at a rate that we had viewed as pretty normal of sort of $35 million a year rate in 2016. Now this year that rate has kicked up because we did do some issuance of $800 million in the first quarter of the year. And then it's pretty important that everyone understands how we've handled the financing of Bureau Van Dijk.","So we announced the deal, you'll recall, on May 15th and at that point we had a bridge loan in place. We replaced that bridge loan on June 12 and we returned that bridge loan with public bonds, a long five-year bond and a long 10-year bond. The blended interest rate on those financings is 2.94%. So we are going to pay with sort of a third a third a third in cash those bond proceeds and also we have commercial paper and a term loan facility if we want to use that.","So again, you'll see that the financing impact of all of that for the year is about $29 million or $0.10. So, hopefully that will help you out in terms of thinking about what the additional financing cost will be for the year.","Operator","Thank you, and we'll go next to Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi","I was wondering if you could give us some idea of how conservative you are on the second-half performance of issuance. It sounded like the environment is good, things are picking up. Outside of comps, is there anything else that we should \u2013 that you are concerned about and anything kind of holding you back?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Again, as I had mentioned, the pull forward that we saw into the first half of the year creates some uncertainty for the second half. There is still a sizable amount of debt that can be pulled forward and conditions remain good, but whether that will happen or not, I think a lot of the debt that was maturing late in 2017 has already been refinanced, so we'd be looking into the out years to see what might get pulled forward. Rob, did you want to add to that?","Robert Fauber","The only thing I would add kind of touching on that is just kind of the sustainability of this bank loan refinancing cycle that we're in. That's a question mark. Another question mark, just an unforeseen event, market volatility, and I think some potential upside if we see a pickup in public finance, U.S. public finance refunding activity.","Linda S. Huber","Let me maybe jump in here, and for the completeness of the record, I'll get the indications that we're hearing from the issuing banks for the year. On investment grade, year-to-date it's been about $720 billion of investment grade issuance, and for the year now the call is for investment-grade issuance to be down 5% to 10%. Rates have moved a bit higher but [indiscernible] stable, overall condition is very constructive. The first half of 2017 was on pace with record 2016 levels, but generally there may be a slowdown in the second half, as Rob had just talked about.","The M&A pipeline is a bit lighter than in the previous two years. So that would be another factor that weighs on our thinking about the back half of the year. In high-yields, $150 billion issuance to date, calling for flat to up 5% in high yields. The markets are resilient despite concerns about stressed retailers and a bit of weakness in the energy sector. Underlying demand has continued to be strong. But again, the same comment that the pipeline is a bit lighter given the lack of M&A and many of the refinancings that were scheduled have already been completed.","Lastly, leveraged loans in the U.S., $400 billion to date, that is up 30%, and as Rob had said, we have to think about whether that will continue. Spreads have been tighter, very strong loan refinancing and repricing activity. Also note, $55 billion of CLO formation year-to-date and we'll have to watch the pace of that as well. Heavy loan, mutual fund inflows, and very strong investor demand. So, you might want to take all of that into consideration in thinking about your own views for the back half of the year.","Joseph Foresi","Right, thanks. And then just on Analytics, can you update us on how much of the growth this quarter was maybe related to timing or some pent-up demand or regulatory change? It sounded like you think that the business is just pushing forward maybe to higher growth rate. But I just want to see if any of that took place just given all the political changes here in the U.S.? Thanks.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","No, I don't think we saw that happening in the first half of the year. You're right to observe that some of the regulatory pressure on financial institutions around the world is lightening up, but the demand for what we do is being driven by other interest and other requirements on the part of the banks. But I don't think we saw any pull forward in activity related to regulation in any way.","Operator","Thank you and we'll go next to Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert","So Linda or Mark, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of commentary on margin trends in the Analytics business. Not to be greedy but I'm wondering why the margin performance isn't a bit better given the strength you're seeing in your higher profit businesses and also the shift in the ERS, why that isn't theoretically showing up in margin performance yet?","Mark E. Almeida","Peter, I think it's because we've always said that in any given quarter, the margin isn't going to be that \u2013 isn't going to tell you all that much about the business, and I think this quarter is a very good example of that because we had light revenue in ERS due to the project timing issue. So, we were light on the top line, the expenses were what the expenses were, and we did have some additional expense coming through related to the Bureau Van Dijk transaction. So again, I don't think you can gain an awful lot of information from either the operating margin or the adjusted operating margin in the quarter.","I think more generally, we're continuing to make good progress on the work we're doing in ERS to drive higher profitability. We've talked about shifting from a business that has grown a lot through delivering these low margin implementation services. We are deemphasizing that work and putting a lot more emphasis on product sales. That is going well and we'll continue on that path. So, we feel like we're on a good trajectory with that and I think we'll continue to see progress over time. But again, any one quarter might not be consistent with the longer-term trend.","Linda S. Huber","And Peter, I probably should help Mark out here a bit. Mark has been pretty successful, and as we've talked about before, as his business is more successful, it does draw a bit more in terms of corporate allocations. So, that's part of the issue as well.","Peter Appert","Got it. And then Linda, for you, I'm wondering what your thought is on this concept of potentially moving to an adjusted EPS metric in conjunction with the Bureau Van Dijk transaction, where are you on that?","Linda S. Huber","Peter, we're contemplating that. We can't get the cart in front of the horse here because we don't own Bureau Van Dijk yet. So we have to wait until that closing occurs, which as Ray said, we expect to be on schedule in the third quarter. All of that appears to be going fine. At that point, we'll think about that and it's something we're discussing right now, but we'll have more to say about all that on the third quarter call.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","A couple of questions. Your guidance for structured finance for the rest of the year, I'd be curious as to hear what your underlying thoughts are on some of the categories, RMBS, CMBS, the other asset-backed categories, how you see them maybe playing out here in the second half of the year?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","For structured finance, we expect there to be year-over-year growth in the second half. The areas that have been strong, certainly I would point you to the CLO business, and there is still a substantial stock of potential assets to go into CLOs as the loan market has been so robust recently. So that would continue to be a promising area. I'll see if Rob wants to add anything further.","Robert Fauber","Sure, Ray. So ABS, we've experienced the market a little bit of a slowdown after a very active kind of February through May, but I think issuance will be supported in particular by some of these esoteric sectors like solar and handset.","In CMBS, kind of a stronger gen, I'd say an active rate of inquiries, the pipe is I'd say slightly stronger than it is this time last year. I'd note that there is some competition from alternative funding sources in the CMBS market, so banks, life co, et cetera. So it remains to be seen how many of these mortgages actually get put into the securitization market. I do think there's some optimism around the CMBS market there that the second half of 2017 will be a bit stronger as I think the view is that the market has generally worked through some of the risk retention [indiscernible].","CLO, as Ray said, in addition to the refi activity, a healthy pipeline, I think we're starting to see some of the SME type deals also come into that pipeline. RMBS, modestly stronger I'd say than this time last year with again a bit of a mix of different type of assets there. In Europe, it looks like a very healthy pipeline there and I think both in CLO, ABS and RMBS.","Craig Huber","And my other main question, you have a comment in your press release where you talk about financial institutions being driven in the quarter by increased issuance from frequent issuer \u2013 of infrequent issuers in Europe and Middle East and Africa. Could you just talk about that, what you think it offers for the rest of the year when these banks, seemingly [indiscernible] banks are not taking on a lot more [indiscernible] sit on this balance sheet, [indiscernible] you think?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","I'll take a crack at that. So you're right, we typically have a more relationship-based construct with the banks that tends to lead a very steady revenue growth. We saw this quarter some very robust issuances, as you say, from what are typically infrequent issuers. The growth in all regions, so a few different drivers I think at play. In the U.S., we actually saw an increase in bank loan financing activity in the managed investment sector. So that was a bit new with some infrequent issuer activity in the banking and insurance.","In Europe, a continuation of the trend that we saw in the first quarter into the second quarter, which I think we may continue to see throughout the rest of the year where banks are building their bail interval capital or bail interval debt to meet those [indiscernible] requirements. We also saw some opportunistic issuance in places like Sweden and the Middle East. So I think we're going to continue to see financing activity coming out of those Middle Eastern financial institutions.","And then lastly in Asia, despite the fact that we had lower [fig] [ph] issuance against the prior-year quarter, that revenue grows again supported by infrequent bank and also non-bank financial issuers in China. And again, I think we will continue to see some of that issuance activity.","Linda S. Huber","And Craig, it's Linda. For completeness, Rob might want to talk a little bit more about what he's seeing in new mandates as well. So if you want to go ahead with that, Rob?","Robert Fauber","Sure. A good story with the first time mandates, healthy leveraged finance markets are very conducive to first time issuers tapping the market. In the second quarter of 2017, we saw over 300 first time mandates. That's up almost 50% from the first quarter and up I think about 70% over 2Q 2016. That growth was in all very strong in all geographies, reflecting again the same comments we had about the leveraged finance markets, positive investor sentiment, tight spreads.","In Asia, I would also note a record \u2013 reached a record for first time mandates in the second quarter, and I had noted that the EMEA activity was significantly elevated over what we've seen the last couple of years. The only caveat to the Asian first time mandates, a number of those Chinese first time issuers have to get regulatory approval before they can actually issue. So there some of that issuance is still sitting on the sidelines.","But overall, we expect to see, I think we could see over 800 first time mandates in 2017, and that's up a bit from the levels we've seen in the last couple of years, which is kind of mid to higher 700s.","Craig Huber","If I could just squeeze one in, Linda, your 30% corporate tax rate guidance for the year, is that adjusted for the various one-time items we've seen in the first half, because it looks like you're tracking below that so far?","Linda S. Huber","Yes, but the year isn't over yet and we have to take into account the various things that are going to happen over the course of the year. Also we did have the CCXI situation which was favorable from a tax perspective. So give us a little bit of time as we get through the rest of the year on the tax rate, but for right now we're comfortable there.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Anjaneya Singh from Credit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh","I think you guys have touched on this stuff in other answers, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on margins. Clearly a strong quarter in the first half and there's many things contributing to that, but what are your thoughts on the sustainability of these high 40s margins in your guidance as we look ahead, how much of this is just the MIS mix and revenue flow-through that you've talked about versus the discipline and efficiency measures that you're also focused on, just any thoughts there?","Linda S. Huber","Sure. I'll take a start on this and then perhaps Ray might want to add some additional color. Margin is always a happier story for us when we have a strong revenue quarter, because we are pretty thoughtful about our expenses. So if we have a good top line, a lot of that comes down to operating income and helps us on the margin front.","For the year, we've guided to approximately 43%. And of course if the revenue line turns out to move more strongly than we think for the back half of the year, there is the potential that we could do better. But given everything that we've set out for the back half of the year, we like this 43% guidance for the rest of the year and we've thought about that pretty considerably. Ray, I don't know if you have anything else you'd like to add.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","No, just I mean I think everyone is aware of this, but obviously if the second half of the year slows in a way that is not expected, our incentive comp accruals would flex in response to that. And so, we do have some ability to course-correct depending on what's happening with the top line.","Anjaneya Singh","Understood, that's helpful. For second question on Analytics, could you just touch on ERS? The product sales growth continues to be super strong. Any updated views on what's sustainable or what the outlook there could be, how long do you think these double-digit rates can continue? And if you could just remind us what's driving the disparity between the U.S. and non-U.S. growth rates in that segment?","Mark E. Almeida","To take the second question first, the distinction between the U.S. and non-U.S. is really a timing phenomenon. The business is \u2013 from a sales perspective the business is doing well globally. So it's just what we're seeing on the revenue line, what projects are getting completed and what revenue is getting recognized, is variable by geography, it's not really indicative of anything fundamental about the business itself. So that really \u2013 again, I'd just emphasize that the business is performing well inside and outside the U.S.","With respect to the strong growth in product sales, that is a function of a couple of things. One, just generally the business is doing well, but also included in that very strong product sales growth on a trailing 12-months basis is the acquired sales from GGY. So you see them coming in and they are additive. So that's having a positive impact on sales growth.","But going forward, we would expect product sales to continue to grow at a double-digit rate. I mean that's how we've built the business, that's how we've constructed our product strategy. We see demand to support that and that's how we expect to continue to drive growth in ERS, is through strong sales of product, again as we deemphasize the low margin implementation services business. This has been a big growth driver on the top line in years past but hasn't done much for us on the margin.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay, got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you and we'll go next to Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.","William Warmington","So you had highlighted strength in the Asian high-yield issuance and I was hoping you could give us some color on the opportunity for you to rate Chinese domestic bonds, how that's progressing?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Sure. Rob probably will want to add to my comments, but we did complete the realignment of our CCXI business in domestic China. So that business is now eligible to rate both parts of the Chinese bond market. So we are looking at opportunities with CCXI and we're also looking at how we may be able to provide research and ratings either from onshore or from offshore from Moody's Investors Service really aimed at the foreign investment community as opposed to the domestic Chinese community, which I think really will continue to be served by CCXI.","William Warmington","Okay. And then one housekeeping item that wasn't clear to me. So BVD is on track to close in Q3. Are you planning to update the 2017 guidance when you close the deal or with Q3 earnings?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","I think we will get the deal closed. We don't know when that will happen yet. We expect it to be in the third quarter, but we don't know specifically when that will happen. And then we're going to have to get organized around what our outlook is once we're able to really get in and work with the Bureau Van Dijk team. So I would expect it to be the third quarter earnings call.","William Warmington","Got it. All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Vincent Hung from Autonomous.","Vincent Hung","Just one question, so can you talk about the mix of frequent issuers in Europe versus U.S., how many more U.S. frequent issuers are there versus Europe?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Europe has a higher percentage of issuers on frequent issuer programs and that's really I would say less a matter of preference in Europe versus the U.S. and more a matter of the relatively larger size of the U.S. speculative grade market which is characterized by infrequent issuers who don't find frequent issuer arrangements as attractive. So, I think that's really the story there.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ray McDaniel.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr.","Okay, thank you. Before we end the call, I want to remind everyone that Moody's will be hosting our next Investor Day in late February of 2018 here in New York City. We'll get more information on the Investor Relations Web-site as we get closer to the event. So, thank you everyone for joining today's call and we look forward to speaking with you in the fall.","Operator","And this concludes Moody's second quarter 2017 earnings call.

Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights, and I will then speak to recent regulatory developments and finish our comments with our outlook for 2012. After our prepared remarks we will be happy to respond to your questions.","Second quarter revenue was $641 million, increased 6% over the prior year period, reflecting solid growth in public finance and structured finance, as well as continued strong results for Moody\u2019s Analytics. Expenses for the second quarter were $362 million, an 8% increase from the second quarter of 2011. Operating income for the second quarter was $279 million, a 3% increase from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share was $0.76 for the second quarter, decreased $0.06 from the prior year period which had included a $0.06 favorable tax impact related to a foreign tax ruling and a $0.03 legacy tax benefit.","While market conditions remain volatile, we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance range of $2.62 to $2.72, and still expect to be towards the upper end of the range. Turning to the year-to-date performance, revenue for the first six months of 2012 was $1.3 billion, a 9% increase from the first half of 2011. Expenses were $740 million, up 12%, and operating income of $548 million, increased 5% from the prior year period.","Diluted earnings per share of $1.52 for the first half of 2012, increased $0.03 from the prior year period, which again had included a $0.06 favorable tax impact related to a foreign tax ruling a $0.03 legacy tax benefit. Revenue of Moody\u2019s Investors Service for the first six months of 2012 was $894 million, an increase of 5% from a year ago. Moody\u2019s Analytics revenue of $394 million was 19% higher than the prior year period.","I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on or financial results and other updates.","Linda Huber","Thanks, Ray. I will begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody\u2019s total revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $641 million. U.S. second quarter revenue increased 9% to $344 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 2% to $297 million and represented 46% of Moody\u2019s total revenue, down slightly from 48% in the year ago period. Recurring revenue of $338 million represented 53% of the total, up from 51% in the prior year period.","And looking now at each of our businesses. Moody\u2019s Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $441 million, about flat to prior year periods. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 3%. U.S. revenue for MIS increased 5% over the prior year period, while revenue outside the U.S. decreased 5% and represented 42% of total ratings revenue. Global Corporate Finance revenue in the second quarter declined 4% from the year ago period to $192 million. Revenue was down 4% year-over-year both inside and outside the U.S.","The decline in Global Corporate Finance revenue reflected weaker speculative grade bond and bank loan issuance against a near record prior year period. Investment grade issuance for non-financial corporate was higher year-over-year, reflecting continued historically low borrowing rates. Global Structured Finance revenue for the second quarter was $91 million, 5% above prior year period. In the U.S. revenue increased 22% year-over-year primarily due to strength in ratings of collateralized loan obligations and asset backed securities.","International Structured Finance revenue was down 9% reflecting issuance declines in European covered bonds and after-tax securities. Global financial institutions revenue of $78 million decreased 2% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was essentially flat as compared to the second quarter of 2011, while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%. Global revenue for the public, project and infrastructure business rose 12% year-over-year to $81 million. Revenue was up 19% in U.S., primarily due to gains in ratings for regional government and higher education. While non-U.S. revenue declined 3%.","Turning now to Moody\u2019s Analytics. Global revenue for Moody\u2019s Analytics of $200 million was up 19% from the second quarter of 2011. Slightly more than half of growth was from the late 2011 acquisitions of Copal Partners and Barrie & Hibbert. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 21%. U.S. revenue grew by 23% year-over-year to $86 million. Non-U.S. revenue grew to 17%, to $114 million and represented 57% of the total Moody\u2019s Analytics revenue.","Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $121 million, increased 9% from the prior year period and represented 61% of the total MA revenue. We continue to see demand for credit research via our CreditView offering and solid growth in data licensing arrangements. Revenue from enterprise and risk solutions of $52 million, grew 24% from last year reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert and growth in the base business.","Due to the variable nature of project timing, enterprise risk solutions revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue grew 84% to $27 million, reflecting the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.","Turning now to expenses. Moody\u2019s second quarter expenses were $362 million, an increase of 8% compared to second quarter 2011 or a 10% increase excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Compensation expense accounted for over half of the year-on-year expense increase, and was due to increased headcount from the acquisitions in late 2011, and from growth in our existing business. Incremental non-compensation expense was driven by higher information technology expense, supporting business growth and regulatory initiative, as well as purchase price amortization associated with acquisition.","Moody\u2019s reported operating margin for the quarter was 43.5%, down from 44.6% in the second quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.6% compared with 27.8% for the prior year period. The increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to lower tax rate in 2011 resulting from a favorable foreign tax ruling.","Now I will provide an update on capital allocation. During second quarter of 2012, Moody\u2019s repurchased 2.7 million shares at a total cost of $100 million, and issued 0.3 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plan. Shares outstanding as of June 30, 2012, totaled 222.3 million representing a 3% decline from the year earlier. As of quarter end, Moody\u2019s had $800 million of share purchase authority remaining under its current program. We still expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $200 million subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decision.","As of June 30, 2012, Moody\u2019s had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $824 million, as of June 30, 2012. A decrease of $114 million from a year earlier. Approximately 85% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity.","And with that, I will turn the call back to Ray.","Raymond McDaniel","Thanks, Linda. I will continue with an update on regulatory developments. First in the U.S. We continue to expect the SEC will adopt final rules relevant to nationally recognized credit rating agencies by year-end 2012 and publish its feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products by about the same time.","Both banking and securities regulatory authorities continue to assess their use of ratings and regulations and are in the process of developing potential alternative measures as replacements. Turning to Europe. Moody\u2019s was registered in European Union in late October 2011, and our European operations are under the full examination and oversight authority of the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA. As discussed on previous calls, in November 2011 the European Commission released new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry, commonly referred to as CRA3, that seek to address among other ideas, the use of ratings in regulation, business models, competition, rotation of rating agencies and liability.","If implemented as originally proposed by the commission, many believe CRA3 would likely have significant negative implications for Europe\u2019s credit markets. Consequently, the debate among public policy makers and the private sector has focused on CRA3s potential damaging impact on the broader European economy and European issuers access to debt markets. The European legislative process requires that the European Parliament and council of finance ministers of the individual EU member states, each produce its own version of the tax and then enter into discussions with the commission.","During these discussions the three institutions seek to resolve any differences among their respective drafts. And once a compromised document produce, put to a vote. In May of June of 2012, the council and the Parliament respectively finalized their positions on CRA3. We expect the necessary compromise discussions to continue through the autumn months and for CRA3 to be finalized before year-end 2012. It is still too early to assess what the likely outcome of these deliberations would be. As always we will continue to advocate globally consistent approaches that align with the G20 statements and directives.","I will conclude this morning\u2019s prepared comments by discussing our full year guidance. Moody\u2019s outlook for 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending. Merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. There is a important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, especially as they relate to Europe. And if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody\u2019s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.","Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. As I mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance range of $2.62 to $2.72 and still expect to be towards the upper end of the range. Now that we have reaffirmed our EPS guidance, certain components of 2012 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions. For Moody\u2019s overall, the company still expects full year 2012 revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also still projected to increase in the low double-digit percent range. Full year 2012 operating margin is still projected to be approximately 39%, including the full year impact of our fourth quarter 2012 acquisitions.","Our effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 33%. As Linda mentioned earlier, we still expect full year 2012 share repurchase of approximately $200 million subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately $60 million to $70 million. We still expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is still projected to be in the $10 million to $15 million range.","For the global MIS business, revenue for full year 2012 is still expected to increase in the mid to high single digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is still expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the low single digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the high single to low double-digit percent range. Revenue from each of structured finance and financial institutions is still projected to be flat to slightly up, while public project and infrastructure finance revenue is still expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.","For MA, full year 2012 revenue is still expected to increase in the high teens percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is now expected to increase in the high teens to 20% range, while non-U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the high teens percent range. Revenue growth is still projected in the mid-single digit percent range for research, data and analytics, and in the low 20s percent range for enterprise risk solutions reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, as well as growth in the base business.","Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 75%, inclusive of revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of the majority stake in Copal Partners, and growth in MA\u2019s existing financial training and certification business.","This concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question and answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody\u2019s Investors Service; Mark Almeida, President of Moody\u2019s Analytics. We would be pleased to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will go first to Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","Thanks, good morning. So, Ray, just a couple of follow up questions starting out on the regulatory environment. So what's your thought in terms of the move to replace ratings in regulations in term of the implications of that. Are you seeing any changes in the portion of debt securities that are issued that are rated versus not rated? That was part one. And then part two, with regard to CRA3, the liability issue seems like it might be the bugaboo. What's your read on how that\u2019s going to play out. Thanks.","Raymond McDaniel","On the ratings in regulation or reliance on ratings, there have been effort both in the U.S. under Dodd-Frank and as part of the some of the European proposals on discussions to reduce or eliminate the use of ratings in regulation. I think from prior calls you know that we are very sportive of that. But frankly the progress on that has not been particularly strong in my view. And there have been probably as many changes in use of ratings in regulation that would seek to increase the use of ratings as there are to decrease the use. So net-net, I don\u2019t think there has been a lot of change.","If nothing else, what we would argue for is at least to reduce the mechanistic use of ratings in regulation. So it reduces some of the [core] risk or pro-cyclicality that\u2019s associated with this. And we do have some views on how that can be done. So as I said, we are supportive of the overall effort even if it has not made a lot of progress and we don\u2019t see it having a negative impact on our business.","And then with respect to liability, yes, we are playing close attention to the discussions in Europe around liability and obviously we will accommodate our business to make sure that we have the maximum protections we can have depending on what kind of liability regime the Europeans determine for our business. And there are -- again there are ways for us to mitigate those risks but we have to wait and see what the final conclusions are at these three party discussions that go on the fall.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","So you are assuming, Ray, that there will be higher levels of liability in that final version of this thing?","Raymond McDaniel","I think there is a good chance that there will be. The question really is the degree and what we will do operationally to manage that risk back down.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","And then specifically though, are you seeing a change in the percentage of publicly issued debt securities, the rated versus unrated.","Raymond McDaniel","No. I mean except to the extent that there are issues coming in domestic markets that might have previously not been issuers. That\u2019s where we have to make sure we continue to provide coverage. But for both the existing issuer base and for most of the new issues that are coming to market we are providing, we continue to provide very comprehensive coverage.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","And then, Linda, one other thing, in terms of -- could you just talk a little bit about the pipeline in terms of what you guys are seeing currently in terms of issuance. And then on the cost dynamics, the cost growth slowed considerably on a year-to-year basis in the second quarter versus the first. What was the differential?","Linda Huber","Sure Peter. Let me take the pipeline question first. And the information that I am quoting here is coming from Morgan Stanley. Let me talk first about....","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","Oh, how insulting that you are quoting them.","Linda Huber","Sorry about that. Investment grade issuance first, Peter, and then high yield. Year-to-date investment grade volume here in the U.S. is $512 billion which is up 6% from 2011. First half volume, $469 billion, it\u2019s the largest first half on record, 5% more than the first half of 2008 which is recent high, and more than the first half of 2011. The month-to-date volume has been $51 billion and close to the July 2010 record amount of $59 billion, we may have surpassed that. The last week has been okay and the pipeline looked reasonably good. Right now we have historically low interest rates. I just saw before coming up here the 10-year\u2019s at 1.42, so we are sort of back to Eisenhower level long-term rates. So that is helpful to the pipeline.","And high-yield year-to-date volume is $187 billion, that\u2019s down 13% versus 2011. The first half volume is $152 billion which is down 25% from the first half of last year. Leverage loans year-to-date volume $136 billion, which is down 30% from 2011 year-to-date. And first half volume was $123 billion which is down 31% from the first half. Now high yield market is grinding tighter. We saw a little bit more activity recently. Bu the pipeline seems to be pretty well constrained right now looking at the $10 billion of visible high yield issuance in the pipeline and $13 billion in leverage loans in the pipeline. And again that\u2019s one where you are going to see a little bit of movement depending on who you source for information.","But generally again, high yield pipeline, limited investment grade pipeline, pretty strong. Now on cost costs, Peter, you are correct, we did move down from the first quarter to the second quarter. A couple of things going on there. The first quarter had some unusually high expenses in it. Our big comp quarter is the first quarter and the second quarter has some reductions in that. First quarter obviously was stronger so we had a higher incentive compensation amount and the second quarter was little bit more reasonable. And so that basically is the main driver of what's happened with the quarter-over-quarter expenses.","Operator","We will go next to Jennifer Huang with UBS.","Jennifer Huang - UBS","So as things like debt issuance in Europe look pretty weak in the second quarter year-over-year. And I think your European MIS revenues were down about 5%, which seems rather stable. So can anybody just talk about what are some of the drivers behind this trend that you guys saw in the revenues in Europe in MIS?","Raymond McDaniel","Yes, Europe was softer in the second quarter. And there were a number of lines that saw year-on-year quarterly decreases. But this was mitigated by the fact that we do have a large number of frequent issuer pricing agreements in Europe. And those provide a steadier base of revenue. What we are missing though is the growth opportunity in Europe that comes from issuance and that\u2019s why we would look for whether market tone and sentiment improves in the second half or remains as volatile and choppy as it has been in the first half. Because that would bring more of the speculative grade credit to market and those are the credit that are less likely to be under frequent issuer pricing agreements and would increase our transaction based revenue.","Also to the extent that there is a strengthening in market tone in Europe, I would expect that that\u2019s going to be a good news for structured finance issuance, so we would have to keep a close eye on that. And that is transaction-based revenue for the most part.","Jennifer Huang - UBS","Okay. And then in terms of the structured finance products, can you just about the profitability of those deals? Are they still -- I mean are they higher than from the corporate side?","Raymond McDaniel","It\u2019s similar, or there are not market differences in profitability subject to cyclical upturns and downturns. And so we have a downturn in structured finance and an upturn in another area that obviously will be more profitable. But looking through those cycles, I wouldn\u2019t identify any significant differences.","Jennifer Huang - UBS","Okay. And then I just have one more on the expense side. So I think from the first quarter you had mentioned, you expect some ramp in expenses throughout the year to the tune of about $40 million. Is that still your expectation looking at the full year now? And if so, just wondering how much flexibility you have in that, just because it seems like in the second quarter you weren\u2019t able to manage the expenses down quite a bit.","Linda Huber","Jen, it\u2019s Linda. Let me talk about the back half of the year compared to the first half of the year. And let me start by saying that we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance so you are going to have to do the math on some of it. On the revenue side, we expect that or revenue pattern will lay out approximately like it did this last year. With our revenue coming in with a balance towards the first half of the year with a little bit of weakening towards the second half of the year. So the split on that we are thinking is about 52% first half, 48% back half. So we do, at this point, expect revenue in the second half of the year to be a little bit lower.","Now on the expense side, you are right, we had talked about $40 million ramp coming off our $377 million first quarter expense number. We did do better in the second quarter. We do expect $40 million expense ramp from $377 million as we get to the fourth quarter. And obviously that was would result in a tick-up in expenses in the third quarter and that will move up in the fourth quarter.","Now the reason for that is we have more headcount coming on in the second half of the year. We also have raises that come into play in the back half of the year and some other expenditures that we have to make in terms of IT, particularly to get ready for Dodd-Frank compliance. Many of those are expensed items, so they are changes to existing systems which have to be expensed as opposed to building new systems which are of course capitalized.","So, yes, we expect the continued expense ramp. We expect that revenue may weaken a bit and traditionally our pattern has been that the third quarter is the most challenged on the revenue side. So that might make for a little bit of a tougher situation in the third quarter. So that\u2019s how we see it laying out at this point.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will go next to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","First a couple of cost questions. What was the incentive compensation expense in the quarter?","Linda Huber","Sure, Craig. I think it\u2019s $27.5 million.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","So that was basically flat with the first quarter, correct?","Linda Huber","That\u2019s right. Now last year -- just interestingly, Craig, last year we had a different pattern. Last year we had in first quarter $29.4 million and ramping up to $35 million in the second quarter because of course second quarter was very strong last year. So as I said this year $27.5 million is flat, first quarter to second quarter.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","And then also back on the overall second quarter cost. I remember in your remarks from three months ago about how you thought the cost pattern would go. And also looking at history here, based on what I can see here over the last 10 plus years, you have never had a quarter where costs in the second quarter were down from the first quarter like we had here sequentially. What changed in your mind versus your original budget you talked about three months so that costs were actually down versus the first quarter?","Linda Huber","Sure. Of course we are looking to accrue incentive compensation based on how we view against our forecast. And in the first quarter we put up heavier incentive compensation view because we had a greater amount of completion. So in the second quarter that was a little bit lighter. We also had some other issues involving FX which were a little bit better for us in the second quarter. But generally, we are being careful with expenses. We are being careful with hiring. We are being very thoughtful about how we are managing the business and with the market outlook being as choppy as it is, we have to be very thoughtful about what we are doing and how we are doing it. So I think those would be the main drivers. And I would ask Ray if he had any further comments he would like to make about that.","Raymond McDaniel","No, just to emphasize that I think part of the pattern that you are seeing, this difference in Q1 to Q2, is really explained by Q1 as much as it\u2019s explained by Q2. Because we did have the higher incentive accruals in the first quarter based on the strength of the markets at that time.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Versus your budget you are saying, because it\u2019s the same number in both quarters of course?","Raymond McDaniel","No, exactly, exactly.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Okay. And then let me ask some questions -- with your four main segments within ratings, can you breakout, Linda, the transaction percentage versus non-transaction across the four segments please.","Linda Huber","Sure. The corporate, Craig, we will do as usual, transaction first and relationship second. For CFG, we are running 70:30 transaction relationship, structured is 57:43, FIG is 35:65, and PPIF is 62:38. Total for the rating agency is 60:40. MA is reverse, 20% transaction revenue and 80% relationship. Total for MCO is 47% transaction and 53% relationship.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","And then also breaking out the revenues differently, can you do similar percentages, like within corporate financial, high-yield bank loans, investment grade and then that monitoring CP, medium-term notes. Do that for all the four segments?","Linda Huber","Sure. Starting with corporate finance, Craig. The total number of corporate finance dollar amounts for the second quarter is $191.5 million. Investment grade made up 22% of that revenue in the second quarter. High-yield made up 17% of the revenue. Bank loans 18%, and other accounts 43%. Going on to FIG revenues, total amount of 77.8, again FIG is pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter. Banking 67% of the revenue, insurance 27%, and managed investments 7%. Going on to PPIF, the total number was $81.2 million, and 54% of that came from public finance and sovereigns. Again that was an increase than what we usually see. Munis at 6%, projects and infrastructure at 40%, and again $81.2 million was the total.","And then I think we missed structured. Total number of $90.7 million. Asset backed securities 32% of that. Residential mortgage backed securities 24%, commercial real estate 20%, and derivative 24%.","Operator","We will go next to Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Douglas Arthur - Evercore Partners","Yeah, Ray, just on international trends. If Europe stays choppy for the balance of the year, can you talk about trends outside of Europe? In emerging markets, Asia, Latin America and how, if those strengthen or continue to be strong or how you are going to get back to increasing your MIS international revenues?","Raymond McDaniel","Sure. We are expecting the international business outside of the EMEA to be relatively stronger than Europe or EMEA. And the concern will be the extent of any contagion from Europe and what that might do to business confidence and business expansion in other international markets. And, frankly, that\u2019s a tough call to make. So we think that other international is going to perform reasonably well for the second half. It is smaller than our European business but it\u2019s subject to at least some of the choppiness and volatility risk that we see in Europe. And I will ask Michel Madelain, if he has any additional comments he would like to make on that.","Michel Madelain","Thank you, Ray. No, think you know the scale of the business as you see is quite different in Asia and Latin America compared to Europe. But we see that as much more stable and robust than we see the choppiness we see in Europe today.","Douglas Arthur - Evercore Partners","Can you put a ballpark range around the scale relative to Europe?","Michel Madelain","Yeah. Europe, overall of Moody\u2019s Corporation business, Europe represents about 30% and Asia represents about half of that. Asia and Latin America.","Operator","That concludes today's question and answer session. At this time I will turn the conference over to Ray McDaniel for any additional or closing remarks.","Raymond McDaniel","Okay. Before we end the call I just want to announce that Moody\u2019s will host its Investor Day on Wednesday, September 12, in New York City.

I\u2019ll begin by summarizing Moody\u2019s first quarter 2012 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights and I\u2019ll then speak to recent regulatory developments and finish with comments on our outlook for 2012. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to respond to your questions.","First quarter revenue of $647 million increased 12% over the prior year period primarily reflecting increased corporate and public project and infrastructure debt issuance as well as continued solid performance from Moody\u2019s Analytics. All reporting units of both Moody\u2019s Investor Service and Moody\u2019s Analytics grew in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year period.","Operating income for the first quarter was $269 million, an 8% increased from the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.76 increased 13% year-over-year. While the level of issuance activity was strong in first quarter, we remain cautious about market conditions for the remainder of the year. As a result we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance of $2.62 to $2.72, but now expect to be toward the upper end of the range.","I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates. ","Linda Huber","Thanks, Ray. I\u2019ll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody\u2019s total revenue for the quarter increased 12% to $647 million. The US first quarter revenue increased 14% to $344 million while revenue outside the US grew 10% to $303 million and represented 47% of Moody\u2019s total revenue, down slightly from the 48% in the year-ago period. Recurring revenue of $330 million represented 51% of the total, essentially flat to the prior year period. ","Now looking at each of our businesses starting with Moody\u2019s Investor Service, revenue for the quarter was $453 million, a 10% increase year-over-year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Moody\u2019s Investor Service revenue by $4 million. US revenue for MIS increased 13% over the prior year period, while revenue outside the US increased 6% and represented 43% of total ratings revenue.","Global corporate finance revenue in the first quarter increased 10% from the year-ago period to $201 million. Revenue grew 8% in the US while outside the US revenue increased 15% year-over-year. The growth in global corporate finance revenue reflected stronger investment grade and solid speculative grade bond issuance activity.","Global structured finance revenue for the first quarter was $94 million, 5% above the prior-year period. In the US revenue increased 15% year-over-year primarily due to strength asset backed securities and commercial real estate. Most other areas of the US structured finance market remained weak. International structured finance revenue was down 2% reflecting weaker issuance volumes in European asset-backed securities in the first quarter of 2012 as well as demand in the first quarter of 2011 for ratings of outstanding securitization placed with the European Government sponsored facility.","Global financial institutions revenue of $79 million increased 2% from the same quarter of 2011. US revenue was essentially flat as compared to the first quarter of 2011 while non-US revenue grew 4%. Global revenue for the public project and infrastructure business rose 23% year-over-year to $79 million. Revenue was up 37% in the US reflecting strength in both public finance and project finance.","Non-US revenue increased 4% primarily due to gains in the infrastructure sector in Latin America and Asia. And turning now to Moody\u2019s Analytics. Global revenue for Moody\u2019s Analytics of $194 million was up 18% from the first quarter of 2011. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. US revenue grew by 19% year over year to $85 million. Non-US revenue increased by 17% to $109 million and represented 56% of total Moody\u2019s Analytics revenue.","Globally revenue from research data and analytics of $120 million increased 9% from the prior-year period due primarily to increased sales of credit research and related data and represented 62% of the total MA revenue. Revenue from enterprise risk solutions formerly known as risk management software of $48 million grew 11% from last year driven by the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert.","Due to the variable nature of the project timing, enterprise risk solution revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue more than doubled to $27 million reflecting both the acquisition of the majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011 and growth in our existing training and education business. Turning now to expenses. Moody\u2019s first quarter expenses were $378 million, an increase of 16% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Incremental compensation expense which accounted for over half of the growth was primarily driven by additional headcount in the operating businesses and from the acquisition. Other incremental expenses were largely composed of non-compensation expenses related to the acquisitions including purchased price amortization and IT related costs.","The impact of foreign currency translation on first quarter expenses was negligible. Moody's reported operating margin for the quarter was 41.6%, down from 43.3% from the first quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.1% compared with 33.2% for the prior-year period. Decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to benefits derived from international tax initiatives and tax audit settlement partially offset by miscellaneous discrete items.","Now I will provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter of 2012, Moody's did not repurchase any shares, but did issue 2.6 million shares under employee stock based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2012 totaled $225 million representing a 1% decline from a year ago. As of quarter end, Moody's had 900 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current programs and as we have previously noted, we still expect to repurchase approximately 200 million of Moody's shares over the course of 2012, subject to available cash flow, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation provision.","As of March 31, Moody's had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Additionally on April 18, 2012 we renewed our $1 billion credit facility for another five-year term. Cash and cash equivalents were $815 million, an increase of $95 million from a year earlier. Approximately 80% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the US. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity. And with that I will turn the call back over to Ray.","Ray McDaniel","Thanks, Linda. I will continue with an update on regulatory developments. Starting in the US, regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the SEC\u2019s summer 2011 common deadline for rule proposals relevant to NRSROs, the SEC revised its timetable and is expected to adopt final rules by year-end 2012.","Within the same time, the SEC is also is expected to publish its feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products, otherwise known as the Franken Amendment.","Turing to Europe, Moody\u2019s was registered in the European Union in late October 2011, and as I have indicated on previous calls, the transfer of oversight of registered credit rating agencies to the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA, became effective in July 2011. Our European operations are therefore under the full examination and oversight authority of ESMA and ESMA published its first inspection report in March. ESMA report had not identified any breaches of the current regulation by Moody\u2019s.","As discussed on previous calls in November 2011, the European Commission release new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry known as CRA 3 that seek to address among other ideas, the use of ratings and regulation, business models, competition, rotation of rating agencies and liability.","If implemented as currently constructed, the Commission suggested measures are likely to have significant negative implications for Europe\u2019s credit markets.","Consequently, the debate on CRA 3 which began in the European Parliament and European Council of Finance Ministers in mid-January has involved the growing number of market participants. The focus on the debate has been on the potential negative impact of CRA 3 on the broader European economy and the ability of European insurers to access funds. Because of the tone of the debate thus far, it is possible that during the coming months, the Commission\u2019s proposals will be amended.","The next stages of the legislative process include deliberation and potential amendments by both the European Parliament and the Council of European Finance Ministers. Parliament, Council and Commission must also confer and agree on final text. We expect this process to be completed by year-end and we will continue to consult with relevant authorities and market participants as of the impact of the specific proposals.","While new rules could entail various changes in our rating processes and operations and require us adapt our business. We will not abandon our fundamental objective to provide the highest quality, independent credit opinions, research and analysis.","We will also continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G20 statements and directives. I will conclude this morning\u2019s prepared remarks by discussing on full-year guidance.","Moody\u2019s outlook for 2012 is based on assumption about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody\u2019s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.","Our guidance assumes foreign currency transition at end of quarter exchange rates. As I mentioned earlier, we are re-affirming our 2012 EPS guidance of $2.62 to $2.72 but now expect to be toward the upper end of the range. That we have re-affirmed our EPS guidance, certain components of 2012 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view of credit market condition.","For Moody\u2019s overall, the company now expects full-year 2012 revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Full-year 2012 expenses are also projected to increase in the low double digit percent range. Full-year 2012 operating margin is still projected to be approximately 39%, which included the full-year impact of our fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions. Effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 33%.","As Linda mentioned earlier, we still expect approximately $200 million of share repurchase over the course of 2012 subject to available cash flow, market conditions and other on going capital allocation decisions.","For the global MIS business, revenue for full-year 2012 is now expected to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percent range. Within the U.S. MIS revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit percentage range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low single digit percentage range.","The finance revenue is now forecasted to grow in the low double digit percentage range. Revenue from each of the structured finance and financial institution is now projected to be flat to slightly up, while public project and infrastructure finances is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.","For Moody\u2019s analytics for full-year 2012, revenue is still expected to increase in the high-teens percent range both inside and outside the U.S. Revenue growth is still projected in mid-single digit percent range for our research, data and analytics and in the low 20% range for enterprise risk solutions, reflecting growth in the core business as well of December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert. Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 80%, inclusive of the revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners and continued growth in our existing training and education businesses.","This concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Mark Almeida, President of Moody\u2019s analytics. We will be pleased to take any questions you may have.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will hear first from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert- Piper Jaffray","So Linda, I was hoping you might give us a little more color on what's driving the rate of cost growth. And I ask this in the context of trying to understand why perhaps we\u2019re not seeing a little bit more margin leverage in the ratings business given the strengthened revenues? And the last part of this question is has your thoughts evolved in terms of where you think margins can go in the ratings business over the next couple of years? Thank you.","Linda Huber","Sure Peter, let me try to tackle your question by comparing our margin this quarter which is 41.6% as compared to first quarter of last year which was 43.3%. So our margin is lower in the first quarter of 2012 by 170 basis points.","And as we noted in the script about half of that is acquisition related or 90 basis points. Of that, the purchase price amortization for the acquisitions was about half of the 90 basis points or 45. The other piece of that, 80 basis points was IT related costs. And we have a little bit of an anomalous situation here on the IT front as we\u2019re getting ready for Dodd-Frank implementation. Because we are not building permanent systems, but rather making enhancements to our existing systems we have to expense those costs. So our expenses are running a little bit higher on the IT front than they might usually for this couple of quarters.","So if you want to think about that you might have certainly a 120 basis points or so that would normally go back to the margins that would not be doing so for the first quarter of this year.","Looking forward, I think in the longer term we do expect our margin to be back over 40, but I think we've got to get through this period of expense ramp relating to these regulatory changes we've talked about.","Ray McDaniel","And Peter its Ray, just to add to that, while we are working our way and are fairly well through the Dodd-Frank process at this point and expect that that\u2019s going to be finalized by the SEC this year, we do have the uncertainty around Europe and that\u2019s going to be something we\u2019re going to have to address as the CRA3 deliberation become more clear we hope over the next few months.","Peter Appert- Piper Jaffray","And Ray you think there are some specific cost implications potentially associated with that?","Ray McDaniel","It depends on what the final proposals are, but yes I think we have to assume that there are some cost implications associated with that legislation or legislative proposals.","Peter Appert- Piper Jaffray","And on the regulatory stuff, Ray I think and I am not sure if I heard this correctly, but I thought maybe in your prepared comments you are implying that you are feeling the Franken Amendment is in fact going to happen, am I putting that correctly?","Ray McDaniel","No, I think we\u2019re just following the expected timetable for the SEC to produce its study and we don\u2019t know their findings will be from that study.","Peter Appert- Piper Jaffray","And last thing Ray, any comments on the pipeline in terms of what you are seeing currently in terms of near-term trends and issuance? And then associated with that your revenue performance last several quarters has been very strong obviously and it looks like you maybe picking up some market share relative to other competitors. Can you comment on that please?","Ray McDaniel","Yeah, I would be happy to make some high level comments on pipeline and I think Linda has some information as well. The pipeline, and obviously the first quarter was a strong quarter particularly in the corporate and public project in infrastructure finance areas. We do believe that that has incorporated some pull-forwards, so issuance that we were expecting later in the year has been pulled into the early part of the year.","So for Moody\u2019s Investor Service, I think at this point we now expect to see a stronger first half than second half of the year. For Moody\u2019s Analytics, we would still expect to see a stronger second half than first half of the year.","That being said, most of the activity we\u2019ve seen has been refinance and so we have not seen an active market particularly in the corporate area around mergers and acquisitions, base financing, share repurchase, business investment spending. And depending on how confidence evolves throughout this year, we may have a stronger second half than would be implied from a more purely refinance based environment.","Before turning this over to Linda on what the pipeline, it looks like the only other comment I would make here is that as we\u2019ve seen over the last 18 months, we expect to see periods of optimism and pessimism really related to the macroeconomic condition and the European sovereign debt crisis. So the pipelines are going to be subject to whether those periods of optimism, pessimism are causing investors to move away from risk and so just expect some volatility in issuance, both positively and negatively.","Linda Huber","","Peter, its Linda, let me give you some specifics and I want to speak first to the US high grade market and then I am going to speak to the high yield market. As you know we\u2019ve just come off a gang-busters first quarter in which average monthly US high grade volume issuance was about $95 billion. Then we came into April and the April high grade volume is expected to be about $30 billion for the month.","If we look at recent trends, we would have expected $42 billion that would be the 10 year average for April. So April is running light. Last week we saw about $5 billion of issuance. This week we have seen $5 billion to $10 billion of issuance. So April\u2019s saw quite a bit of softening coming off a very strong first quarter.","May, is calling for $70 billion to $ 80 billion of high grade issuance and we\u2019re starting to see pipelines we build, but again we are concerned about the situation in Europe and any sort of week that auctions coming out of Europe can grow a range into the process pretty quickly.","2012 quoting from some of the banks here we\u2019re still looking at $850 billion of issuance, that\u2019s up 15% from last year, but as Ray said, we have seen some pull-forward so it\u2019s going to be interesting to see what happens for the rest of the year.","And turning to high yield, a bit of a different story and this is actually quite interesting because the high yield pipeline is still reasonably strong. For second quarter of 2011, the entire leverage market, about $27 billion of pipeline, high yield financing is about $6 billion of that, leverage loans about $21 billion.","That\u2019s the next highest after second quarter of last year where we saw $64 billion of pipeline. So high yield looks pretty good and if it all keeps coming that will be pretty helpful to us. But again, as Ray mentioned, we are very, very conscious about the risk on, risk off sort of phenomenon that we\u2019ve been seeing.","Ray McDaniel","And with respect to your market share question Peter, I think it's as much a mix issue as anything else. Some areas in the market where Moody\u2019s is particularly strong have been active such as the commercial real estate area in the US, but there are some other areas where our coverage has been weaker such as in European structured finance, where some of the rating actions that relate to sovereigns and how that impacts the structured portions of the structured market have not been helpful to share.","Operator","We will take our next question from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Linda, can you give us what the incentive compensation was in the quarter?","Linda Huber","Yeah. Hang on, just one second while we get that for you, Craig. Incentive compensation was $27.5 million, that was 11% of total compensation and total comp expenses for the first quarter are running about $250 million Craig.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Then also within the MIS, could you breakdown on percentage basis transaction versus non-transactions that typically ask you cross structured finance, corporate finance and PPIF?","Linda Huber","Okay, so for first quarter for corporate finance we are looking at 73% transaction and 27% relationship, so quite heavy on the transaction side for the first quarter given the way the markets have been running. Structured finance is 56% transaction and 44% relationships, financial institutions 38% transaction and 62% relationships and public projects and infrastructure 62% transactions and 38% relationship. So total MIS is 62 and 38. Moody\u2019s Analytics of course runs sort in reserve of that 20% transaction and 80% relationships. So for the company as a whole first quarter 2012, 49% transaction and 51% relationships.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Another question, if you could breakdown on percentage basis, like within structured finance, ABS or MBS et cetera due to say for corporate finance (inaudible) and PPIF?","Linda Huber","Sure, just a second okay. In terms of corporate finance revenue, investment grade and again as we have said earlier in the call we\u2019re looking at a total line of $200 million for corporate for the first quarter 2012. Investment grade was 22% of that or $44 million, high yield was 26% of that or $51 million, bank loans 17% at $34.7 million and other to 35% or $70 million.","Again the dramatic swing for us was the change in high-yield revenues for example the fourth quarter of 2011 which was only $15 million. So $36.5 million increase in high yield is obviously very helpful to us. Let me go on to structured and see if we can get those for you. So the total structured line was $94.3 million, asset backs 29% of that revenue or $27 million, RMBS was 25% at $23.3 million. Again that does include cover bonds, commercial real estate 26% or $24 million and derivative 21%, $19.6 million and we are seeing some good interest and good pipelines around CLOs which would be another of the bright spots in structured finance?","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Can you do it for financial and PPIF if you would?","Linda Huber","Sure for saving, total line was $78.8 million, banking was $55.9 million of that or 71%. Insurance was $18.1 million or 23% and managed investments almost $5 million or 6% and for public project and infrastructure, public finance and sovereigns $39 million which was 50%, munis just about $5 million which was 6% and project infrastructure $35 million which was 44% of the PPIF revenue line. As we had noted earlier again nice pick up in the project and infrastructure line.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","And then lastly if I could, I wonder if you could just update us on (inaudible) various losses out there, please? Thanks.","Ray McDaniel","Yeah, sure. In terms of just an overview in ratings related litigation, we still have 20 open cases in the US and a little over 30 cases have been closed, dismissed or withdrawn. Outside the US, we have about a dozen open cases and about a half dozen cases that have been closed. As far as probably the most notable litigations, the CalPERS case, we filed an appeal to the court\u2019s decision on the anti-SLAPP statute in March. When that appeal will be argued or decided and in Abu Dhabi, we have filed, well first of all the discovery has been completed in Abu Dhabi and we filed a motion for some re-judgment in January, but again we don\u2019t know when that will be argued or decided?","Operator","We will hear next from Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Doug Arthur - Evercore","Just a quick question on public finance in the quarter. Ray, do you think that's more of a one-off in the sense that last year the market was sort of paralyzed over bankruptcy concerns and so this is just sort of a snap back and then going forward, things will settle down or do you think with state finances improving, you could have a pretty good run here for the rest of the year, particularly in the US?","Ray McDaniel","We think public finance is showing and it is probably going to be a fairly study for the rest of the year. We did have a good first quarter, but we are not anticipating a big drop-off for full year. ","Doug Arthur - Evercore","And project infrastructure is the general source of the strength?","Ray McDaniel","Now well project and infrastructure has been strong, but we have also seen an increase in issuance at the regional government level, below the state level. ","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will hear next from Jennifer Huang with UBS.","Jennifer Huang - UBS","I was wondering if you could follow up to Peter\u2019s question on expenses, may be just for the rest of the year in terms of the guidance, how much of that do you think is driven by meeting investments into the Moody's and over there particularly enterprise service solutions business versus the credit rating business.","Linda Huber","Sure Jen I will take a shot at that. As we said before, we expect our expenses to ramp up by about $40 million over the course of the year. And we will continue to expect that to happen and the ramp maybe a little bit deeper in the second and third quarters than some of the analysts have noted, so just something to look at in terms of the quarter-by-quarter spread on that.","And so there are a number of things we are doing in terms of our investments and more than half of the growth in those expenses are due to headcount growth and those are in the revenue area as we noted, for the rating agency its corporate finance, public projects and infrastructure and for Moody\u2019s Analytics in enterprise with solutions and sales.","So the expense growth that we are projecting about half of it is headcount growth to drive the revenue lines in those growing businesses. About $7 million is acquisition related costs, some of that is the amortization of the intangibles. We mentioned this on the last quarter call. We said this would be something that we would be working, that would take our expenses.","And then lastly as I mentioned to Peter, we are seeing a bit of a bump up in the expense side of our IT budget, running a little bit more heavily towards expense ramp and capitalization as we get things ready for Dodd-Frank so that would explain the majority of the cost ramp coming in 2012. Does that help you?","Jennifer Huang - UBS","Yeah, and maybe just a quick follow-up on the headcount growth, and maybe if you could provide some color; to what extent you can or in terms of the employees maybe switch from, allow them to switch from one area of credit rating to another. So for example from pay structure finance to public to the PIP area or is that possible at all?","Linda Huber","Ray will answer that part and then I\u2019ll talk more generally about headcount additions. Go ahead.","Ray McDaniel","Yeah, there is some ability to move our professional staff between areas in MIS, but I would note that all lines of business are growing and so that does provide a constraint in terms of at least the financial ability to make the moves as opposed to for just developmental purposes.","And the other thing I would just note is that a good portion of the headcount increase obviously is related to the acquisitions that we did make. So we have increase in headcount for the existing businesses that are themselves growing, but then as well from the acquisitions.","Linda Huber","Yeah, let me just give you some quick details. This first quarter \u201812 first quarter \u201811 we\u2019ve added about 430 people in the existing businesses; about 200 of those Moody\u2019s Analytics, again to put sales effort, the Enterprise Risk Solutions business and some of the other things you\u2019ll note that the top-line growth in Moody\u2019s Analytics has been quite stellar and we do need people to support that.","In the rating agency, we\u2019ve added a 156 people; we\u2019re supporting the higher volumes particularly as I said in corporate and PPIF, we\u2019ve not added heads in structured finance. We have added few people as we get ready for Dodd-Frank and some of the regulatory functions.","For Shared Services we have about 70 headcount and some of those folks are compliance, business support initiatives and we recruiting. So we\u2019re cautious to add people on the revenue driving side and we think that we\u2019re seeing on the top-line reflects that we\u2019ve invested pretty well in order to have that happen.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will take a question from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert- Piper Jaffray","","So Linda, I was just wondering specifically if there is any reason you chose not to buyback stock in the first quarter?","Linda Huber","Sure Peter. As, I think we said we had $815 million of total cash at the end of the quarter; 80% it is offshore and a lot of that is permanently reinvested offshore. We do that because it\u2019s brought down our tax rate nicely from above 40% a bunch of years ago to, we are guiding to 33% for this year. We have made real progress on the tax line which helps the shareholders quite a bit.","Perhaps the other side of that is we have about a $180 million in cash in the US here, and the first quarter, as you heard from (inaudible) earlier in week are seasonally heavy cash out flow quarter. We have bonuses to pay, we have taxes to pay and we have dividends to pay. So it\u2019s something more than the available cash and we are looking to get back into the market as Ray said to do 200 million of repurchases for the rest of the year.","Operator","We will take a follow-up question from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partner","Yes. I am back for the MIS for the second term, you guys are up internationally 6% during the quarter, can you break a point how Asia did there versus how Europe did, please?","Ray McDaniel","Yeah, we can talk generally about Europe versus other international. I won\u2019t be able to give you a detail break-out within Asia, but Europe for the first quarter overall was down about 4% and other international was up about 30% so the overall was up about 6% for MIS outside the US.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. I just like to thank everyone for joining us and we will talk to you after the second quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes Moody\u2019s First Quarter Earnings Call.

At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded, and that all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, we will open the conference up for questions-and-answers following the presentation.","I will now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.","Sallilyn Schwartz - Moody's Corp.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on this teleconference to discuss Moody's first quarter 2017 results as well as our current outlook for full year 2017. I am Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations and Communications. This morning, Moody's released its results for the first quarter of 2017 as well as our current outlook for full year 2017. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com. Ray McDaniel, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead this morning's conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Linda Huber, Moody's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I call your attention to the Safe Harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the Act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website.","These, together with the Safe Harbor statements, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements. I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Thank you, Salli. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's first quarter 2017 financial results. Linda Huber will follow with additional financial details and operating highlights. I will then conclude with remarks on our current outlook for 2017. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","In the first quarter, Moody's achieved record revenue of $975 million, up 19% from the prior-year period as Moody's Investors Service benefited from very strong issuance levels in the quarter, especially in leveraged finance markets. Moody's Analytics also continued to exhibit steady growth. Operating expense for the first quarter was $532 million, up 4% from the first quarter of 2016. Operating income was $443 million, up 46% from the prior-year period. Adjusted operating income defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization of $476 million was up 42% from the prior-year period. The operating margin was 45.5%, up from 37.3% in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating margin was 48.8%, up from 40.9%.","Moody's EPS for the quarter was $1.78 per share, up 91% from the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.47, up 58% from GAAP EPS of $0.93 in the first quarter of 2016. First quarter 2017 adjusted EPS excludes the $60 million or $0.31 per share gain from a strategic realignment and expansion involving Moody's China affiliate, CCXI. Including the $0.31 CCXI gain, we now anticipate full year 2017 EPS in the range of $5.46 to $5.61. Excluding the gain, we anticipate full year adjusted EPS to be toward the upper end of the range of $5.15 to $5.30, reflecting the likely impact of some debt issuance pull-forward during the first quarter, while recognizing ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.","I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the first quarter was $975 million, up 19% from the prior-year period. U.S. revenue of $578 million was up 20%. Non-U.S. revenue of $397 million was up 18% and represented 41% of Moody's total revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on Moody's revenue was negligible. Recurring revenue of $480 million was up 6% from the prior-year period and represented 49% of total revenue.","Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service, total MIS revenue for the quarter was a record $668 million, up 27% from the prior-year period. U.S. revenue increased 26% to $423 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $246 million was up 30% and represented 37% of total MIS revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.","Moving to the lines of business for MIS; first, global corporate finance revenue for the first quarter was $353 million, up 47% from the challenging prior-year period. This year's results reflected robust leveraged finance issuance especially of U.S. bank loans. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were up 41% and 61% respectively. Second, structured finance revenue totaled $100 million, up 11% from the prior-year period, primarily as a result of increased U.S. CLO and ABS issuances. U.S. and non-U.S. structured finance revenues were up 8% and 15% respectively. Third, financial institutions revenue of $112 million is up 18% from the prior-year period. This result was driven primarily by an increase in issuance from infrequent issuers. U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions revenue were up 26% and 13% respectively.","Fourth, public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $98 million was up 7% from the prior-year period, primarily driven by an increase in global infrastructure issuance partially offset by a decline in U.S. public finance issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenues were up 3% and 15% respectively. Finally, MIS Other, which consists of non-ratings revenue from ICRA in India and Korea Investors Service, contributed $5 million to MIS revenue for the first quarter, down 38% from the prior-year period. This decline is attributable to the divestiture of a non-core subsidiary of ICRA in late 2016.","And turning now to Moody's Analytics, global revenue for MA of $307 million was up 5% from the first quarter of 2016. U.S. revenue of $155 million was up 8%. Non-U.S. revenue of $152 million was up 3% and represented 49% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 1%. On a constant currency organic basis MA revenue grew 4% in the first quarter.","And moving now to the lines of business for MA; first, global research, data and analytics, or RD&A, revenue of $175 million was up 6% from the prior-year period, and represented 57% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly driven by credit research and ratings data feeds. U.S. and non-U.S. RD&A revenues were up 5% and 8%, respectively. Second, global enterprise risk solution, or ERS, revenue of $96 million was up 7% from last year due to the March 2016 acquisition of GGY. U.S. and non-U.S. ERS revenues were up 14% and 3%, respectively.","Trailing 12 months revenue and sales for ERS increased 10% and 16%, respectively primarily due to the 2016 acquisition of GGY. As we continue to make progress on shifting the mix of the ERS business to emphasize higher margin products, product sales were up 25%, while service sales declined 8% with about half of the growth in product sales attributable to last year's acquisition of GGY. Third, global professional services revenue of $36 million was down 2% from the prior period. U.S. professional services revenue was up 9%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 8%.","Turning now to operating expenses, Moody's first quarter operating expense was $532 million, up 4% from 2016. The increase in the operating expense was primarily attributable to higher accruals for incentive compensation, and the March 2016 acquisition of GGY. This increase was partially offset by a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 1% and the impact of ongoing cost management initiative. As Ray mentioned, Moody's operating margin was 45.5%, up 820 basis points from 37.3% in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating margin was 48.8%, up 790 basis points from 40.9%.","Now, I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During first quarter of 2017, Moody's repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares at a total cost of $55 million or an average cost of $112.24 per share. Moody's also issued 1.5 million shares as part of its annual employee stock-based compensation plan. Moody's returned $73 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the first quarter of 2017. And on April 25, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share of Moody's common stock. This dividend will be payable on June 12, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 22, 2017.","Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2017, totaled 191.3 million, down 2% from a year ago. As of March 31, 2017, Moody's had approximately $700 million of share repurchase authority remaining. On February 27 of this year, Moody's issued $800 million of notes, consisting of $500 million in 2.75% senior unsecured notes due in 2021 and $300 million in floating rate senior unsecured notes due in 2018. Also in the first quarter, the company repaid its outstanding $300 million in Series 2007-1 Notes along with an associated prepayment penalty of approximately $7 million. At quarter-end, Moody's had $4.1 billion of outstanding debt and approximately $800 million of additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program, which is backstopped by an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility.","Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter-end were $2.3 billion with approximately 83% held outside the U.S. Cash flow from operations for the first three months of 2017 was negative $512 million, a decline from a positive $254 million in the first quarter of 2016. Free cash flow for the first three months of 2017 was negative $531 million, a decline from a positive $227 million in the prior-year period. The declines in cash flow from operations and free cash flow were due to $864 million of payments the company made pursuant to its 2016 settlement with the Department of Justice and various states attorneys general.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Ray.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for 2017. A complete list of Moody's guidance is included in Table 11 of our first quarter 2017 earnings press release, which can be found on the Moody's Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.","Moody's outlook for 2017 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital markets factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Our outlook assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.25 to \u00a31 and for the euro of $1.07 to \u20ac1.","As I noted earlier, Moody's now expects full year 2017 EPS to be $5.46 to $5.61 which includes the $0.31 per share CCXI gain. Excluding the gain, full year 2017 adjusted EPS is expected to be toward the upper end of the range of $5.15 to $5.30. Both ranges include an estimated $0.15 per share benefit due to the adoption of accounting standard update ASU 2016-09, Improvements To Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, $0.10 of which was realized in the first quarter.","Operating expense is still expected to decrease in the 25% to 30% range. Adjusted operating expense which excludes the 2016 settlement charge and a restructuring charge associated with cost management initiatives is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. The effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 30% due to the impact of the non-taxable CCXI gain.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics, and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investors Service. We'll be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Jeffrey D. Goldstein - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, this is actually Jeff Goldstein on for Toni. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you just talk a little bit more about your expectations for the rest of the year? Obviously, it was an extremely strong quarter driven by ratings, but by increasing your EPS guidance to only the high-end of the previous range, and hearing some of your comments about pull-forward and macro risk. You obviously have some reservations about the remainder of the year. So, really just overall, can you talk a little bit more about the puts and takes that go into your guidance raise, and what do you think needs to happen for you to exceed the range?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Well, you can see from our updated guidance that we did not fully roll-through the very strong first quarter into the remainder of the year. We think it's going to provide a benefit and that's why we're guiding to the upper end of the range. But we're also cognizant of the fact that refinancing continues to be a very heavy driver of issuance and that characterized the first quarter in the corporate sector in particular. So, looking out for the remainder of the year, we think some activity that we initially had anticipated would go later in the year, did get pulled-forward into the first quarter. And if you're looking for upside to our current guidance, I think you'd be looking to more new money borrowing and we can certainly make a case for that with a strong economy. And I hope that's what happens, but that's what's guiding our outlook at a high level currently.","Jeffrey D. Goldstein - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, just with ratings having such a strong quarter, I'm assuming there was a less of the impact to the Moody's Analytics margin from increased overhead. So, can you just talk about if that 80 basis points of expansion we saw in the quarter at Moody's Analytics, is representative of core margin expansion and if not what the core expansion would have looked like there?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","I'll let Mark Almeida answer this in a little more detail, but we do anticipate ongoing expansion margin at Moody's Analytics, but we do not expect that line to be completely smooth. Mark, do you want to comment?","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Sure. First, to your question about overhead allocation, the way we allocate corporate overhead to the business lines, I don't think it's as dynamic as what your question suggested. The share of overhead allocation is fixed, so it doesn't change from quarter-to-quarter. So, in other words, what you saw in Q1 was indeed core expansion in the Moody's Analytics margin. And I think as Ray said, what we're seeing there is exactly what we've been talking about for some time that as the enterprise risk solutions business matures, as the product offering matures, and we shift from being engaged in doing a lot of the spoke work for customers to doing more standard product delivery. We would expect to see more margin coming out of that business and I think that's what you see going on here. As Ray said, that's not going to be a straight line, but we do expect continued gradual improvement in the Moody's Analytics margin as a result of that.","Jeffrey D. Goldstein - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Go ahead.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, I was wondering if you could talk about what's built into issuance for the second half? What are your expectations for growth there? And maybe if you can compare your second half assumptions with the first half, just so we can get an idea of cadence.","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Well, last year, we had a strong second half after a weak first half. We don't expect that second half of this year is going to be weak, but we do anticipate that we're going to have a stronger first half than second. That being said, the full year outlook in terms of issuance: for investment grade, it's flat to down by perhaps 10%; for high yield, it's flat to up about 5%; and for leveraged loans up 5% to 10%. Those aren't big changes from where we were when we spoke to you in February, but it's a little less optimistic on the investment grade side and more optimistic on the leveraged loan side.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay, and then, could I get your thoughts on some of the political events we have going on here. Obviously, we talked about the Trump administration and some of the tax changes and potential tax changes and then you also have some upcoming elections in Europe. Maybe you could talk about the impact on your business and what your thoughts are in relations to issuance. Thanks.","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Sure. I'll take the second part first and then maybe Linda would like to comment on the tax situation here in the U.S. But yes, we have been cautious in our outlook for the second half of the year, actually beginning in the second quarter in the European context of elections for France, UK, Germany, Italy. And so, the more those outcomes turn out to be expected outcomes, the more confidence the market is going to have and we would probably expect to see more economic momentum and hopefully more debt activity, but there is going to be a level of anxiety around each of these elections throughout the year and they are spaced out throughout the year So, I imagine, we're going to be having periods of relative optimism and then periods where market participants pull back, awaiting the outcome of these various elections.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Joe, just wanted to be clear that this guidance does not incorporate any of the Trump tax proposals, because as you know such proposals have a long way to go before they're enacted as legislation. Just as a way to think about what potentially could happen, of course a lowering of the corporate tax rate would be helpful for Moody's, you can take a look at that by thinking about 1 percentage point drop in our estimated tax rate, would give us $0.07 to $0.08 on the EPS line.","We did note that the latest proposal did not mention interest deductibility limitation, nor did it mention a border tax adjustment, and we would not expect that the deemed repatriation tax would have a meaningful impact on issuance, because offshore cash is held very closely by a small number of companies. So, generally the majority of scenarios that have been discussed would be net positive for Moody's, of course the details would matter quite a bit. And that's the basis of what we know at this time, but again none of these proposals are baked into anything we're saying today.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Operator","And, we'll take our next question from Alex Kramm from UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Hey, good morning. Just wanted to come back to the early retirement of debt with the pull-forward comments, Ray you made earlier. Just wondering if you can flush it out a little bit more, I guess what are you hearing when you're talking to corporates or to banks, I mean is this just a typical, we think rates are moving higher, let's go now, is this, hey, let's get ahead of tax policy changes, because some banks are telling us it's a wise thing to do now and how does that impact the longer-term outlook for refinancing, just what are you hearing I guess is my question at the end of the day.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","I think it's each of the items you identified and right now, rates and spreads are very attractive. So, it is a good opportunity for issuers to be in the market, whether it's refinancing or new money or upping their outstanding debt. These are attractive conditions and looking ahead to potential interest rate increases going forward. And again some of the uncertainty that comes with the geopolitical situation and the elections in Europe. Yeah, we do think issuers are taking advantage and we're certainly not anticipating a weak second half of the year, as I said earlier, but the kind of growth we've seen early in this year, we just don't think is going to be sustained.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. Alex, it's Linda, I think we should also point out that again for us last year, we had the reverse pattern where the second half of the year was much stronger so the comps become more difficult for us. Just to kind of go through the views we're hearing from various investment banks, and again, these are not Moody's views, the first quarter was a record issuance for investment grade and that reflects low market volatility, attractive rates and tight spreads, as Ray said, $450 billion of issuance through the end of April. And once we get through the blackouts, we expect issuance to pick up in May. Last week, it was $40 billion in issuance which is pretty strong, this week's calling for $30 billion to $35 billion, and with the tenure at 2-3-6, that remains a pretty attractive set of issuance conditions for investors. We do expect as is being noted this morning about 94% probability that the Fed will do a rate hike in June. Thus far, that has seemed to mostly flatten yield curve.","For high yield bonds, it's been a bit of a mixed condition, it's $100 billion so far this year. The pipeline is light-ish due to the factors that Ray had commented on. That's contracted with leverage loans, which has been $300 billion of issuance to date this year. The activity is moving to the leveraged loan market. We saw a record start to 2017, but this is important, Alex. 75% of that volume is from refinancing and re-pricing. CLO issuance has also been robust, $25 billion year-to-date and the pipeline is strong in these areas and we look to that for increased activity.","In Europe, things are quite positive. The euro and sterling markets are resilient, conditions are constructive, spreads at all-time lows, rates historically low, but the busy political calendar offsets that potentially and we will see some choppiness. On spec rate in Europe, strong leveraged financing activity, leveraged loan activity reached a post financial crisis high in Q1. High yield bond spreads in Europe at a 10-year low and of course as we mentioned, the macro conditions again may cause choppiness in the speculative grade market as well, but generally, pretty good conditions and we'll have to see what happens, but if you want to finance, the market remains quite attractive.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Very true. Thank you. And then just secondly, maybe a little bit more longer term, but a couple of months ago at a conference, you changed one of the slides in your typical presentation deck a little bit. I think you had this long-term slide that you used a lot in terms of the algorithm of the long-term growth and you changed that, I think to some degree, kind of took away with some of the boxes that you have to have and you also reduced the longer-term growth rate. You may have addressed this already at the conferences, but can you just kind of like talk about what this change was all about, like how you're thinking about the long-term algorithm the company may have changed or if this is more of a, the next few years are different? So just flesh out why the long-term change there was. Thank you.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Sure. First of all, I think it's important to underline that there is no change in our outlook for the revenue areas that we have under our control. This is pricing Moody's Analytics in the sense that it's a non-capital markets component of our business. Coverage, new mandates, all of that remains consistent with the views that we've had in recent years. The new slide and the discussion that we've had around that reflects our view that we're looking at protracted lower GDP growth, especially in developed economies. For 2017, the MIS GDP forecasts for the G20 are about 3%, but importantly, the U.S. is at 2.4% and the euro area at 1.3%. And between the U.S. and the euro area we were looking at 85% of our revenue. So, we're taking that into account in terms of the pace at which debt markets are going to be expanding given this low-ish or some period of time outlook on GDP. In that kind of environment, we're going to continue a strong focus on managing costs and our capital allocation.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Co. Please go ahead.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just want to ask about the gain in China and the adjustment to the investment there. Can you elaborate what that was and what that means kind of going forward?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, sure Tim. What we did was our joint venture, CCXI, issued additional shares in order to merge with another rating agency in China. And that merger reduced our holding in the combined company from 49% to 30%. We didn't sell any. We didn't sell down. But we have a smaller piece of a larger company. Strategically the reason we did this was by combining these two rating agencies, we now own licenses through our joint venture to compete in all areas of the domestic Chinese market, both what's called the interbank market which is large and somewhat slower growing, and the exchange traded market, which is smaller but faster growing. So that the fact that we are now able to provide rating and research services through our joint venture in all areas of the Chinese capital market, we think is strategically very important. And we had the revaluation of our original 2006 investment in the joint venture as a part of this process and that's what led to the gain.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, Tim, it's Linda. Let me just also explain the tax effect of this, because we got a lot of questions about this. Our tax rate guidance has come down. The effective tax rate for 2017, the guidance now is approximately 30% and that was reduced from the prior guidance of 31% to 32% and that's due to the impact of the non-taxable CCXI gain. That change is a GAAP guidance item, but again because that was not taxable, the overall ETR for the year comes down. If you wanted to strip that out, the tax guidance would be back to the 31%, 32% where it was, but this is a permanent change downward for this year.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And just to follow up, is this I guess change in China, as an interval of it, there's also been some news I guess about perhaps opening up the market there. I guess, is this a sign at all about your view of interest in taking a bigger role or a bigger stake there or is it more just an opportunity and I guess locally that was a decision for the joint venture to take?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. Well, there is the opening of the Chinese market and then, there are the activities that we are either currently carrying out or will be in a position to carry out between the joint venture and MIS. I already described the joint venture side of this. And so, I'll ask Rob if he wouldn't mind commenting on MIS and where we stand in the Chinese market cross border and then potentially looking into the future.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Right. As Ray said, we have a growing presence with our cross-border business in MIS in China, offices in Beijing and Shanghai. And I think, what you're referring to in China is the State Council of China announced that the foreign investment restriction in domestic CRA industry would be lifted. So I think that change may allow us more freedom, both in how we can invest in the CCXI, the expanded CCXI enterprise as well as how we can potentially better address the domestic market through MIS.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. And I would just add that we've continued to see very good growth in new rating mandates from Chinese institutions active in the cross-border markets. So, that has been a good news story and it continues to be.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question with Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you. Linda, I guess just a point of clarification, your tax rate comment just so I'm clear on this, the 31% to 32% is exclude the gains for the full year?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Yes. But it is a GAAP change, this event for CCXI is non-taxable per GAAP, so it is a GAAP adjustment to take the tax rate down to 30% going forward. So, that change is good and that's our guidance for the full year.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","But again, taking out that gain will be 31% to 32% you're saying.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Correct.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then my real first question, I'm sorry, that this is \u2013 you guys talked about some pull-forward into the first quarter here in the corporate finance area, I guess the transaction revenue is up 72% or so. How much of that would you ballpark came from pull-forward, was it roughly half and what would you sort of ballpark?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","It's difficult to be precise with that Craig, just because there is quite a bit of noise in the mentions for why capital is being raised. We can look at mentions from issuers around capital expenditure versus share repurchase versus refinancing. And we can see that the large majority of references are for refinancing. But how that money actually gets used and what portion of it is put to work in other ways is difficult for us to see with a lot of certainty.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","And then, if I could just quickly ask, roughly $1.75 billion of cash you have overseas, Linda, if you get a chance to take that home for repatriation, how much of that could you actually take home. I know you have to leave some portion in each country that you operate you in, I believe, and if you did bring it home, what would you use it for, share buyback?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Craig, we don't disclose that, but you are directionally correct that a certain amount of that needs to remain in the statutory entities that we have in Europe. So, we couldn't return it dollar-for-dollar. I think it would be fair to say that the strong majority we could bring back. We obviously would be able to respond very quickly if such a change does become law, but right now, it's not. And if we did make a decision like that, the use of those \u2013 that return of cash would be subject to the usual decision-making process that we do, regarding our capital allocation. So at this point, we haven't taken the plans that far, we do know, what we would do if there is a change, but to this point such a change is still going to be some amount of time away, if it does materialize at all.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Linda, if I could just ask you to first give us the updated expense ramp that you typically do?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Sure, Manav. As of now, the new first quarter to the fourth quarter expense ramp is $30 million to $40 million. Previously, we had said $20 million to $25 million, but we've had an uptick because of better, actually higher incentive compensation in the first quarter and a little bit later spending on some of our IT projects, so again $30 million to $40 million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, sort of bigger picture question, after lowering \u2013 well, I guess, forget about the long-term guidance necessarily, but I guess the focus on most of that conversation is still on the ratings business more than you guys would like to probably. But just in context of the opportunities, there are some interesting assets in the financial umbrella that might be out there, up for sale and so forth, just your thoughts on diversification or are you happy with the portfolio where it is or how we should think of that longer term?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Well, first of all, we do like to talk about the rating agency, so that's okay. But with respect to our satisfaction with the portfolio, yes, we are very satisfied. We've made what we think are some very nice strategic acquisitions that have been performing well in Moody's Analytics. We would continue to look for other opportunities similar to what we've done in the past, but we remain disciplined about how we think about bringing assets on board and about M&A generally.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, that's good. Thanks guys.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you so much. Looking at the margin expansion in the MIS business, some of the reasons for that, the large increase in transaction related revenue relative to subscription base?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Jeff, it's Linda. We have always talked about one of the great features about Moody's as an investment is if we get some progress on the top line, we have a lot of operating leverage and we were able to really demonstrate that this quarter with some pretty impressive increases in the margin for the quarter. Now the best outcome for us as Rob Fauber will talk about in a minute is probably if we see that revenue increase come through, the corporate's line where we have teams obviously covering all of these issuers and that allows for a very effective bring down in terms of margin expansion. But I will turn it over to Rob for a little bit more color.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, I think that's right Linda. I think we probably have the most operating leverage in the U.S. corporate finance space. Over time as we see significant increases in issuance volume, we will have to act faster to be able to keep up with the demand and monitor the new relationships. But I think in general it's right.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. And I'm sorry to go back and ask a tax question. But I know you are not giving guidance for 2018, but for modeling purposes, should we go back to that 31%, 32% rate for next year?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Jeff, we probably will deal with that in February of next year. Given all the exciting tax proposals on the table right now, we think we are going to take the better part of valor here and not comment on what the rate should be for next year, because there are lot of proposals floating around and none of them have made their way to law yet. So, go ahead and model whatever you'd like, but it's hard to know right now.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","But assuming would we kind of stay ceteris paribus, 31% to 32% would make sense?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","I'm not going to confirm that, let's take a look next year. It depends on a whole lot of things including one-off audits that we have to look at and various other things, the mix of our business between the U.S. and offshore is a very heavy driver of that tax rate. And there's some indications that the headline tax rate in the UK comes down, but yet they are limiting interest deductibility. So there is a lot that goes into that number and it could change if any one of those situations change. So, on this one, we're just going to let you do whatever you'd like there.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. I appreciate that. Thanks so much.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Sure.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. So, Linda, the preliminary question is can you quantify please the bonus accruals for the first quarter and then a follow-up related to how you answer that.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Yes. Sure, Peter. So, the incentive comp accrual in the first quarter went up pretty considerably from last year, last year in incentive comp, we did $32.2 million, this year we did $52 million. Now, that includes two components and it's important to understand that. And of that change, which is about $20 million, $15 million of it is the over-performance that we put up in the first quarter. The other five relates to normal increases that we do with target bonuses year-over-year. So, the out-performance is really the $15 million piece of that Peter. And if you want to look at the modeling for the rest of the year, you might want to look at $40 million to $45 million number for each of the remaining quarters, but the one thing I could you promise you is that we'll get that wrong because it depends on the performance quarter-by-quarter, but we did have very good performance in the first quarter, so we put up the heftier number based on the percentage of completion of our budget for the year.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Okay. So, the follow-up then is that ex that increase your costs were basically flat year-to-year in the quarter, which is pretty extraordinary. So, I guess this is cheating, but there are two sub questions to this. Number one, why not even a bigger accrual for the bonus in the first quarter given just the extraordinary strength in issuance? And two, why cost is flat for the first quarter?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Sure. I'll tackle the second one first and yeah, thank you very much for noting. We've been working very hard on keeping our expense growth limited. Now some of you may have noticed, we went from low single-digits to mid single-digits and that's just because we were at the very cusp of this line, so we've bumped just lightly from the highest end of low single-digits to the lowest end of mid single-digits, if you could follow that, it really doesn't amount to very much. The expense growth that we had, Peter, you're right, comes primarily from this higher incentive comp and the costs from the GGY acquisition which we're about to lap.","So, we've been pretty happy with that. We've worked very hard to keep tight control on hiring. If you looked at the head count for the corporation year-over-year, we're actually down 1% first quarter this year versus last year. A lot of that is that we've reduced head count slightly in shared services. Rob has kept a very good handle on the rating agency's head count, and Mark's business where we've had very good growth has had a little increase. But we're also very careful where we put the people and we're looking at lower cost jurisdictions, where a number of them have gone for shared services. So pretty happy with all of that. We continue to maintain our discipline, even through we've had this very strong first quarter.","And the incentive comp accrual is based on where we think we're going to be for the year and that percentage of completion, so it's sort of a formulaic thing. If we had taken up our guidance, Peter, that would have been a different case and we would have had to move more aggressively on incentive comp in the first quarter. As you know, we've moved to the upper end of our guidance range. So we went with the $15 million. So hope that gets you everything you need.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yes. Thank you.","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Sure.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Warren Gardiner from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks. Just a question on the slide on the investment bank issue. Do those reflect or I guess, do your internal forecasts differ significantly from any of those? And then, I guess I'm trying to understand why the downward or sort of slight downward adjustment for high-yield investment grade, just for the full year versus what was spoken about last quarter, because I guess I just kind of struggle with it. It's been pulled forward and conditions remain pretty favorable. Why sort of soften those for the full year?","Linda S. Huber - Moody's Corp.","Sure. Warren, these views that Ray and I quoted from are summation of a number of banks. Sometimes they match up with our internal view and sometimes they don't. I think that there are a couple of things going on there. There is some pull forward as you had mentioned, but also in a period where rates may move up, the focus tends to move toward the leveraged loan market which is more of a floating rate market. So I think that's the main reason why high-yield may have softened a bit, because you're seeing a substitution effect over into the leveraged lending side. I will stop here and see if Rob has anything else he wants to add about what's going there.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","The only thing I would add to that Linda is, the funds flows in high-yield have been a bit choppy for the year, year-to-date down about $6 billion in outflows. We have seen some stronger inflows in mid-April, but we're still down as opposed to what Linda was talking about. Year-to-date inflows in leveraged loans about $12.5 billion of inflows through mid-April, and that's double what we saw in full-year 2016.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Got it. And then, I guess, any thoughts on the structured product pipeline from here? Sorry, if I missed any comment on that earlier.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. Sure. Rob?","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. I'll touch on maybe a couple of the asset classes. I'm going to focus mostly on the U.S., it's obviously our largest market. In ABS the issuance momentum picked up throughout the quarter, and that was after a slowdown that we had seen in the back half of the fourth quarter, and that's been led by an uptick in autos and cars primarily. Spreads there have flattened and are at multi-year lows, so conditions, issuance conditions good there. We'd expect the activity to moderate a little bit from a very strong March, and we are continuing to see some interest in the esoteric space, renewable energy, those kinds of things.","CMBS, spreads are still at very favorable levels. We are nearing the apex of the CMBS refinancing on maturity of loans that originated just pre-crisis in 2006 and 2007. I think everybody is familiar that the activity in CMBS suffered at the beginning of this year, as we saw a pull-forward into the fourth quarter, as folks were trying to get ahead of the risk retention implementation deadlines. We have seen that strengthen a bit in March. I think we'd expect to see that pick up again in the second half of this year. And I would just note that there are a lot of single borrower deals where there's competition to fund by banks and insurance companies. So, we'll see how that plays out.","In CLOs, similarly to the strength in the leveraged loan market, spreads there continue to tighten, again at multi-year lows. We've seen very heavy refinancing activity. That continued all the way into April. I would think that will slow down a bit, probably pick back up again sometime in the third quarter and we are seeing some new CLO issuance in the pipeline. So, it's not just going to be weighted towards all of that refi activity.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you. That was very helpful.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Jake Leonard Williams - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hello, everyone. This is Jake on for Bill.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Hi, Jake.","Jake Leonard Williams - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just wanted to ask how the new issuer mandates are trending in 2017 versus previous years?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, Rob.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. With strength in the leveraged finance markets, we typically see strength in first time issuers. That's where a lot of the first time issuer mandates come from. Those were up very nicely in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2016, over 200 new mandates and up very strongly from the first quarter of 2016 when as you remember we had very weak leveraged finance issuance. I would think that may moderate a little bit, but you've heard our comments and outlook for high yield and bank loan, but we think we'll still be in line with our first time mandate count for the last several years.","Jake Leonard Williams - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, or I guess good afternoon for you. So in enterprise risk solutions, you saw a really nice acceleration of your trailing 12-months sales growth from 4% in the December quarter to 16% in the March quarter. I think, part of maybe, that you had some easier comps, but can you talk a little bit more about what was driving that increased sales growth?","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Yeah. It's Mark here. What we had \u2013 what you're seeing there, a lot of that is coming out of the GGY acquisition. They have a very large amount of their renewable business that is \u2013 that closes in January and this was the first January that we own that business. So that got rolled into the trailing 12-months sales figure for ERS. So, that's the big driver there. But even if you take the GGY piece out, we still had pretty solid growth in trailing 12-month sales in ERS. So we feel good about what's going on there.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And then quick follow-up. With CCXI, do you guys have an option to take your ownership back up 49% at some point?","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","No, we do not have an option to take it up to 49%. But we are in a joint venture with individuals, who \u2013 and institutions who may seek to sell some of their interest in the future. And to the extent that we are satisfied with the performance as we have been over the last decade, we're a potential buyer.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. Can you talk about how your share of leveraged loan rates has trended, because I simply said they are raising a higher share of loans this quarter?","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Yeah, Rob.","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. We have a pretty comprehensive coverage in the bank loan market, but I would say that it further improved in Europe in the first quarter.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. And my follow-up is, can you talk about any of the work that you are doing on technology and the rating agencies to drive any sort of improvements in ratings analyst productivity, because I guess a lot of the pain points for a lot of ratings analyst is the maintenance work?","Mark E. Almeida - Moody's Corp","Yeah. I'll let Rob comment on this, but as we've talked about before, we have been in the process of a really pretty comprehensive transformation of how we do business in MIS and our processes, and really there is a important technology component, but there is also just some process reengineering that is nontechnology related. And this really comes from the fact that a lot of the responsibilities and obligations on analysts have changed post financial crisis and with regulation, and we have to align our business in a way that responds to those both effectively and efficiently and that's what this process is about. So, Rob, I don't know if you wanted to add anything to that, but...","Robert Fauber - Moody's Corp.","Yeah. Maybe a little bit more color, we're modernizing both our analytic and data platforms, we're putting in place a workflow platform for the analysts that will I think automate much of kind of what you're touching on in terms of all of that credit administration and rating workflow. We're going to get some benefits of that, we'll get some efficiency, we'll get the right task done in the right place, and we believe that will also allow all the analysts to spend more time focused on the credit portfolio and engaging with the market issuers and investors.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks.","Operator","And it appears there are no further question at this time. Mr. Ray McDaniel, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr. - Moody's Corp.","Okay. Thank you very much. And just before we end the call, I wanted to mention that Moody's will be hosting its next Investor Day in late February or early March 2018 here in New York City. I know this is an early announcement and we don't have a specific date yet, but I wanted to give everyone a sense of what we're aiming for there.

I\u2019ll begin by summarizing Moody\u2019s first quarter 2014 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. I will then conclude with remarks about our outlook for 2014. And after our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to respond to your questions.","First quarter revenue of $767 million increased 5% from the first quarter of 2013 and reflected continued strength in Moody\u2019s Analytics, as well as modest growth in Moody\u2019s Investor Service, despite variable market conditions and challenging year-on-year comparisons.","Operating expenses for the first quarter were $434 million, a 4% decline from the first quarter of 2013. Operating income for the first quarter was $333 million, a 19% increase from period year period. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income less depreciation and amortization, was $356 million, up 17% from the same period last year.","Diluted earnings per share of $1 for the first quarter increased 20% from $0.83 in the first quarter of 2013, and on a non-GAAP basis excluding litigation settlement charge in 2013, increased 3% from $0.97 in the prior year period.","We are reaffirming our full year 2014 guidance of high-single-digit percent revenue growth and EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.","Linda Huber","Thanks Ray. I\u2019ll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody\u2019s total revenue for the quarter increased 5% to $767 million. The impact of foreign currency translation for the quarter was negligible. First quarter U.S. revenue increase 4% to $426 million. Our revenue outside the U.S. grew 6% to $342 million and represented 45% of Moody\u2019s total revenue for the quarter. Recurring revenue grew 12% to $397 million and represented 52% of total revenue, up from 49% in the prior year period.","Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody\u2019s Investor Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $526 million, up 1% from the prior-year period. U.S. MIS revenue of $316 million increased 1% from the prior-year period. MIS revenue generated outside the U.S. of $210 million also increased 1% and represented 40% of total ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on the MIS revenue was negligible.","Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue in the first quarter increased 2% from the year ago period to $264 million, and reflected increased U.S. investment grade bond issuance, as well as higher revenue from rated U.S. and European bank loans. We also saw increased monitoring revenue across all regions as a result of more companies becoming rated to access the global bond markets. These gains were partially offset by a contraction in global speculative bond issuance. In the U.S. year-over-year revenue was up 5% while non-U.S. revenue declined 3%.","Second, global structured finance revenue for the first quarter was $95 million, an increase of 2% from the prior-year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 5% year-over-year, primarily due to commercial real estate ratings. International structured finance revenue was down 3% against the prior-year period, with gains in certain asset classes in Europe more than offset by weakness in Asia.","Third, global financial institutions revenue of $85 million decreased 1% from the same quarter in 2013. U.S. revenue declined 3% while non-U.S. revenue was flat to the first quarter of 2013.","Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue declined 3% year-over-year to $81 million. U.S. revenue was down 14%, primarily due to weakness in public finance. Non-U.S. revenue increased 19% from the prior-year period, reflecting increased infrastructure and sovereign rating revenue across all international regions.","Turning now to Moody\u2019s Analytics. Global revenue for Moody\u2019s Analytics of $241 million was up 15% from the first quarter of 2013. The impact of foreign currency translation on MA revenue was negligible. U.S. revenue grew by 14% year-over-year to $110 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $132 million increased 15% in the prior-year period and represented 54% of total Moody\u2019s Analytics revenue. Excluding the December 2013 acquisition of Amba Investment Services, revenue increased 10% year-over-year.","Moving to the lines of business for MA. First, global research, data and analytics or RD&A. Revenue of $141 million increased 9% from the prior-year period and represented 58% of total MA revenue. RD&A\u2019s customer retention rate remained in the mid 90% range and we continued to see performance in credit research sales and content licensing. RD&A\u2019s U.S. revenue was up 7%, and non-U.S. revenue was up 11% as compared to the first quarter of 2013.","Second, global enterprise risk solutions or ERS. Revenue of $50 million grew 13% against the prior year period, due to growth in subscription revenue and software maintenance fees. U.S. and non-U.S. revenue increased 14% and 12% respectively against the same period last year. As we\u2019ve noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. Trailing 12-month sales and revenue for ERS have increased 9% and 11% respectively.","Lastly, global professional services revenue grew 45% to $41 million, primarily reflecting the December 2013 acquisition of Amba Investment Services and continued growth in revenue from Copal Partners. U.S. and non-U.S. revenues increased 70% and 35% respectively year-over-year. Excluding Amba Investment Services, professional services revenue increased 7% from the first quarter of 2013.","Turning now to expenses. Moody\u2019s first quarter expenses declined 4% to $434 million, compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to lower legal expenses, partially offset by increased compensation expenses for additional headcount. The impact of foreign currency translation on operating expenses was negligible for the quarter.","Moody\u2019s reported operating margin for the quarter was 43.4%, up 510 basis points from 38.3% in the first quarter of 2013. Adjusted operating margin was 46.4% for the quarter, up 490 basis points from 41.5% for the same period last year.","Moody\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.9% compared with 28.5% for the prior-year period. The first quarter 2014 tax rate included a benefit from the resolution of a foreign tax audit, while the first quarter 2013 tax rate included benefits from the litigation settlement charge and the retroactive extension of certain U.S. tax benefits.","Now, I\u2019ll provide an update on capital allocation.","During the first quarter of 2014, Moody\u2019s repurchased 2.5 million shares at a total cost of $202 million or an average of $79.21 per share, and issued 2.9 million shares under our annual employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2014 were 213.7 million, reflecting a 4% decline from a year earlier.","In the first quarter of 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which will commence following the completion of the existing program. Including this new program, as of March 31, 2014, Moody\u2019s had $1.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.","At quarter-end, Moody\u2019s had $2.1 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments at quarter-end were $2 billion, an increase of $275 million from a year earlier. As of March 31, 2014, approximately 65% of our cash holding were maintained outside the U.S.","Free cash flow for the first three months of 2014 of $158 million decreased $56 million from the same period a year ago.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ray.","Ray McDaniel","Thanks, Linda. I\u2019ll conclude this morning\u2019s prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance for 2014. Moody\u2019s outlook for 2014 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability, business investment spending, mergers and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, and, if actual conditions differ, Moody\u2019s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates.","As I mentioned earlier, our full year 2014 EPS guidance range remains $3.90 to $4. For Moody\u2019s overall, the company still expects full year 2014 revenue to grow in the high-single-digit percent range. Full year 2014 operating expenses are still projected to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Full year 2014 operating margin is still projected to be 42% to 43% and adjusted operating margin for the year is still expected to be 45% to 46%. The effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 33%.","Full year 2014 total share repurchases are still expected to be approximately $1 billion, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.","Capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately $90 million. The company still expects approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Growth in compliance and regulatory expense in 2014 is still projected to be less than $5 million. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $900 million.","We\u2019ve modified certain components of 2014 guidance to reflect the company\u2019s current view of business conditions. For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2014 is still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is still expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range.","Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Revenue from structured finance is still expected to grow in the low-single-digit percent range. Financial institutions revenue is still expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. In public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is still expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range.","For Moody\u2019s Analytics, full year 2014 revenue, including the December 2013 acquisition of Amba Investment Services, is still expected to increase in the low-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is now expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. Non-U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the high-teens percent range.","Excluding Amba Investment Services, revenue for Moody\u2019s Analytics is still expected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range. Revenue from research, data and analytics is still projected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range, while revenue for enterprise risk solutions is still expected to grow in the low-teens percent range.","Professional services revenue, including Amba Investment Services, is now projected to grow in the low-forties percent range. Excluding Amba Investment Services, revenue for professional services is now expected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody\u2019s Investor Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody\u2019s Analytics. We\u2019ll be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","Yes, hi everybody. So the first question on the ratings business. You mentioned on the structured finance side that you some benefit on the commercial real estate side. I thought the CMBS activity was not that great this quarter. So I was just wondering is that an implication that there is some share gains happening, or maybe this is some other dynamic that I am not picking up.","Ray McDaniel","Manav, this is Ray. No, you\u2019re correct. We did have strong coverage in the commercial real estate sector in the first quarter. So that benefited us.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","Okay. And was that specific to, I guess just the U.S. right. What is the sort of your outlook on the Europe in terms of how that performs?","Ray McDaniel","You\u2019re correct. This was a U.S. story in the first quarter. Commercial real estate in Europe and Asia was not strong in first quarter, but the U.S. market is substantial. And so overall contributed to the growth in securitization for Q1.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","Got it. And then just a question for Mark. In terms of the instead of bigger strategic vision for professional services, is Copal and Amba basically, with your testing business or whatever, the complete suite, or is there something else that needs to be added on to this long-term, just trying to understand what the vision is for that particular business?","Mark Almeida","Manav, I think I\u2019d say that we like what we\u2019re doing in that area. We like the \u2013 we added Amba last year to build out the Copal platform. And we like where that business is going. We see a lot more growth opportunity there.","In the training and certification business, similarly we like where we\u2019re positioned there. That business has been a little bit soft over the last couple of quarters, and I think that mostly reflects some of the banks having other priorities in other areas that they are funding rather than focusing on training and development of their staff. But I guess the short answer is, we like where we are in professional services, and we particularly like what we\u2019re doing in the outsource research and analytics side of business.","Linda Huber","Manav, it\u2019s Linda. Let me probably just point out that we own two-thirds of the Copal Amba Group. So just want to make sure that everybody is aware of that ownership structure.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","Okay, fair enough. And actually, Linda, if I can just squeeze in one. On the expense side, I think last quarter you had talked about it coming in at $450 million and then ramping up another $40 million by the end of the year. It came in a little better this quarter. How should we adjust that for the rest of the year?","Linda Huber","Yes, Manav, your observation is exactly correct. We did do better than we expect on the expense side in the first quarter. So we still expect the same end point. So we would ask that you look at a little bit of a steeper ramp. So we\u2019d like you now to look at $50 million to $55 million of ramps specifically from $434 million this quarter to $490 million for the end of the year.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi good morning. I first want to follow-up Manav\u2019s last question. In terms of the costs, the lower than expected this quarter. Can we get a little more color on what exactly drove that? Was it just a timing issue, was it lower comp accrual. Just what makes you believe that you\u2019re still going to spend the same amount of money for the full year?","Linda Huber","Sure, Andre. The factors to the positive were lower legal costs and lower incentive compensation. I think we have said previously, you might want to look at $35 million for incentive comps for each quarter. We ran shy of $30 million this quarter, because of the top line was close and EPS was good, but we were little bit lighter on incentive comp.","Those two positives were offset by overall higher compensation expenses, because we\u2019ve added more people over the course of the year, and some consulting and IT costs for some of the things that we\u2019re looking to do too, improve efficiency to ramp here. So it didn\u2019t what we see now. We do think we will have that ramp over the course of the year. We are intending to increase headcount to support our revenue growth over the course of the year.","And again we can\u2019t predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen with incentive compensation, but probably that $45 million a quarter is as good number you\u2019re presenting.","Andre Benjamin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. And for a follow-up, on the RD&A business. Could you maybe talk a little bit about how much of a growth which has been sustained high-single-digits for the last year or so on a quarterly basis? How much of that\u2019s driven by, say, new product innovation versus growth in demand from some of the existing products and pricing? And are there any things on the horizon that you\u2019re seeing as you talk to customers that would make you lead to believe that you can maybe even see a higher growth rate?","Ray McDaniel","Mark why don\u2019t you address that if you would.","Mark Almeida","Yes. Andre, I think that what\u2019s been going on in RD&A which we think is been performing quite well for us, is a function of a couple of things. You mentioned pricing, that\u2019s been a nice contributor for us. We\u2019ve done I think some very good work on upgrading the product offering and providing a more complete product delivering, more content through our core research delivery platform, moodys.com.","So I think that has driven lots of demand. We\u2019ve seen very good customer retention. Linda mentioned that that was running in the mid-90s. It\u2019s as high as we\u2019ve ever seen it. So that\u2019s helped us very well. So I think just generally the business is doing quite well along all of those dimensions, pricing, coverage and the breadth of the product offering. It\u2019s just performing very well.","Honestly the underlying growth in the market is fairly limited. We don\u2019t have a lot of new entrants coming into the market. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019re selling to lots of new customers. But we are finding very good demand with the customers that we\u2019ve got. And we\u2019re finding that they\u2019ve got very good appetite as we\u2019re able to deliver more content through the platform.","Andre Benjamin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","Bill Warmington \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good morning everyone.","Ray McDaniel","Hi Bill.","Bill Warmington \u2013 Wells Fargo","I wanted to ask if you could give us some color on your bank clients, specifically where they\u2019re spending money, where they\u2019re not spending money, and how that\u2019s impacting your guidance?","Ray McDaniel","In terms of banks purchasing services from Moody\u2019s Analytics or in the ratings side?","Bill Warmington \u2013 Wells Fargo","The former.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. Sure, I\u2019ll turn this over to Mark in just a moment, but it\u2019s really going to touch on all three areas of the Moody\u2019s Analytics business, and has been a significant driver for the enterprise risk solutions component. But Mark may want to give some more detail on that.","Mark Almeida","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right Bill. Banks represent a very sizable share of our overall customer base. And we\u2019ve seen very good demand from that customer set, again going to some of the things that I mentioned a moment ago in the RD&A area in response to Andre\u2019s question.","But also Ray mentioned the enterprise risk solutions. All of the work that banks are doing to meet regulatory requirements, whether that be Basel III requirements outside the United States or stress testing requirements in the U.S., there has been very, very healthy demand from those customers. We can do in a lot of work. We\u2019ve been getting very good traction in that area, and we continue to be very optimistic about the outlook for demand for our product offering across the product portfolio.","Bill Warmington \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. And I also want to ask for your thoughts on issuance trends as you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. and Europe and Asia?","Ray McDaniel","Sure. I think it was pretty apparent that there was a difference in the first quarter between what was happening in investment grade and speculative grade bond issuance. Lot more strength in the investment grade sector. Speculative grade was soft really globally. So it hit us in the U.S. and Europe in particular, because those are our largest markets for spec rate, but it was also a factor elsewhere around the world. So we were soft on the spec rate.","That was offset though by the strength in the bank loan area. And the demand for an increase in ratings in bank loans was very beneficial for us. And I expect we\u2019re going to continue to see that, both in terms of demand for variable rate product like bank loans and the demand for ratings in that sector.","I guess the last thing I would add to this is that, we also benefited from growth in monitoring fees. And those monitoring fees are growing along with the new rating mandates. And you\u2019ll recall that in 2013, we had a very healthy growth in new rating mandates globally. A lot of those were spec rate issuers. And so we even though spec rate activity was lower, we were gaining from those new relationships in the monitoring fees rather than the bond issuance fees. Linda, I don\u2019t know if had anything you wanted to add to that but.","Linda Huber","Sure, Bill. If you want to look at U.S. trends, thinking first about investment grade, long-dated U.S. corporate bonds were the best returning asset in the first quarter at 7.75% despite some very negative initial outlooks on the investment grades sector at the beginning of the year.","Issuance for the year for the first quarter in U.S. has been about $300 billion, which was up 10% year-over-year. We\u2019re still looking at sort of flattish for the whole year. Fund flows have continued to be positive into investment grades. And we would hope to see some shifting of proceeds towards M&A or CapEx. We haven\u2019t fully seen that yet.","Year-to-date issuance has been about financials. And the three to five year part of the curve has been the largest share of issuance. Investor demand is also very high there. Shorter duration because the concerns about the rising rate environments.","Now if we had to split it into headwinds and tailwinds. Headwinds would be potentially slowing work in China, reduced signals from the Fed, escalation of Ukraine and Russia situation. Tailwinds would be that rates remain new record low, 10-year at 2.64% this morning, good investor demand, and again the asset classes performing well. We\u2019ve had some good strength in Europe as well.","The current pipeline is a little bit on the lighter side because of earnings blackout that we\u2019re expecting pickup on that in May. And then the spec grade side as Ray said, we do see an offset of high yield bonds by leveraged loan. Leveraged loan fund inflow continues to be strong and we continue to see that trend for a very long time.","The main drivers of the loan market have continued to be refinancing, but last week we saw some pickup on the leverage side in M&A. 79% of loans syndicated last week were earmarked for acquisitions. So that\u2019s an interesting trend. We\u2019ll see if that holds. And we\u2019re seeing M&A activity at about 37% of the calendar going forward, and 59% of the combined and announced calendar. So again let\u2019s see what happens.","Yields continue to be helpful. CLO issuance is also healthy. But again that is not such an high yield market for straight bonds. And we continue to see that that is a little bit weaker, $75 billion of issuance versus a $100 billion last year. So I think those are some of the overall trends in what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the strength and weakness in various markets. Any other details you might need?","Bill Warmington \u2013 Wells Fargo","Very helpful. Thank you.","Linda Huber","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Peter Appert with Piper Jaffrey.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffrey","Hi Linda, actually I need one more detail please, and that is the \u2013 we saw that mega deal, this week or last week I can\u2019t remember where the international yield markets [ph]. Can you read anything into that in terms of maybe using up the logjam in the high-yield markets?","Linda Huber","I think we\u2019re now going to have Michel comment on that. Michel, any thoughts on whether that is a trend starter?","Michel Madelain","Well, I think it\u2019s been viewed as really something that is a bit of a game changer in terms of the scale and the size of the deal and the opportunity creates for funding of large transactions in Europe and in some other market. So from that perspective, I think that was a very welcome event. And you\u2019ve seen it\u2019s been a very successful deal however described and good condition. So I would clarify that as a positive sign.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffrey","But no indication that the backlog is specifically picking up in the context of their early favorable results.","Michel Madelain","Well, it is an M&A. This is an M&A driven transaction. So you\u2019ve seen there is a number of \u2013 this is obviously something that tends to be variable driven. And to the extent that we see more M&A activities, what they mean is that we\u2019ll see more of those transactions, but again we view that as a positive development for the market.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffrey","Great. Understood.","Ray McDaniel","And Peter I would just add that with the ability of potential M&A transactors to see the degree of market appetite for these larger deals, you have to put that in the positive category.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffrey","Right, absolutely. And then I wanted to, if I could ask Mark a question. Mark, I\u2019ll need a day, things called fairly. You saw year-over-year improvement in the analytics margins in the current quarter and the numbers have been drifting lower over the last couple of years. I\u2019m wondering, Mark, you would call that a trend? Are we plan we were going to start to see some leverage from the investments we made in the last couple of years?","Mark Almeida","Well, our goal is certainly to move the business to higher margins overtime, and we\u2019re doing an enormous amount of work to get us there. I just caution you a little bit Peter on the timing of that. I think for us to get to the margins that we\u2019re aiming for. We\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do. And we\u2019ve got to build more scale into the business and also we\u2019ve got to make number of our product offerings, particularly in enterprise risk solutions, more scalable and more easily configurable and replicable from customer to customer.","So there is a fair amount of work going on there. So again that\u2019s clearly our objective. We\u2019re very focused on that, but I\u2019d be real love them to declare victory on that just on the basis of what you\u2019ve seen in this quarter.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffrey","I actually got \u2013 the first quarter was interesting, because it\u2019s with dilution from Amba, correct? What was the impact of Amba on the margins?","Linda Huber","Peter, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to break out the impact of Amba on the margin other than we said that the Copal Amba Group has Moody\u2019s like growth rates and Moody\u2019s like margins. So you might want to do a little reverse engineering there, but I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to go into that specifically.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffrey","So Amba theoretically was accretive to the margins. So I guess, Mark, the message is that it\u2019s really about the risk software business in terms of where the margin leverage is going to come in?","Mark Almeida","Absolutely. And again there is a whole program of activity in that line of business to get us there, but that program is a program that\u2019s going to start that meaningful impact on the bottom line over a period of years rather than quarters.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffrey","Okay. And then just quick last thing. Linda, should you assume the share repurchases are relatively even through the year?","Linda Huber","Yes, Peter. We do adjust bits of what we\u2019ve seen from market conditions, couple of comments there. We do have heavy issuance of shares in the first quarter that\u2019s when we primarily do the issuance for our previous year compensation plans. So that is particularly heavy in the first quarter. And as we move through the year, we\u2019re pretty well balanced out.","I would say that, for the number of trading days we\u2019ve had in the year, we would note that to this point we are on pace to achieve our $1 billion for the year.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffrey","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.","Flavio Campos \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, this is Flavio. I am standing in for Hamzah today. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to turn back to costs a little bit very briefly. I was just wondering when thinking about the leverage you can pull to reduce costs. If there is any relationship between MIS and Copal in the sense of using Copal services in order to drive down costs of research? Is that something that you have looked into before?","Linda Huber","Flavio, it\u2019s Linda. And Ray or Michel may want to comment on this. We think we\u2019re managing our costs pretty well while making the required investments in the business. As you can see this quarter, we\u2019ve had some particularly strong results from Moody\u2019s Analytics, but we\u2019ve always felt Moody\u2019s Analytics has been a little bit under in terms of its performance.","So we are watching our costs pretty carefully, but we do want to make sure we make those strategic investments to keep these businesses growing at the pace that they have been growing.","For the Moody\u2019s shared services side, we do use the Copal Amba Group. We have about 100 people that we\u2019re using for shared services. And most of the increases in our headcount for shared services would be offshore at this point. So the whole company is making use of those assets, particularly in Moody\u2019s shared services.","So we have had tremendous margin expansion year-over-year. We are also guiding to 50 to 150 basis points of further margin expansion this year. So we like where we are and we\u2019re particularly cautious about the rating agency and how we handle operations in the rating agencies. So with that preamble, I\u2019ll let Ray and Michel perhaps add any comments if they want to.","Ray McDaniel","Michel, anything you\u2019d like to add to that?","Michel Madelain","No, I would say that we are effectively looking at the options that the acquisition of Amba and the addition of Copal are bringing to us. We already are using outsourcing to some extent, but there are opportunities and we\u2019re working on that.","Flavio Campos \u2013 Credit Suisse","Perfect. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for the color. And just as a quick follow-up. When we were talking about leveraged loans making up for some of the are withdrawn to gain a higher issuance. And we know that loans have \u2013 rating of loans have lower margins. Should we look this as also the opportunity of rating goes else when comeback at CLOs and those are additional revenues and a much higher margin. And if you look at leveraged loans combined with the potential for the CLOs. Is that enough to offset the mix of lower high yield and more loans that come first?","Linda Huber","Flavio, it\u2019s Linda. Before we get into the next issue, one of our jobs here is to correct the urban myth. And that is an urban myth. In fact leveraged loan pricing, speculative grade pricing in general is helpful to us. And that\u2019s one that\u2019s favorable to investment grade pricing. So you should not make that assumption that margins are lower on leveraged loans. So please make that change.","And in terms of mix, we do like leveraged loans, because we rate them and then as you said, we are able to rate them again if they are packaged into CLOs, but I may have missed a little bit of the color for your two year back to your comment and I\u2019ll ask Ray if he wanted to add anything.","Ray McDaniel","No, I think Linda\u2019s correction on the profitability of the two different areas is important, but otherwise your observation is correct, Flavio, about the fact that these loans at least have the potential for being repackaged into additional securities.","Flavio Campos \u2013 Credit Suisse","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Linda Huber","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to William Bird with FBR.","Linda Huber","Hi Bill.","William Bird \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","On your guidance, maybe you can speak to what accounts for the just slight downward tweak to your corporate finance revenue outlook. Then I have a follow-up?","Ray McDaniel","Sure. There are a couple of things. I would say the first is that the market \u2013 I would observe that the market has not changed in the direction that I think the consensus view was earlier in the year in terms of higher interest rates characterized by stronger global economic momentum. In fact, we\u2019re seeing something of the opposite.","Now that\u2019s good for refinancing, but refinancing has really been the driver for the last few years. And so while the refi part of that market continues, it\u2019s difficult for us to project that as being a source of strong growth in the corporate sector at this point. So what we\u2019re really looking at is whether these other drivers, M&A and capital expenditure are going to take on a more prominent role and we\u2019ll see.","There is some reason to be optimistic about what\u2019s going on in M&A but that\u2019s pretty recent. So as I said in some previous calls, I hope we\u2019re being cautious on that, but we\u2019ll see.","The other two things I would just point to are, we have seen some slower growth in Asia. And the geopolitical uncertainty coming out of Russia and Ukraine is not helpful. So again we factor that into our outlook.","William Bird \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","And maybe you could just speak to Europe. How would you characterize the state of your business right now in Europe?","Ray McDaniel","Well, I will invite my colleagues to make some comments, but I think the business in Europe is quite healthy. The regulatory situation in Europe has been somewhat challenging as we\u2019ve talked about on previous calls, but there has been increased stability in Europe and that is encouraging and stability in the public sector and that is encouraging for increasing confidence in the private sector and encouraging business activity and borrowing in the private sector.","So for the outlook, that stability is clearly a precursor to better activity and we\u2019re going to have to see whether the economic momentum picks up on the European side. Michel or Mark, just start with Michel just from a capital markets perspective, see if there is anything you wanted to add.","Michel Madelain","I mean the unfun way I would add is something \u2013 forwarding previous calls is really that in Europe the size continue to benefit from business disintermediation and that\u2019s really a very important favorable development for us, but that\u2019s the only point I would make.","William Bird \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","I have a final question. Just given just a spike in your revenue growth in MIS in the year ago quarter, is it reasonable to think MIS revenues could be down in Q2?","Ray McDaniel","Well, I mean it\u2019s certainly possible, but we do think we\u2019re going to be able to point on the board in Q2. So our central case is for growth.","William Bird \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","Great. Thank you. First question, can you just comment a little bit further on what you\u2019re seeing on the ratings business over in Asia?","Ray McDaniel","Yes. I mean I think we have to separate cyclical from secular. I think the long-term story in Asia, it\u2019s very positive. And I think we feel that we are well positioned in the key Asian markets, whether it\u2019s through our own offices or through joint ventures or investments in places like Korea, China and India. Cyclically, we\u2019ve seen some softness and few markets in Asia was weak.","And really because of among other things that the downturn in speculative grade issuance globally. We also saw some weakness in the Asian market on the spec grades side. So I think we\u2019re going to continue to be dealing with some of these short-term issues in Asia, but the long-term story is it\u2019s something we\u2019re very enthusiastic about.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","My second question please. Your non-transaction revenues within the ratings business had a very strong quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. Can you just touch upon what\u2019s been driving that?","Ray McDaniel","Sure. I mean the growth in the monitoring fees is probably I think the most important driver there. We do have some growth in program relationships, large frequent issuers that are paying annual fees. And that\u2019s certainly helpful. But the growth in new rating mandates that we\u2019ve been picking up over the last couple of years, and the fact that those rating relationships trends translate into annual monitoring fees has been a big pick-up for us.","Linda Huber","Craig, it\u2019s Linda. Before I get into the usual conversation that you and I had, having spent a better part of the last three weeks in Asia, and Michel may want to comment on this further, we\u2019re continued to be pleased in what we\u2019re seeing regarding our business in China, both domestic with CCXI and cross-border.","I think our China compendium says we have about 140 cross-border rated companies now coming out of China. And I think if I\u2019ve got my memory stats we\u2019re adding about 30 of those per year. They start off in our CCXI business of domestic issuers and then it\u2019s growing size and scale. They become cross-border issuers as they move over to our MIS business.","On part of both MIS and Moody\u2019s Analytics. And so that part shared services as well, we are investing in China. It is a growth area for us and we have an effort [ph] to make sure that we have our greater China strategy correct. And that was supported in the growth particularly in that part of the region. And before we go onto other things, maybe I\u2019ll pause for a minute and just see if Michel and Mark want to comment a little bit further on China specifically. Michel anything from your\u2026","Michel Madelain","No, I think you\u2019ve pretty much covered it.","Linda Huber","Okay. Mark?","Mark Almeida","Please go ahead.","Linda Huber","And I guess we would also note Craig that we are tendering for the 55% ownership of our ICRA business in India. Those who are reading carefully page 12 of the balance sheet, you\u2019ll see an item on there which is restricted cash, which is cash by regulation we have to set aside for that tender which is for everyone\u2019s information going through its usual regulatory review processes, and we will update as we have something further to say if that opens and then move along. So just wanted to make sure everybody is aware of that that\u2019s going on, but that would be another indication of our investments in our business in Asia.","So with those commercials, Craig, what else can we do for you?","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","So typically like to ask you Linda, if you can just breakdown percentage basis in dollars if you would, high yield versus bank loans versus investment grade with the corporate finance and then ultimately the three main sub-segments?","Linda Huber","Sure. I will start with corporate finance for you Craig. As we\u2019ve said $264 million for this quarter. That\u2019s up from $258 million last year. The percentage breakdown investment grade was 18% of revenues, which is about flat to last year. Spec grade high yields bonds down to $52.9 million. That\u2019s 20% of the corporate finance line versus last year\u2019s 29%.","Bank loans, the opposite. We\u2019re up to about $67 million, which is 25% of the corporate finance revenue versus 22% last year. And again those lines offset each other. And other accounts as you had noted correctly, Craig, that line has moved up to $97 million from $82 million and that\u2019s 37% of the total.","Again it\u2019s important to call out that globally across all of Moody\u2019s investment grade of revenues represent only 7% of Moody\u2019s corporate revenues. And that\u2019s just something that we think sometimes is not fully appreciated. And we do also see an over focus on the U.S. So it\u2019s important that these trends are looked at on a global basis and that\u2019s spec grade and investment grade are considered in total.","We go into SFG, Craig. First of all, the total for structured was $95 million, up from $93 million last year. ADS, about flat at 24% of revenue, so up $23 million. RMBS also about flat at $18 million. That\u2019s 19% of revenues, about the same the last year. Commercial real estate at 31% versus 28% last year. Up to $29 million this year. And structured credit, which includes CLOs, $25 million, that\u2019s 26% of the structured revenue line versus 29% at the same time last year.","Moving onto FIG, $85 million revenue for the first quarter of this year. And banking constituted 67% of that, $57 million. Insurance constituted 25%, $21 million. And managed investments up to 8%, $6.6 million, which is up from last year\u2019s 4%.","And then lastly, public project and infrastructure, $80 million for the quarter. And as Ray had talked about public finance and sovereign, $37 million down from last year\u2019s $42 million, about 46% of the PPIF line. UNIF [ph] $3.8 million, which is 5% the same as last year. And then project and infrastructure $40 million, was up from last year and that\u2019s 49% of revenues.","Again we\u2019ve talked about we\u2019ve seen project and infrastructure being one of the beneficiaries of the disintermediation that Michel spoke about. We\u2019re seeing that a number of these deals are coming to the bond markets in project and infrastructure finance, which previously would have been funded by banks. So that\u2019s an helpful trend.","So I think that\u2019s it Craig. If we\u2019ve got everything you need.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott","Hi. My first question here is, how should we think about the impacts from the Ukraine? What has built into guidance from an outlook in that region, and how do you kind of risk adjust the numbers for that?","Ray McDaniel","Well it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s fairly easy for us to look at our business in Russia. And that is modest. So that is not a large driver of any change in outlook. But beyond that, geopolitical tensions are always difficult to address in an outlook, simply because there is the direct consequence of tension and how widespread that is. And then there is the collateral impact on business confidence and willingness to engage in business activity and focus on growth during periods of stress.","So we\u2019ve factored that into our modest reduction in outlook for the corporate finance area. And beyond that, we\u2019re really just going to have to comment as views change depending on what happens on the ground.","Linda Huber","And Joe, as usual to take the other side of that for you. The flight-to-quality in the U.S. Treasury has made them a very strong returning asset class for the first quarter as well. It\u2019s about the same 7.75% that I mentioned for long duration corporate bonds. So the flight-to-quality is just the price of U.S. Treasury and has resulted in the 10-year remaining at 2.64%. We\u2019ve been happily surprised to the 10-year under 2.7%, which I think is perhaps a bit different than many pundits have been calling for to this point of the year.","So a bit of a mixed bag for us in terms of how it affects our business. And I hope that gives you kind of both sides of the story for how think about that.","Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott","Yes, that\u2019s definitely helpful. On the Analytics business, obviously there is a positive uptick there. How sustainable is that step-up in the business? Should we think of this as accelerating, or is there a reason to be maybe a little bit more modest in our thoughts regarding it?","Ray McDaniel","Mark, do you want to address?","Mark Almeida","Sure. I think that I would characterize it as pretty much in line with our expectations to be honest. We had a good quarter. Organically we were at 10%, which we feel very good about, but we\u2019ve always thought of this business as a high-single-digit growth kind of business.","So we didn\u2019t \u2013 while we\u2019re very pleased with the quarter, we didn\u2019t feel like the quarter was wildly outlined with our expectations.","Linda Huber","So again try to make sure you understand, 10% organic, 15% with the acquisitions. Again we would urge everybody to take another look at Moody\u2019s Analytics and what it\u2019s able to do. And as we said earlier regarding the fact that one of our major customers are banks and they are looking to use a lot of our services. We have done very well in the Moody\u2019s Analytics in the first quarter.","Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott","All right. And then just the last one for me, just kind of general question. How should we think about issuance versus rising interest rates environment? Is there any sort of rule of thumb that you could provide as we look out on the year, different commentary from the Fed and the changes in those rate? Is there a base level for this business, and how do we kind of correlate those two?","Ray McDaniel","Yes, we\u2019ve listed this historically, and in our investor presentation, you would be able to see some of the historical data that we\u2019ve been able to collect. And long story short is we have had periods in the past of rising interest rates that did have a negative effect on the business in terms of lower or no growth, but more recent periods we have been able to grow through rising interest rate environments.","I think the reasons for that includes the fact that we have a much more global business over the last 10 to 15 years than we did back in the early 1990s. We have a much more substantial business in Moody\u2019s Analytics, which is not as susceptible to volatility based on movements in interest rates, but that all being said, I still go back to the kind of fundamental idea that in a rising rate environment, assuming that that rate environment is rising because of economic strength, there are going to be substantial bond market activity and borrowing for reasons unrelated to refinancing, so for share repurchase and capital expenditure, merging acquisitions. Those are all important drivers of issuance in a stronger economic scenario.","Linda Huber","And Joe, it\u2019s Linda. I can recite this from memory. In \u201893 to \u201894, interest rates went up 200 basis points over that year-long period. And Moody\u2019s revenue which as Ray said with much more U.S. centric at that time barely dipped. I believe it\u2019s \u201897 to \u201898, interest rates went up 180 basis points and Moody\u2019s revenue continued to trend up. When we do our first quarter slide, you\u2019ll see revenues for the corporation up 5%.","I\u2019d be surprised if overall global issuance has been up from the fourth quarter of last year. It\u2019s probably going to be flat to down. So once again, global issuance can be flat to down and our revenues move up. So it\u2019s very important that you understand that interest rates also continue to have trouble breaking above 3% in the 10-year. We were able to see that in January. We saw it in September, but we have not seen the 10-year come back through 3% for any sort of sustained period of time.","And there is pieces in journal today that higher interest rates are causing some real issues in the housing market. So again rates may move up, but they\u2019ve surprised us for being lower longer than perhaps we and a lot of market participants kind of expected. So I think we\u2019ll end our very long comment there.","Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott","Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Doug Arthur \u2013 Evercore Partners","Yes, Ray, just on the legal front. It seem like there were some developments in the CalFirst case in the first quarter. Can you just bring us up-to-date on kind of what inning that\u2019s in and what\u2019s the next step? Thank you.","Ray McDaniel","Sure. You\u2019ll recall that we had filed an appeal in California seeking reversal of the lower court decision denying our motion to dismiss the case under this, what\u2019s called the anti-SLAPP statute in California. And there was oral argument on that in early April. I think it was April 9. And according to what I\u2019ve been told are the rules in California, a decision on that appeal and the oral argument would be expected within 90 days following that argument.","Doug Arthur \u2013 Evercore Partners","So nothing is going to move forward until there is a decision on that?","Ray McDaniel","Correct. And as we\u2019ve talked about before, that is just one small piece of a much broader case that is still in many respects in very early stages.","Doug Arthur \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Stephen Sheldon \u2013 William Blair. Hi. It\u2019s Stephen Sheldon in for Tim. Most of my questions have been answered. But just in terms of headcount growth. You\u2019ve talked before about expecting roughly the same growth in 2014, as you saw in 2013, which I think was roughly 9%. Any changes to that? And maybe just add some additional color on where you\u2019re planning to add.","Linda Huber","Sure. What have you achieved? The headcount growth excluding Amba year-over-year has grown 10% here at Moody\u2019s. And a lot of that growth has been offshore in lower cross jurisdictions. If you split it out, the majority of the additions have been in the lines of business. And we do expect probably 9% headcount growth this year. And again a number of those \u2013 that growth will be offshore.","But again we\u2019re driving 10% to 15% growth in Moody\u2019s Analytics, and we\u2019ve been putting up double-digit growth on the revenue line. And in order to support that, it\u2019s important that we are able to add headcount to support both, the ratings and the Moody\u2019s Analytics side. So yes, we would continue to expect 9% headcount growth. But we\u2019re judicious about where we\u2019re adding those additional jobs.","Stephen Sheldon \u2013 William Blair. Okay, thanks.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ray McDaniel for any additional or closing remarks.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. I want to thank everyone for joining us.

I am Steve Maire, Global Head of Investor Relations and Communications. This morning, Moody's released its results for the first quarter of 2018, as well as our current outlook for full year 2018. An earnings press release and a presentation to accompany the teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.","Ray McDaniel, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead this morning's conference call. During this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures. To view the nearest equivalent GAAP figures and GAAP reconciliations, please refer to our earnings release that was filed this morning.","Before we begin, I call your attention to the Safe Harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the Act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the Risk Factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the SEC's website.","These, together with the Safe Harbor statement, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements. I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel.","Ray McDaniel","Thank you, Steve. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's First Quarter 2018 Financial Results. Steve is going to help me out with the prepared remarks by following up with some additional first quarter financial details and operating highlights. I'll then conclude with comments on our current outlook for 2018. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions. In the first quarter, Moody's achieve a record revenue of $1.1 billion a 16% increased from the first quarter of 2017, reflecting not only a strong contribution from Bureau van Dijk and but also solid organic growth from Moody's analytics, Moody's investor service contributed broad based transaction revenue growth particularly from structured finance activity as well as recurring revenue growth as 2017 new rating mandates became monitored credits. ","Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $636 million up 20% from the prior year period including 12 percentage points attributable to Bureau van Dijk operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-recurring acquisition-related expense. ","Operating income was $491 million, up 10% in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating income of $541 million was up 13%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income and adjusted operating income by 4% each. The operating margin was 43.6% and the adjusted operating margin was 48%. ","Moody's diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.92 per share of 8% from the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $2.02 per share up 35%, and excludes $0.10 per share related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses. First quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS primarily excludes a $0.31 per share gain from strategic realignment and expansion involving Moody's China affiliate CC Exxon. Our business remains well-positioned to benefit from continued global economic expansion in 2018 and as such we are affirming our full year 2018 guidance of $7.20 to $7.40 for diluted EPS and $7.65 to $7.85 for adjusted diluted EPS. ","I'll now turn the call back over to Steve to provide further commentary on our financial results and other upticks. ","Steve Maire","Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue with the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the first quarter was a record $1.1 billion, up 16%. U.S. revenue was of $598 million was up 3%; non-U.S. revenue of $529 million was up 33% and represented 47% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $603 million was up 26% and represented 54% of total revenue. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted Moody's revenue by 4%.","Looking now at each of our businesses starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $720 million, up 8%. U.S. revenue increased to 3% to $433 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $287 million was up 17% and represented 40% of total MIS revenue. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted MIS revenue by 3%.","Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, corporate finance revenue for the first quarter was $378 million, up 7%. This result reflected strong contribution from EMEA bank loans and U.S. investment grade as well as growth in recurring revenue resulted from an increase in new mandates in 2017. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were up 1% and 20% respectively.","Second, structured finance revenue totaled $130 million, up 29%. This results reflected broad strength in securitization markets with particularly strong levels at new CLO formation. U.S. and non-U.S. structured finance revenues were up 30% and 28% respectively. ","Third, financial institutions revenue of $114 million was up 2%. This result reflected growth in issuance from the EMEA banks and U.S. insurance companies partially offset by a decrease in activities from Asian and U.S. banks. U.S. financial institutions revenue was down 4% while non U.S. revenue was up 7%.","Fourth, public project and infrastructure finance revenue of $93 million was down 5%. This result primarily reflected a decrease in U.S. municipal insurance with loss tax exemptions for advanced refunding transaction. U.S. public project and infrastructure finance revenue was down 15% while non-US revenue was up 13%.","Turning now to Moody's Analytics, total revenue for MA of $107 million was up 33%. U.S. revenue of the $164 million was up 6% while non U.S. revenue of $243 million was up 60%, and represented 60% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted MA revenue by 4%. Organic MA revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $333 million up 9% from the prior year period.","Moving now to the lines of business for Moody's Analytics. First, research data and analytics or RD&A revenue of $269 million was up 53%. U.S. RD&A revenue was up 11% and non-US RD&A revenue more than double. Bureau van Dijk's revenue contribution of approximately $74 million included a $10 million reduction as a result of the deferred revenue adjustment required under acquisition accounting rules.","Organic RD&A revenue was $196 million, up 12% from the first quarter of 2017, driven by strength in sales of quarterly search and rating data fees. Second, enterprise risk solutions or ERS revenue of $100 million was up 4% from the prior year period. This result reflected strength in software subscription revenue partially offset by revenue decline from onetime projects and license. ","U.S. ERS revenue was down 4% while non-US revenue was up 11%. Trailing 12 month revenue for ERS increased 6%, while sales were approximately flat. We continue to make progress on shifting the mix of the ERS business emphasize higher-margin products with trailing 12 month product sales of 5% and service sales down 14%. Recurring revenue represented 81% of total ERS revenue in the first quarter 2018, up from 76% in the prior year period. Finally, professional services revenue of $38 million was up 5%. U.S. professional services revenue was down 4%, while non-US revenue was up 10%.","Turning now to operating expenses. Moody's first quarter operating expenses totaled $636 million up 20% from the prior year period. 12 percentage points of this increase were driven by operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition related expenses. Other drivers of expense growth include additional compensation expense for merit increases and hiring. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted operating expenses by 3%.","On January 1, 2018 the company adopted the new ASC 606 revenue accounting standard using the modified retrospective approach. The impact of adoption was immature with those both revenues and expenses in the first quarter of 2018. The impact of ASC 606 was expected to be immaterial to the corporation and the remainder of the year, however it could create some quarterly volatility.","As Ray mentioned, Moody's operating margin was 43.6% and adjusted operating margin was 48%. Moody's expected tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 14.6% down from 23.4% in the prior year period. The decline in the tax rate reflects the lower U.S. statutory tax rate net uncertain tax physician benefits relating to its statutory limitation exploration and higher benefit related to the tax accounting for accretive compensation. ","Now, I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter of 2018, Moody's repurchased approximately 300,000 shares at a total cost of $43 million or an average cost of $161.10 per share. Moody's also issued a net 1.2 million shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plans and net amount includes the shares with held for employees payroll taxes. Moody's also returned $84 million to its shareholders via dividend payments and on April 24, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share of Moody's common stock. This dividend will be payable on June 11, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 21, 2018.","Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2018 totaled $191.9 million, approximately flat to a year ago. As of March 31, 2018, Moody's had approximately $500 million of share repurchase authority remaining. At quarter-end, Moody's had $5.5 billion of outstanding debt and $910 million of additional borrowing capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $1.4 billion, an increase of 16% from December 31, 2017.","Cash flow from operations for the first three months of 2018 was 392 million and increase from negative 512 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow for the first three months of 2018 was $377 million, an increase from negative $531 million from the prior year period. These increases in cash flow were largely due to payments the company made in the first quarter of 2017 pursuing through 2016 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and various states attorneys general","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray.","Ray McDaniel","Okay, thanks Steve. Before just discussion the changes to our full-year guidance for 2018. I'd like to provide some highlights on our progress with Bureau van Dijk integration and synergy activities. After nearly nine month since closing the acquisition our integration efforts are on track with not only legal and regulatory requirements, and executed cost reductions without disruption to the business.","In March, we completed a rightsizing program to realize efficiencies across the combined employee base plus reducing compensation expense. Having co-located Moody's analytics and Bureau van Dijk staff in seven cities and with consolidation of additional offices expected through year-end we are well-positioned for significant reductions in real estate costs. We deployed Moody's analytics sales operations practices to Bureau van Dijk in order to gain increased sales productivity.","Our pursuing joint marketing efforts and specialized product areas, we are building a solid pipeline of near-term cross-selling opportunities. In short, we are making good progress on the synergies that we anticipate when we announced the transaction. And the legacy Bureau van Dijk's business continues toward the results consistent with its historical performance.","I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing the changes for our full year guidance for 2018. A complete list of Moody's guidance is included in table 12 of our first quarter 2018 earnings press release, which can be found on the Moody's investor relations website at ir.moodys.com. Moody's growth for 2018 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.","Our outlook assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of the $1.40 to \u00a31 and for the euro the $1.23 to \u20ac1. We are now expecting corporate finance revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Structured finance revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range.","Before turning the call over to Q&A I would like to provide an update on Moody's corporate social responsibility strategy. Earlier this week we launched a global approach to CSR focused on empowering people around the world with the information, resources and confidence they need to create a better future for themselves their communities and the environment. We also announced We Shape Tomorrow, our signature financial empowerment initiative to help people succeed in growing small businesses.","We Shape Tomorrow will provide small business owners access to vital information about the credit process and help them connect with sources of financing. Moody's seeking partnership proposals from organizations for We Shape Tomorrow programs and resources that provide essential financial knowledge, increase their chances of success. For more information and to submit a proposal, please see the CSR press release that we issued on April 24 or visit moodys.com\/csr.","This concludes our remarks and joining Steve and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investor Service. We would be pleased to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Conor Fitzgerald","Just wanted to dig a little bit on the recurring revenue on the rating side where you had a pretty good quarter particularly in corporate finance. Just can you talk a little bit about the trends you are seeing in this space and how sustainable do you think the pace of growth is?","Ray McDaniel","Sure happy to Conor and I'll ask Rob Fauber to offer some initial thoughts on that.","Bob Fauber","Yes, so your first question was around recurring revenue. So somewhere to the fourth quarter among other things we saw increases in monitored credits, particularly in Europe and Asia where we have seen some very strong first time mandate growth and we have also got a modest benefit from FX. And if you recall we had over 1,000 first time mandates in 2017, so that's helping to support the current revenue growth. And I think your second question was around corporate generally. So looking at corporate issuance globally it was down somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% on this CFT revenues. Whereof we benefitted from some favorable mix, some good commercial execution, the higher new mandates that I mentioned, monitored credit growth and FX. We also saw some good growth in other transaction revenue and that includes our rating adjustment service that's typically driven by M&A activity and the rest of world issuance declines were largely confined to the European investment grade issuers which mitigated the revenue impact to some extent.","Steve Maire","And I would just add that as far as recurring revenue at MIS to the extent that is driven off of new rating mandates and we are benefiting from the strength of that in 2017. We do expect another robust year for our new rating mandates in '18.","Ray McDaniel","And then Connor let me just take the opportunity to give an update on what we're hearing from the street as we do every quarter and again keep in mind these are consolidated consensus views from a variety of different large investment banks has included both financial and non-financial that we would be necessarily in line with the rate and categorized revenue but hopefully will be instructed to at least what we're hearing on the ground in the bond markets here in the U.S. and in India. But so far investment grades guidance for full-year levels are about 1.2 trillion that's down roughly 5% to 10% from what were record levels in 2017.","Overall conditions remain stable and fundamentals remain relatively strong and we are seeing a solid pipeline out front this week. For instance another was around 20 billion of investment-grade, I think calling next week or slightly higher than that as earnings blackout start to roll-off in May which is typically a fairly active month as from what we're hearing is shaping up to be so. Credit spreads have widened in the first quarter given equity market volatility but rallied a bit in April. The Barclays, Bloomberg aggregate bond index is roughly 10 basis wider here today. So the round trip is showing sort of modest widening on a year-to-date basis.","And then other thing I've pointed out some cash repatriates have been out in the market so far in Q1 so let's keep an eye on that. Moving to high yield the forecast for full-year volumes 275 billion that's about flat to 2017, every market volatility and interest heights we've obviously seen one so far this year. The Fed is or the future market is pricing in between two and three incremental heights likely an excellent will be in June with a 90% plus probability.","Issuance today is primarily have been driven by refinancing and high yield bond market but demand from investors remained strong and on the close I would say a similar story as to investment grade in terms of the joining has been taken year-to-date given the and tightening in January and selling off in February and March and then some rallying over the last several weeks but year-to-date relatively unchanged in credit spreads volume of bonds.","On leverage loan side full-year forecast that we are hearing is roughly 500 billion. Again this is flat to down 10% on what was really just a game buster to the year this asset class in 2017, so a very high base. As the leverage loan market does remain strong as we now know and is obviously an attractive asset class in a rising rate environment. Repricing and refinancing activity this still remains robust that was with regard to last year and we're seeing that trend continue. Full-year 2018 expected to be slightly down as I mentioned somewhat was directed through that 2017 with some potential upside if we see M&A activity accelerate or rising rates create more demand for floating rate base than we already think.","Moving to Europe on the investment grade side issuance has picked up in the beginning of the year. The demand remained solid as [we are hoping]. The spreads have moved a bit wider from the beginning of the year but remain tight by historical standard so similar dynamics to what we are seeing on the U.S. dollar spread investment grade. Bureau van Dijk continues to see strong growth in GDP and corporate profits. So that's the happy condition.","On spec rate side both high yield and leverage loan markets are in good shape, though issuance levels face tough comps over what was a strong 2017. And spreads are narrow due to strong demand fueling opportunistic issuance, our pipeline is healthy and some of the -- some of our refinancing and repricing. So I hope that helps.","Conor Fitzgerald","And then just one on capital and capital return, cash is up at the quarter and you have got some debt pay downs coming in as we get through the rest of the year. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on what you are thinking about doing with the free cash flow? I think based on your guidance you still have a little extra wiggle room such with all those moving pieces together, buybacks, debt pay down, et cetera. So just wanted to get your updated thoughts.","Ray McDaniel","Our thinking there really hasn't changed, Connor. We have been very upfront really since we announced the Bureau van Dijk acquisition that our near term priority would be deleveraging from the debt that we took on to finance that acquisition. But we haven't come off of that, as you know we took our share repurchase target for 2017 to 200 million, 2018 the same amount and that's enough to offset dilution from employee shares issuance. So we are still marching along those same times. To the extent that we are able to reach our leverage targets sooner than we expected, I'd say at this point we are a bit ahead of pace than we had initially thought, then we will [fortunately] to reevaluate over the months there. But right now near term it is actually prepaying debt.","Operator","And I'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","You had a good quarter in corporate finance, revenue up basically 7% globally and really difficult comp in that business. So I think I was just a little bit surprised that the revenue guide for the year, you lowered it and so can you just talk about -- I guess you just talked about like what's going on in the markets but I'm just not totally sure as to what to think for the rest of the year given [indiscernible] guide but okay first quarter.","Ray McDaniel","Yes, Rob may want to provide some additional color but the high level answer is we do have a moderation of issuance expectations for U.S. high-yield and many investment grade bonds. And you add to that what we anticipate will be an adverse shift in foreign currency translation and that's really contributing to the modest reset in our guidance.","Toni Kaplan","And then for Moody's Analytics, we noticed that the margins were -- it was about 20 basis points -- were up about 200 basis points but they are down sequentially from -- for the second half of '17. And so we are just wondering if you have to sort of look at the legacy business margin expansion as opposed to just BVD been included. How should we think about the legacy margin expansion if you exclude that?","Ray McDaniel","Mark you want to try and address that.","Mark Almeida","Yes, Toni we did have what we thought was good year-on-year margin expansion and moreover, we have got another quarter of margin expansion on a trailing 12 months basis. So I think that's five consecutive quarters now that on a trailing 12 months basis the margin is expanding. And that's really the number that we focused on because you can get some weird things going on with the numbers if you look at anyone discreet quarter. But the margin expansion is coming from both the legacy business as well as from Bureau van Dijk. Both pieces are contributing to expansion and that's in spite of the hair cut on the Bureau van Dijk revenue associated with the accounting and also the extra overhead allocation that Moody's Analytics is now attracting because of the growth in the scale of the business relative to MIS with the addition of Bureau van Dijk.","So we are -- actually we are quite pleased with the way the margin is expanding and we feel like where we really are delivering on what we talked about with respect to delivering consistent gradual progress in expanding the margin and again focusing very heavily on the trailing 12 months performance rather than the discreet quarters.","Steve Maire","And I will just comment to you Toni on the differed revenue hair cut that Mark just mentioned. We experienced 10 million of it this quarter, so we are most of the way through it. We got of 5 and some change left, 5 should likely hit next quarter and then [indiscernible] will be largely done and after that it goes way. So that will be a nice uplift for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Staying on I guess BVD Analytics for a minute here. I think a lot of people were surprised this morning by the revenue performance and RD&A and in particular on BVD. So maybe you can talk about it a little bit more why maybe some of us got that wrong in terms of the seasonality and how does it all ramp all throughout the year? But maybe most importantly I think the adjusted number for BVD was flat quarter-over-quarter so I guess I would have expected some growth in particular given that FX was helpful? So maybe a little bit more color would be great.","Ray McDaniel","Sure. Mark?","Mark Almeida","Alex taking the your second point first, the Bureau van Dijk numbers if you add back the haircut to what we reported you are right that it's flat from the fourth quarter to first quarter. What you are missing there is that we did take a hit to the top line in the first quarter because of the transition to the new accounting standard ASC 606. That did hurt us on the top line. We also had some timing delays in closing some of our renewal contracts that really relates to operational matters as opposed to commercial matters. We don't have issues with the customers or with the business but we just didn't get some of those contracts booked in the first quarter as expected. But we expect to get them shortly and we will see an acceleration like a catch up on the revenue recognition once we get those booked. So that's what going on there.","The underlying business is performing well. As Ray said it's very much in line with if not better than the historical standalone performance of the business. So we feel very good about what's happening there. And then on the other point, I think that what you're seeing is that we do expect RD&A's growth rate to accelerate, particularly in the second half of the year. You need to keep in mind that what's happening here is that as we get into the third quarter, Bureau van Dijk numbers will start to roll into our organic calculations, because we will have them in the half of the third quarter and the full fourth quarter of '17. And as Steve just pointed out that deferred revenue haircut will go away. So we're willing to see very healthy growth in the organic RD&A figures as we get into the second half of the year.","Steve Maire","And then I guess just one other point I'd make Alex, you made a comment about expecting a nice lift from FX. The average rate on the Euro really wasn't materially different in Q4 versus Q1. Obviously the Euro strengthened pretty meaningfully last year, but most of that's in place sort of really to midyear. So it was relatively flat quarter on quarter.","Alex Kramm","Okay. And since then I thought it was up 4% or 5%, but it's okay. I will double check, anyways. And then secondly just quickly, I think when you gave the update on the issuance outlook, leverage loans was still cited as an area of strength and I think you colleagues said this yesterday too with flows to bond funds and demand for variable paper. But LIBOR has certainly been coming up a lot, so while spreads are tight in this demand, like what about the corporate side? Is there a point where some of these high yield issuers are seeing the variable rates just too high or do you think we are still pretty far away from that? And any color would be helpful.","Ray McDaniel","This is Ray, just the [ebbs in] borrowing costs are still attractive and I think there is room even in a rising rate environment for borrowing conditions to remain attractive. We may see later in the year some rebalancing between the relative attractiveness of floating versus fixed rate paper, it really depends on both policy and market reactions to policy on interest rate. So we'll see but we do see a broadly positive environment for borrowing continuing.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","I guess you answered my question I had on BVD but maybe if you do the rest of the Moody's Analytics business I think the organic growth is 9% you called out. I believe that includes FX benefits. So if I assume it's about 4% to 5% growth, I guess can you just help understand it feels a little slower than we would have expected? Any moving pieces maybe timing in the other pieces of RD&A, ERS and so forth?","Ray McDaniel","There is a little bit of timing there and like I said we do expect acceleration in the growth rate as we get into the second half of the year. But bear in mind we guided to low double-digit growth for MA organically. And we came in at 9% in Q1. Of course our guidance includes our expectations about FX. So I think things are running substantially as we expected. We don't see a big deviation from where our guidance is and where we see the business performing.","Manav Patnaik","That's fair. But I guess if I do a true organic constant currency number that 9 is probably 4 or 5. And I was just -- we have always thoughts that it should be more high single digit growth. So is there some -- so if that timing explain why that is in higher I suppose, was I was trying to get at?","Ray McDaniel","Well RD&A organically constant currency is up 7% in the first quarter. So again it feels pretty solid.","Manav Patnaik","And then just a follow-up, maybe just on the back drop. It sounds like you guys still remains constructive on the issuance backdrop as you were at Investor Day. Maybe just on the structured side like how much do you think -- it was pretty strong obviously in the quarter. Like how much of that do you think was pull forward and you see weakness and so forth? I know pull forwards a word we've been using for many years now but just some thoughts there would be helpful?","Ray McDaniel","As we talked about a little earlier in the year our expectations for robust issuance environment were relying more on a global GDP growth economic momentum, mergers and acquisition activity as opposed to refinancing that was going to be needed because of maturing debt in 2018. That being said you are correct we've had a continuing pull forward narrative and dialog and so as interest rates increase in 2018 we have to look out to 2019 and 2020 and see what corporations are thinking about the utility of refinancing in 2018 with rates where they are now versus their expectations for rates in 2019 and 2020 and we will have to watch and see where those decisions get made.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi","I was wondering if you could be a little bit more specific on what caused the renewal delays or timing in RD&A and how you rectified it?","Mark Almeida","It's really -- it's pretty simple and frankly we've seen this before with some -- when we've acquired subscription businesses. The practices at Bureau van Dijk have not historically been as rigorous as we do think in Moody's Analytics and we haven't quiet gotten the discipline around getting our renewal contracts signed in book on a timely basis. But as we're making progress in getting them with the program and getting that work done the way we get it done across Moody's Analytics but we haven't quite gotten them to the level that we'd like. So that's really what I was referring to. It's not a massive amount of business but it does affect our numbers a little bit in the first quarter. But as I said we fully expect to get those sorted out in short order and will have the revenue catch up once they get booked. I should note that attrition in the business is holding very steady at kind of their historical experience, so we don't see any problems with the underlying business. It's really just an operational matter.","Joseph Foresi","And just to go back to guidance, why not raise the guidance at least on the margins and the earnings side of things? Is there a change you are expecting to the cost structure or was that due to the lower revenue outlook you mentioned a little bit earlier?","Steve Maire","It's -- I hope we are being cautious on the top line outlook but we have some robust comps that we are going to be lapping in for the rest of the year. And we are in an environment where rates are moving up at least modestly, spreads have widened out a bit. So we're taking a I think a prudent but you might say cautious approach to what the top line opportunity is for the rest of the year.","Ray McDaniel","And Joe I'd just add, just to give an update to help you with your modeling on the expense ramp we are expecting it still to increase between $60 million and $70 million from Q1 to Q4, so the starting point is obviously not 636 which is actually right in line with what we have talked about in the last call. So we are still expecting growth as we move through the year. So that's part of why we are being thoughtful about our guidance on the margins.","Operator","And our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert","Mark I want to make sure I fully understand the impact of deferred revenue of BVD on the profitability. Is it correct to say that your deferring revenue with all costs have to recognized as incurred, and therefore you are perhaps understating the margins currently and we might anticipate some fairly meaningful spike in margin in the third and fourth quarter? Hope it's right.","Mark Almeida","Yes, you understand that perfectly Peter. I think the only tweak I might make to what you said is just the -- I forget now what exactly what words used but you maybe said it with a bit more bigger than I would have in terms of the amount of additional margin we will see when we stop hair cutting the top line with these accounting adjustments. But yes, absolutely, we are absorbing and we are recording all of the expense but we are not recording all of that revenue on the P&L.","Peter Appert","Is it possible to quantify that a bit more then Mark in terms of -- for example in the first quarter you deferred 10 million of revenue. Would that imply if this is a 40% margin business, the operating income would have otherwise been formally and higher?","Mark Almeida","You did the math right, yes.","Peter Appert","Okay.","Mark Almeida","Peter just to clarify, the differed revenue haircut would have added $10 million to the top line and there would be taxes on that, but otherwise there's no additional expense associated with it. We are recognizing all of the expenses.","Steve Maire","And also just a reminder to everyone to how that works. The majority that we have taken in Q3 and Q4 last year. So it was roughly 50 all in, about 39 of that was taken, a little north of 39 that was taken in '17 in Q3 and Q4 so the remainder of the '16 is left in 2018. And again, we recognized the 10 this quarter projecting 5 next quarter and then this is very [indiscernible].","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jeffrey Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Silber","I was wondering if we can get an update on the CFO search.","Ray McDaniel","Sure, it's ongoing, we've seen some excellent candidates. We have good candidates both inside Moody's and we are conducting an external search as well. I hope to be able to close out the search in the near future but it's still in process.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay. And when you are saying you are searching, can you remind me if you put a time expectation on that beforehand?","Ray McDaniel","Well I'd like to have it done today but I want to make sure that we get the best possible candidate. So I'm not going to put a deadline on it, I'm just going to keep working at it.","Jeffrey Silber","I understand. I appreciate that. And just one quick numbers question. I know the tax rate was lower this quarter, you highlighted some of the items. What would we be using going forward for the tax rate for our models?","Steve Maire","It was quite a bit lower and we commented on the last call to expect exactly that. We have estimates of excess tax benefit related to the stock comp accounting of roughly 40 million for the year and we said that it was obviously [weighted] towards the first quarter. In fact it was about 35%, 30 million was taken in the first quarter, there's 10 or so remaining of it fairly evenly spread out. So that was one piece that was impacting the tax rate. Another item that you really wouldn't have visibility into but there was an alternate benefit that we received in the first quarter from the statute limitations expiration on certain of that tax to uncertain tax positions that we have a reserve for. So we reversed those out, so that further brought down the ETR. So going forward Jeff, obviously 14.6% in Q1 we haven't changed our guidance of 22% to 23% so the math would indicate that it's going to likely have to be slightly higher than that 22% to 23% for the remaining quarters in order to average out to the 22 to 23 guidance.","Operator","And we will take our next question Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Ray, would you willing just talking further about your outlook here for bank loan issuance and for the rest of the year here? I know you talked at the investment bank side, I think it would be down -- flat to down 5% in the U.S. What is your thoughts for the year on how that will play out here in this environment?","Ray McDaniel","As you saw for bank loans we had a good first quarter. There was a lot of strength in our European bank loan business and I will let Rob provide a little more color on that. But overall we are looking at flat to slightly up revenue expectations for bank loans for the full-year which would be a little bit better than what we're expecting in terms of the direction of issuance line which should be slightly down. So we think that we have opportunities to increase our coverage in bank loans and again I would point to the strength in Europe that we've seen. And Rob I don't know if there is anything you wanted to add on that.","Bob Fauber","That's right Ray and I think we we're seeing a very active bank loan market. I think we have to keep in mind when we are talking about the issuance outlook for the full-year we're coming off a year where global issuance last year was just something north of 30% growth I believe. The bank loan market has been a bit more active than the high yield market. We're seeing a lot of first time issuers come through the bank loan market. We're also seeing a lot of issuers that are rated very low in the credit spectrum.","As Ray just said, in Europe, we saw some nice revenue growth in bank loans on generally flattish issuance this quarter. The issuance mix worked in our favor there. Leverage loan volumes in Europe, while again kind of flattish are at a record chase. And there is very good M&A activity supporting the loan volumes there compared to the prior year quarter where we saw a bit more refi activity. And also in Europe, we have got institutional investors and CLO originators that have got very strong bids for these loans. So that's driving down the funding costs and keeping spreads tight for issuers there.","Ray McDaniel","And then one thing I'd add on to Rob's comment is with some of these bank loan borrowers profiling as a high credit risk low rated entities. There is some potential volatility that could enter the equation if the default rates don't continue to decline. We believe they will through the year but if there is an increase in default rate that makes those deep speculative grade names less attractive and they may not have market access.","Craig Huber","Then also I'd like to just quickly ask two quick ones if I could. For BDV what was the underlying growth rate to put aside the revenue adjustment for accounting purposes? And then also up 7.7% ratings to revenue growth the whole division, how much of that would you tie into being directly from the new mandate? Was it half of it coming from there, roughly how much please?","Ray McDaniel","I think it's going to be less than that Craig. I don't have a number for you right away but we can check on that. But it's not going to be the majority, no.","Mark Almeida","On Bureau van Dijk, Craig we're not disclosing the precise numbers for Bureau van Dijk on a standalone basis but suffice to say its performing at a rate that is very consistent with what we would've showed you when we announced the acquisition in terms of its historical growth rate.","Craig Huber","Mark how historical was what 9%, 10% so its roughly\u2026","Mark Almeida","It was lying in the high single-digits around 9%.","Craig Huber","So you suggest you are pretty close to that then?","Mark Almeida","Yes, absolutely.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","Bill Warmington","So the first question for you on the structured finance segment. You highlighted the CLO and the CMBS demand being particularly strong, but also look at the demand was really pretty broad. I wanted to ask about what was driving that? And then also to ask if there was any pull forward there to highlight?","Ray McDaniel","Rob?","Bob Fauber","Yes, let me take that. And I think you are right. Generally we saw broadly higher securitization volumes and you're right. We called out U.S. CLOs but we have seen -- experienced some robust activity across a number of other sectors. Just to touch on CLOs because it was such a big driver for the quarter, we have seen very strong refi activity on tighter spreads. We also saw higher proportion of new CLO formation as a percent of total deals in the first quarter higher than any quarter that we had in 2017 and that's helped in part by using our risk retention.","The U.S. is obviously a bigger market for structured credit, but a similar story in Europe with European CLO volumes supported by refi and as I've said earlier also a very hot leverage loan market. We saw an uptick in CMBS deals and very robust ABS volume on very strong investor demand. In Europe we saw RMBS volumes up particularly in the UK, in the Netherlands and the UK really benefiting -- volumes were benefitting from the conclusion of the Bank of England's term funding scheme in February which was a chief source of funding for banks.","I would also note that Q1 '17 was a little bit of an easier comp for structured. If you think all the way back to Q4 of 2016, we did see some pull forward because of the implementation of risk retention in the beginning of 2017, so it's a little bit of an easier comp as well.","Mark Almeida","And also I would just add on to that after this call we will post on the IR website as we always do after our earnings calls the breakdown of the components to the lines of business of revenue for the rating agency and you'll see CLO quarter-over-quarter Q1 '17 and Q1 '18 structure credit line is up 58%, ABS up 24%, RMBS up 90%. So broad based strength across pretty much all the asset classes.","Bill Warmington","And then for my follow-up question, I wanted to ask about the war for IT talent, well it seems to be intensifying as you see tech services companies across verticals looking to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning. And I wanted to ask whether you find that you are able to get the talent you need and whether there are any changes that you are thinking about making to ensure that you continue to get the talent you need?","Ray McDaniel","Well I think broadly speaking, we do feel that we are able to attract very talented IT professionals whether it's in our centralized IT function or embedded in the businesses. A lot of this is how attractive the opportunity is, in terms of what we would have people working on, whether it's robotic process automation or product development, it is an attractive offering. You're correct that there is a lot of competition for the best people. So we've got to stay on top of that. We will adjust to make sure that we continue to retain our best people and recruit the best people and those adjustments they maybe financial, they maybe in terms of job content. But we're paying attention to it like almost any organization today would. Mark do you want to add to that.","Mark Almeida","Yes, I would just add that, what we are also seeing is that there is a lot of talent available in many different locations around the world. Certainly it's quite challenging if you are recruiting in San Francisco and New York City and some other major centers. But we've got operations in many different place around the world. We've got a big operation in Omaha for example and we find there to be a terrific source of talent. And in many of our other operational centers around the world we are able to attract the kind of talent we want. So I think having the broad based footprint that we have really helps us in that respect.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Tim McHugh","One numbers one, can you just update us on incentive comp, how much you accrued in the quarter and I guess any change to that outlook versus what you are expecting for the full year now?","Steve Maire","Yes, sure Tim, happy to provide that. So for the first quarter, incentive comp was 45 million, that was down 13% from first quarter of last year and 37% sequentially. As you know we had to take that up pretty significantly in the back half of '17 as we raised guidance given the performance of the business. Going forward I would say sort of a 50ish number is probably the best way to think about. But as you know that will likely change depending on how the business performs, depending on what we do with guidance, but that I think is probably the starting point.","Tim McHugh","And then ERS product sales on the trailing 12 month basis was actually a little slower. I get like services sale is something you have been deemphasizing, but I guess I was a little surprised about the pace of product sales growth. Was there anything happening there that you can elaborate on?","Ray McDaniel","I think Tim, its performing pretty much as we expected. I mean I think we have got a number of new product launches that we put in to the market recently that have been very well received. Our new loan origination product is doing quite well. The product that we have in the market to help our customers comply with the new seasonal accounting standard is being very well received. We have a very nice pipeline building there. And so we are -- if you drill that a little bit more into these numbers you will see that we've got continued double-digit sales growth for renewable products, which is really where we are putting our emphasis.","I think we have got at least five or six quarters now of double-digit growth in renewable product sales. So I think things are going very much in line with our expectations there as we have told you. We expect 2018 to be a fairly soft year for ERS as we work through this transition. But we feel very good about some things that are happening in the business and that should play out very nicely for us over a longer period of time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous.","Vincent Hung","How much of the non-transaction revenue comes from rating assessment services? And if you can't give us that what was it up year-over-year? Because I think S&P said it was at 40%.","Ray McDaniel","Our revenue from rating assessment services is not very significant to tell you the truth. I don't have the year-on-year growth rate in front of me. But again, it's not a material number.","Vincent Hung","On RD&A as we think about the core RD&A excluding BVD, should we be looking at 12% organic as the right run rate for the rest of the year?","Ray McDaniel","12 well, again, our guidance RD&A organic is mid teens for this year. And we did 12% in the first quarter. We expect that to accelerate as I've said because we will be layering in Bureau van Dijk it's going to help. So I guess you are asking me will -- am I expecting 12% growth from RD&A on an organic basis excluding Bureau van Dijk, is that the question?","Vincent Hung","Yes exactly. ","Ray McDaniel","Again, I don't really have I don't think we can give you guidance at that granular level. But I would expect that the RD&A business organically would continue to perform at a level similar to what we did in the first quarter if you were to pull out the Bureau van Dijk business. I don't see it -- let's put it this way, I wouldn't expect that business to be -- the growth rate to be slow.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","First just a regular numbers question. What was the organic constant currency growth for the whole company? If you just kind of strip out both Bureau van Dijk and then the positive impact from FX some of which went into Bureau van Dijk.","Steve Maire","Sure Shlomo. That should be -- so we have said that 60% top line for Moody's Corporation half of that was due to the contribution from Bureau van Dijk and the FX impact on all that revenue was 4%, so if you strip that out they get you down to 4.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","The thing is that data took in MIS at 5 and then there seems to be kind of 9 when you take out BVD, it implies a little bit higher than that. That's what I'm trying to get out the number it seems to be little bit higher?","Steve Maire","That's the math at least for the first quarter.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Can you comment a little bit on the economy and the performance for between the U.S. and outside the U.S. for ERS and Professional Services?","Ray McDaniel","I'll let mark start with this and I may add a couple of comments on to it.","Mark Almeida","Yes I think a couple of things going on there. First we had some pretty significant FX benefit which is obviously impacting the business outside the U.S. Also we had some very strong sales growth outside the U.S. in -- particularly in ERS last year related to work that we were doing associated with our customer's adoption of the IFRS 9 accounting standard. So that gave us some very good sales growth outside the U.S. last year relative to the U.S. which I think is now showing up in the U.S. -- non-U.S. revenue results.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And Professional Services?","Mark Almeida","Again a similar story but in our two businesses within Professional Services they both tend to be a little bit more heavily oriented for customers outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. So I think it's just the nature of those businesses is such that we've just got a bigger base of customers and a bigger base of business to work with outside of the U.S. and to the extent that those businesses are performing better we're seeing most of the improved growth outside the U.S.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","What's been the impact of tax reform on synthetic repatriation bond issuance thus far in 2018? And I was reading the other day that the 10 largest holders of overseas cash haven't tapped U.S. bond market so far this year after issuing roughly I think it is 80 billion or so last couple of years. But obviously that doesn't seem to be weighing on your Corporate Finance revenues so far?","Ray McDaniel","This follows up on a brief comment that Rob had made earlier, that it is providing at least a modest headwind, but it is very concentrated in terms of the number of firms that have large cash hordes overseas and may not feel they want to tap the debt markets given their repatriated cash. So the numbers -- if you look at the dollars you might think it provides more of a headwind to our business than in fact it is. And I would just add that with so much of our business being in the spec grade sector those are not companies that typically have a lot of overseas cash to bring back. So again it's a headwind not a serious one at this point.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","I actually had a follow-up on the tax rate but that got answered already. But a couple of things while I'm here I guess. One, I know you don't really give near term guidance but would be interested with the commentary you have said in terms of the updated outlook how you think about more near term? I mean the first quarter has -- I mean on the MIS side, had a little bit of volatility, some of the this volatility has persisted. But typically the second quarter gets a little bit of a seasonal bump from the 1Q. So I'm just wondering if you feel like seasonally the second quarter should be stronger than 1Q just given seasonality, maybe some things were delayed and they are coming in the second quarter or is it just too uncertain of an environment? I guess I'd say you probably see the pipeline developing pretty real time. So any color will be great.","Ray McDaniel","Let me try that Alex. So I'm going to talk a little bit about kind of the pipeline in market terms and kind of what we are seeing and what's happening. I think in general I'd say the pipelines look healthy. I'd note that we have worked through a good bit of the big M&A backlog that we had earlier in the year but we are also seeing M&A deals in kind of preliminary stages and we are seeing that through our rating assessment service. We have also got a very good pipeline of first time mandates. So that gives us some visibility.","We have talked about in spec rate market, spreads remain very tight and as I said we are seeing a lot of low rated issues tapping the market, a very strong CLO bid for that kind of paper. I'd also note just in terms of fund flows, so on the high yield side after we saw a lot of outflows earlier in the year we are starting to see some inflows back in the high yield funds. We saw 3 billion inflows last week. That was the largest week since mid-December 2016. And on the loan side inflows continue to be strong. We have had now nine consecutive weeks of inflows. So I think we expect on the investment grade side we are coming out of blackouts, we are seeing good activity and I think we expect steady issuance here in the second quarter.","Alex Kramm","And then maybe just lastly, Ray, I think M&A hasn't really come up as a topic. I know you are pretty busy integrating BVD still but just curious about appetite right now as you look at the world and maybe also what the environment is like for deals in areas that you are interested in? I mean is there a good bid ask or I think just to [expense the voice] there's not really anything out there that you are taking a look at?","Ray McDaniel","Well things are always to expense, so they are a very good starting point. We have an active corporate development function at Moody's, M&A function. We look at a lot. As you know, we don't pull the trigger very often. So there are things that we are looking at that are of interest to us but it would be the same thing I would answer in any other quarter. There is nothing unusual going on in the M&A environment that is causing us to either step back and say it's too rich for us or to say we've got to act right now. This is the moment in time to pull a trigger. So we're being disciplined. We are looking and we will see if something attractive is offered at a fair price.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ray McDaniel, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Ray McDaniel","Okay. I Just want to thank everyone for joining today's call and we look forward to speaking with you again in the summer. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes Moody's first quarter 2018 earnings call. As a reminder, immediately following this call, the company will post the MIS revenue breakdown under the First Quarter 2018 Earnings section of the Moody's IR homepage. Additionally, a replay of this call will be available after 3:30 PM Eastern Time on Moody's IR website. Thank you."]}}
