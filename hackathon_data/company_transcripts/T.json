At this time, all participant phone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] As I reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael Viola","Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. We'll begin with our 2019 progress and our third quarter results, but we want to spend most of our time today on the 3 year guidance and capital allocation plans that we announced this morning, then we'll take your questions.","Before we begin, I want to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of the comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties, results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. I also want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC's Spectrum Auction 103, so we can't answer any questions about that today. And as always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That includes the news release, investor briefing, 8-K, et cetera.","And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Randall Stephenson.","Randall Stephenson","Okay. Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. On Slide 3, you'll see some of this listed. Last November, we laid out our 2019 commitments and we challenged the team to deliver, and they have.","The punchline for the quarter is that we remain on target to meet every single objective for the year. We said leverage would be around 2.5 times by year-end, and we're on track to hit that target. We told you that full year EPS would grow in the low single digits, and we're checking that box.","We said we'd generate $26 billion of free cash flow, and now we're tracking to $28 billion. We said we would remain very active on the portfolio front, evaluating and executing opportunities to monetize $6 billion to $8 billion in non-core assets, and we have. Our current forecast is to realize $14 billion by year-end.","We said that our wireless business would return to top line growth, and it has. Year-to-date, wireless service revenues are up nearly 2%. We committed to stabilizing Entertainment Group EBITDA despite the DIRECTV top line pressures, and through 3 quarters, Entertainment Group EBITDA is growing. And we needed to do all of this while integrating WarnerMedia, hitting our synergy targets and introducing several new services.","So across the board, we're positioned to meet or exceed every commitment for the year. In a few minutes, I'll cover our 3 year plan, and you'll begin to understand why I feel good about meeting those commitments as well. But before we get into that, let me turn it over to John, and he'll go deeper into the quarter. So John?","John Stephens","Thanks, Randall. When looking at our third quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.94, up more than 4% and up slightly for the year. As Randall mentioned, we're on track to reach our expected low single-digit growth for the full year.","Revenues were down in the quarter due in part to tough year-over-year comparables at Warner Bros., along with video and FX impacts. However, adjusted operating margin was up 30 basis points with gains in Mobility, entertainment and WarnerMedia.","Our cash flows are on a record pace for the year. Cash from operations came in at $11.4 billion, and free cash flow was $6.2 billion in the quarter and nearly $21 billion year-to-date.","This puts us firmly on track to reach our full year target of free cash flow in the $28 billion range, both from an ongoing operations and including about $2 billion from a full year of applying our working capital approach to WarnerMedia's assets.","This solid free cash flow comes even with strong capital investment. CapEx was $5.2 billion, and total capital investment was $6 billion when you include the $800 million of payments for prior vendor financing activity.","As Randall said, with asset sales as well as expected free cash flow in the fourth quarter, we expect to hit our 2.5 times range net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA target by the end of the year.","Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications segment on Slide 6. Starting with Mobility. We're growing service revenues and adding phone subscribers while increasing EBITDA.","Wireless service revenues grew by about 1% in the quarter and approximately 2% year-to-date, and we expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter. EBITDA grew by 1.6% to $7.8 billion, and EBITDA margins expanded by 80 basis points with service margins of 55.7%. During the quarter, we had 255,000 phone net adds, including more than 100,000 postpaid and 154,000 prepaid voice.","We also continue to stack up industry awards, including being named the nation's best wireless network for the second year in a row and fastest for the third consecutive quarter. These awards say it best: Our network investment and spectrum deployment are paying off.","Let's now look at our Entertainment Group. One of our key priorities for 2019 was to stabilize Entertainment Group's EBITDA. Year-to-date, we're up 2.3% with expense reductions outpacing video and legacy revenue losses. premium video and IP broadband ARPUs continue to grow. Our 300,000-plus AT&T Fiber net adds helped drive broadband revenue growth.","We also expect that our premium video losses have peaked. We had about 225,000 net losses due to programming blackouts. Our gross adds were down about 400,000 due to new, higher intro pricing and credit thresholds, as well as more targeted promotions, and we continue to work through customers rolling off 2 year price locks. Those video losses also impacted our broadband numbers, especially our bundled customers, but we did have more than 300,000 AT&T Fiber net adds in the quarter.","And Business Wireline revenue trends improved year-over-year, thanks to strength in strategic and managed services. That performance came even with about $80 million less of intellectual property revenue when compared to the year ago quarter. With our strong business wireless performance, our Business Solutions revenues grew by about 1%.","Let's move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results which are on Slide 7. WarnerMedia revenues largely reflect a comparison to a very strong revenue third quarter last year, which includes strong television licensing revenue growth and a box office slate that includes several hits. But WarnerMedia operating margins expanded in the quarter. Even with lower revenues, Warners Bros. operating income was up 2% due to lower film and TV production costs.","We also will have challenging comparisons to the fourth quarter. We're off to a strong start with the box office success of Joker. But remember, the fourth quarter of last year included blockbuster movies such as Aquaman, Fantastic Beasts 2 and A Star is Born.","Turner revenues were up on subscription revenue growth, partly offset by lower advertising and content licensing and other revenues, but operating income was up almost 3%. HBO revenues and operating income saw double-digit growth, thanks to strong content sales driven by international licensing. HBO's third quarter is even more impressive when you consider the DISH carriage dispute and Game of Thrones finale both occurred in the second quarter.","WarnerMedia also delivered another incredible performance at this year's Emmy Awards, leading the industry with 39 primetime Emmys and 15 news and documentary Emmys.","Our Latin America team continues to do an excellent job of reducing costs in a challenging foreign exchange environment that helped drive an EBITDA increase of more than 20%.","A large part of the increase was due to an $81 million improvement in Mexico EBITDA. We expect this trend to continue and Mexico EBITDA to be positive in the fourth quarter, and we also added nearly 600,000 wireless subscribers in the quarter.","Those are our third quarter highlights. I'll now hand it back to Randall to talk about our 3 year financial outlook and capital allocation plan that we announced this morning. Randall?","Randall Stephenson","Okay. Thanks, John. So what I want to do is talk to you about what you should expect over the next 3 years.","Before we get into the numbers, I want to begin with a broader discussion on our strategy. If you go to Slide 9, we'll outline this for you. Since 2012, we've made a series of strategic investments, and those investments have been aligned around 2 overarching trends.","First, consumers will continue to spend more time viewing premium content; and second, businesses and consumers will continue to demand more connectivity, more bandwidth and more mobility.","When we began pursuing this strategy, we saw an emerging world in which consumption of video and other premium content was no longer bound to your living room. And everything we expected has arrived, and it has arrived sooner than we or anyone else anticipated. And now the foundational elements of our investment thesis are clearer than ever.","It all starts with advanced high-capacity networks. From our iPhone experience, we knew the mobile Internet revolution in a world of streaming video would require much more capacity than people were anticipating, so we began investing for future demand.","First, we spent $20 billion on premium spectrum licenses. Next, we acquired Leap Wireless, which gave us additional spectrum; and Cricket's prepaid business. We've doubled the size of that business and transformed it from losing money to healthy margins.","And finally, we were selected to build and manage the First Responder Network for the United States government, and this brought with it another layer of premium spectrum capacity.","Over the last 18 months, we've been putting all this capacity into service, and the performance results have been dramatic. AT&T now has the fastest and most reliable wireless network in the U.S. We've invested to extend these same capabilities south into Mexico.","In 4 years, we built a high-speed nationwide network and have doubled the customer base. We've also been undertaking the most aggressive fiber deployment program in the U.S. since 2015 with over 20 million locations passed. Over the next 3 years, our strong spectrum position will allow for lower capital intensity, and that bodes well for growing operating margins.","The second essential element is direct customer relationships, and we have about 170 million of them across mobile, pay TV and broadband. And that number reaches 370 million when you include our digital properties such as cnn.com, Bleacher Report and Otter Media. As we prepare to launch HBO Max, our direct customer relationships are an asset that any streaming company would love to have.","Gaining scale in linear pay TV was the core rationale behind our DIRECTV acquisition. We realized the satellite business was mature and we anticipated subscriber losses.","However, the content savings quickly turned our U-verse pay TV business from loss to a profit. And since we bought DIRECTV, it has generated healthy cash flows of over $4 billion per year or a total of $22 billion in cash by the end of this year.","Third, we were convinced that the value of premium content would increase significantly over time as consumer demand continued to grow and new forms of distribution emerged.","And I think you've already seen that with some of the multiples paid for media companies after we did our deal. Vertically integrating content and distribution is the future, and we're seeing it across the board.","And last, the vast distribution network and subscriber base brings unique viewer and customer insights. Pairing these with our large advertising inventories at DIRECTV and Turner and creating an ad tech platform is a unique opportunity, and every work -- every move we've made has been focused on building these four critical capabilities.","So now as we conclude 2019, we are the clear leader in network performance and capacity. We have one of the premier entertainment companies in the world with a broad-based presence in premium content and direct customer relationships, and I wouldn't trade places with anyone.","So if you turn to Slide 10, I want to take a look at our 3 year outlook. Looking ahead, let me take you through the keys to our financial outlook, to our capital allocation plan. And all this will drive compelling returns for our shareholders.","I'm going to start with the top line. We expect total company revenues over the 3-year period to grow by 1% to 2% per year. This will be driven by strength in Mobility, increased fiber penetration and WarnerMedia.","As mentioned earlier, our wireless business is now enjoying operating leverage from investments made over the last 5 years. Our WarnerMedia cost synergies are on target and EBITDA at AT&T Mexico is ramping, and we're identifying significant opportunities for margin improvement through ongoing cost evaluation and operational review.","Given our incremental investments in HBO Max in 2020 and our expectations for strong growth in equipment revenue driven by the 5G upgrade cycle, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be stable in 2020. From there, we will drive 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion by 2022, above the 2019 levels.","Improving margins 200 basis points will give us an EBITDA margin of 35% in 2022. And applying a 35% margin to a revenue base that's growing 1% to 2% per year produces an EBITDA lift in the neighborhood of $6 billion in 2022, and that includes our investment in HBO Max.","The drivers for this EBITDA margin expansion are: WarnerMedia cost synergies, continued improvements in our wireless business, continued EBITDA growth at AT&T Mexico and our plan to take out costs across the entire company.","In fact, we've hired Bill Morrow. He's a Special Adviser and Managing Director of Process Service and Cost Optimization, and he's leading our enterprise-wide cost-reduction initiative.","Bill has been CEO of large communication companies in the U.S., Europe and Australia, and he has a proven track record of creating best-in-class cost structures. He'll have full authority to examine and change our cost structure across the entire company to ensure that we achieve the targets that we're outlining today.","Bill's work will be overseen by the Board's Corporate Development and Finance Committee and myself. And it will be above and beyond what we're already doing with network virtualization, real estate consolidation and our other ongoing cost-reduction initiatives.","Our free cash flow has grown significantly over the past few years, and that's thanks in part to our DIRECTV and Time Warner deals being cash flow-accretive on day 1. We expect free cash flow to be at $28 billion in 2020.","And as the HBO Max investment declines and we execute against our cost take-out initiatives, free cash flow will grow by more than $1 billion in 2021 and another $1 billion in 2022, reaching $30 billion to $32 billion in 2022.","Now let me talk about our 3 year capital allocation framework. We'll continue to grow the dividend as we have since I joined the company. Expect modest annual increases and a dividend payout ratio going below 50% in 2022. After paying the dividend, we expect to use 50% to 70% of our free cash flow to retire about 70% of the shares we issued for the Time Warner deal.","And we will continue to reduce debt going forward. Our target is that by 2022, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio will be between 2 and 2.25 quarter times, and we'll have retired 100% of the debt we took on for Time Warner.","This is a very comfortable leverage ratio for us. We have routinely pruned the portfolio of assets that don't contribute to our core strategy. In fact, when you conclude what we've done in 2019, we've monetized more than $30 billion in non-strategic assets over the last few years. You should expect continued evaluation of our businesses and more progress on divesting assets that are no longer core to our fundamental mission.","As I mentioned earlier, we expect to realize about $14 billion in non-core asset monetizations this year, and we're targeting $5 billion to $10 billion next year. This is a continuous process for us. It is one of the areas in which our Corporate Development and Finance Committee dedicates a tremendous amount of time and attention.","With the support of our Board generally and the Corporate Development and Finance Committee in particular, I've instructed our executive team to begin the next review of our portfolio. So we're going to give you regular updates on our progress as we've done over the last year.","We're committed to an objective, diligent and disciplined process. We'll analyze the merits of each of our businesses individually and as a part of the whole. But let me be clear, we have no sacred cows. We're always open to making portfolio moves, and DIRECTV has been the source of a lot of public speculation in that regard. As we've said, it will be an important piece of our strategy over the next 3 years.","But no portion of our business is ever exempt from a continuous assessment for fit and performance. We'll approach it with a fresh set of eyes and clarity around the rapidly evolving consumer environment, and we'll evaluate multiple options. That includes partnerships and other structures.","Likewise, given the quality of our assets, there will be no major acquisitions during the next several years. With our financial outlook and the benefits of our capital allocation policy, we expect EPS growth in 2020 will be up low single digits. But by 2022, we expect EPS to be between $4.50 and $4.80.","That includes our investment in HBO Max of between $0.15 and $0.20 per share in 2020 and then $0.10 per share in 2021 and 2022. And as you can see, over the next 3 years, revenue, EBITDA and EPS all grow every single year.","Free cash flow is stable in 2020 and then grows in 2021 and 2022. This plan will deliver both substantial and consistent financial improvements for the next 3 years.","And before I hand it to John for his perspective on the 3-year plan, I want to say a few words about what you'll see tomorrow at Warner Bros. Studios and our investment in the HBO Max platform. This is a terrific product, and I honestly can't wait for you to see it.","John Stankey and his WarnerMedia team will take you through all aspects of the strategy, the product and the rollout, including our revenue and subscriber expectations for the next 5 years. We'll be investing to maximize the value of the service, which will drive growth and value to WarnerMedia and to AT&T as a whole.","HBO Max is a terrific platform, and we're aligned in making it great while also being responsible with our capital and value. We'll make the significant investments required to win in the marketplace, but we'll also hit our numbers and ensure that we deliver on the promises that we're outlining for you here today.","I feel really good about this plan, and I'm highly confident in hitting each of our 3-year objectives. So now I'll ask John to provide his perspective on our 3-year plan. So John?","John Stephens","Thanks, Randall. Let's turn to Slide 12 and dive a little deeper on some of the details of the 3-year plan. We're expecting 1% to 2% revenue CAGR for the next 3 years. On the operational side, we expect wireless service revenues to grow by more than 2% per year.","FirstNet, our network quality improvement and reseller initiatives, all offer growth opportunities for us. We also expect 5G device adoption to boost equipment sales as we launch our nationwide 5G network in 2020. We also expect to continue our broadband revenue growth to help offset legacy and video pressures. And we expect to see significant incremental growth during the planning period from HBO Max and targeted advertising from Xandr.","Randall did a good job of laying out our EBITDA and EBITDA margin growth plans. Our incremental cost plan will contribute to the 200 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement. One way we plan to do that is through product simplification. Our future video product set will focus on 2 platforms: HBO Max, our subscription video on-demand service, which you'll hear more about tomorrow; and AT&T TV, our live TV offering.","Turning to capital allocation plans. We expect to return about $75 billion in value to shareholders over the next 3 years through $30 billion of share retirements and $45 billion in dividends. Our share retirement will be aggressive. We expect to retire about 70% of the shares issued for the Time Warner deal. That's more than 10% of the company.","You heard our debt reduction target earlier, but let me repeat it here: We intend to target leverage between 2.0 times and 2.25 times. As CFO, I'm very comfortable operating the business in that range. Randall also mentioned that we overachieved on asset monetizations this year, and we'll monetize more non-core assets next year as we continue to analyze the merits of all of our businesses.","That's our 3-year outlook, but let's look at our 2020 guidance on Slide 13. Let me start by laying out that all these financial projections take into consideration the impact of our investment in HBO Max. We expect revenue to be up low single digits driven by growth from wireless service revenues and strong equipment revenues from the launch of 5G smartphones. This revenue growth represents our best top line performance in several years and highlights the strong performance across our businesses. We expect the base business will generate EPS of $3.75 to $3.90 per share. When you subtract the $0.15 to $0.20 per share of HBO Max investment, we expect adjusted EPS growth in the $3.60 to $3.70 per share range. Our share retirement program will be a big part of this growth.","We also expect consolidated EBITDA margin to be stable with 2019 levels, even with the impact from our HBO Max investment and 5G smartphones being available next year. Helping us keep EBITDA margins stable will be wireless service revenue growth, WarnerMedia synergies and our cost initiatives. Free cash flow is expected to be in the $28 billion range. It's about the same as this year even with the HBO Max investment. And our dividend payout ratio will be in the 50% range. We'll continue to invest at leadership levels in 2020 with an expected gross capital investment in the $20 billion range. And we'll continue to monetize our asset portfolio. We expect $5 billion to $10 billion of asset monetizations in 2020.","Let's next walk through the components of our 3-year EPS growth plan on Slide 14. As you can see from the chart, our path to $4.50 to $4.80 a share is clear and achievable. A large part of that expected growth is a result of share retirements. That alone should get us about $0.40 a share.","Our enterprise-wide cost-reduction plans and Mexico profitability growth should net us another $0.25. Our remaining WarnerMedia synergies adds another $0.20. We also include about $0.10 of HBO Max investment in 2022. That business should turn profitable after that.","The growth plans that we've just outlined for you provide real earnings opportunities. When you combine our dividend yield along with share retirements of more than 3% a year for the next 3 years, that provides a yield of about 8.5% per year. And when you factor in EPS growth, you get a solid double-digit return.","I want to reiterate what Randall said earlier. We have a high degree of confidence in delivering on these commitments. We're hitting our marks in 2019 and feel very strongly that we will do it again with this 3-year plan. Randall?","Randall Stephenson","Okay. Thanks, John. And before we get to Q&A, I want to speak to just a couple of additional issues. And if you go to Slide 15, we've listed these.","Over the last few years, we have continuously refreshed our Board of Directors. It's been done under the leadership of Matt Rose. He's our Independent Lead Director, Chair of our Nominating Committee. Today, the average tenure of our independent directors is 8 years. And of our 12 independent directors, 10 have joined the Board since 2012.","This is the Board that has directed our transformation into a modern media company. And along the way, we've added new directors with the skills and experience to inform and guide our business strategies. That includes 3 directors since 2015 with particularly strong backgrounds in large-scale video distribution, media and entertainment and digital media.","Looking ahead, we have 2 directors retiring in the next 18 months. As a result, we have a natural opportunity to continue our Board refreshment and add additional skill sets that align tightly with the objectives I outlined this morning. In fact, we've been in discussion with some exciting candidates for some time.","And in the coming days, following our next regularly scheduled Board meeting, we anticipate adding a new Board member with deep expertise in technology and executing strategic cost initiatives. This new director will be added to the Corporate Development and Finance Committee, which has responsibility for overseeing our cost program and the evaluation of our portfolio. And we'll then add another director in 2020.","And finally, there's been a lot of speculation recently concerning my retirement. The Board and I have not yet set any formal plans for my retirement as CEO, but having been in the role for over 11 years, you can rest assured the Board and I have begun detailed planning for when that date arrives.","We've spent many years guiding the business to the strong position we have today, and for all the reasons I've described, I believe we're on the threshold of something really remarkable in terms of the next chapter of AT&T's storied history. I have every intention of being here, and I will be here through 2020 to ensure that we hit the objectives we've laid out today: to drive significant growth in EBITDA margins and EPS and to invest in growth areas and to retire all the debt and most of the shares issued in the Time Warner merger. My goal and my strong belief is that this is going to drive significant long-term value for our shareholders.","And helping me do this will be my talented colleague, John Stankey, who was recently appointed COO. He has a big job, and his teams are working together to develop their joint plans, and John is continuing to build his leadership teams across all 3 businesses. The Board and I have very high expectations for John. I'm excited for him, and I look forward to seeing him tackle his new responsibilities.","Together, we're all about execution and delivering on our 3-year plan. You should also understand that the Board views leadership and CEO succession as one of its most important responsibilities to shareholders. The Board's HR Committee, which is led by Chair, Beth Mooney, oversees our talent management program and our succession planning process.","Under the HR Committee's leadership, the Board's evaluation of all potential candidates for the CEO position has been underway for some time, and it continues today. Further, whenever my transition as CEO does occur, the Board has already determined that it will separate the Chairman and the CEO positions.","This is an exciting time at AT&T for all of our shareholders, our customers, our partners, employees and investors. The Board and our entire management team and I place the highest priority on generating value for our shareholders. Following 5-plus years of heavy investment, it's now time to reap the rewards of these investments to deliver some strong returns.","We believe that the plan we've taken you through today is going to deliver strong performance across all measures and that it should generate significant value creation in the near and the long term. The strategic transformation we've been working on for several years has enabled this new plan, and we've assembled the best set of capabilities to excel as a modern media company.","The objectives we have outlined today had been central to our plans for many months, even before we closed our acquisition of Time Warner. But as you would expect, our thinking has also benefited from robust engagement with our owners, and that includes Elliott Management. And given the shareholder interest in our engagement with the team at Elliott, I'm happy to address that subject very directly here.","Over the past several weeks, Matt Rose and I have found our engagement with Elliott to be both constructive as well as helpful. Among other things, Elliott has met with the prospective new director that I mentioned earlier and is enthusiastic about that addition to our Board following our next meeting.","These are smart people, and they very much understand the tremendous opportunity we have to create substantial shareholder value. As we move forward in the coming months, the Board and I look forward to continuing our close collaboration with Elliott on strategy, operational initiatives in our portfolio and to see through the value-enhancing steps that I've laid out today.","I'm excited about our strategy, and I'm very excited about this plan. And I want you to know that I'm all in on running this play and seeing us execute it.","So I know you have a lot of questions, and so we're going to open it up to Q&A. So Mike, I'll turn it back to you.","Michael Viola","Okay. Greg, we are ready to take questions. And can you please give us those Q&A instructions? Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","David Barden","Congrats on the new plan. So I guess, Randall or John, as we kind of think about this more prescriptive capital allocation plan that you've kind of outlined with respect to dividends and stock buybacks, could you kind of talk about how that wraps around the potential for spectrum acquisition or kind of other opportunities?","And especially that dovetails with the kind of commitment to the no-acquisition posture. In the media world in particular, it seems like this is very much becoming a scale game. It would seem that more scale would be better if this is the right strategy.","Could you kind of wrap all this together for us in terms of how we kind of get the business developed in the right way while at the same time following through on these commitments for capital allocation? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","Yes, Dave. This is Randall. I'm going to start, and I'll let John supplement what I say here if there's anything else he wants to add. But what we have given you today is a cash flow forecast and plan, built around operational aspects that would allow us to do the shareholder returns that you heard us talk to today, particularly around EPS accretion and such.","To the extent that we need to engage in spectrum acquisitions of some type, and I have to be cautious because we're in a quiet period here. But what I can give you confidence in, and what I'd tell you we now have confidence in, we developed a lot of muscle over the last couple of years, on cleaning up the portfolio.","And I am very confident that portfolio cleanup and asset dispositions will more than offset anything we need to do in terms of spectrum acquisition. So what we're committed to is this capital allocation, this capital return plan, because we've been investing very aggressively over the last 5, 6 years to get us to this point.","And I just think we're in a very seminal point, Dave, point where now it's time to reap the rewards of what we've been doing. And so drive margin expansion, get the 1% to 2% revenue growth, it's going to generate incredible cash flow.","CapEx comes in, in 2020 as you saw in John's numbers and so begin to reward to shareholders these investments that we've been making over the last few years.","So bottom line, we're committed to what we've laid out here in terms of capital returns. When we talk about M&A, we've said no major M&A. We like the assets we have. I mean this is really, across the board, a quality, premium set of assets. If we have to do tuck-in acquisitions here and there to supplement capabilities, like you saw the HBO LAG deal that we did Friday, the LA - or pardon me, the Latin American HBO property. That's a small acquisition that's immediately accretive, and it just supplements what we're trying to do in Latin America with our HBO Max product. And so you'll see those kind of things. But in terms of big M&A, we have no needs given the assets that we have right now.","John Stephens","Yes. Dave, just to put a kind of a numerical perspective. $500 billion balance sheet, finding 1% to 2% a year on a recurring basis is certainly a reasonable goal and something we have high expectations to be able to achieve. From a practical standpoint, we've announced two deals, Puerto Rico and the CME transaction was announced yesterday.","They're going to provide about $3 billion in capital just next year, so we have a great head start to the deals that will close next year that will give us more cash, things that we've already gotten done. And you can rest assured we got more of that in process.","And then with regard to spectrum, as Randall said, can't comment on the 39 that's underway. With regard to the C-band and the other future auctions, certainly we'll be interested. As always, we're interested in fair auctions that provide as much spectrum available to the marketplace and allows all bidders to bid.","We think that's going to take some time, particularly with the C-band and the FCC. But certainly, we'd be interested. By the same token, there's a clear expectation we'll pay for it with asset monetizations on this balance sheet, that we have that opportunity to do that.","David Barden","Thanks for the color guys. Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip Cusick","So around video, have we hit the peak of losses in terms of near-term video trends? And how do you think about the impact of AT&T TV launching versus the price increase of AT&T TV Now recently?","And it looks like you plan to invest about $1.5 billion to $2 billion in HBO Max in 2020 and about $1 billion a year for the following couple of years. How do you think about this level of investment to drive success in a market that's increasingly full of competitive offers? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","Phil, this is Randall. I think John mentioned it in his comments that in terms of the video losses, particularly around the satellite product, third quarter is the peak. Third quarter is -- we had a couple of significant blackouts in terms of content, and those blackouts drove some sizable subscriber losses.","And then we had the cleanup that's been going on in the customer base in terms of prior promotions and so forth. And so we have pretty much run to the end of those. There's a little bit more of the customer cleanup that will run into Q4, but in terms of the losses, they will be significantly improved in the fourth quarter and get better as we move into next year.","As you think about the product portfolio going forward, and you're seeing this in terms of the pricing moves that we're making. But as we get into next year, you're basically going to see our traditional satellite platform, which is going to have a long life.","I mean this business continues to be really strong, generates a lot of cash flow. As I said in my comments, there's more than $4 billion of free cash flow a year and done $22 billion since we owned the thing.","But as we get into next year, then you'll have the satellite then you'll have the software platforms. And AT&T TV is the standardized software platform, and that will be our primary vehicle for going to market, particularly pairing it with our fiber product and our broadband product.","And then HBO Max becomes the workhorse for our video product as we move into next year. And all of the muscle, and as you can see and as you articulated, the range of investment is going behind HBO Max.","In terms of are we comfortable with that level in what you called a crowded field, I actually think the field in terms of where we intend to play is not that crowded. We intend to play at a significant level, and we're starting with a product called HBO, which has a very significant position in the marketplace.","And as you're going to see tomorrow, we're investing heavily behind that brand and bringing additional content to bear. And I actually feel very comfortable.","And I think tomorrow, Phil, that's all tomorrow is about, is to get you comfortable that this is a unique product. This is a product that's going to be very different from anything else that you've seen in the market so far. This is not Netflix, this is not Disney, this is HBO Max, and it's going to have a very unique position in the marketplace.","And I would tell you we feel very comfortable at these investment levels, that we can do something very significant in the market and drive some significant subscriber gains. This is going to be a meaningful business to us over the next 4 or 5 years. And we're talking a 50 million subscriber business and I'm really, really enthusiastic about this.","So the video product gets really streamlined and simplified as we move into next year. Satellite and then software product. And then one of the big cost initiatives, and it's not inconsequential, is John Stankey is bringing the video platforms, the software platforms, he will be standardizing all of these.","And as you can well guess, AT&T TV, we have a development and cost associated with that. HBO Max, there's a technology development cost associated with that. Putting these on a standardized platform over the next couple of years drives significant savings as well. So feel pretty good about the platform, and the numbers should improve as we move forward.","Philip Cusick","Randall, just to be clear, the 50 million you mentioned, is that current or forecast?","Randall Stephenson","Forecast. That's what we're forecasting, domestic HBO Max over 5 years.","Philip Cusick","Thanks very much.","Randall Stephenson","Greg, we\u2019ll take the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik","Great, thanks, Maybe two questions. One for John and one for Randall. John, could you give some more detail on the - I guess both the near term and the sort of the longer term 200 basis points of margin improvement? I guess Randall just mentioned that some of it comes from product simplification within the entertainment segment. But can you talk a little bit about how you expect some of those cost initiatives to impact each of the segments? Should we expect continued improvement in wireless margins and in enterprise and WarnerMedia?","And then for Randall, I guess with today's announcements, the company has addressed, I'd say, the majority of the issues laid out in the Elliott letter. What I didn't see though is with John Stankey taking on the role of COO, what's the time frame for him to relinquish leadership of the WarnerMedia asset? Thanks.","John Stephens","Thanks, John. Let me take the first question on the 200 basis point improvement in margins. Let me give a base case that we see -- now we are expecting improvement from Mobility.","We are expecting improvement from Mexico. We are expecting improvement from the WarnerMedia cost synergies. With that being said, these additional cost synergies that we're talking about, I would categorize in just a couple or 3 buckets.","One, I think you'll see product simplification. I think we'll see a big effort with Bill and the team working with John and everyone across the enterprise on product simplification. I think that should provide significant rewards.","Secondly, I would tell you that there's still general administrative expense savings, and I think that opportunity continues to be there. You've got to remember that we've only got final court clearance on the Time Warner deal just 6 months ago, so we've got more opportunities in bringing that together.","Third, the video platforms, Randall mentioned this, and the standardization of those platforms, bringing those platform cost and development and capabilities together not only is a great business result but also an opportunity.","I think those are kind of 3 things I'd point to kind of real quickly and real briefly. We'll look at everything there are. Just like with the portfolio there's no sacred cows. ","But to give you a just a more simple sense of it, about $180 billion of revenue, about $120 billion of COE gets us our $60 billion of EBITDA. If we can mine out 1% to 2% of our COE every year, that's in that $1.5 billion to $2 billion range.","I'm not setting a target for ourselves, but you can give us a sense that, that really gives us some comfort with regard to that overall $6 billion EBITDA improvement, especially when you've got great progress in things like Mexico, great progress in Mobility, real improvements across the enterprise.","Randall Stephenson","I would actually just append a little bit into that. We're going to now have Bill Morrow and John Stankey heading up an initiative to take these costs out, that John just gave you the big blocks of what they will go after.","These are two process improvement hawks. They are probably as good as it gets anywhere in terms of streamlining process, simplifying process and taking cost out. And as you look at this plan of the areas that I have the least concern that we will achieve, setting objectives to get cost out, to get 200 basis points of margin expansion, this is probably the area I feel the most comfortable with.","And so there's some big target areas in terms of what we go after to take these costs out. This is stuff we do, and we do it really, really well. We all have a lot of experience here. The cost piece, it'll get done. I don't spend a lot of time worrying about that one.","In terms of your question on WarnerMedia, when will John Stankey relinquish leadership of WarnerMedia, I don't anticipate he will relinquish leadership in WarnerMedia. It's under his purview of COO. And he's got a big job, and he has been spending a lot of time building his leadership team and getting the right people in the right spots and getting HBO stood up.","I would tell you on the WarnerMedia side, I think what he has done over there in terms of building the team that's there, the hires he has made, Bob Greenblatt, you're going to get a full dose of Bob Greenblatt tomorrow, and as he launches the HBO Max product. This is an impressive guy. He's got great media chops, been around, a lot of experience.","Ann Sarnoff coming in to run Warner Bros. I mean just a really, really impressive hire. As you think about WarnerMedia, I have no doubt he'll find the right person for that job as well. So feel really good about the team that John's assembling and I feel really confident about where he's going.","John Hodulik","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. So coming back to the buyback, could you talk a little bit about the timing of the buyback? I think you're saying 9% of these outstanding over a 3-year period.","But how should we think about that flowing through in Q4 and in 2020? And is there really a number in terms of $25 billion or x number of shares? What's the kind of what you're -- the messaging here?","And then coming back to the last question on costs, is there a time frame for Bill Morrow to complete his evaluation and to come back to you and the Board and then potentially to us with more clarity around the buckets, diving into the things that we've just been going over at a high level? Thank you.","John Stephens","This is - Simon, this is John. Let me take on the share retirement question. First off, when you take a look at Time Warner transaction, it was about 1.1 billion shares. If you take 70%, it's about the 750 million range of shares.","That's the communication we intend. I would suggest to you that we haven't laid out a specific time line for how much each day, how much each month or quarter. We're going through that process now, but I wouldn't be surprised if it is somewhat front-end loaded or at least front-end loaded in individual years.","I would tell you we are very respectful of the commitments we made to get into the 2.5 range, and we're going to do that. And I want to make sure this doesn't change that, just like we're going to do this share retirement consistent with getting into that 2 to 2.25 times.","Do feel really comfortable operating the business at that level. So it's -- and particularly in today's interest rate environment and our cash flow environment, feel very comfortable with it. But we're going to respect that and make sure we do that.","With regard to the process for buybacks, this is -- as you can imagine, we're looking at everything from accelerated share repurchases to open market purchases to other transactional aspects. But I do think it's fair to assume that we would focus on trying to front end load or trying to do more earlier. And within a year, I do not expect it to be smooth.","Additionally, within the 3 years, as I expect, we're going to be successful with this plan, we will see our stock price change. And as it changes, our dividend, cash cost of that equity gets adjusted downward. And so you have to continually evaluate the total cost and total investment and total decision-making process. It's a fairly direct decision-making process today, and we will continue to evaluate that.","But that's how we're thinking about it and we feel very comfortable about getting it done. It's just a matter of getting the process implemented and moving forward. Nothing to announce on how many shares we may or may not buy in the fourth quarter, but clearly, the commentary we put out that says some share retirements are in the mix for the fourth quarter is a fair statement.","Okay. On the cost-initiative side, I mean once again, I will tell you this. This is been going on for a while. We have been going through this process. Bill Morrow, we've been talking to Bill Morrow for a while. And knowing that we wanted to bring on someone with those talents and those skill sets.","So we will give him some time to get his feet on the ground, but we expect him to hit the ground running. And we will have plans in place and identified opportunities already that we'll start operationalizing as soon as possible, many of those things before the end of this year.","If you're asking about when they will show up in the financial statements and the cost synergies, the savings, I would expect that they're going to be somewhat back-end loaded. They won't all show up in the first year, specifically because there will be some investments and some time to get the plans put into operation.","Within our $20 billion capital number, we've set aside some resources for those system investments and for those activities. So feel comfortable about our ability to get those done within this plan.","But while as -- while we will show as much urgency as possible to get savings starting with day 1, I would expect that they will be certainly more back-end loaded as opposed to our buy -- our stock retirement program, which may be more front-end loaded.","Randall Stephenson","We'll have some that are going to be quick hits. G&A, those are areas where you can generally get some pretty quick hits on cost. We've identified some of those areas. Product simplification, those take a little longer because as John said, you got to make some investments.","You remember the last time, though, we took this on, it was probably 5 years ago. Andy Geisse led the effort. And that initiative over a couple of years generated almost $1 billion of cost savings.","We're back at one of those moments here again. So I feel pretty confident there are going to be some big chunks of cost that we can get out of the 2-year time frame and some others that will -- we'll get them out in the 2020 time horizon.","I think John - what we should just anticipate doing and what you should expect, Simon. We get Q4 earnings, we'll give you an update in terms of where we are at that stage. Bill Morrow starts, I think, today. I believe this is his first day.","And so we do want to give him a chance to get his feet on the ground. But as we begin to put the plans together and develop them, we'll give you a status report on the Q4 earnings call and let you know where these are going.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you. A couple, if I could. Randall, from your own perspective, you've talked about the simplification of the product to basically 2 brands: AT&T TV and HBO Max. How are you thinking about the rest of the portfolio, given that you have a lot of other streaming brands as well as brands such as HBO? And does your guidance contemplate some degree of cannibalization across your entire portfolio?","And then, John, from your perspective, you've talked about buybacks potentially being front-end loaded and EBITDA potentially being -- the growth guidance being back-end loaded. Could you talk about the components within that in terms of things like partnerships potentially at DIRECTV or [financing] coming from Turner and so on and so forth? So what are the variables that go into that guidance? If you could just highlight those.","Randall Stephenson","Yes. Thanks, Kannan. On the video product simplification, cannibalization or mix shift, I don't know how best to describe it, but obviously, as we roll the software products out and so AT&T TV and this Korean client product, we'll be rolling that out early next year. This is really a good product. And it will become -- for a live streaming product, it will become the workhorse. It's where the lion's share of gross adds move to over the next couple of years.","And so that cannibalizes satellite, it replaces satellite. But we actually like if gross adds are coming in on that product, that's a good thing for us for a number of reasons. It's a much lower cost point to put in place with a customer.","And as a result, it allows us to meet a much different price point in the market. And -- but with content costs continuing to escalate, these price points are pricing a lot of customers out of the live streaming product.","And so we've just been very ambitious to get a new cost structure on our video product that allow us to get people back into the live streaming product. Our research says there are a lot of people that want a live streaming product, but it's just too expensive with the way content costs have gone. So this allows us to get another product in the marketplace at a lower price point, lower cost point, good margins. So that's point number one.","HBO Max. HBO Max becomes our SVOD product of the future. And you're going to hear a lot more about this tomorrow. I don't want to steal Stankey and his team's thunder on this. But HBO Max becomes the SVOD platform for AT&T as we move forward into the future. And what you should expect is as we get into the future, this won't be day 1.","But over time, that platform -- because of the platform through which we also deliver live stream TV. So you want an SVOD service, HBO Max, great. Over time, we look forward to bringing in live element into HBO Max as well. And so this thing gets more and more simplified and we ultimately get down to where we have two products: the traditional satellite, which will be there for a long time; and then our streaming product, which will be premised on the HBO Max platform. And again, you're going to hear a lot more about this tomorrow night, and I look forward to seeing you there.","John Stephens","Kannan, it's John. With regard to the buybacks and the EBITDA discussion. On the buybacks side, as I discussed before, the ability to get cash, get the stock in at very attractive prices from a cash cost of capital will be our focus, and I do expect it to be front-end loaded. On the EBITDA side, I would not use the term back-end loaded on the EBITDA side gains because that would just suggest to you this: Mobility is growing today and it will continue to grow in 2020. Mexico, if you look at -- and we expect Mexico to be EBITDA positive in the fourth quarter.","And when we achieve that, we'll have about a $300 million -- just under a $300 million improvement in Mexico's EBITDA this year. And we expect that those trends to continue next year. If you look at WarnerMedia cost savings, the programs are already in place.","John Stankey and his team already have those in place, and you see those growing next year. We've got a significant number of items that would -- that are propelling EBITDA improvement, which would propel our standalone EPS guidance that we suggested.","The reason for next year being flattish, so to speak, on EBITDA margins is because we're making close to a $2 billion investment in HBO Max. That's the $0.15 to $0.20 that's on our schedules of EPS. So I think of it we're choosing to make an investment on a long-term product, on a long-term winning product that is going to be very important to us. So that's that aspect of it.","As I said, we'll have some quick hits. As Randall said, we'll have some quick hits on the cost initiatives led by Bill Morrow, but the full scope of his ability to get all the savings is going to take -- is going to come in over years. But our EBITDA next year on a -- with, inclusive of, our $2 billion investment or in that range in HBO Max, is flattish. If you would take that out, that would be a full 1% growth in our EBITDA.","That right there would be about half that growth, that 200 basis point growth we're talking about for the full 3 years. So this is a long-term investment, a good decision-making process like we've done with our acquisition of spectrum, like we've done with our buildout of our wireless network, like we've done with our fiber play. We believe this is a very good long-term decision.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman","I want to talk a bit more about wireless here. You've obviously talked a lot about the benefits of the FirstNet investment you flagged, the 50% increase in network capacity through the additional spectrum. You've also expanded your distribution both into the FirstNet or the first responder community as well as in just some new rural markets.","And those two things combined you would assume are going to start creating some churn benefits because of the network quality, some gross add benefits because of the expanded distribution. And I'm just curious, where are we in terms of starting to see that in your performance? You've obviously had pretty solid phone net adds.","Do you think that there's an opportunity for that to keep inflecting? Is that the real driver of the service revenue CAGR you've put out there? Or are there other elements we should be considering as we structure our models as well?","John Stephens","No, thanks for the question. Let me try and go at it this way and ask Randall to jump in and help me out. First of all, with regard to the service revenue increases and the overall performance of the business, the additional spectrum capacity, the ability to put in new technologies like a carrier aggregation, typically it's got, like most kinds of technological improvements as well as this one-touch build opportunity we have with FirstNet, which just gives us a big lead in getting towers 5G-enabled and getting our network ready to be a national 5G network next year. Those are all the base of what we're doing.","When you look at our postpaid business, you're right. We have phone growth, voice growth in the third quarter, 100,000. That's the best we've had in 5 years. I think it does have something to do with the quality of our network, the speed of it. I also think it has something to do with the great offers that we have and the efforts of our folks.","You saw another strong quarter of prepaid. We're on track to take virtually our -- we're going to have a share of the prepaid net adds this year that I think that equates to the total growth in the market. So we're doing really well with our Cricket brand. It continues to be seller. We're seeing great churn reduction. That's going to help with revenue.","We're in an inflection point with our reseller point. We had stepped away from the reseller business because of capacity issues. For the last 4 quarters, our reseller revenue's been essentially flat. So we're now moving towards it with this new capacity from FirstNet, we now have the opportunity to have a real growth from that reseller perspective where we're very interested in that.","And then you continue to see what's happening with connected devices, IoT, and quite frankly with 5G+, the millimeter wave-based 5G services for businesses as well as our overall 5G services for businesses, feel really good about. Those are the things that are going to make up that service revenue growth.","I would also tell you we continue to see customers buying up to unlimited. They're continuing to buy our quality insurance programs on their more expensive phones. And then on the nonservice side, you'll see the step up to 5G equipment, mainly handsets, particularly for us, we expect to be measurable in share.","So you put all of that together, it's really, really very good. Those customer handsets will also bring some cost with them. But what they do, do is give us the opportunity to lock in that customer and refresh that customer and make -- and allow the customer to see this really significant network advantage we have.","And so feel good about all those. That's how we're thinking about Mobility. At the same time, they're going through efficiencies and efforts. We'll look at product simplification, our offering simplification there, all of those kinds of things will continue to help keep margins heading in the right direction.","Brett Feldman","Can I ask a quick follow-up? That was helpful. You mentioned the reseller business and putting more emphasis on that because of your capacity improvement. One of the key reseller communities you really haven't addressed is the cable MVNOs. Considering the improvement in your network capacity, are you strategically opening to supporting that customer base?","John Stephens","Absolutely.","Randall Stephenson","Yes. We would actually be open to that. So you should assume that, that's something we'd be open to. And not just cable guys, but there are a number of people in the reseller space that are reaching out.","And it's just as John said, we got a lot of capacity now in this network, and we're at the point of evolution in this industry where we ask, how do you monetize most efficiently, capacity? And so we're going to look at all those channels.","John Stephens","One last thing, Brett, on the capacity, I want to make sure. We have put in almost 60 megahertz of spectrum nationwide on a base of about 100. So it's a significant increase there. Secondly, all the technology changes, the carrier aggregation and others, have increased our spectral -- our throughput capacity significantly.","And then this ability to one-touch and put up 5G. The conversion from a 3G network and some of our older -- or this 4G network into this 5G network is also going to increase.","So we've not only got an increased capacity just from the spectral, that's the easiest way to think about it, but all the other steps the network team's doing is dramatically improving our capabilities. And so we have a significant advantage over our competitors and have an ability to compete because of that advantage.","Michael Viola","Greg, we'll take one last question.","Operator","And that question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi.","Michael Rollins","Just curious if you could describe how the team evaluated the value of share buybacks relative to some incremental investments in the operations, for example, accelerating investments in fiber-to-the-home, especially after the subscriber gains that you've highlighted recently in the segment?","And then just separately, AT&T has been bundling video with its wireless subscribers in some form for some time. Can you describe the results that you're seeing and how that impacts both customer acquisition and retention?","Randall Stephenson","Mike, this is Randall. As we think about share buybacks and capital expenditures, actually, we're still going to invest at a $20 billion level next year. And that's, I am quite confident, will be, by order of magnitudes, the most aggressive investment in the industry.","And we have been on a very aggressive plan for deploying fiber. And we put in a very short period of time 20 million locations passed with fiber. And we are somewhere between 20% and 25% penetrated in that footprint in the next couple years are going to be about penetrating. It's really about penetration. That doesn't mean we're stopping fiber deployment. 5G requires us to continue deploying fiber.","We have business customers who have expectations and we deploy fiber into business locations. And what that does is creates capillaries that we then expand off of. And so you're going to continue to see the capillary of fiber in this company expand.","It's just not going to expand at the pace we've been going on. It's been on a torrid pace. I would suggest it's been the most aggressive in the United States. Now it's time to reap the rewards of what we've done and let's go penetrate the market.","As you think about the video bundles, the strong -- and this is something I find very encouraging. I don't think we've put metrics out on this. I think you will probably talk about it tomorrow. But the most powerful video bundle we have with our mobile business is HBO in terms of what it does to churn and retention.","And the reason I think that's very exciting is now think about HBO Max and taking that product to a different level. And it's going to be something different. And now bundling that with our mobile business and the impacts on churn, we believe, are going to be very, very powerful.","And so we're very excited about putting wireless with HBO Max. HBO Max is a natural bundle with our -- obviously our video business, whether it's DIRECTV or AT&T TV. It's a great bundle with our broadband business, particularly the fiber business. So we're really bullish right now on how HBO Max gets leveraged across the footprint.","When you look at HBO today, keep in mind we've really only owned the asset, post appeal by the courts, since February. So about 8 months is how long it's been under our purview. In a very short period of time, AT&T has moved by order of magnitude into the position as the largest distributor of HBO.","And if you look at the number two distributor, we're 62% higher penetrated than the #2 distributor. So we think HBO is a very powerful platform to bundle with our various distribution properties. And you turn HBO into HBO Max, it becomes even more exciting. So thanks for the question, Mike.","Michael Viola","Okay. Greg, that ends our Q&A session.","Randall Stephenson","So if I could, I would just close out by first of all thanking everybody for joining the call. Look, this is an aggressive 3-year plan. I got to tell you, this is a 3-year plan we've spent a lot of time over the last few months putting together. And as I keep saying, it's time to reap the rewards of the investments we made over the last few months -- years.","And so it's a very exciting time for us. The capital allocation plan is very exciting, and we're really excited about HBO Max, and I'm really hopeful to see everybody here in L.A. tomorrow night to preview this product and see what we have to offer at WarnerMedia. So thanks again for joining us, we'll talk to you tomorrow.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Welcome to the AT&T First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d also like to remind you that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Viola","Okay. Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter conference call. As Greg said, I'm Mike Viola, I\u2019m Head of Investor Relations here at AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Rand Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. Rand is going to provide an update of the key 2019 initiatives, then John is going to cover our operating results. Then, of course, we will follow that with a Q&A.","Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they\u2019re subject to risks and uncertainties, results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations website.","I also need to remind you that we're in a quiet period for the FCC spectrum auctions, spectrum auctions 101 and 102, so we can't address any questions about that today. And as always, our earnings materials are available on the IR page of the AT&T website, and that includes the news release, investor briefing, 8-K, associated schedules, etcetera.","And so now, I'd like to now turn the call over to Randall Stephenson.","Randall Stephenson","Okay. Thanks, Mike. And we do appreciate you joining us this morning. I came to you back in January and I outlined six priorities for 2019, and we have those again listed on the third slide. But if I could quickly summarize, what I would tell you is in all six of these areas we're either on track or well ahead of schedule.","And the first one, as you remember, I told you that paying down the $40 billion in debt that we took on to acquire Time Warner that that would be our top priority, and we are on target to retire 75% of that by year-end. This quarter, we generated free cash flow of $5.9 billion and brought our net debt down by $2.3 billion. And that puts us well on track for generating at least $26 billion of free cash flow for the full-year.","And then already here in the second quarter, we\u2019ve sold our stakes in Hulu and Hudson Yards. That generated an additional $3.6 billion of cash. And then John Stephens\u2019 team is doing their typical great job. They\u2019re driving down working capital and restructuring some collateral arrangements, and this is also adding significant cash flow and it\u2019s giving us very clear line of sight to reaching our target of $6 billion to $8 billion from asset monetizations, so bottom line, we committed to driving our net debt to EBITDA ratio to around 2.5x by year-end, and we are right on track for achieving that.","Second priority was mobility, and we had another really strong quarter, and it continues to grow and build momentum with customers. Our wireless service revenues increased by 2.9%. EBITDA grew and that\u2019s even with some significant accounting pressures. Our postpaid and prepaid phones grew very nicely and churn remains low across both products. So, all in all, I'd have to tell you, I\u2019m very pleased with our wireless performance.","And then stabilizing profitability of our entertainment group, this was a must do for us this year. And John Donovan and his team are exceeding expectations. And not only are they stabilizing EBITDA, but they\u2019re growing it by nearly 7%. There was a small one-time item in there from a carriage dispute settlement, but even removing that, growth was very healthy, I think around 5% excluding that. And so, that was led by 8% growth in broadband revenues. I got to tell you our fiber product, the AT&T fiber product is doing very well in the marketplace.","On the cost side, the team is doing terrific work on controlling content costs, promotion costs, and all the other operating costs. And then, finally, some aggressive customer segmentation and targeting are driving some higher video ARPUs. And so, I think what you should expect is as we work through the year, we will continue to see declines in traditional TV subs, particularly those areas where we can't bundle with broadband, but as we get into the second half of the year, we roll out our thin client video product. There will be a much lower price product in the marketplace. What I think you'll see is subscriber losses should lessen as we get into 2020.","And then I think the DIRECTV NOW customer base, that\u2019s our streaming over the top product. That should be pretty stable for the rest of the year. We might see some slight customer losses in the second quarter as the price increases continue to flow through. The second half of the year should be decent. Bottom line, I remain comfortable that we are either going to meet or exceed our entertainment group EBITDA target for the full-year and that\u2019s going to lay the groundwork for continued stability as we move beyond 2019.","At WarnerMedia, it's been a really strong start to the year. Revenue growth was solid. Operating income grew by double digits. Our merger-related synergies are on track and we expect to hit $700 million in run rate by the end of this year. Stankey and his team have reorganized the business to compete in a world of streaming and streaming content. We brought in some great new talent, like Bob Greenblatt. He is a known commodity. He is running WarnerMedia Entertainment, and is also leading the SVOD development project for us. And I got to tell you, I think he is one of the best around and I couldn't be more excited to have him on board.","Bob and his team's top priority is to develop our new SVOD service. And as we\u2019ve discussed, this is a service that will be centered on HBO and significantly enhanced by the Warner Bros. library, which is a very, very deep and prolific library. The closer we get to launching this service, the more excited I get. We are planning a WarnerMedia Day for everybody in the September to October timeframe, and we\u2019re bringing all the executive team across from WarnerMedia and we're going to give you a detailed look at the product, and that includes the breadth of new and existing content. So just stay tuned for that and we're making significant investments here and we think our customers are going to love this product.","Now every facet of our strategy is built on a foundation of world-class connectivity. And a few years ago, we set out to build the best video delivery platform in the world, and we invested billions of dollars securing spectrum licenses, and we made it among our highest priorities to go after and to win FirstNet. That\u2019s the national network for first responders. And today, our FirstNet build has now passed the halfway mark and it is running well ahead of schedule. We now have more than 7,000 agencies signed up across the country with more than 570,000 subscribers, and those numbers are growing.","This initiative along with our vast portfolio of spectrum has catapulted AT&T into the leadership position in network quality. Over the last few months, AT&T has been recognized as both the best as well as the fastest wireless network, and FirstNet has enabled us to accelerate our 5G and fiber build out. Our 5G service is now in parts of 19 cities and we will have 5G coverage nationwide next year. We are the only carrier to offer 5G service to businesses and consumers, and we're well ahead of our competition here. And our AT&T fiber network now surpasses 20 million locations, that's both consumers and businesses. And in short, our network investments are paying off and we're not done yet. ","Finally, Brian Lesser and his team continue to grow Xandr, that's our advertising business. Revenues were up 26% including the AppNexus acquisition. They had strong EBITDA margins and we're continuing to invest in new product development capabilities as we integrate more of Turner's ad inventory. So, we're very pleased with the progress we're making. Our strategy is working. Our key initiatives are on track and you can expect strong execution on these priorities as we continue in the quarters ahead.","And so, with that, I\u2019m now going to turn it over to our CFO, John Stephens, and he'll take you through the results.","John Stephens","Thanks, Randall, good morning, everyone. Again, thanks for being on the call today. Let me begin with our financial summary on Slide 5. Adjusted EPS was $0.86 in the quarter. WarnerMedia continues to be accretive. Mobility is adding customers and we saw EBITDA growth in our Entertainment group. Offsetting these positive signs was about $400 million non-cash impact from the reversal of rev rec and fulfillment deferrals. We expect those headwinds to continue throughout the year and we\u2019ve included all those in our guidance.","Adjusted earnings included a higher interest expense from the Time Warner acquisition and the non-cash impact of lower capitalized interest as we continue to put additional spectrum into service in our mobility business. During the quarter, we also had a mark-to-market adjustment to our pension plan based on our expected distributions for the coming year. The $0.05 impact reflects lower interest rate even though we significantly exceeded our returns on plant asset assumptions.","Consolidated revenues came in at $44.8 billion, up 18%. Thanks mostly to the acquisition of Time Warner. The gains in mobility service revenues, WarnerMedia and broadband were offset by a foreign exchange impact of approximately $550 million and lower U.S wireless equipment sales of about $175 million as well as a little bit of ongoing legacy product pressure.","When you look at our pro forma basis, revenues were down slightly due entirely to the impact of foreign exchange and lighter equipment revenues. Without those impacts, revenues were up. Operating income showed solid growth and adjusted consolidated operating margins were 21.4% or up a 170 basis points with strong growth in the WarnerMedia and mobility and significant improvement in our Entertainment group. EG's first quarter EBITDA puts us in solid shape to meet or be our full-year EBITDA target for EG.","Our cash flows also continued to be impressive. Let's look at those in Slide 6. Both our cash from operations and free cash flow saw strong growth. Cash from operations was up 24%, mostly reflecting WarnerMedia. Free cash flow was $5.9 billion. The addition of WarnerMedia operations obviously made an impact. For example, our securitization efforts got a lift to more than $1 billion from adding WarnerMedia to our program. This helped to overcome $700 million in pressure from income taxes, where in the first quarter of last year we received a significant refund from the December 2017 passage of tax reform.","When you look at our free cash flow for the past 12 months, we are well over $25 billion. And with a full-year of Time Warner, we have confidence in meeting or exceeding our $26 billion range cash flow guidance. Our dividend payout of free cash flow was about 63% in the first quarter, another healthy amount. We also continue to invest at high levels. Our reporting CapEx was $5.2 billion and total capital investment was right at $6 billion when you include $800 million of payments from vendor financing arrangements.","We have been receiving favorable payment terms from several suppliers, which allow us to be more efficient with our spending. And you see that at our capital investment in the quarter. We had $700 million of equipment assets put in the service during the first quarter that we won't have to pay for and aren't included in our CapEx number because of these new vendor financing activity. As a reminder, payments made under our vendor financing obligations are classified in the cash flow statement as financing activities, not investing activities.","I will get into more detail about our leverage little later, but our net debt declined a solid $2.3 billion in the quarter. In addition to strong free cash flow in the quarter, we amended many of our collateral support agreements with our lenders, which allows us to reclaim most of the collateral posted for our foreign currency hedges. The net result was more than $1 billion in cash return to us, fully offsetting our vendor financing payments. And we don't expect to post much additional collateral during the five years of these arrangements. In fact, we expect to get another $300 million or more in collateral return to us in the second quarter.","Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with communications on Slide 7. Mobility turned in another solid quarter with service revenue growth, solid margins and postpaid and prepaid phone growth. Our Entertainment Group got off to a good start and stabilizing EBITDA for the year. In fact, we grew at nearly 7% in the quarter, thanks to broadband revenues growing more than 8% and tight cost controls. In fact, our broadband growth exceeded our legacy revenue change in the quarter.","Communication revenues were up slightly when you exclude lower equipment revenues from the fewer smartphone upgrades. And margins were up 20 basis points even with the accounting headwinds and lower business wireline EBITDA. Business continues to be impacted by legacy declines and then transition to a low margin services. The first quarter had a tough year-over-year compare and this year we had higher deferral amortization and a wholesale business customer default, but we still posted $2.5 billion of EBITDA for the quarter.","Now let's take a deeper look at our mobility results on Slide 8. Solid service revenue growth drove wireless revenue gain even as equipment revenues get to lowest upgrade rate in our history. Service revenues grew by nearly $400 million or 2.9% in the quarter and EBITDA grew by about 2% even with non-cash accounting headwinds of $200 million and subscriber gains in postpaid and prepaid phones. We grew postpaid phone net adds by 80,000 in the quarter, a significant improvement compared to a year-ago and FirstNet continued to be a tailwind to customer growth.","In prepaid, we had 85,000 phone net adds, our 17th consecutive quarter of growth. We continue to be strategic here as well, focusing on the high-value prepaid market. Cricket is our flagship brand in prepaid. It generated strong subscriber growth and had its lowest ever quarterly churn rate of less than 3%, down more than 60 basis points year-over-year. Prepaid revenue growth was solid, up more than 6%. We now have more than 10 million Cricket subscribers, double what we had when we acquired the company in 2014 with more than 17 million total prepaid customers under the umbrella of AT&T.","Randall already mentioned our many network achievements, but I will also point out that the percentage of new FirstNet customers is shifting to more customers new to AT&T and fewer migrations.","Let's now look at our Entertainment Group results on Slide 9. The headline in Entertainment Group is growing EBITDA and operating contribution. And we\u2019re confident, we will meet or exceed our target of stabilizing EG EBITDA for the full-year. EBITDA grew by more than $180 million and margins expanded by 180 basis points to 24.7%, reversing a trend that we saw last year as the chart shows. A few things drove that improvement. First was good expense control both on content cost moderation from some recent renewals and operational cost such as lower advertising expense and promotional spending.","Also we had a one-time settlement of a prior year carriage dispute that help the first quarter by about $40 million. So even without that one-time event, we had growth of over 5%. Third, our video ARPU increased as we focused on higher value customers, reduce promotions and move our pricing to market for both premium at over the top service offerings.","Advertising revenues also continue to grow. Our premium ARPU grew for the first time in five quarters, up more than 2% and DIRECTV NOW ARPU was up more than $10 year-over-year. The number of premium TV customers on a 2-year price lock promotion declined by about 700,000 in the quarter. We still have about 1.6 million customers left on that pricing and we work through those for the rest of the year.","Our focus on -- is on the long-term value customers. Secular declines and pricing moves we've made, did results in fewer gross adds and 544,000 fewer video subscribers. Changes to packaging and pricing in DIRECTV NOW impacted over the top net adds as well, but was significantly less than the fourth quarter.","Broadband revenues grew by more than 8% and contributed to EBITDA stability and growth. We\u2019ve seen continued ARPU improvement in both video and broadband for the past year, helping us stabilize and grow EBITDA. We expect IP broadband ARPU growth to continue, but somewhat more moderate rates as we lap the step up that we saw in the second quarter of last year. We gained nearly 300,000 AT&T fiber customers in the quarter, bringing the total in service to more than 3 million and we now passed more than 12 million customer locations with fiber. For the quarter, we added 45,000 broadband customers.","During the quarter, we updated our billing process for the premium video and broadband customers. Customers are now billed and receive service for the full month when they stay -- when they are in the last month of service, which is consistent with our content cost and mobility customer policies as well as the rest of the industry. This generated additional revenues for us and gave us additional time to win back customers. Customers in service at the end of the period were higher because of this change, about a 117,000 subscribers in premium TV and 38,000 in broadband.","We expect the video net add challenges we saw in the first quarter will continue. Achieving EBITDA growth in the first quarter was a tremendous accomplishment for our Entertainment Group team. We continue to have confidence that we will meet or exceed our EBITDA target for the full-year.","Let's move to WarnerMedia's first quarter results, which are on Slide 10. WarnerMedia continues to exceed our expectations and had a strong start to the year. Revenue growth was up more than 3% and operating income once again showed double-digit growth and nearly 12% with gains in all three units, and WarnerMedia continues to be accretive to both earnings and free cash flow.","Warner Bros revenue grew by nearly 9%. Theatrical revenues increased primarily due to carry over revenue from Aquaman. Television revenues increased primarily due to higher initial telecast revenues. HBO revenues declined mainly related to a carriage dispute with one our distributors, but still realized operating income growth for the quarter. HBO's operating income was up due to lower programming costs. We continue to increase investment in high quality content. However, programming costs declined primarily due to the timing of content releases and some lower amortization expense.","Turner revenues were down slightly, subscription revenues continue to grow. Thanks to higher domestic affiliate rate. But this revenue growth was offset by ad revenue declines, primarily from the every other year shift of the NCAA Final Four games. We are the Final Four games in the first quarter last year and reported all that ad revenue. This year CBS reported that. in years which CBS broadcast the Final Four games, we reported our share as participation interest not as ad revenue. That explains the difference, virtually all the difference in our ad revenues. With that, Turner's operating income was up 7%.","WarnerMedia set for a solid year with final season of Game of Thrones is underway and viewership is breaking records. More than 17 million people turned in for the season premiere and to date more than 27 million people have watched the episode. In fact, we added more HBO Now subscribers in the week leading up to the Season 8 premiere of Game of Thrones than in any other week in the services history. Those numbers will show up in the second quarter customer accounts.","We also had another successful airing of the March Madness, the NBA playoffs are going full steam on TNT. Warner Bros. Shazam! open earlier this month and is doing well at both the domestic and international box office. And later this year, we have our next Godzilla movie. It, Chapter 2 and the Joker, to name just a few of the great movies slated to be released.","Now let's look at Xandr and Latin America results on Slide 11. Still very much in the early days for Xandr, but it continues to execute and expand. Revenues were up more than 26%, including AppNexus, our strongest first quarter growth in the last three years. Growth rate in this business tend to be seasonal and event driven such as election days with growing growth ramping throughout the year. EBITDA margins continued be strong and we continue to invest in developing our advertising platforms.","We are making progress, integrating the Xandr marketplace across all of AT&T. Xandr is now helping optimize Turner inventory. Xandr will also be working with Viacom as a result of our recent content negotiations, so we\u2019re excited about that. We\u2019ve discussed many times the potential joint benefits of blending premium content with our data and distribution to take advantage of targeted and relevant advertising opportunities. These agreements can help distributors, content providers and most importantly, help our customers.","Turning to Latin America, we continue to deal with foreign exchange and local economy challenges. Total Latin America revenues and EBITDA were down year-over-year, primarily due to those pressures. But on a constant currency basis and excluding Venezuela, revenues would have grown .3% on a comparable basis.","In Mexico, we saw solid service revenue growth, which was offset by lower handset sales in the quarter. We are making good progress on our goal to achieve profitability in Mexico. We still have plans for more improvement, EBITDA improved by $58 million year-over-year. We are improving operating income and maintain line of sight for EBITDA to breakeven in the second half of the year.","Coming into 2019, we adjusted our subscriber base in Mexico to reflect the impact of a double count from certain third-party distributors and the sunset of 2G services. We continue to take operational steps to improve the quality of our sales and profitability. This includes focusing on higher value customers, adjustments to dealer commission structures, reduction in the subsidies and targeted price increases. Each of these changes improves the long-term value of our business, but puts pressure on volume comparisons.","Even with our focus on higher value customers, we continue to grow our subscriber base of nearly 18 million subscribers. Given our focus on quality, we expect to see continued net add growth as churn improves. Foreign exchange significantly Vrio [ph], but revenues were flat sequentially. If you look at the results in constant currency, revenues were up year-over-year and the business continues to be profitable and generate positive cash flow. The beginning of the year, customer base was adjusted for the prior year after we identified and shut off a group of nonpaying customers. Vrio net adds were down, but our total subscriber base remain stable from a year-ago.","Now before we get to your questions, let me give you an update on deleveraging, that's on Slide 12. As you know, our goal is to get to the 2.5x net debt to EBITDA range by the end of this year through free cash flow, asset sales and overall cash management and we are off to a really good start. First, our free cash flow, working capital and collateral agreement initiatives help us reduce net debt by $2.3 billion in the first quarter. Remember, the first quarter is usually our toughest quarter for free cash flow.","We still expect our free cash flow after dividends to generate about $12 billion this year and expect to use it to pay down the debt. Second, we\u2019ve significant asset sales that put us well on our way to our asset monetization target. And it includes the sale of our interest in Hulu for $1.4 billion, which closed on April 15 and the pending $2.2 billion sale of our interest in Hudson Yards, which was just announced. This puts us in solid position to meet our leverage target of the 2.5x range by the end of the year. We are sharply focused on this. The teams have done a superb job so far and we expect that to continue through the rest of this year.","Mike, with that, we're ready to take some questions.","Michael Viola","Okay. Thanks, John. Greg, we will start with the Q&A and we will take our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik","Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Maybe a couple of questions on EG. First, maybe for John, the 5% growth, the adjusted growth on EBITDA was quite a bit better than we thought, and we were led to believe given the price changes that you would actually see improving trends later as the year progressed versus the first year. So, would it make sense? I know you didn\u2019t really change guidance, you said there could be some upside, but how should we think of the cadence of that as some of these price increases work through the system there. And then, maybe drilling down on the traditional sub losses. I guess, we get some -- we understand how NOW is going to continue to moderate given what\u2019s going on with Game of Thrones in HBO. But on the traditional side, we\u2019re using 661 for losses this quarter, given the $117,000 sub adjustment. First of all, is that the way to look at that? And then Randall, in your remarks, you said things would improve in the second half. And John, during your remarks you said that you'd still expect to see challenges. What is the cadence of that? Should we be using the 661 this quarter as the base of losses going forward? And the 1.6 million still on promo, what\u2019s the cadence of those guys coming off and adding to churn? Just how should we think of that line going forward? Thanks.","John Stephens","Yes. So, John, let me try this. Let Randall kind of clear up what maybe I don\u2019t make clear. First, on EBITDA, it was really great growth. We did have -- as we mentioned, one-time adjustment was about $40 million, but the EBITDA growth was close to $200 million. So, it was only a small part of it. So it was really good. What -- that growth, and we're pleased and have confidence that we\u2019re going to meet our goal of stability. We are not raising our guidance, but as Randall said and I repeated, it's clear that we're on line of sight to not only meet but exceed that target, so we are just being careful with our representations going out.","John Hodulik","Got it.","John Stephens","We will continue to balance things and continue to measure costs, and go after high value customers, so we are leaving ourselves that flexibility, but we are clearly on track. I wouldn't suggest to you that you can draw a straight line out, but I feel really good about where we\u2019re on EBITDA growth. So, that\u2019s my best attempt to make a direct answer. We feel very good about it. We continue to expect to meet our guidance. At this stage, I understand why you would think we're going to exceed it, we'll let that happen. We are going to stick with our guidance as it is today with the understanding that we're outperforming on many respects.","With regard to the sub losses, I think of it as a -- the 544 is the right number. I understand we pointed out the change in the billing [ph], but remember that's just an item that continually gets refreshed and it\u2019s always out there. So it's not a loss each quarter or an adjustment each quarter. In the second quarter, it just refreshes itself. So, it's kind of just the timing item on a one-time basis. Secondly, we did price increases on an annual basis in January. So that affected. All the customers got some price increase, that affected the linear. And we had about 700,000 customers impacted by the 2-year price lock. As we go through the year, we won't have another annual price increase per se. So that will have a -- that impact on customer accounts won't necessarily be there in that light. And then, secondly, as we get through now down to about 1.6 million at the beginning of the year 2.4 million on the price locks, as we get through the rest of those, we'll see less and less impact from those just because we get through the process. We expect that process to continue through November, which is the 2-year anniversary the last time we had an offer on this, but we'll see a lot of that activity going through in the second quarter. That's the difference between the first quarter and the rest of the year in the sense of the annual price increase as well as the largest group of the 700,000 customers hitting by the 2-year price lock. Randall, what would you want to add?","Randall Stephenson","Yes, on the subscriber losses, I\u2019ve said particularly on DIRECTV NOW, our streaming product, that we\u2019ve put the price increases and we\u2019ve seen the effect of that in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Second quarter, you'll see that moderate, and I actually believe second half of the year based on what we're seeing in terms of uptake in the market on the new platform and the new product, and we should have a decent second half of the year on DIRECTV NOW. On the traditional premium product DIRECTV, I said you should expect continue to see losses as we move through this year, but we will be launching second half of the year the thin client, which think of that is our satellite replacement product. And why this is so important? It allows us to get into the market at a lower price point. When you look at the DIRECTV churn, it's interesting. What you see is not people at the high end in terms of ARPUs that are churning. It's disproportionally at the low end and where we don't have broadband. And so this thin client gives us an opportunity to meet that low end with a better price point and this should start to moderate the subscriber losses. And particularly as we get into 2020, we think this product is going to have a really good appeal for people down market in terms of their expectations of video pricing.","John Hodulik","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Michael Viola","Greg, we will take the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","David Barden","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first kind of a bigger picture question with respect to the DTC strategy, Randall, or John Stankey, if he's on. A couple of weeks ago we saw Disney launch a DTC product or announce a launch with lower-than-expected pricing, bigger than expected losses. Numbers came down and the stock jumped 10% because people were looking at this as kind of a standalone Netflix being incubated inside Disney. And I was wondering if you guys could kind of address how you guys think about how the market would react to a similar announcement at AT&T? And if you could at this stage kind of dissect a little bit about what you think is good and strong about the Disney platform announcement and what maybe vulnerable about their approach and opportunities you see for yourself to come into that market. I guess, kind of on a related topic, could you talk a little bit about what if anything the Hulu sale might mean to the financials of the business. My guess is that you'll kind of see less losses from that flowing through to the earnings statement? And if you could kind of size that, that will be helpful for us. Thanks so much.","Randall Stephenson","David, this is Randall. On Hulu, fewer losses and less capital requirements. So -- but we received $1.4 billion in cash and we're no longer in it, and so the capital goals go away, obviously. So on the Disney launch, yes I was impressed by what Disney did. I was -- also I thought the market reaction was an indication that people look at what Disney would be able to bring to market in terms of original content, library of content, deep strong brand content and new and original content and talking about the licensing that they would be pulling back in and I think what it did is gave the market an appreciation that this is a viable direct-to-consumer product, that will have good appeal for a broad number of customers, not just in the U.S., but around the world. And so I thought it was very instructive from that standpoint. From our standpoint, you'd be able to formulate your own opinion in September, October about what will be bringing to bear. But in terms of premium content, think about the HBO brand. In terms of breadth of content, consider the Warner Bros. library and the depth of that library, the new original content creation machine at Warner Bros., which is really an impressive scale machine in terms of producing theatrical as well as TV productions. And we're actually quite optimistic that we have something from both a magnitude of content, breadth of content, depth of content, new and original generation creation capabilities that we believe we can bring to market and will have significant customer uptake. And we will lay out for you those details in terms of what we think that looks like, what our expectations are for this product, including pricing and so forth. We are not ready to fully disclose all that yet. There's a lot of work being done. Bob Greenblatt is just getting his hands into this and working at aggressively. But I will tell you we're very, very optimistic and the Disney announcement gave us nothing, but more optimism in terms of what we think we will be able to bring to market.","David Barden","Thanks, Randall.","Randall Stephenson","Thank you, David.","Michael Viola","Okay. Greg, we will take the next question. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thank you very much. I wonder if you could turn to wireless. Perhaps you could just update us on the outlook on the wireless service revenues for the rest of the year, another good performance and the ads turning around despite churn continuing to be a little bit higher year-over-year. So talk us through the network improvements how you\u2019re going to market to take advantage of that, and how that should shape during the year-end? Any updated color on the 5G rollout? We haven't really seen a lot on the commercial site. So when do we see more kind of opportunities in terms of pricing plans and so forth? Is that when the sub 6 gigahertz chipsets come out? Thanks.","John Stephens","Sure, Simon. Let me take a run at it and ask Randall back me up. But first on the wireless revenue outlook continued to be positive. I stand by our guidance, and expect new service revenues. We had a great growth almost 3%, 2.9% in the first quarter. I will point out that last -- second quarter is when we saw some service revenue growth. So our compares get a little tougher in the second quarter and then a little bit more tough in the third quarter next year because of the growth we\u2019ve last year, but that\u2019s how I will still expect to grow it. It just has little tough compares, that's one. Two, why do we expect to grow? Because we do expect customer net adds. This first quarter was the first time in, I think, five years we had positive postpaid phone growth and solid prepaid phone growth. I think probably close to 170,000 or so voice that adds in the first quarter. In total, it's really great number for us and a game changer shows the impact we\u2019re having in the marketplace. So we feel good about the momentum coming out of that and that opportunity going forward. I will give you a sidebar. Our reseller losses were small as they\u2019ve been in the years -- in quarters, I should say, excuse me. So that\u2019s even showing an impact on that revenue -- that service revenue item. From a network improvements perspective, Randall mentioned the multiple awards that we're getting. Anybody's heard Mike and I do presentations know that we test the speeds walking down the hallways before our presentations and it's working. We get emails from investors and so forth. So it's having a real impact that we believe is impacting our ability to gain and retain customers. It's going to take a while to make sure we get that story fully understood. It's -- I mean, it takes a while to convince people, so we're optimistic that we will see the benefits that later in the year. We are at 53% of our network build out for FirstNet as of the end of the first quarter. We expect to get to 60% clearly by the end of the third quarter because that\u2019s the next billing milestone and payment milestone with FirstNet authority. And as we\u2019ve told you, we expect to reimburse -- first reimburse going to get that done. Now we expect to do that. We are well ahead of schedule. Team is doing a great job in that. Putting all that spectrum into use at once maybe caused some interest expense pressure, but it's working and it's working in the quality of the network. 5G were at 19 markets today operational using that 39 gigahertz millimeter wave. I will tell you, we still have plans to get a couple hundred. We have, if you will, a couple hundred million on our 5G evolution network coverage by the end of this year, but end of next year we will have over 200 million of our POPS covered on a 5G network. So our plans for 5G are going quite well. We -- as we mentioned earlier, we don\u2019t expect that revenue to come until next year and the year after, but we are working on a number of things. Whether it's in the hospital, in core netting medical centers, or it's in the factories, whether it's doing a whole host of automated, if you will, campuses for our big customers, we are seeing lots of really good progress with that. But it -- from a revenue perspective for a company of our size, we're still -- we're very optimistic, we're leading in 5G, but we'll see those revenue impacts growing over next year into the 2020 one timeframe.","Randall Stephenson","I would -- Simon, I would add that this is the wireless piece. The network quality piece is probably the area within our business where I take more satisfaction than just about anywhere else. And this has been a long time coming, we\u2019ve been investing billions. As you know, we\u2019ve invested tens of billions of dollars in building the spectrum portfolio, and so bringing on FirstNet and having the opportunity to begin turning up all that spectrum is we're going across the country and turning up FirstNet is having exactly the impact that we hoped it would have and it is changing the value proposition for our customers. The value proposition is now one of quality and speed and delivery of video and we're not going out doing a lot of aggressive promotions and we're not doing pricing to try to get customers to stay and come on to the network. It is happening just organically and by virtue of the strategy that we implemented. The 5G evolution of product that we have out there as we turn all this spectrum up and put the new technology on MIMO and so forth, our competitors hate it, but it is having exactly the effect that you wanted to have. Our customers see this tag and they go do a speed check and they\u2019re seeing 80, 90, 100, 150 meg speeds depending on where they are. It is truly a step change difference in product capability. And that its having exactly the effect that we had hoped. And so all the areas that I look at right now and say I am pleased with this is the number one area that I\u2019m most pleased with. Obviously, second would be getting the Entertainment Group EBITDA stabilized and actually growing and we\u2019re feeling really good about that as well. But this is really, really an important accomplishment for us.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thank you.","Michael Viola","Thanks, Simon. Greg, ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip Cusick","Hey, guys. Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","Hi, Phil.","Philip Cusick","Can you -- two follow-ups. Can you dig first into the wireless growth and help us quantify what FirstNet is doing for the subline? And then, second, a follow-up on the video side. Can you expand on your relationship with the NFL, and particular on the exclusivity of Sunday ticket? Thank you.","Randall Stephenson","Sure. Wireless growth, we -- we're having a lot of success with FirstNet even with only 50% of the nation now completed in terms of the network build. And you heard 570,000 subscribers and John articulated that we\u2019ve hit a threshold where more and more those are coming new on to the network, they\u2019re not just migrations on to our network. And what we are finding is the FirstNet community. We put some very attractive offers out there for their families. And so every FirstNet subscriber that comes on to the network, I think the latest number John is we\u2019re getting two \u2026","John Stephens","Yes.","Randall Stephenson","\u2026 family members with it. And so, this is driving a not inconsequential impact on subscriber gains. The network quality being the best and FirstNet being a main driver of it. So FirstNet is going to be a very important strategic element for us for a number of years to come and we are -- we continue to be more enthused about it than when we want to bid and won the deal. In terms of the NFL, I think we're not allowed to discuss much, but the exclusivity should remain as we go forward on DIRECTV. You probably saw news that the NFL network was taken down on our U-verse network. And look, we're heavily invested in the NFL on DIRECTV, but we're limited to carrying the Sunday ticket just on DIRECTV. And so our customers that have a high affinity to the NFL, we tend to have them overall on DIRECTV. When you look at the NFL network, there's some costs attached to that. And when you consider the games on the NFL network or the NFL Draft, our customers can watch the NFL Draft on ABC, they can watch the Thursday night games on Fox, and so it's all stuff we carry and so the NFL network was for a product U-verse that was not allowed to carry the Sunday ticket. It just didn\u2019t really make sense to continue carrying it over there. So it will save some content cost and we will give our customers access to the NFL through other mediums. If they really are a NFL centric customer, we will move them to DIRECTV.","Philip Cusick","Got it. Thank you. And at one point you had talked about bending the content cost curve on DIRECTV. You re-signed Viacom. Is there something coming that you think might bend that curve, or we should be looking at it sort of linear from here?","Randall Stephenson","So we\u2019ve nondisclosures generally on these deals, but what I would tell you is that the content cost or the content deals that we\u2019ve negotiated over the last few months have all been curve benders. And we are -- we feel good about where we are coming in and I think the margins on Entertainment Group are reflecting that. So bottom line, I am satisfied with the progress that John Donovan and his team are making on the content deals are coming up and getting them re-crafted to make sure we can distribute them to all of our various platforms and controlling the cost curve.","John Stephens","Remember Phil, the ability to work with them on -- that\u2019s not at all. The content distributors have more advertising minutes than we as the distributor do. So if we can use our advertising resources to increase our ARPUs and our advertising dollars, like you\u2019ve seen with Xandr's growth, and then we can offer that to the content guys. There is a different -- there is a solution to the situation where they can gain advertising revenues and not have that the content cost, but still the revenues for them, and both of us benefit as do the customers. And quite frankly, we are really excited about Viacom. As we said we're working at Xandr with Viacom on things just like that. So those solutions here that are to be mutually beneficial, all three of the parties, the distributors, the content providers and the advertisers. So, it's a lot of work we\u2019re doing and the team is doing a great job, but we believe that there are solutions here that makes sense for everybody.","Michael Viola","Thanks, Phil. Greg, we will take the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. On the slide where you show your fiber broadband net adds, what we can see is that there's been gradual improvement in that performance which makes sense because you\u2019ve been building out the fiber network. I was hoping you could give us just a little bit more insight into what\u2019s driving that? For example, to what extent has the mix of that then shifting from upgrades to maybe winning new customers. How do you see that trending as you complete the fiber build out? And if you can give us any insight into the success you've had at bundling that fiber with some of your other products, that will be really helpful. Thank you.","John Stephens","Yes. So, Brett, let me take a shot at it. And I appreciate you bringing this up, because I should dovetail this in -- for our prior question. When you look at the Entertainment Group margins in total, broadband is really a driver. Broadband is really a grower. If you remember my comments, broadband growth this year-over-year quarter exceeded the challenges, the headwinds we faced from the local voice of the other equipment revenue. So that's actually -- when you put broadband there, broadband's growth exceeded that. So broadband, specifically fiber derivative is doing well. And it is -- and it itself is helping drive EBITDA margin improvement at Entertainment Group. That's one. Two, we will continue to see some revenue growth on broadband throughout the year, just like wireless compares get a little bit more challenging in the second and third quarters, but we still -- we still expect to see ARPU growth and revenue growth. So feel really good about that. Yes, you're right we\u2019ve kept that about 25% of the available fiber out there. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent and no matter how much more we put out a 1 million or 1.5 million a quarter, we continue to immediately utilize 25% of that, because we've continue to add capacity and we will finish off adding that capacity at least from the FCC requirements we have in July. We will then start to further penetrate that market. So we feel like we will be able to grow it. If you think about the timeframe, keeping up at a 25% is a pretty good penetration rate when you continue to add as much fiber as we\u2019ve had. We see it in areas where we have the video, the wireless, the fiber together bundling is going well. It continues to give us an opportunity to participate and take market share in the broadband space. You are right, we continue to see on the early stages migrations of existing customers. But once again, as we get passed that that initial stage, we get in to be able to attract more and take share, which we\u2019ve said in the past and we will continue to see going forward. So with that being said, I expect we will get to around 14 million or maybe just under that range by the end of June and to July kind of the timeframe to fulfill our FCC requirement. That will give us 22 million customer locations in total. But that 14 million we'd expect to continue to see that 25% penetration very quickly and move up from there and get into a on par market share with our competitors as we take share or convert more customers. Let me stop at that and see Randall, if there's anything you want to add or anything I forgot?","Randall Stephenson","No, I think you covered it well. This is probably one of the more exciting areas of the business in terms of where we have invested heavily and now we are seeing the fruits of the investment and getting to 25% penetration, that's almost mechanical. To be candid with you, whenever we go into a neighborhood and turn up fiber, 25% comes fast and 50% is eminently achievable. And we actually think we can hopefully get beyond 50% as we continue to get this build completed. And I\u2019m telling you where we get AT&T fiber, a video product and a mobile product, churn rates just drop. And the value effect of that is really, really powerful. Customers will love it and the services were all premium services and so this is going to be a really important element of us as we go through the rest of this year in 2020 in terms of keeping the Entertainment Group EBITDA stable.","Brett Feldman","Thank you.","Randall Stephenson","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormick from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Michael McCormick","Hi, guys. Thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on the wireless business. It sounds like you guys grew -- you are fairly aggressive in 1Q on the buy one get one offers. Clearly FirstNet is having a positive impact, but how should we think about on a going forward basis through 2019 the appetite for that trade-off between promotional activity margin and phone net adds? And then, secondly on the broadband side, the active broadband side, could you give us a sense -- I know you\u2019re going to be laughing that allocation -- the revenue allocation change, how should we think about the spot pricing in broadband sort of today versus, say a year-ago.? Thanks.","John Stephens","Let me take the first one. On the mobility margins and the perception of BOGOs and so forth, remember our equipment revenues are really down. So in -- so that may have an effect depending upon on how any of our promotions are done on the BOGO stuff, but let me say it this way. If you look at our results and you say service revenues were up about $375 million, $400 million, and our -- about $375 million and our EBITDA was about $130 million, $350 million. And then you say I had noncash accounting rev rec commission and amortization in the rev rec and so forth of about $200 million. Effectively, of that $375 million service revenue, $350 million -- or almost $350 million of it fell to the bottom line from making that accounting adjustments. So from that perspective, it won't be really effective at controlling cost, controlling promos, being prudent with advertising and promotional expense. So we feel good about the quality of our customer count net adds and the ability to do that. I mean, I understand your question, but I don't want to leave you with the impression that somehow -- this was a very thoughtful process and focused on value of customers. And we -- I believe we are really successful. So I would tell you that the value of FirstNet, the quality experience of the market and the opportunity it provides and further geographic coverage, and quite frankly we\u2019re putting more distribution points out there with opening new stores. But that's part of our investment that we're making that sometimes shows up in the expense line as opposed in the CapEx line. But we're expanding our stores in places where we have stores before. So all of that based on FirstNet, based on the solid very, very solid first quarter results, based on this expanded, if you will, geographic footprint and distribution footprint, we feel really good about wireless going forward.","Randall Stephenson","That\u2019s the point John just made. As we build out FirstNet into these rural communities, as we deploy, we're turning up new distribution in these rural communities and these tend to be communities that have had one option for the last number of years. And we're having a lot of success as we move into the smaller communities, set up new distribution and taking market share. So that\u2019s just another side benefit of the FirstNet build.","John Stephens","With regard to the IP broadband side, I just refer you to the kind of the ARPUs, I think that we got published out there with regard to this quarter being at about 50 -- little over 50 bucks on the broadband ARPU, it's about 8% growth. But if you compare it to next quarter you will see next quarter year-over-year -- we jump from first quarter to second quarter last year. And so that's all we\u2019re trying to tell you about. It's not a sensitivity at all about the success of the project. We feel really good about it and we do feel like as we get more of the fiber put in service. We have the opportunity to -- our customers will want higher-speed, and they will be willing to pay a fair price for those higher-speeds. So we are optimistic about it. We are just being careful from a numerical comparison perspective. If you look at the first quarter last year, both on wireless and on broadband to second quarter you saw a step up in those ARPU numbers, and we just want to make sure the compare is right.","Michael McCormick","Very good. And Randall, can you maybe just comment, we\u2019re seeing a lot of price increases across the board and over the top streaming video products. How does DIRECTV now sort of set up against that and in this landscape how do you view price elasticity for your customer?","Randall Stephenson","Yes, Mike, we made our move on OTT pricing and rationalizing the whole content lineup for our OTT product in the fourth quarter. And you've now seen most of the other players that have a streaming product out there follow. And I think we're getting to a place where the product, we all look at. So, okay, this is a sustainable place if you can get the advertising revenues to where we think we can get them. This was probably a sustainable level. It is as you're seeing highly price-sensitive. This is a segment of the market that had by and large left the linear product market, because of pricing. And so as we came in with a $40 product, you saw a significant uptake and it was largely people who had left the market. And as you begin to move the pricing and try to get the profit equation right, you saw some fallout, but now we're in the market at this $50 price point and we\u2019re early on in terms of getting the new platform out there. It came out I think very end of March, but we're seeing good uptake on the new platform, the new pricing. As I said during the second quarter, you may still see the OTT product to be negative in terms of subscribers, as we continue to experience price increases on the base. But what we're seeing on the uptake of the new product with a new price point is giving us confidence. So we get to the second half of the year, this thing ought to do decent growth. And so we're actually optimistic, but it is a very price-sensitive product, Mike. Make no mistake about it.","Michael Viola","Thanks, Mike. Greg, we will take one last question.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Rollins","Hi. Thanks and good morning. Two, if I could. First, as you look at the performance of full fiber subscribers when you made the upgrade relative to the implied decline of customers with DSL and fiber-to-the-node, how are you thinking about what portion of your homes ultimately need to get the full fiber capability and how quickly you want to get there. And then, secondly, you described the growth in fixed broadband ARPU as customers are buying up the higher-speed packages. Do you see a multiyear opportunity in the wireless segment to change the pricing model and charge higher prices for higher bit -- higher bit rate, especially as you introduce 5GE and then eventually full 5G?","Randall Stephenson","Yes. On the 5G piece, Mike, I will be very surprised. If as we move into wireless, the pricing regime and wireless doesn\u2019t look something like the pricing regime you see in fixed line. If you can offer a gig speed, there are some customers that are willing to pay a premium for 500 meg to a gig speed and so forth. So I expect that to be the case. We are two or three years away from seeing that play out. Right now from a 5G standpoint, what we're seeing in terms of adoption tends to be business. In fact it's exclusively business for us right now. Its serving as a land replacement product and we're having really impressive demand where we turn up the 5G service from businesses basically saying, we want to put a router in, and it becomes their LAN replacement. And so now as you begin to think about equipment, whether it be handsets or tablets or laptops that have 5G modems within them, which that will happen starting this year and it really pick up over the next year, then that truly does become a LAN replacement. You don't even need the router at that stage. And so, the idea that just like business customers pay more for more speed in a fixed line environment, we expect that there is going to be demand and that there will be price differentiation for speed as you move into a 5G environment. In terms of fiber upgrades, we have as you know, over the last 3, plus 4 years have the most aggressive fiber deployment program probably in the United States. And so we've been going at a really hot rate in putting fiber out. As I mentioned earlier, I think it was to Mike McCormick's question, the adoption on fiber deployment in terms of taking market share and customer upgrades is fairly mechanical. It doesn't take a rocket science to figure out what this looks like as you deploy fiber. And so while we're going to kind of finish off this first phase of our fiber deployment between 5G and FirstNet and just our natural desire and preference for fiber on new builds, you\u2019re going to see fiber continue to be pushed into this network. And as business locations demand fiber, you\u2019re just going to see a capillary of fiber deployment continue over the next 4 or 5 years. And it's not going to go at the same pace you\u2019ve been seeing for last four, but it's going to continue. And I don't see that stopping. So I see our fiber opportunity just continuing to grow as we move 2020 through 2025. Thanks for the questions, Mike.","Michael Rollins","Thank you.","Michael Viola","Okay. Well, listen, I appreciate everybody joining us. And once again, punchline to this quarter is we have basically done exactly what we told you we would do at the Analyst Day and then again our January guidance. Debt reduction is right on track. Asset sales and asset monetizations are right on track. Our free cash flow forecast is actually ahead of schedule and Entertainment Group is on track and actually ahead of schedule as well. So stay tuned. We will be getting more details to you in terms of our WarnerMedia Day to come in September, October timeframe. And I appreciate your time and look forward to talking to you again.

Operator Instructions]","At this time I would like to turn the conference over to our first speaker Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Susan Johnson. Please go ahead.","Susan Johnson","Thank you, Nick. Good afternoon everyone. And welcome to our second quarter conference call. It\u2019s great to have you with us today. I\u2019m Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer; and Ralph de la Vega, AT&T\u2019s President and CEO for Mobility. John will cover our consolidated and wireline results and Ralph will give us an update on our wireless business. And then we\u2019ll follow with a Q&A session.","Let me remind you our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website that\u2019s www.att.com\/investor.relations. Of course I first need to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement before we begin which says that some of our comments today maybe forward-looking. As such they are subject to risks and uncertainties, results may differ materially. And additional information is available in our and DIRECTV\u2019s SEC filings and on the Investor Relations page of AT&T and DIRECTV\u2019s websites. I also wish to direct your attention to the information regarding SEC filings that is included on the slide.","Before I turn the call over to John, I would like to provide some additional context for the quarter on Slide 4. We talked with you the last few quarters about how we\u2019ve been transforming our business for growth. This quarter we saw a significant progress, particularly with our repositioning of the wireless business model. First on the network front. Our Project VIP investment plan continues to deliver or transforming our network to a premier IP video-centric network and the results have been impressive.","Our 4G LTE build now covers more than 290 million people and we expect to complete our deployment by the end of the summer. And our fiber build out to cover more businesses is going well. We\u2019ve now passed more than 500,000 business customer locations since we first announced Project VIP. At the same time we are investing in our network, we are investing in our customers by repositioning the wireless value proposition.","Several years ago we successfully led the transition to usage base to data pricing and now more than 80% of our postpaid smartphone subscribers are on those plans. Now we are making another successful pivot away from the traditional device subsidy model with AT&T and our Mobile Share Value plans. Customers can now pay directly for their devices and exchange for lower service pricing. That\u2019s an equation that really works for our customers, as you can see with this quarter\u2019s record subscriber metrics. And it\u2019s an equation that works for us.","With this an important strategic shift away from device subsidies which has historically netted out to be a multi-billion dollar cost each year. This move away from the subsidy model it\u2019s happening quickly and bringing about many of the expected changes in our financial results.","The shift in revenues from service to equipment and the moderation of quarterly margin trends as we achieved increased savings in device subsidies in the back-half of the year, which as you know historically is our strongest device sales season. But the key point is that we have made a deliberate discussion to go down this path and with the results we are seeing, we believe the strategy is clearly working. We see it in our results and we hear from our customers.","With that, let me turn it over to John to discuss our second quarter results. John?","John Stephens","Thank you, Susan. And hello everyone, thanks for joining us today and as always thank you for your interest in AT&T. Let me begin with our consolidated financial summary which is on Slide 5. Consolidated revenue grew to $32.6 billion up $500 million or 1.6%. This was driven by continued wireless growth as we change our business model. Solid consumer wireline growth once again led by U-verse and growth and strategic business services.","Revenue this quarter was impacted by the shift to no device subsidy plans and wireless. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.68, as you know during the quarter we sold our equity position in Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil. After-tax we had a gain of about $0.08 on the sale. The gain was taxed at a higher effective tax rate due to accounting for deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits.","While these accounting rules will acquire this high tax rate, we are confident we will be able to utilize existing capitalized carryforwards to maximize the after-tax cash proceeds from the sale. When you normalize to the side, our consolidated effective tax rate is about 34% or about a 100 basis points higher than last year.","Also we had $0.02 of pressure from our Leap integration cost, including our non-cash items such as the amortization of customer list. You may recall that we close that transition in March, so this is the first full quarter with these integration costs. When you exclude these items earnings per share was $0.62 compared to an adjusted $0.67 a year earlier.","Consolidated margins continue to be pressured by our investments both in Project VIP and Agile and our shift away from the subsidy model to wireless. These well for our investments are expected to drive stronger growth in the second half of the year. Cash from operations continues to be strong. Cash from operating activities in the quarter totaled to $8.1 billion and capital spending was $ 6 billion with strong investments in Project VIP. Year-to-date our free cash flow is more than $5 billion and that after are more than $1.5 billion investment in our customers through AT&T Next.","Solid churn to our operational highlights on Slide 6. As you can see, we continue to execute a high level even as we transform our business. In wireless the growing popularity of AT&T Next and the Mobile Share Value plan is having an impact on our results.","The customer transition to these plans is driving a major shift in the subsidy model and at the same time helping to reduce churn increased postpaid subscribers drive strong growth of large voice data and improve our net promoter scores or our customer satisfaction results.","However, Ralph will give you the details in just a moment. But we are very pleased with what we are seeing from our wireless repositioning and confident in our strategy. In wireline U-verse continues its steady performance of subscriber gains and increasing revenue.","It\u2019s now approaching $15 billion in annualized revenues, growing at about 25% year-over-year. Strategic business services also continues to grow at more than 13% and is an annualized $9 billion revenue stream. We also reached a milestone in the second quarter when our U-verse high-speed broadband reached 70% of our total broadband base. Clearly the transition is underway.","While we have made great progress, we still have a lot of room for growth, as we expand our base through Project VIP and continue the bundle broadband with other valuable services. And of course in the second quarter, we announced our intention to acquire DIRECTV.","This will take our video and bundling strategies and our cost structure to a whole new level. We\u2019re really excited about what this transaction can do. Service bundles are a proven winner for us, and we believe the ability to bundle services nationally will be a big plus. Overall, we are on track with full year guidance and look forward for trends to improve in the second half of the year.","We\u2019d now like to turn it over to Ralph de la Vega, who will provide more insight on the strong wireless performance and the repositioning of the wireless business volume. Ralph?","Ralph de la Vega","Thank you, John and good afternoon everyone. It\u2019s great to be with you today. I\u2019ll start on Slide 7, as John said this was truly a remarkable quarter for our wireless business with results coming in better than expected. We\u2019ve been very successful in repositioning the business model and it\u2019s happening and break next speed.","The shift is in no-device-subsidy model is unmistakable, more and more customers are choosing the simplicity of Mobile Share Value plans and AT&T Next. This model shift is driving impressive results. Postpaid churn was a record low 0.86%, the best ever for AT&T and likely and industry best this quarter.","This customer loyalty help drive our largest postpaid subscriber gain in nearly five years more than a million postpaid net adds in the quarter including very strong smartphone net adds. The shift in Mobile Share Value and Next has been dramatic in transitioning our smartphone customer base. Half of our smartphone sales in the second quarter were on AT&T Next and nearly half of our smartphone subscriber base has moved to Mobile Share Value plans since we first introduced value plans in February.","Even better when customers do switch to Mobile Share they are moving to larger and larger data buckets. We now have more than 41 million connections across 15 million accounts on Mobile Share with half on plans of 10 gigabytes or higher. And the number on larger data plan continues to grow. As more and more customers move to usage-based data plans data use is increasing.","We\u2019re still seeing nearly 50% year-over-year data usage increase on smartphones and we continue to add more smartphones connected devices and tablets. We\u2019re also starting to see the NextWave of wireless growth Digital Life is gaining momentum and had its best net gain quarter. Connected car growth is accelerating with new models entering the market such as the Audi A3 as well as 10 GM models that will grow to 30 by the end of the year. These are in addition to those are already in the market such as Tesla, BMW and others. We feel these are incredibly good results in a time of transition. Let me give you more details starting with our strong postpaid net adds and churn on Slide 8.","The move to Mobile Share Value plan has really solidified our customer base and this is critically important, retaining our smartphone base is the basis for future growth. Postpaid churn was there an all time low and churn for Mobile Share and smartphone customers were even lower. That was even more remarkable in a noisy competitive environment.","This help to drive more than a million postpaid net adds with more than half of those being phone customers as significant improvement from the past several quarters. Overall, we had more than 600,000 total net adds and that includes prepaid declines due to the second quarter seasonal pressure and continued migration of session-based tablets to postpaid.","We also saw expected second quarter pressure from our Cricket integration. We expect this prepaid pressure will moderate in the third quarter and in fact we have already seen our prepaid trends improving. Branded tablet net adds for the quarter were 250,000 and that includes 366,000 postpaid tablet net adds in the quarter.","We also saw pressure in reseller and connected devices, as we transition of the old 2G network, all this drove total return higher even with our record low postpaid churn. We continue to grow our smartphone base including migrations, we added nearly 1.6 million in the quarter. We had more than 700,000 net adds in the quarter and more than 90% of our postpaid phone sales in the second quarter were smartphones.","Sales of LTE devices also continued at a strong clip which is great for both us and our subscribers. LTE devices provide the best customer experience well also be the most network efficient, almost two-thirds of our postpaid smartphone base now have LTE phones. You see the dramatic impact Mobile Share Value plans on churn and postpaid net adds.","Now let me show you the impact on the subsidy model and revenues. Those details begin on Slide 9. Total wireless revenues for quarter were up nearly 4% as revenues continue to shift to equipment from service. Equipment revenue growth was strong in the quarter up 45% but also we expect that service revenues were impacted. We also saw revenue pressure from promotional activity early in the quarter from a change in the recognition of revenue with the sales of phones through our agents due to the AT&T Next offering.","Together these two items are about a 200 basis point impact on total wireless growth. We\u2019re also seeing significant increases in the number of customers who bring their own devices. This is a good thing for us, as it takes all the subsidy expense out of our model and brings on a profitable customer.","We\u2019re continuing to see customers choosing Mobile Share Value plans in unprecedented numbers. In just five months about 24 million smartphones or about 44% of our postpaid smartphone base have moved up to subsidy model. That includes about 2 million subscribers on a limited data plans who chose to move to Mobile Share plans.","We now have less than 10 million subscribers on a limited plans; our lowest level in years. At the same time, customers who are ready to upgrade are increasingly turning to AT&T Next. More than half of our smartphone sales in the quarter are 3.1 million were on Next, as you can see on the pie chart on the left of the slide, we have about 7 million AT&T customers who are Next customers at the end of the quarter. But the total number of subscribers on non-subsidy plans is about 24 million.","This gives us a large number of subscribers who will move to AT&T Next when they buy a new device. By the end of the year, we expect the percentage of Next sales to increase considerably as customers begin to upgrade their phones. And in fact we are already seeing customers do this, virtually all of our pre-Next customers are choosing AT&T Next when they upgrade in our company-owned stores.","And we expect sales to increase with our agents and in national retail where we\u2019re just beginning to ramp up Next. The change in the device subsidy model is driving a shift in our wireless mix, but it is also driving higher value with improved churn and more sustainable margins.","I\u2019ll turn it back to John, so he can give you those financial details on Slide 10. John?","John Stephens","Thanks Ralph. Ralph talked about the great results we saw in wireless in the second quarter. Let me take just a minute dive deeper into the financial and customer value impacts. If you look at the overall customer value that shift away from the subsidy model is very positive. Churn plays a big role in this.","Take a look at the customer value illustration on the upper left of the Slide 10. With the year-over-year 16 basis point improvement in postpaid churn, the average life of each of our customers is extended by 18 months. With Mobile Share Value pricing servers ARPU is to drop on a comparable basis. But when you factor in the average life of a customer\u2019s lifetime service revenues actually increased and example percentage that have increased $400 per customer when you are AT&T with over 50 million phone customers. That\u2019s a real opportunity to generate great value.","So in short, the customer value increases with Next and this doesn\u2019t even take into account the reduction in equipment subsidy. Going to AT&T Next also takes way most if not all of the net subsidy cost. That\u2019s why can\u2019t just look at service ARPUs anymore to get a comprehensive view of our business.","Phone-only service ARPU is down for the quarter, but when you add in Next billings you get a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us each month. The average monthly Next billings for the equipment are about $27 per month, driving our phone-only ARPU higher with Next.","When this $27 per month is spread over the entire base it adds about $2 in ARPU per customer in the quarter. As the Next base rose, so will this impact on ARPU. We\u2019ve actually already seeing this. Service ARPU with Next improved throughout the second quarter and for June was more than $65, are almost $1 higher than the quarterly average as equipment purchases increased throughout the quarter.","Another benefit of moving off the subsidy model which is at the previous highs and lows of our margins become more stable. We did in this business a lot of time and we\u2019ve seen two big drivers to sales upgrades. That\u2019s a holiday season and the introduction of new devices. In the past we usually have mixed feelings about those events was great for sales, with that subsidy cost pressured margins and financial results.","Now with about half of our smartphone subscribers already are in non-subsidy plans and that number going up every day. We\u2019re feeling really pretty good about the position we are in. If you look at our expectations for the rest of the year, we anticipate service margins to be more than 40%, while postpaid phone-only ARPU with Next billings will continue to increase as more customers upgrade their phones.","Our wireless repositioning story is definitely work in progress, but it\u2019s definitely working. The benefits are clear, lower overall churn, higher postpaid net adds, customers buying larger buckets of data and a shift away from the unlimited plans.","First of all, customers like it, they like the clear and simple pricing and we feel really good about where we are and we\u2019re excited and look forward to the second half of the year. Those are our wireless highlight; I would now like to discuss our wireline business starting with consumer on Slide 11.","U-verse has been a solid and consistent story for us; we continue to see solid subscriber and revenue growth. This help drive 3% revenue growth in consumer, total U-verse revenues are now approaching a $15 billion annualized revenue stream and they are growing at about 25% year-over-year.","U-verse now represents 62% of consumer revenues. They had a 11.5 million broadband customers after adding almost 500,000 in the quarter. That\u2019s more than 70% of our total broadband base that compares to just 40% two years ago. We also added a 190,000 TV subscribers in the quarter, which gives us 5.9 million total U-verse TV customers.","The big factor in the success of U-verse is our ability to bundle. More than 97% are virtually all of our video customers had some kind of bundle with us. And two-thirds of our U-verse TV subscribers take three or four services with us. ARPU for U-verse triple play customers continues to be more than a $170 a month.","Now to drive growth while reducing churn, in fact triple play bundle customers has significantly lower churn than standalone customers. We see continued opportunity here, our market penetration stands around 20% for U-verse broadband and TV. But that penetration increases the longer we are in a market, plus this Project VIP expands our customer reach, we believe we can achieve much more.","We also continue to deploy GigaPower as part of our Project VIP build sales of our Ultra-fast broadband service have exceeded expectations at Austin and we\u2019ve announced our intention deploy in Dallas and North Carolina.","Now I\u2019m taking to our business wireline results on Slide 12. Wireline business continues to be a story of the economy and the shift to IP data and away from legacy services. Strategic business services, services such as VPN, Ethernet, Hosting and other advanced IP services grew by more than 13% in the quarter and more than 14% year-to-date. And now represent more than $9 billion annualized revenue stream.","And that now make up more than 27% of business wireline revenue and for the first time strategic business service revenues are now more than half of our total wireline business data revenues.","Overall wireline business revenues were down to 0.9%, service revenues were down a little more than 2% in the second quarter. But that\u2019s on track with recent trends and the slow economy. When you look at each of the business components that make up our wireline business, you\u2019ll see some different stories and different trends. Enterprise service revenues were actually up about 1% year-over-year.","And this was its fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth rate improvement and our enterprise channel continues to provide significant sales opportunities for our wireless services. Wholesale again was challenged by network proving of some of our wireless customers. And we also saw in the impact of our acquisition of the Leap this quarter as those previous external wholesale revenues now are internal to AT&T.","While our small business is benefiting from wireless bundles and continued U-verse broadband growth. The lack of new business formations is still impacting the business opportunity.","Now let\u2019s look at our margin story on Slide 13. You can see the margin impacts from changes in the wireless subsidy model and Project VIP on our margins. In the second quarter when adjusting for Leap integration expense wireless EBITDA service margin was up slightly to 42.6%. That\u2019s a strong performance especially when you consider our very strong postpaid and smartphone net adds in the quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA was $6.5 billion stable year-over-year, the total EBITDA margin was down due to the impact of the 24 million smartphones moving to Mobile Share Value pricing, some promotional activity we had in the first half of the year. And new business investments and things like Cricket and Digital Life.","For the quarter our adjusted consolidated margin was 17.7% compared to 19.1% in the year ago quarter. As Ralph said, the shift to Mobile Share plans ahead of equipment purchases pressure our results.","Wireline margins were down from a year ago, but essentially flat with first quarter levels. The decline in revenue from legacy services was part of the impact, but at the same time success-based video content cost retransmission price increases and expenses for project Agile and VIP also cause pressure.","For example overall content cost increases for more than double, the total increase of wireline operating expenses for the entire quarter. But this wireline pressure was partially offset by growth of consumer revenues gains in strategic business services and solid execution of cost initiatives.","We expect project Agile and are moved to software defined networks to provide margin help, project Agile drive efficiency and speed to market as we transform how the company organizes and operates all around our customers.","As we\u2019ve said before, we are reinvesting in savings at this point, we feel real opportunity to reduce cost through this effort. We expect run rate in savings in the $3 billion range by 2017.","Now let\u2019s move to cash flow, our summary is on Slide 14. In the first half of the year, cash from operations totaled nearly $17 billion and about $8.1 billion in the second quarter. Capital expenditures were up $11.8 billion for the six months and 16 for the quarter. Free cash flow before dividends was $5.1 billion year-to-date on track with full year guidance even with investments in Project VIP and our wireless customer base.","We did monetize $800 million of our Next receivables in the quarter and there continues to be great interest at additional sales. But even after that our net investment in customers increased by more than $1.5 billion during the year. So we expect to meet our free cash flow guidance even with the substantial working capital invested in AT&T Next customers. And net debt to adjusted EBITDA was at 1.71 as we maintain the best credit rating major U.S. telecom company.","In terms of cash, I think you know the story, dividend payments remain our first priority and year-to-date total $4.8 billion and we continue to be opportunistic with our share buyback program.","Our asset sales including Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil also strengthened our cash position and balance sheet. We ended the quarter with more than a $11 billion of cash about 4.6 that has already been used for debt redemption leaving more than 6 billion of cash on hand at the current time.","We have balance in flexibility to pay down more debt and position ourselves for the upcoming spectrum auctions and DIRECTV acquisition, while investing in the growth of our business. In fact I believe we\u2019re continuing to maximize our balance sheet efficiency. We expect another $3 billion of asset monetization by the end of the year, with the sale of our Connecticut wireline property and remaining proceeds from our Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil sale.","The DIRECTV transaction continues to move forward, Brazil\u2019s antitrust regulator has approved it without restrictions and we have completed the reviewing process at the state level without conditions, which included Arizona, Louisiana and Hawaii. We also received good news today when the Department of Labor\u2019s approval notice allowing us to fund our pension plans with the preferred equity interest in Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil was posted in the federal register website.","Now let me close with a quick summary and a recap of our full year 2014 expectations.","There continues to be a lot of moving parts in this quarter and throughout the remainder of the year. We\u2019re confident; we\u2019re heading in the right direction. We staked out our course in our plan for the year and we are confident that we are on the right track. First we expect consolidated revenue growth at the low end of the 5% range to define that, but said that, we will say that the range is, we define that range as 4.5% to 5.5% and expect the numbers of the AT&T Next upgrades to ramp substantially in the second half of the year powering that growth.","Second, we see stable consolidated margins as we\u2019ve begun to realize greater benefits, as more customers shift away from the subsidy model to the back-half of the year. We continue to expect adjusted EPS in a low end of the mid-single digit range even with the pressure from Leap integration cost and loss of the Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil equity income. We\u2019re still targeting capital spending in $21 billion range even as we accelerated investment in the first half of the year. And we expect free cash flow in the $11 billion range even with strong AT&T Next sales.","I now will turn it back to Susan to take your questions.","Susan Johnson","Thank you, John. Nick I\u2019m going to return the call back to you for instructions for our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies","Hey guys thanks. Maybe just to comment on the churn side, obviously you\u2019re getting the benefit probably it\u2019s somewhat due to lower pricing points, how do we get more confident that this is going to be a long-term benefit? And then just secondarily on the Leap side, how many of those customers if any we\u2019re able to migrate on the postpaid platform? Thanks.","John Stephens","Ralph do you want to take the question?","Ralph de la Vega","Yes, let me comment a little bit on that, Mike when John was going over the chart he was explaining just the extension that we see in the customer life time value, when you take our overall churn going from 1.02 to 0.086. The thing that is really encouraging to me is that that is the total average for postpaid. When you look at smartphones, you see a similar change and what is driving the overall churn down our smartphones. And then when you look at smartphones on Mobile Share Value plans and Next they are even lower. So what we\u2019re doing is working, I\u2019ll give you one proof point that was really encouraging to me in the second quarter.","In the second quarter typically churn for our company goes up in May and June compared to April. What we saw in this quarter was a change in the trend, so both May and June were actually lower in churn than April despite all the competitive activity that\u2019s going on. So we feel very certain that as more and more customers sign up to Mobile Share Value plans and Next it solidifies our scores in terms of churn and we\u2019re seeing the same thing in our net promoter scores. Our net promoter scores for customers who are in Mobile Share Value plans compared to family talk for example are twice the number.","So every indication we have from our customers is that these are sustainable and sustainable even during some pretty intense competitive activities as we always see in the wireless business. Now you are asking about Cricket, let me give you a quick update on Cricket. As you know, we actually launched Cricket on a nationwide basis, the new Cricket on the 19th of May. So that was relatively short, but I\u2019m very pleased with what happened we successfully converted both the AIO brand the old Cricket brand to the new Cricket brand. We rebranded the stores and we started converting customers at rates that we expect that from the old CDMA network that LeapPad to our GSM network and Mike the results are really, really encouraging. As you know that network covers 97% of the customers, it doesn\u2019t include roaming. But what we\u2019re seeing is net promoter scores again of Cricket customers improving month after month as they get the sample, the GSM network compared to their old CDMA network.","And so the migration are on schedule and we\u2019re seeing improving trends in terms of the net additions since we completed the conversion. In fact if you look at the second quarter, Cricket numbers compared to a year ago, we have reduced the factors (ph) by one-third. Just in the first quarter alone and what we\u2019re seeing in July is an improving trend that I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll continue throughout the year. Again as customers sample this great network that they have now that is a nationwide network as we move those customers over, we are seeing lower churn.","So, we feel really good about what we did with Cricket and we\u2019re really excited about the results we\u2019re seeing with Mobile Share Value plans and Next in driving lower churn.","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies","Hey Ralph I\u2019m sorry just for the clarification on the Leap migration, did you get any benefit on the postpaid side from customers from Leap?","Ralph de la Vega","No not any significant improvement no Mike there was no \u2013 no significant movement from prepaid to postpaid in our case.","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies","Great that\u2019s helpful. Thanks Ralph.","John Stephens","Thanks Mike.","Susan Johnson","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","Okay thanks guys. Maybe first just a follow-up to Mike\u2019s question for Ralph and then another one for John. Ralph is there any, I like that where you are going with the churn, is there any risk that churn could start to move up within the Next phase once the \u2013 maybe the pre-Next people that you\u2019ve moved over they are do for handset and we\u2019re probably looking the new iPhone later this year. We start to see the bill sort of, they\u2019ve already seen the bill were down start to see it go back up again and maybe talk about your experience there? And then maybe for John, in your prepared remarks at the beginning of the call, you talked about some stronger growth and stronger trends in the second half. Is it just equipment driven or can you give us a little more detail on what some of those trends are and to the point where we have an eye when we will start to see service revenue trends start to churn?","Ralph de la Vega","John on your comment about what happens as people upgrade to Next as we have mentioned in my comments, we\u2019re already seeing about half of our smartphone sales go on Next and that\u2019s the same experience that you are referring to and those customers when we sample them their net promoter scores are high. So we are not seeing any concerns at this point and I think that once they get on Next they are going to be able to get the new smartphone every year or every 18 months depending on the plans that they select. So we feel really good so far, but everything we have seen from the plans no major concerns.","John Stephens","John specifically the customers that we allow to go up on the Mobile Share Value plans early and then it\u2019s subsequently come in. We\u2019ve seen great stay on rates over 90% of the company-owned stores where they\u2019ve stayed on the Next program. So they like it, they really seem to be very sticky. So we feel good about where it\u2019s going, but we\u2019re going to watch closely.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","Got you.","John Stephens","With regard to the stronger trends there is a couple of things that are just really important, one when you add a million customers on the quarter and we added total change was 1.6 million smartphones that was a conversion of about 900,000 feature phones to smartphones. And then there was net adds postpaid smartphone net adds of 700,000. So that\u2019s a really significant number, we had another good quarter of tablets, about 350,000. But we really had great performance on our smartphone net adds. So that gives us confidence in generally more revenue.","Additionally we are seeing people take insurance, almost sort of 50% clip on our Next sales. So that\u2019s going to help and we continue to find satisfaction of those insurance rates anywhere from $7 to $10 a month. We see really good results there. Third, we\u2019re seeing people buy bigger buckets as we mentioned. I think we mentioned Ralph mentioned that there was 14 million or so Mobile Share Value accounts, over half or about half of those are taking 10 Gig or better.","And with the new phones coming up people are using more data, we continue to see usage growth which is going to drive revenue growth. All of those things are what give us confident in what we see and why we believe there is going to be real opportunity for improving revenue trends.","Lastly, there are much so we think the Next take rate and especially with the opportunity for maybe some new devices in the holiday season will also generate some improvement in our numbers. So feel really good about kind of the whole package not just the equipment story.","Ralph de la Vega","John one other thing that I think we both feel good about is if you look at those larger data buckets we mentioned that about half of our base is on buckets that are 10 gigs or higher. But if you look at actually as customers add lines to their Mobile Share Value plans, we\u2019re seeing that number that are selecting the 10 gig or higher plan to be 70%. So we got about half the base, but on the \u2013 the ones that are getting added the take rates are even significantly higher.","So it gives us great encouragement and as you look at Mobile Share and Next, number one is producing lower churn and number of customer life times. Number two, it\u2019s actually reducing our subsidies and number three, is resulting in these large data bucket purchases that we know will increase ARPU as we define it now could be phone-only ARPU plus Next billings. Those are expected to increase for the remainder of the year. So we feel really good the strategy is working and it\u2019s evident is intending the results.","John Stephens","John let me give one other thing that I\u2019m sure (indiscernible) about 200 basis point pressure in the wireless margin, wireless revenue growth this quarter and it has to do with, we\u2019re now selling our \u2013 our Next program through our agents. And so and sort of recognizing the revenue when we deliver to the agent, we recognize the revenue when they deliver to the customer and so that delayed and have the impact on revenue score. By the end of the year, we think we\u2019ll get that back especially in the holiday season where the inventories are traditionally low.","In addition, we had some early on in the quarter; we had some pressure from some promotional activities, as you know we really have a round of significant promotional activities since the April timeframe. So we think we\u2019ve got most of that pressure buying this. When you put those two things together, we have a better starting point that we may appear based on our \u2013 on the appropriately reported results.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","Got it. Okay thanks for the detail guys.","John Stephens","Thanks.","Susan Johnson","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse.","Joe Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi thanks for taking the question. Ralph can you give us the sense for the exit rate for churn at the end of the quarter? And then John you just mentioned the promotional activity, do you have an idea of how much of the sub-growth was actually driven by the promotional activity we saw early on in the quarter?","Ralph de la Vega","First on the churn in the quarter, as I mentioned earlier what is really encouraging is that we saw both May and June be lower than our postpaid churn in April and usually is the reverse. So it says that that the plans that we have put in place are bending the curve in the right direction, trending to lower churn in the back-half of the quarter as suppose to being higher which is traditionally what we have seen in mobility. So it is very encouraging and we\u2019re seeing very good churn levels at this point. So, I think anything that will drive it in a different direction.","John Stephens","We \u2013 shall we bolster in the whole operation, we are very optimistic about churn continuing to improve kind of an year-over-year basis compared to the historical levels. So we feel really good about that. With regard to the net adds we have, we really haven\u2019t had any significant promotional programs in a fact in May or June, we had some in March and some of the cost of those were appropriate carryforward when the customers are earning those discounts were actually on April. So we really didn\u2019t see much in the way of significant customer change with regard to that. We may have seen some of that benefit in March, but I will tell you it seems like in the new environment we and a lot of our competitors were very active in that. And quite frankly we were not; we were not as active as others.","Ralph de la Vega","By the way Joe one other point of reference, the 0.86% churn number as far as I know if you go back and look at the history of wireless is the second lowest churn ever reported by a company in the history of wireless and the one that was lower than that was only two basis points lower two years ago. So not only is at the lowest were AT&T, but some of the lowest churns ever reported by any company in wireless.","John Stephens","Obviously Joe we feel real good about where we are and how we\u2019re performing and the team is doing great job.","Joe Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay guys thanks.","Susan Johnson","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks a lot, good evening. John on capital spending you reiterated the $21 billion that implies about a 20% drop second half versus first half and I know there has been a lot of talk in the market around the CapEx freezes and so forth. So perhaps you could just provide a little clarity about how you are going to get there and what impact that has on wireless or wireline? And then for Ralph, I think in the June release you said about one half of customers would be on no-device plans by mid-year and two-thirds by the end of the year. I think you hit 44%, so as we go into Q3 and Q4 you\u2019re still targeting about two-thirds number or are we coming in a little bit lower than that? Thanks.","Ralph de la Vega","Let me answer the last one first Simon, and yes that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re targeting. What we have seen Simon is first of all we started with our company-owned retail stores and it was a huge smash hit. Then we brought in our dealers and they have been a huge smash hit, almost exactly the same performance that we saw in our company-owned retails, which are much higher than the averages that we are reporting. Now we\u2019re bringing national retails, these are national retail agents that have not sold Next up to this point, will be coming online. And so we expect those to come online in the third and fourth quarters further increasing the rates. So we\u2019re fairly confident that you\u2019re going to see an increase from the rates that we reported in the second quarter.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Perfect, okay.","John Stephens","Simon with regard to the CapEx story as we did reiterate that we will be in a $21 billion range and we\u2019re going to stay with that. With regard to the commentary on over about a billion dollar spend in the first six months; I guess I\u2019m more aware of the commentary that the talk that many have had that we had changed our spending patterns based on those numbers. It would seem that some people are misinformed maybe have been more about the spread or the hearing amongst our \u2013 amongst our spend. If you\u2019re thinking about how we\u2019re going to get down to the $21 billion, I would suggest this we are very near complete with our $300 million LTE build. And in fact we expect to complete that later this summer. So most of the spending for that and much of spending for the network intensification has been already placed. We just need to go out and utilize and put those assets in the services, which we have to do.","Secondly, we\u2019ve done a lot of other of our systems and other corporate work with regard to laying out fiber and other things that we expect will moderate in the second half of the year and focus more on the utilization of assets that we placed in service. So, certainly it will be a challenge and be a lot of work. We feel good about the fact that we can stand at $21 billion range.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Susan Johnson","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays","Thank you very much and good afternoon folks.","John Stephens","Good afternoon.","Ralph de la Vega","Good afternoon","Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays","Earlier this quarter you folks mentioned that you\u2019ve been able to secure some financing for your handset receivables which I believe Randall had alluded to as an opportunity during your most recent analyst event. Now that we\u2019ve seen a couple of quarters with the Next program, do you see further opportunities to finance some of these receivables? And then secondly there has also been a lot of chatter around the possibility of extending bonus depreciation, John the scenario that you\u2019ve spent a decent amount of time looking at. But love to hear thoughts around where you think legislation is and where it ultimately shakes out and the potential opportunity here with respect to your sort of cash flow positioning?","John Stephens","Sounds great, we are let me turn it Amir, first of all Citi was our lead bank in the Next monetization transaction that we completed in June. We received about $800 million in cash from the monetization of some of our Next accounts receivables. With that being said, we still had a net investment and are customers of $1.5 billion more than $1.5 billion actually from January 1st to June 30th. What we learn from that is, it wasn\u2019t just Citi, but it was a number of other banks stepped up and we\u2019re interested in joining in the contortion to buy those receivables there was plenty of demand.","The financing costs were extremely low, very, very attractive and the terms and conditions were very attractive. So we went ahead and did it, we also, we are also very pleased with the fact that the collection of major banks established the real validity and the real value of those receivables. And we believe there continues to be great demand in fact all the participants and that have come back to us and said and asked us. So we\u2019ll get further opportunities that we believe that\u2019s one other reasons why I feel comfortable are, cash flow guidance for the year in the sense that we have that one of those levers is the monetization process. So it gives us great comfort.","Second piece is we\u2019re optimistic on bonus depreciation giving at least extended, there has been a number of builds out there, some to make it permanent others to extend it. There seems to be a general sense that the extenders will get completed and approved, but maybe not until later this year. That would be a very good thing for capital intensive industry like us and help us continue to make significant investments in our network. The biggest cash impact for us would be in 2015. We would certainly help 2014, but the biggest cash impact for us would be in 2015, because of some of the new answers of tax rules.","And we\u2019re we follow carefully and we\u2019re looking, we\u2019re looking for every opportunity to promote that legislation.","Susan Johnson","Next question.","Operator","That comes from Mike Rollinswtih with Citi Investment and Research.","John Stephens","Hello mike.","Mike Rollinswtih \u2013 Citi Investment and Research","Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of follow-up if I could please. I think last quarter you mentioned what the installment net receivables were at the end of the quarter, I was wondering if you can give us an update there? And then secondly, if I can just go back to the churn improvement that you saw during the quarter, how should we think about who specifically the improvement came from, in other words did it come from customers that were had a contract and were able to churn but took advantage of the no-sub Mobile Share Value. Was it customers earlier in their life that may have churn prematurely or you were able to capture a benefit from this, a way to think about the segments of customers were you saw that churn savings? Thanks.","John Stephens","I think the Mike couple of things, one I think the biggest churn improvements we saw over are quite frankly in smartphones in the overall category of smartphones where the smartphone churn is lower than that 0.86 postpaid churn we saw. Secondly, the customers who participate in our Mobile Share Value plan as they are churn is also lower than the 0.86%. So as those plans grow and as our smartphone, 80% smartphone base continues to go to flow share of 92% you can understand why we are optimistic about further kind of churn improvement and the opportunity we continue this good run we\u2019re having.","Ralph de la Vega","Yes, Mike let me add a little more color to that, like John said when you compare the 1.02 churn to 0.86 that extends the life of a customer by a year and a half. If you do the same analysis not on the total base, but on smartphones that life extension goes to 2.5 years. The churn difference is actually greater if you compare smartphones on the same basis. So you extend the life of the customer by 2.5 years and then if you take smartphone who will have Mobile Share Value and Next you extend that even further than that.","These results are early on, but are really encouraging and it\u2019s basically says that customers who choose Mobile Share Value and Next on smartphones are driving this thing down to really low levels. And by the way the numbers that we\u2019re quoting on churn are of course total churn there is some involuntary churn. So the voluntary churn numbers are actually even lower than the ones that we have just published.","John Stephens","Mike, I will add to the sort of the installment sales, I would tell you it\u2019s a mix bag of numbers I don\u2019t want to, make sure I don\u2019t direct you to something one specific line of the financial statements. But if you look at our accounts receivable and then you add in our long-term assets that relate to Next, because some of the receivables are over 12 months. And then you look at the deferred purchase price from the city organization to get a sense where in the area of $3.2 billion of total receivables and that\u2019s after taking into account or reducing it for the \u2013 for the monetization we did. We will disclose this information in 10-Q. So I\u2019ll give you that back to say we will make sure we \u2013 as we have in the first quarter to disclose that.","Susan Johnson","Next question.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan","Hey guys, thanks. I guess two quick ones, first the buyback pace is a little slower, should we think of that as sort of the new run rate given the DTV transaction out there and I know you said opportunistic, but that\u2019s I mean this at this level give or take? And then second speaking of DTV, there are lot of opportunities in Latin America AMX made some assets, the Brazil auction is coming up, would you anticipate being involved in anything in Latin America between now and the close of the DTV deal or in the future, or do you think of DTV sort of it is as it is for a while? Thanks.","Ralph de la Vega","Phil real quick on the buyback, you\u2019re absolutely right the pace is moderated and certainly we take into consideration all factors the DTV deal, our CapEx spending, quite frankly our investment and our customers with Next. So I must stick with the guidance we gave before that, we are going to continue to be opportunistic, but you\u2019re absolutely right that the pace has moderated cash compared to last year.","With regard to any transactions other than the comments I have made on the DTV, we really wouldn\u2019t want to speculate on any or comment on any speculation. So we were just \u2013 we were just really focused on continuing to work with the regulatory agencies in getting the DTV transaction approved and moving forward that and we still, we\u2019re more excited about it and more confident that\u2019s the right thing to do than ever and so we want to push it forward.","John Stephens","Thank you.","Susan Johnson","And Nick, I think we\u2019re going to call for the last question.","Operator","Thank you. The last question will come from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer.","Timothy Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thanks guys. I think last quarter you gave the normalized ARPU and maybe I missed at this quarter, if you normalize for the sale of the equipment. And maybe I know you have channel sales and a few other moving parts. Can you give us what your best guess and what the normalized revenue growth was for the quarter? And then lastly, I know you said customers are bring their own, more of their own devices, but are you seeing customers kind of trade down to lower cost devices with the next plan now that they have to kind of pay it for their own? Thanks.","John Stephens","So, Tim a couple of things if you look on Slide 10 that we showed there, you can see that the ARPU plus the Next billings was about 64 little bit over $64, $64.35 that compares to last year $67 so it\u2019s down around the 4%, 4.5% range. Secondly I would tell you that if you look at that as of the month of June as opposed to the average for the quarter that\u2019s about a dollar higher. And so what we are seeing is an expectation that through the rest of this year you will see the ARPU plus those Next billings definitely increase and we\u2019ll be, we\u2019re very optimistic about the opportunity to get back on track for growth. Ralph take the question.","Ralph de la Vega","Yes, and Tim what we\u2019re seeing today in terms of bring your own devices, devices that are typically hand me downs. But we\u2019re very excited, because we see a new wave of low cost smartphones where our customers can outright purchase the device for a very low cost and in essence bringing their own device by paying cash. And the new line up of smartphones that we\u2019ll have in the second half will have several options of good looking devices, very functional, large screen at lower cost that will allow a customer to get our best price by a very simple purchase of the device. So we think that the BYOD will probably increase as the year goes on.","John Stephens","Well, for the quarter Tim our BYOD units were about three times or more than three times what they were last year. But the encouraging win for us is about three quarter or more of those, went on accounts under contract. And so the BYOD there is a required contract when they bring them put them out of the account that has a contract we feel real good about the sustainability of those and quite frankly as Ralph mentioned the fact there is no-subsidy cost those makes it really a financially attractive situation.","As we close, I want to thank you all for being with us this afternoon. We\u2019ve made significant progress in transforming our business for growth in the second quarter and in particular with repositioning our wireless business model. Postpaid net adds were very strong. Specifically smartphones net adds were very strong and we had our best ever postpaid churn. And we\u2019ve made great strides in moving smartphone subscribers off the subsidy model.","We feel really good about our current momentum heading into the back-half of the year and believe even stronger that our discussions to go with this model was appropriate. Thanks again for the call and as always thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a great evening. Good night.","Operator","With that ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.

(Operator Instructions) Also as a reminder, today\u2019s teleconference is being recorded.","And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Susan Johnson. Please go ahead.","","Susan Johnson","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. It\u2019s great to have you with us today. I am Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Stephens, AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Randall will discuss our 2013 highlights and then close with a strategic perspective in 2014 outlook and John will cover our results. Then we will follow up with questions and answers.","Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, that\u2019s www.att.com\/investor.relations. Of course, I need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3. This presentation and comments may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks. Results may differ materially. Further details are on our SEC filings and on AT&T\u2019s website.","I would now like to turn the call over to AT&T\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Randall Stephenson. Randall?","","Randall Stephenson","Thanks, Susan and good afternoon everyone and Happy New Year. 2013 was an interesting year for the industry and I would suggest you it\u2019s probably a formative year. We saw all competitors take out new positions. We saw most of the players significantly changed the value proposition for their customers. And with smartphone penetration beginning to hit some impressive levels, we have seen new business models emerge around LTE in the cloud and our case that includes things like connected homes, connected cars, video and mobile business solutions.","So from our view, the most important development that we are seeing is that the entire U.S. telecom industry is investing aggressively in advanced networks. Today in the U.S., four national carriers and dozens of regional providers are building out LTE and you just don\u2019t see that happening anywhere else in the world. The industry is now competing on price, customer service, technological innovation, and most importantly, network coverage and quality. And we think this speaks volumes about where the country\u2019s public policy has landed concerning spectrum and the importance of light touch regulation. We think it\u2019s very, very important to maintain that approach as we move forward. Because of these things, the industry is helping and it is attracting a lot of investment.","So let me give you a few highlights and then what I am going to do is turn it over to John and he will take you through the details of the 4Q. First, our revenue and EPS growth finished right on track with our guidance. Cash generation was strong both from operations and from the monetization of non-strategic assets. For the full year, we invested $25 billion in CapEx and spectrum and then returned another $23 billion to shareowners through our dividend and share buyback programs.","We ended the year with really high-quality credit metrics and our pension plan funding is in great shape. And 2013 was our first year for Project VIP and we are well ahead of schedule across the board. LTE deployment, U-verse expansion and fiber to the business, I would tell you, was a home run \u2013 as a home run year by our Network Operations Group. In terms of LTE coverage, we said we get LTE to 300 million people by the end of \u201814. We are already closing in on that number. We expect to be essentially done by summer.","John is going to give you the details with growth on these platforms was very strong. Mobile data is now a $23 billion revenue stream and is growing at 17%. U-verse is more than $13 billion of annualized revenues and is growing at 28%. Strategic business services are now at $9 billion at a run-rate and the growth ramp throughout 2013 and it hit 17% in the fourth quarter we expect this growth rate to step up again this year. We have rolled out a number of new technology solutions. We\u2019re adding terrific success with our AT&T net bond service. This combines our VPN network of cloud services from companies like IBM and Microsoft. What it does is it gives customers a secured connection to the cloud that they can\u2019t get on the public internet. Our mobile business solutions continue to scale, digital life and connected car were off to a strong starts and we\u2019re very enthusiastic about no contract wireless. We expect the Leap acquisition to close by into the first quarter and we\u2019re convinced that putting the Cricket brand on top of the AT&T network is going to shape things up in this space.","So if we go to slide 5, a year ago I told the team that 2013 would be the year of the network for us and that turned out to be an understatement. Today our network is best in class. We come out on top in all sorts of third party test for network quality and speed. In fact in a broad study of overall performance and that was done by RootMetrics we\u2019re head and shoulders about the field.","The chart on slide 5 shows you how we stack up and we think it's telling. We\u2019re in a dead heat with Verizon for lowest to drop calls well under 1% and our other national competitors are at twice the drop call rate or more. That\u2019s the reason we posted record low fourth quarter postpaid churn.","At slide 6, you see our network puts us in a great position for what we think is the industry\u2019s next growth wave. There is a lot of talk about the connected world ahead very different estimates on how fast it develops but I think we\u2019re all going to agree that it's a big opportunity and when you combine these pervasive, superfast LTE networks with the cloud it changes everything. It changes every industry, every aspect of our society and the economy and for this industry it means we\u2019re moving past the era of smartphone wars to rethink on how we work, how we conduct commerce, how we learn and manage our healthy and so much more. In fact the visual slide 6 captures most of what\u2019s taking place. It starts with the ultra-fast connectivity to the cloud, the smartphones are quickly becoming the remote control for disconnected world and the pace of innovation is accelerating and this explains why we\u2019re being so aggressive at Project VIP and with initiatives like our U-verse 1 Gig launch down in Austin. These things give us the ability to drive innovation and then lead in the next ways of growth and so with that I want to turn it over to John to take you through the results.","","John Stephens","Thanks Randall and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with our consolidating financial summary which is on slide 7. As Randall said 2013 was a solid year for our financial results. We grew consolidated revenues by almost 2% thanks to strong growth in wireless, U-verse and strategic business services. Consolidated margins were stable even with Project VIP expenses and record annual smartphone sales and we grew adjusted earnings per share by 8.2% for the year. Looking at the fourth quarter we finished the year with an exceptionally strong earnings per share performance. Reported EPS was a $1.31, however when you exclude onetime adjustments earnings per share for the quarter was $0.53 a 20% increase from a year ago. Adjustments include an $0.89 gain from the year-end mark to market change for our benefit plans, the gain was driven by an increase in the discount rate as well as strong performance of our Benefit Plan Investments and a $0.02 gain from the sales of Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil shares was also one of the adjustments.","We also saw $0.07 of pressure from cost associated with an early debt repayment and a $0.06 charge for cost associated with employee retirement specifically an early retirement program as Randall mentioned. Our solid cash flow and strong balance sheet also allowed us to be aggressive with our share buybacks. We repurchased more than 366 million shares for the year returning nearly $23 billion to the shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And since we began our buyback program at the beginning of 2012 we have bought back 737 million shares or about 12% of our outstanding shares.","All in all, we turn in a very strong financial performance for the quarter and for the year.","Now, let\u2019s look at our operational performance for the quarter starting with wireless. Revenue and ARPU are on Slide 8. Strong wireless revenue growth was driven by the network strength and by data-hungry smartphones and tablets. Data is now a $23 billion annualized revenue stream and it\u2019s continuing to grow growing at nearly 17%. That helped drive 4.8% service revenue growth and total wireless revenues were up 4.5%. Postpaid ARPU growth was strong. For the 20th consecutive quarter, we saw total postpaid ARPU growth as a record unmatched in the industry. And our postpaid phone-only ARPU increased by 3.9%. And that\u2019s growing up with higher base than anyone else. We did have adjustments in the quarter that bring the run-rate closer to 3.7%, but either way, a very impressive performance. Our phone-only ARPU includes smartphones, but also includes our low ARPU feature phones and wireless home phones, which make this growth even more impressive.","Now, let\u2019s move to net ads and churns, the details are on Slide 9. Our churn story is nothing short of exceptional. In a quarter, where we saw increased competitive activity, strong seasonal promotions and competitive offers targeting our postpaid base, we turned in our lowest ever fourth quarter postpaid churn, a record of 1.11%. We are very proud of that. This helped drive a solid quarter of postpaid gains with almost 600,000 net adds, including nearly 300,000 smartphone subscribers. And overall, we added more than 0.5 million branded smartphones in the quarter both postpaid and prepaid. We also added about 440,000 branded tablets as well. Network coverage and quality is the top reason customers choose AT&T and thanks to the high-performance of our 4G LTE networks. We have been very successful in attracting and keeping high-value postpaid customers. We are also taking steps to address the more value conscious customer. Competition for these customers is intense, but our network gives us an important advantage.","On the postpaid side, we have several initiatives underway, including new mobile share value plans and other targeted promotions. In prepaid, we have made steady progress in adding smartphone subscribers. In the fourth quarter alone, we added more than 230,000 prepaid smartphones to our network that gives us a base more than 2 million prepaid smartphones. And ARPU for these customers is more than 70% higher than our non-smartphone prepaid base. Once the lead transaction is approved, we will be an even better option for value conscious consumers. We believe the cricket brand on our network will be a great combination.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at our growing smartphone base. Those details are on Slide 10. Smartphones continue to take a bigger share of our phone sales, a record 93% of our postpaid phone sales were smartphones in the fourth quarter. That increases our postpaid smartphone base by 1.2 million. For the full year, our postpaid smartphone base grew by nearly 5 million subscribers. Overall, 77% of our postpaid phone base are on smartphones that compares to about 70% a year ago. Smartphone sales were strong $7.9 million in the quarter and data usage per smartphones continued to rise increasing by more than 50% year-over-year. We haven\u2019t seen an incredible response to AT&T Next, especially when we introduced the new mobile share value plans and sales improved throughout the quarter. Overall, more than 15% of all smartphone sales during the quarter or AT&T Next sales with the sales percentage in company-owned stores much higher. These strong sales reinforce our belief that focusing on what the customer wants is the right move whether it's a new device every year or the ability to take advantage of bring your own device service plans we need to continue to focus on the customer. AT&T Next did impact our cash flows since we\u2019re financing the handset but that\u2019s all right we know these customers and we know their credit profile. Overall this program is a great value for both our customers and us.","In the quarter we reached 7.1 million of mobile share accounts those accounts include more than 21 million postpaid subscribers or about 3 subscribers per account. Take rates on a high-tier data plans for both mobile share and pure data customers continue to be strong. In the last year the percentage of customers on those plans is nearly doubled growing from 13% to now 24% with about a third of the mobile share customers on plans of 10 gigabits or higher. At the same time mobile share value plans are attracting customers who may not need such large data buckets.","The new plans offer customers more savings and provide no annual service contract options giving our existing and new customers even greater choice. Now let\u2019s talk about wireless margins both details are on slide 11. Subscribe by taking a look at the full year. For 2013 our wireless EBITDA service margin was 41.3% that is a 170 basis point increase from a year ago even though we sold more smartphones during the year. There are a number of reasons for this improvement, revenue growth (indiscernible) throughout the year thanks to our expanding smartphone base and increasing data usage.","Second the strength of our network makes the difference, we\u2019re seeing outstanding speed and reliability performance and great efficiencies as more and more customers upgrade their LTE devices more than half of our smartphone base are now on LTE capable devices. Our new upgrade policy also added a positive impact on margins as it's strong AT&T Next sales.","In the fourth quarter wireless EBITDA was nearly $6 billion an impressive 35% increase over last year and wireless EBITDA service margin was 37.4% also much higher than a year ago. When you look at the full picture this was a very strong wireless quarter for us from churn to smartphone sales to margins to network performance, these solid results in a hotly competitive environment gives us confidence as we look ahead.","Now let me turn to our wireline story starting on slide 12. U-verse finished the year just as it started with strong subscriber gains increasing penetration and growing revenue. In fact U-verse helped drive consumer revenue growth of nearly 3% in the fourth quarter. U-verse continued it's record of strong high speed broadband gains. We added 630,000 U-verse broadband subscribes in the fourth quarter and 2.7 million during the year. U-verse now represents more than 60% on a total broadband base. These subscribers not only have a higher ARPU but churn is significantly lower as well.","We believe we have had a tipping point with U-verse broadband with the growing base of U-verse subscribers we feel confident that we can grow broadband subscribers even stronger this coming year. We also continue to excel in video. Well some companies are excited about actually gaining customers we added almost 200,000 subscribers in the quarter and nearly 1 million for the year plus we had our lowest TV churn ever in the fourth quarter. That tells us that customers not only want U-verse but they stay with us once they get it. But we expect to maintain this momentum. We continue to add new features such as TV everywhere which allows customers to view programming on smartphones and tablets inside their home and out and increased broadband speeds nearly 2\/3rds of the U-verse TV footprint can now get speeds upto 45 megabits per second. U-verse is now a $13 billion annualized revenue stream growing at 28% year-over-year and makes up 57% of our total consumer revenues. U-verse was a solid story from start to finish during 2013 and we expect that to continue as we expand U-verse coverage with Project VIP.","Now, let\u2019s move to wireline business, which you can see on Slide 13. First, let\u2019s start with some of the really good news. Strategic business service continues to be a bigger part of business services. Those service products such as VPN, Ethernet, cloud, hosting and other advanced IT services now make up more than 25% of business wireline and growth is accelerating up more than 17% year-over-year. We continue to see U-verse high-speed broadband growing in the business space. Increasing speeds and broader coverage open the door to new growth opportunities with small and medium-sized customers. We are also seeing increasing momentum in cloud and integrated service offerings. We are one of the top cloud providers in the world and adding scale. For example, we already have more than an exabyte of virtualized storage. Much of this is driven by steps we are taking to move our own business processes to the cloud. Our goal is to be an entirely cloud-based enterprise within the next three to five years.","Our own IT operations are probably the most aggressive cloud operations around. So we are just selling cloud applications. We are customers. We are users as well that helps focus us on developing new cloud-based products, such as NetBond. NetBond helps our customers safeguard their information by extending their virtual private networks into the cloud, which functions like a normal VPN site and keeps data separate from other users\u2019 traffic. And NetBond reduces latency by up to 50%, which means that businesses have access to the data almost instantly. We believe NetBond will drive even more growth.","We already are the VPN market leader with a multi-billion dollar annual business and we had our best fourth quarter VPN growth in years. These growth products help transform our revenue mix, but we still saw lower revenues in the quarter. Total revenues were down 3.4% versus the year earlier quarter and we are essentially flat sequentially. Business service revenues declined 2.4% year-over-year. Behind all of this are the overall economic trends. The outlook is still uncertain. Customers are still delaying buying decisions. Business starts lag to slightly better than a year ago. And unemployment is slowly improving. The labor force participation is the lowest that\u2019s been in more than 30 years. It\u2019s still a slow market, but we are hopeful that we will see an improving economy to get this part of the company growing again.","Now, let\u2019s look at consolidated and wireline margins on Slide 14. Even with Project VIP expenses, U-verse gains and record-breaking annual smartphone sales, consolidated margins remained relatively stable. Wireless margin improvements help offset this pressure. For the year, our adjusted consolidated margin was 18% compared to 18.2% last year. This pressure in wireline was expected. Much of it is tied to Project VIP and other success-based initiatives. We had almost 1 million new U-verse TV subscribers and they were trailing expenses from VIP investments and depreciation expenses were also higher.","We continue to take steps on the cost-cutting side as well. This includes the introduction of project Agile. Project Agile is a major new initiative that is transforming how the company organizes and operates around customers to deliver a best-in-class customer experience as an all IP, all mobile and all cloud services company. You see considerable opportunity to reduce cost through simplifying processes, standardizing platforms and making our customer interactions effortless and efficient. Randall will talk more about this initiative in just a few moments.","Now, let\u2019s move to cash flow. Our summary is on Slide 15. In 2013, cash from operations totaled nearly $35 billion. Capital expenditures were 21.2 billion as we deployed Project VIP and free cash flow before dividends was 13.6 billion. This was impacted somewhat by the tremendous success of AT&T next. We also have been very opportunistic in monetizing some of our assets this includes the tower transaction Crown Castle, sales of some of our Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil shares and sales of some of our real estate assets. These items generated $7 billion in cash for the year and nearly 6 billion in additional cash in the fourth quarter alone.","All this and free cash flow generated about $20 billion in cash during the year and strengthened our cash position. Our balance sheet remains solid, net debt (indiscernible) during the year however our average effective interest rate is down compared to last year thanks to debt refinancing early repayments to debt and at historically low interest rate and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio 1.73 is well below our 1.8 target and down from the third quarter even with our Project VIP investments.","In addition to investing in our business we also return substantial value to shareholders for the year. We repurchased about 366 million shares for around $13 billion. We make dividend payments for the year totaling nearly $10 billion. This makes our total return to shareholders for the year by at $23 billion and in the last two years we returned more than $45 billion a record unmatched in the industry.","Now before I hand it back to Randall let\u2019s take a quick look on how we delivered on 2013 guidance that\u2019s on slide 16. So how did we do for the year? On adjusted basis we expected upper single digit EPS growth, continued revenue growth, did wireless and consumer wireline and stable consolidated margins and that\u2019s what we delivered. We set out ambitious Project VIP targets increased them during the year and still came in ahead of forecast. We\u2019re also excited about the Leap acquisition and how we will support our Project VIP deployment. Once the deal is closed we will take a look at how it will impact our cell sites bill plans and densification initiatives.","We continue to generate cash both through asset monetization\u2019s and free cash flow. We also took several steps to manage our debt helping reduce the cost of debt even as we invested in future growth and through it all we remain focused on the shareholder returning substantial value through dividends and buybacks. All together a solid year during a transformational time in our business and I will turn it back to Randall to talk to you a little bit more about that transformation. Randall?","","Randall Stephenson","Okay thanks John. I will close with just a couple of comments so can\u2019t expect from us in 2014. I will reiterate what we laid out when we Project VIP and that was 2014 is our peak year for VIP investment and our outlooks is very consistent with that original plan. We will continue to be aggressive on the network front. We expect to hit our LTE coverage target ahead of schedule this year. We also have a big effort in terms of network densification and cell sites. We will further ramp our U-verse and business fiber builds, video we believe is a big growth opportunity so we have a major initiative to make our network the best in class for video delivery for both wireline and wireless and longer term we\u2019re taking the lead in virtualizing our network to shift functionality from hardware to software. And overtime we believe the pay-offs in operating efficiency and speed to market are going to be significant. In terms of our investments and growth, mobile data and U-verse while they are beginning to scale to very large businesses in and of themselves we\u2019re still very early in their growth curves and the same holds for our strategic business services. As John pointed out with the Cricket brand on top of the AT&T network you should expect us to be disruptive in the no-contract space this year.","We have a number of new services that we will begin to move the needle this year. We will Digital Life into a number of more markets. We have taken a leadership position and connected cars, we have already announced agreements with GM and Ford, Nissan, Audi, BMW, Tesla and there are more to come.","And as I mentioned we have a number of new cloud, security and mobile solutions for business and in parallel we\u2019re also reengineering how we operate. We have a major effort this year to re-architect our enterprise customer experience, rethinking every step in the end to dramatically shorten our intervals. Across our business, we are driving to make 80% of our customer interactions digital and online by 2020 and Project Agile is all about streamlining operations around an all IP cloud and mobility experience and is a first step about 5,600 employees took voluntary retirement in the fourth quarter. Most of those were management employees. We have additional Project Agile initiatives underway, which will require some investment and we expect run rate savings in the $3 billion range by 2017.","If you go to Slide 18, it lays out our financial expectations for 2014. They are very much on track with what we laid out for you. We launched Project VIP some 14 months ago, so there shouldn\u2019t be any surprises here. We expect consolidated revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range. This doesn\u2019t include any impacts from our planned Leap acquisition. We expect stable consolidated margins with adjusted EPS growth in the mid-single-digit range and this does not factor in any future share buybacks. And we expect cash from operations in the $32 billion range.","2014 capital will be in the $21 billion range exactly what we laid out earlier for Project VIP with savings from our original plan offset by capital for Agile and some new network projects. And again, we expect 2014 will be our peak investment year for Project VIP. And with the step up in cash taxes, we expect free cash flow this year in the $11 billion range with similar levels for 2015. Post VIP we expect free cash flow and dividend coverage to trend back to the historical levels. We also expect cash from divestitures from some non-strategic assets and all of this is based on some rather conservative assumptions, that includes U.S. economic growth of around 2%.","Finally, I know everyone saw the filing we made with UK Takeover Panel yesterday. I think the statement speaks for itself. We have talked in the past about how we view the European market. We don\u2019t have much to add. Again, we are on track with and in most cases we are ahead of what we committed to you where we rolled out Project VIP. We have a lot of opportunity ahead of us. The initiatives we are executing have really good payoffs in terms of growth and cost structure. And 2014 is going to be a very productive year for us. So Susan, with that, I think we are ready for questions.","","Susan Johnson","Thank you, Randall. Tony, I think we are now ready to open it for Q&A session.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) Your first question in the queue will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you very much. Randall, just very quickly, can you just give us some color on exactly why you have at this point you had to file with the UK Takeover Panel? And then John on the free cash flow, can you just give us a little bit more detail around the cash taxes and what the impact is in 2014 and \u201815 and what the CapEx is likely to be on \u201815 to get to that $11 billion number? And is there any impact on working capital from the Next program as that starts to ramp this year as well? Thanks.","","Randall Stephenson","Yes, hi Simon. In terms of the, they call it a 2.8 announcement we made in the UK yesterday, anytime you get a lot of noise around any kind of M&A, it\u2019s kind of standard procedure for the Takeover Panel to contact the parties that are being mentioned and ask them to make a declaration. And so we were contacted over the weekend because of a lot of press surrounding us in Europe and asked to make a declaration. So we have made the declaration we did. I really don\u2019t have much more to add than that, just technical requirement by the panel.","","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","","John Stephens","Simon, on the free cash flow, I will take it from the standpoint of we are expecting that $32 billion of cash from operations in the $21 billion range and on CapEx is the biggest generator. When you look at the $32 billion and you compare it to this year, the major changes is the pickup in cash taxes, some of it\u2019s from our pension funding strategy that we implemented last year, some of it\u2019s from depreciation. It does incorporate continued growth in the Next program and it does incorporate what is effectively pressure from that program, but that is all inclusive. Likewise, if you look at \u201815 some of the same things are happening, we will have certainly continued tax pressure, but we will also have growing, we would expect to have some growing pressure for Next and some growing and strong I should say CapEx but our operational improvements and our revenue growth and our profitability improvements will allow us to cover that and keep it stable and keep as very comfortable in our coverage ratios.","","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","So CapEx is around that 21 billion again in \u201915?","","John Stephens","Not specifically giving guidance on that but I would tell you that in prior conversations we talked about CapEx being the current year 21 for \u201913 and then 20 and 20. We have opted for Project Agile this year and we will continue to have I would expect we will continue to have some project Agile efficiency investments going forward.","","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies","I guess it's good for the industry that the consumers are back to being willingness to pay for full handsets. Maybe John just your thought on recent in the current quarter the impact of Next on churn and then looking through the tracking of throughout the quarter obviously December very strong month. Is there a seasonality for that or should we be thinking about or how should we be thinking about percentage growth adds or upgrades as we progress through 2014 and then secondarily your comments regarding Cricket, is there something to be read through that meaning that some of these folks who are getting EIP contracts from the industry [ph] maybe will be better off in the Cricket type product or when we say shake things up I guess I\u2019m trying to understand what that means.","","John Stephens","So let me take a couple of the questions Mike and kind of go from there. If you look at where we were at the end of the third quarter we had about 10% of our handset sales being through the next program. During the fourth quarter that grew for the overall fourth quarter we had about 15% for about a 1 million handsets sold under the Next program and we came out of the quarter at about 20%. We continue to see strong sales in the first quarter so that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with regarding and that\u2019s a very good opportunity for our customers. They like the program, the last thing is accusing it and certainly we like it. While I\u2019m confident that Next has had a positive impact on the churn I would suggest you that the award-winning customer service, our retail stores, give our customers and a really great network performance are also really significant factors in that real reduction in our churn rate in the fourth quarter. I can\u2019t point to you just one item I got to tell you that I believe it's the network performance, it's the sales efforts, the quality service and quite frankly the good choices including that our marketing team has put out there.","","Randall Stephenson","Hey Mike as it relates to the Leap acquisition we have spent the last 6 or 7 years chasing capacity in our network build and we have been very reluctant to move down market because we have some very, very high value customers, high ARPU customers that we\u2019re ensuring that we maintain network quality and capacity there. As we make the move to LTE and as we continue to push the network build and create capacity it's created a whole new opportunity for us to think about the value segment and the no contract segment and as we get into the Leap acquisition as we really study the Cricket brand we\u2019re finding that it is a very, very strong brand and we really believe that if that end of the market as you pull it a no contract type service on top of an AT&T network our coverage, our quality, our performance we are convinced there is a real opportunity to grow. We\u2019re convinced that we can grow from a couple of standpoints and that is what we have seen in terms of moving smartphones, deeper, deeper penetration on postpaid that play has yet to be run in the prepaid segment in a meaningful degree and you should expect this to be very assertive and very aggressive to push smartphone penetration in the no contract space and to be aggressive as it relates to pricing, we will be using a different brand we can do something\u2019s that will be disruptive in the market and we\u2019re actually getting more and more excited about it the closer we get to closing in the first quarter.","","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies","Just sort of just looking at it as a bifurcation of credit risk and understanding some balance sheet risk there as well?","","Randall Stephenson","That\u2019s exactly what it is and also given you the flexibility to do something\u2019s in the marketplace with a different brand that you wouldn\u2019t do with the traditional brand.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in the queue will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan","Hey guys, a couple. One, Randall, just to follow-up real quick in your regulatory conversations the last week, have you learned anything new, no, not necessarily about you, but of U.S. companies ability to buy assets in Europe whether those are NSA issues or otherwise? And then second John, given the high payout ratio for \u201814 and it sounds like \u201815 should we assume that the days of big buybacks are pretty much over for now. Is there any room to raise the leverage there? Thanks.","","Randall Stephenson","Yes. So, Phil, I was in Davos actually and I had an opportunity to meet with several folks, there were administrations and policymakers and so forth. And my main objective for last week as it related to those conversations was we have had some business impacts from the NSA revelations and they have not been inconsequential. We are having customers ask us a lot of questions. We are having policymakers ask us a lot of questions and is affecting our ongoing business today irrespective of anything that might relate to some M&A or whatnot. And so I was really there to discern what was the attitude and the disposition and try to help formulate our own plans as it relates to those. And it\u2019s fortuitous with the President made his speech the Friday before, I think that speech was helpful in terms of the policymakers in Europe understanding where the administration here. The President is going on beta data collection and so forth. And so I would tell you it was net-net a productive set of discussions and I feel like we have a path just as it relates to our ongoing business operations there today.","","John Stephens","Phil, let me comment on your questions with regard to buybacks. First and foremost, I\u2019d make the point very comfortable with our payout ratios. Feel really good about our balance sheet, you can see that our debt ratios are well within line and are within our previous guidance that we have been able to generate strong cash from operations, but quite frankly, we have also been able to generate strong cash from asset monetizations, not strategic assets. And we still believe we have opportunities there. As the set transaction, announced transaction would imply, so I feel very comfortable not only for \u201814 and \u201815 with where we are at on our payout ratios. With that being said, our assumption is the business plan and our guidance that we gave, it was not based on additional buybacks. We will continue to buyback opportunistically. I will tell you we have about 160 million shares left on our authorization, so that would give you a gating factor unless our board will give us more guidance. But we feel real good about our payout ratios and where our balance sheet is. It remains very strong.","","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Thanks guys.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","","John Hodulik - UBS","Okay, thanks. Maybe Randall, could you comment on the competitive environment you are currently seeing in the wireless market and maybe look out to when you are expecting \u2013 how are you expected to evolve in \u201814? And I guess specifically with T-Mobile\u2019s new ETF strategy, it seems to be the first promotion that really targets family plans, I mean is that something that you see is more of a significant change in the competitive landscape or just sort of more of the same promotion that we see in the past? Thanks.","","Randall Stephenson","Yes, hi John. As I have mentioned in my opening comments, it was a formative year for the industry. And I would tell you what is probably most interesting to me as we look at what has played out in 2013 and carried into the first month of 2014 is the idea that our customers are demonstrating an interest desire even to put more of their money into the handset in exchange for lower monthly pricing. And that\u2019s what you see happening in the marketplace right now. More and more customers are moving to the handset financing plans picking up more of the cost of the handset with the desire to have a lower monthly rate. And so we are seeing that play itself out.","And you are seeing kind of the whole market move there, all players are introducing these kind of plans and our customers are loving it. You heard John talk about the take rates and now in December, 20% of all of our smartphone sales were on these types of arrangements. And so one can say well, that\u2019s great margin opportunity, but then your turnaround to reinvesting it back into the customer in terms of better pricing in the marketplace. And so that\u2019s kind of working out very interesting. As it relates to the impact on competition, there is a lot of noise, but at the end of the day we study this nine ways to Sunday and we have made a lot of moves in the marketplace ourselves and fourth quarter churn was the lowest fourth quarter churn we have ever experienced and it just continues to reinforce that you have to be aggressive in the marketplace, you\u2019ve to constantly have your ears to the ground and attuned to what the customer expects that you better have a high quality network experience both data and voice and we really, really feel good about what was accomplished in 2013 in terms of network quality. Again our voice quality is on par with the best in the industry, in the United States and when you look at everybody else in the industry we\u2019re running drop call rates that are half of what the nearest competitor is running. So competitor intensity is going to remain strong I\u2019ve no doubt that you will see that continue, I have no doubt that you will see us continue all to modify our value propositions but as I pointed our earlier I think what you will see us get most competitive is moving down into the value space with the Leap acquisition and using the Cricket brand.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Two if I could, first Randall obviously without a win for the carriers net neutrality space you guys are out at CES with some of your sponsored data trials visible for the marketplace. Obviously Ed Whitacre kind of started this conversation many years ago with the marketplace. Could you kind of tell us how you see the next steps unfolding and when if ever we might be able to see a real monetization of this opportunity? And then second John just for you on the EPS guidance two pieces I wanted to talk about just one obviously we\u2019re going to get about 2% benefit year-over-year from the ending share count relative to the mid-point of 2013 and then obviously on the next program we\u2019re going to get a lot more equipment revenue being booked for a fifth of the customers coming in the door than we do under the old plans, by my math we should see roughly a $1 billion more revenue dropping into the EBITDA line, dropping into the earnings line for 2014 that\u2019s going to be about another 4% or 5% benefit. So we\u2019re already at 7% kind of earnings per share growth year-over-year before we have even started to work on the business. Could you kind of talk about (Audio Gap)","","Randall Stephenson","For the last couple of years the industry came together and worked and agreed to a framework as it related to net neutrality, the SEC promulgated into rules. We did have this court order. From our standpoint David that changed really nothing. It doesn\u2019t change anyway that we will operate, I really don\u2019t believe it's going to change much of what anybody in the industry will do. As you pointed we introduced our sponsored data plans which you know the easiest way to articulate it is like 1800 data where companies may want customers to access their content and they would be willing to pay the price to let those customers access their content. We can\u2019t find that that violates anybody\u2019s net neutrality rules or in place today. It's perfectly volunteer it's opened to any company that might want to do this, you think about the kind of situations that are driving this moving on and it's very interesting. So for example UnitedHealth they have a number of young mothers who are not getting good education and training on prenatal care and obviously it's driving their healthcare cost up. UnitedHealth says we have a lot of information, a lot of data. We want to motivate these young women to come watch and to take advantage of and they say if we would like to pay for it to make sure that there are no constraints, nothing gets in the way from these women taking advantage of these training to address their prenatal care and so they said we\u2019re willing to pay for that and provide motivation and incentives for these young mothers to be to take advantage of that. I\u2019m struggling to figure out what the argument against those types of services would be.","So you\u2019re going to the easy ball. I\u2019ve no doubt you will see them scale. It's the same way the long distance industry grew and scaled and I think mobile data and mobile internet services will follow some of the same paths. So stay tuned but I don\u2019t see the court ruling on net neutrality changing anything in terms of how we operate or most anybody else in the industry for that matter.","","John Stephens","David on your second question a couple of quick comments, we are giving a guidance of that EPS growth in the mid-single-digits range. You are right we will get a little lift underneath the wings from the buybacks that took place in \u201813. We are not assuming anymore working. In the wireless space, we do expect some benefits not only from that, but also from our 24-month upgrade cycle. But I will tell you some of the customers on Next, while they are electing that, they are also as Randall mentioned electing to do, to choose the bring your own device pricing platforms. And so those benefits from Next just may be moving from our service revenues. And you will see the different mix of revenues with the equipment and service, but we are positive about the wireless market and about continue to expand margins.","On the consumer side, U-verse is doing great. We continue to expect to see growth. You saw the kind of numbers they posted on video in the fourth quarter and early on for the year as well as high-speed broadband with initial footprint. We are real optimistic there. Business is still challenged with strategic services are going great. The base is up to 25% we expected to expand. And with that expansion, it should come out to expand the growth rate. So one of the challenges, well the challenges are in a real slow economy, lack of investment by the private sector in the U.S. economy. And quite frankly, we still have \u2013 well, we have made a lot of progress in our voice, legacy voice headwinds and we brought that from what it was in 2011 by 22% of our revenue base is now down to 17% and in the fourth quarter down to 16%. We still have to overcome those challenges in a low employment slow economy environment. When you put that all together, we are optimistic about the year, but we are at that mid-single-digits guidance.","","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks John. Thanks Randall too.","","Randall Stephenson","You bet. David, I would just add on that if we can get some type of U.S. economic growth in that 3% to 4% range, it changes the equation for a lot of us. And I am hopeful, I am not yet optimistic, but I am hopeful and you can assume that we, AT&T and the business community in general, are going to be pushing an agenda. I hope to hear the President speak on several of these issues tonight, first and foremost, business tax reform. I just can\u2019t think of anything that would move this needle faster and to a greater extent than the business tax reform. And I do believe the administration and Congress are all supportive. Here is an area where everybody has coalesced and it seems like its right for getting done. Trade is obviously huge and immigration report, everybody is talking about these. Everybody in Congress, the administration is expressing a desire and a need to get this done. If you could just get a couple of these done, I think it takes us 2% to a 3% plus growth profile and that does change our view of this is what.","","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks Randall.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","","Joe Mastrogiovanni - Credit Suisse","Thanks. John, you have been able to find opportunities to monetize some non-core assets, do you see any additional opportunities as we move forward and how should we think about the use of the capital from these types of transactions?","","John Stephens","So I think, Joe, thanks for your question. First and foremost, we are always looking for opportunities. The most recent example of that was the announcement of the Southern New England Telephone transaction at $2 billion, the transaction we expect to close at the end of the year. I will tell you that we will continue to look at things like real estate, like we did last year with other opportunities. In a company of our size with a quarter of $1 trillion balance sheet and a company that has the history, a 100-year-old plus company, we have opportunities. We will continue to search those out. And as some of the economics on real estate and other things improve, we are optimistic about those. With that being said, we are going to keep our balance sheet strong like we always had. We are going to keep our credit metrics strong as we have and we are going to be opportunistic with the use of that cash. We feel good about where we are at, feel good about our, I think how we treated our shareholders and our ability to continue to keep that in the forefront as we invest for our customers and our employees.","","Joe Mastrogiovanni - Credit Suisse","And do you think this could maybe give you an opportunity to ramp some of those buybacks as we have seen it slow over the last couple of quarters?","","John Stephens","Well, with certainly all of those things that we have taken into account as we make those decisions, but I do want to make sure I am clear on the guidance that for next year, our EPS guidance did not assume a ramp up in the economy and did not assume any buybacks. And as we said before, we are going to be opportunistic with our buybacks and make sure that they are done from a position of strength as we have been doing, as we continue to remain with a strong balance sheet.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next in the queue will come from the line of Adam Ilkowitz with Nomura. Please go ahead.","","Adam Ilkowitz - Nomura","Just one question on the balance sheet side, you had made a move on the pension plan to fully fund that. I wanted an updated on the preferred equity contribution if you could and then on the wireless side, the postpaid gross additions I know that this is a top quarter with some of the moves that were going on but I was wondering if on the high-end postpaid side you\u2019re looking to accelerate itself in anyway? Thanks.","","John Stephens","So first and foremost with regard to the (indiscernible) funding. We continue to work with the Department of Labor for an official approval that process continues to go well for purposes as we had filled and we publically stated we have made the contribution, we did that in September of last year and when you look at our audited pension financial statements this year they will be essentially fully funded. They will be at the 99.8% or a 100.2% funding. So that\u2019s gone well, we do not have an official ruling yet from the DOL but we\u2019re still very optimistic about it and quite frankly I will tell you I\u2019m complimentary about the work in the way we have been respected by the individuals at the Department of Labor. They have been good to work with. With regard to gross additions and our wireless, we\u2019re also looking to be competitive, we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to continue to grow what has been just a great business for us. As Randall said we\u2019re continuing to respond not just the competition but what our customers want and we will continue to focus on offerings and products that will allow us to do that. I will tell you that we\u2019re looking at sustainable growth, profitable growth, growth that gets for both us and the customers not growth that does not make economic sense long term.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investment. Please go ahead.","","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment","First for Randall if you go back to your page 6 diagram, how much of your strategy do you want to be the enabler of these applications with your network versus out rightly owing the applications that scale when you compare it to a la carte alternatives? And John if I can broader question, back on the dividend coverage how should investors be thinking about the coverage aspirations that AT&T has on a two year view and how should they think about how much comes from growth in revenue or cash flow from operations versus lowering the CapEx overtime? Thanks.","","Randall Stephenson","Michael on enabler versus owing the end user or the finished service, answer to the question is yes and it depends. As you think about LTE and cloud capabilities there are some we will take it all the way through the finished service. Classic example of that would be home security and home automation that connected home that is a finished service that we\u2019re monetizing at a retail level. As you think about our NetBond product we\u2019re enabling other people via APIs and capabilities to monetize through us providing a secure environment for cloud services (indiscernible) we have our own cloud services out there that we\u2019re selling at the retail level as well. You can think about in terms of health services. We\u2019re opening up APIs allowing companies to come and put their devices and their applications and use our network services to accommodate that. We think this is a rather sizeable opportunity. Payments, mobile payments we\u2019re working with a JV Isis where Verizon and T-Mobile are partners in that JV that is a finished service. So it's going to cover the gamut. We think the opportunities are really large, the connected car is probably going to be both.","They are going to be subscribers who the car is like an additional device, they add-on to their data bucket but the auto manufacturers will look at us as a platform and they will sell finished services in the car through our connected capability as well. So again to answer your question is yes, all of the above.","","John Stephens","Mike we forgot the dividend coverage, let me reiterate we feel very comfortable about the dividend coverage for \u201914 and \u201915 but with the continuing revenue growth, with the opportunities that the VIP network platform provides it's not only for products and services and revenue, but quite frankly for efficiency through Project Agile. We believe that you will see us trend fairly quickly to historic \u2013 more historic levels of dividend coverage. And quite frankly, I am opportunistic that we can get to better than that. I think that\u2019s a mix of efficiency from the payoff from Project VIP and high-quality IP networks as well as the revenue growth that comes from those products.","","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment","Thank you.","","Susan Johnson","Tony, I think we have got time for just one more question.","","Operator","Thank you. And that question will come from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays","Thank you very much and good afternoon folks.","","Randall Stephenson","Good afternoon.","","John Stephens","Good afternoon.","","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays","On the churn front, I mean, certainly you reported the lowest fourth quarter postpaid churn coming out of you folks, given some of the recent initiatives in part launched by you folks during the quarter for carriers to absorb ETF fees, should we expect your postpaid churn and perhaps the industries for that matter to go up here given what seems to be more increased flexibility to shift between competitors?","","Randall Stephenson","Good question and thank you for that. Let me give you a couple of comments. First of all, our churn improvements were not just in our wireless business and we are very proud of those, but I need to point to you that we had really great performance in U-verse churn and consumer video churn. So we are really pleased with churn and an overall customer satisfaction with this network quality we have. Secondly, I will tell you that when people talk about things like floating ratios and offers for ETF, the real measure of the network and the real measure of customer satisfaction is churn, floating issues or ETF issues are a subset of that. Historically, about a third of our customers who made a change ported their numbers, about two-thirds didn\u2019t. And so when you have unusual and sometimes uneconomic offers to pay someone\u2019s ETF, you may shift floating ratios, but that may not have any change to the total churn picture, it\u2019s just a difference between those customers who made a change with or without porting. Well, we certainly have a competitive environment and we are certainly going to keep our eye on the ball and make sure that we continue to respond to what customers want in a sustainable process, but we think those are the driving force, those choice manage the driving issues not necessarily just one ETF offer or another.","","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays","Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And then one last question if I may on the release from yesterday, has anything changed in terms of review on the regional market outlook for Europe over the longer term with respect to the potential opportunity for mobile data for someone who opts to invest in the region? Thanks very much.","","John Stephens","No, our view of Europe hasn\u2019t changed at all.","","Randall Stephenson","So with that, let me take this moment to thank all of you for being on the call with us today. We close the year with a solid performance, solid quarter and a solid year. Our growth platforms are going strong. Our wireless network is best-in-class and our capital structure is solid. And as Randall mentioned, we are positioned well for 2014. Focused on growth, we have a solid achievable plan that will help us get there. Thanks again for being on the call. And as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good evening.","","Susan Johnson","Thank you.","","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today.

Instructions will be given at that time.","At this time, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for AT&T, Mr. Mike Viola. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, AT&T, Inc.","Okay, thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. Thanks for joining us. Joining on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John will provide an update with perspective on the quarter, and then we'll follow that was Qs and As.","One reminder, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website, and that's att.com\/investor.relations.","Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. The Safe Harbor statement says that some of our comments today may be forward looking. As such, they're subject to risks, uncertainties. Results may differ materially, and additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website.","So with that as an overview, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in AT&T.","We are very excited about the progress we've seen in our business the last three years. We set some ambitious goals to transform our business, every part of our business, to lay a new foundation for the future and for growth. The first quarter was another significant step in that transformation. To put it simply, we are executing very well. We have completed or are near completion with all of our Project VIP network initiatives. We are also ahead of plans with many of the transformational customer and operational initiatives that we now have underway.","The results are impressive. You know the story. Our 4G LTE network now covers 308 million people with ultrafast speeds. We also deployed new spectrum, densified the network, and added DAS [Distributed Antenna Systems] and Wi-Fi capabilities to improve the quality and reach of our best-in-class network.","Our expanded wireline IP broadband footprint reaches 57 million customer locations, and we now are offering 75-megabit speeds in 90 cities. We've also deployed fiber to nearly 800,000 additional business locations, with our 1 million goal in sight, enabling strategic services growth and network-on-demand possibilities.","While transforming these networks, we've also invested heavily to transition our customer base. Many of those transitions are nearing completion as well. Several years ago, we started to move our postpaid base to smartphones and usage-based pricing. Today, 84% of our postpaid phone base use smartphones, and almost 90% are on usage-based plans. And just one year ago, we accelerated the shift to the no-device subsidy model for smartphones when we launched Mobile Share value plans.","Customer response to these plans has been tremendous. About 60% of our postpaid smartphone subscribers already are on no-device subsidy plans. The surge of customers coming to value plans provides for some expected tough comparisons when looking at year-over-year financial results, but our record-breaking churn demonstrates that we made the right move in introducing these plans.","We also moved to strengthen our position in new growth areas. In prepaid, we acquired Cricket and paired it with our LTE network to provide a premium prepaid experience. We also saw the future of the Internet of Things and developed platforms such as the connected car and home automation. We now have more than 20 million connected devices on our network, and the future is very bright for additional growth.","In wireline, the transformation to IP broadband is nearing completion. That means most of the costs associated with this transformation are also behind us. Today, nearly 80% of our broadband base is on IP, and about 90% of the customers with access to IP broadband already have it. And more than 30% of our business wireline revenues come from our strategic IP services.","And finally, we have been laser focused on improving our operations, driving efficiencies across the board. We're seeing good traction with several Project Agile cost savings initiatives, including Digital First, which is our company-wide effort to make it easy for customers to do business online. The number of digital transactions with our customers has increased by the tens of millions the last two years, and we expect to see that increase by millions more in this coming year.","We also have been reducing cycle times in provisioning new services. This improves our competitiveness, our revenue opportunities, and the customer experience, while reducing expenses as well. And we took a giant step with our leading software-defined network initiative when we launched Network on Demand capabilities for business customers in 100 cities.","We continue to take steps to make our capital structure more efficient, including monetization of assets, reducing borrowing costs, and implementing working capital improvements. This has contributed to our strong balance sheet and gives us the financial strength we need to continue to invest and diversify our business.","The moves to diversify our business also continue on track in the first quarter. Those details are on slide four. We've executed Project VIP in our transformation well, doing the hard work necessary to enable the company to move forward. This puts us in a great position to achieve the vision we laid out for you last quarter, vision of a new AT&T, a diversified, integrated wireless and wireline company for both business and consumers, uniquely positioned in a world of high-speed mobile connectivity and video.","We expect the DIRECTV transaction will close this quarter. We have done a lot of work identifying opportunities for additional cost synergies between these two great companies. This includes savings from supply chain, installation, customer care, and even sending just one bill. This has increased our confidence that we can significantly exceed the original $1.6 billion expected in cost synergies. In fact, we now believe cost synergies alone will exceed a $2.5 billion run rate by year three.","In wireless, we closed on Iusacell, the first of our Mexico wireless acquisitions, and we expect to close the Nextel Mexico deal shortly. Together, these properties will give us a leading spectrum position in a dynamic wireless market that is just beginning its transformation to the mobile Internet. We plan to deploy a near-nationwide 4G LTE network, something we know how to do very well. It will be covering about 100 million people in a country that borders the United States. The cross-border opportunities that this opens up are exciting from both a consumer and a business standpoint.","We have also significantly improved our spectrum position here in the United States. Our Leap acquisition brought with it an average of 10 MHz of spectrum in the top 100 markets, covering 137 million people. Some of it was unused spectrum. We've already put much of that unused spectrum to work in more than 200 markets, and we've begun shutting down the legacy CDMA networks. We expect that process to be complete by the end of the year, and we will quickly redeploy that spectrum as well.","We also made a major investment earlier this year when we acquired licenses for near-nationwide contiguous 10x10 MHz block of high-quality AWS-3 spectrum. Needless to say, we feel good about our spectrum position. This takes a lot of uncertainty out of the process with our ability to add capacity and maintain quality in a cost efficient manner. We know what we have and we know what we need to do, and we have a clear path to delivering a network that customers want, that customers expect, and that customers will use.","With that as background, let's take a look at our consolidated financial summary on slide five. Adjusted consolidated revenues grew to more than $32.6 billion. That's up about $375 million when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut wireline properties. This growth was driven by continued success in wireless as we reposition our business model, strong demand for strategic business services, and adjusted wireline consumer revenue growth. Adjusted wireline revenues were down about 1%, but revenues were essentially flat year over year if you adjust for the impact of foreign exchange and discontinued businesses.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.63. That includes adjustments for Leap integration expenses as well as costs associated with the voluntary employee retirement plan. It also excludes a one-time $0.05 benefit from a tax planning related matter. And while we don't show this on an adjusted basis, first quarter 2014 earnings also include the income we received from our previous equity ownership of Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil as well as net income from our domestic Connecticut wireline operations. Those two provided about $0.03 of EPS in the first quarter of last year that we don't have this year.","Our business also continues to generate solid cash flows, with free cash flow of $2.8 billion. Cash from operations totaled $6.7 billion, and that includes an additional $500 million investment in our Next customer base. And capital expenditures were $4 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $4.4 billion. And in terms of uses of cash, dividend payouts totaled $2.4 billion.","At the same time, we maintained a solid balance sheet while continuing to invest in the business. During the quarter, we funded investments in AWS spectrum and Iusacell. And we are also well positioned for our planned investments in DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico.","Net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 2.19 times. And as we've said before, with our transformational investments in DIRECTV, Mexico, and spectrum, we will go above our normal net debt to EBITDA target. But after we close the DIRECTV transaction, our focus with free cash flow after dividends will be on paying down debt and getting back to our target range.","Now let's turn to our operational highlights, starting with wireless on slide six. Our wireless results this quarter only include our domestic operations. Information on our Iusacell operations is included under the international segment in our financial statements and is separately broken out.","The repositioning of our smartphone base by giving customers the choice of lower-priced service with no device subsidy plans continues to show positive results. Postpaid churn was 1.02%, the best first quarter that we have ever had and the best in the industry this quarter. This continues the positive trend we saw last year and comes in a very noisy and competitive marketplace. And prepaid churn also showed strong continued signs of improvement thanks to the strength of our Cricket operations.","Total net adds came in strong at 1.2 million. That was led by gains in postpaid and connected devices. We added more than 440,000 postpaid subscribers in what is traditionally a slow net add quarter, thanks to strength in tablets. These tablet gains more than offset a decline of feature phone subscribers. We also grew our high-quality postpaid smartphone base by another 500,000 in the quarter. This includes postpaid upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number. And when you look at total branded smartphones, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, we added about 1.2 million smartphones to our base during the quarter.","We also added about 1 million connected devices, thanks to a continued strong showing by connected cars. Connected device net adds were impacted by a change in how we report our session-based tablets. Previously, we included them as part of our prepaid base. Now they're reported as connected devices subscribers. This gives us and you a better view of phone growth in prepaid, which now essentially includes only phone activity. You see that this quarter.","Thanks to strong results from our Cricket offering, we had positive growth in prepaid. Cricket is just the latest example of our ability to integrate new businesses. The team has done a very good job of transforming this business. Retention is ahead of schedule. Churn is less than expected and certainly much less than historical levels prior to our ownership. And we're doing a great job of moving customers off the legacy CDMA network. More than 90% of Cricket customers already are on the GSM platform. However, we do expect to see some pressure over the next quarters as we complete the transition to GSM and shut down the legacy CDMA networks.","Overall, postpaid gross adds and upgrades continue at a solid pace. We had about 6.2 million smartphone sales in the quarter, slightly higher than last year's total. Our postpaid upgrade rate was 6.6%. Smartphones were 94% of all phone sales, and now make up about 84% of our postpaid phone base. We still have about 16% of our phone base to transition to smartphones, but the bulk of the smartphone transformation has been completed. Transforming our phone base to LTE smartphones and moving those customers to no-subsidy and usage-based pricing has been a big investment for us. But once again, we made these investments, executed our plan, and are now in a strong position to move forward.","Now let's look at the progress we're making with shifting our customers to AT&T Next and Mobile Share. That information and revenue are on slide seven. AT&T Next sales reached record levels, nearly two-thirds of smartphone sales. Another 5% brought their own devices to our network. That means 70% of phone sales in the quarter didn't carry a subsidy. Total wireless revenue was up about 2%, driven by 36% growth in equipment revenue. The customers who choose to bring their own devices don't increase equipment expense for us, so the no-device subsidy model works for our customers and us, whether it's with Next or with bring your own device.","As expected, service revenues this quarter were impacted by Mobile Share value plans. But because we have now passed the anniversary of the introduction of these plans, we expect the year-over-year comparisons will improve in the coming quarters. At the end of the first quarter, more than 70% of our postpaid base is on Mobile Share plans, with more than 60% of the postpaid smartphone base on no-device subsidy pricing. This means our first quarter Next flow share percentage has exceeded the percentage of smartphone subs on no-device subsidy pricing. Mobile Share customers continue to buy up to larger buckets of data. About half of all accounts are on plans 10-gigabytes or larger and about 20% are on plans of 15-gigs or more. That's more than twice as many as a year ago. This helped drive a 14% increase in data billings.","As expected, the strong Next take rate helped drive the third consecutive quarter of sequential phone ARPU growth when you factor in Next billings. The metric gives you a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us each month. Phone-only ARPU with Next was more than $66 in the quarter, with the average monthly Next billings about $6 and growing. That strong sequential increase comes even when you factor in the impact of our new Data Rollover plan, which generated about $0.25 of ARPU pressure in the quarter. As the Next base grows, so does the impact on billings. More than 30% of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, but 65% of our sales are on Next, so our ARPU with Next is expected to continue to grow.","Now let's move to our wireline operations on slide eight. Our focus on profitability and transforming to IP technologies can be seen in our wireline results. On the business side, Strategic Business Services are now close to a third of the business wireline revenues, and we continue to see strong demand for those services. Adjusted Strategic Business Services revenues grew by more than 15% in the quarter. And when you adjust for FX, growth was more than 17%. Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 3.3%. However, about half of that decline comes from the impact of FX and our discontinued low-margin businesses, such as Global Hubbing. If you consider those items, the decline would have been 1.7%.","And if you look at our combined business wireline and wireless operations, revenue actually increased year over year. While overall wireline business operations saw pressure, it was most pronounced in wholesale, in part due to our focus on profitable sales and the continued impacts of network grooming. Enterprise revenue was down less than 1% when you adjust for Connecticut and FX. Small business revenues were also down. However, there are some positive signs with new business starts and growing sales from our fiber build.","We also took a significant step recently in our transition to software-defined networks. We introduced Network on Demand for business customers in more than 100 cities. This allows businesses to easily order, add, or change network services on their own in real time.","In consumer, U-verse services now make up about 70% of consumer revenues and helped drive adjusted consumer revenue growth of more than 2%. U-verse started the year with solid subscriber gains, increasing penetration, and strong revenue growth, including adding more than 400,000 IP broadband subscribers. That helped drive a net gain of almost 70,000 new subscribers to our overall broadband base.","We are nearing the completion of our broadband conversion to IP. About 80% of our broadband base is now on IP. That's 90% of our IP-eligible customers. So we expect the number of migrations to ease throughout the year as well as the costs associated with those conversions.","At the same time, we continue to increase broadband speeds. We expanded our 75-megabit services to nearly 90 cities, and we offer GigaPower in 10 markets, including a just announced deployment in Chicago. We also hit a milestone with our Voice-over-IP services in the quarter. We now have more than 5 million VoIP subscribers. All this helped drive an increase in adjusted U-verse consumer revenues of almost 20%.","Now let's move to margins, starting with wireless margins on slide nine. Wireless service margins were essentially stable year over year. There was pressure from customers on no-device subsidy pricing in advance of upgrades and from the full quarter of inclusion of Cricket operations. And our new Data Rollover plan also had about a 20 basis point impact on margins. This was offset by the impact of AT&T Next and cost saving initiatives in the quarter.","Wireline margins continue to stabilize, and operating margins were flat year over year. There was pressure from non-cash benefit expenses and TV content costs, but this was offset by growth in consumer and Strategic Business Service revenues and solid execution on our cost initiatives.","For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated operating margin was 18.5% compared to 19.6% in the year-ago quarter and 18.9% two years ago, but most of the year-over-year difference is due to our strategic investments in Mexico and Cricket.","Cost efficiencies continue to be a priority with us. We discussed the success of our Digital First initiative earlier. We also have made headway in cutting cycle times to provision new business services. We're seeing up to a 40% reduction in cycle times on some IP products, with more than a 50% reduction in the fiber-ready buildings. Our software-defined network initiatives will help even more.","Before we open up the call for your questions, let me do a quick recap of the quarter on slide 10. The first quarter was another big step in the transformation and diversification of our company. Customers are moving to Mobile Share value plans and AT&T Next in increasing numbers. This helped drive industry-leading postpaid churn and more than 1.2 million wireless net adds.","The success of the migration to IP technologies can clearly be seen in our wireline revenue numbers. IP services now make up 70% of our consumer revenues, and our migration to IP broadband is near complete. In business, Strategic Business Services, which include our IP services, is close to a third of the wireline business revenues. Strong demand has revenue growing at more than 15%.","At the same time, the moves we are making to diversify our business through video and international operations are on track. We are confident the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deals will close this quarter, and we are taking steps to get all plans in place to close these transactions quickly.","Our solid balance sheet and cash flows provide the financial strength to invest and to make these transformative moves. We feel very confident with our standalone guidance for the year. We're on track and on plan. In fact, we're actually ahead of plan in many of the areas, including free cash flow. That gives us even greater confidence that we can hit our growth targets for the year while also being prepared for the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico acquisitions.","We are on the starting blocks for a very exciting year for AT&T. We have made the investments and done the hard work necessary to position us to be a very different company, and we are ready for the opportunity ahead of us.","With that, Tony, let's go ahead and take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. Our first question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks very much. John, thanks for the update on DIRECTV. Can you just go into the merger synergy guidance a little bit more? Just what are the main buckets there? And help us think about how it phases year one, year two, year three. And then you sound confident on the closing this quarter. Given all of the headlines we have out there, just can you just give us some more sense of what makes you so confident? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thank you, Simon. Real quickly, Simon, the base of most of our savings that we previously announced was going to content contracts as we understood them to be standard in the industry. And that was the basis for a large part of our $1.6 billion original target; that along with some of the normal synergies associated with bringing two public companies together.","The additional ones are the opportunities we now see in going to, for example, one single truck roll to install products, so combining the installation of both our broadband capabilities and our video capabilities into one truck roll; or getting the customers on one single bill, one single customer care operation; the ability to go to our supply chain to get better pricing with regard to our equipment because specifically one of us was buying set-top boxes and other equipment at lower numbers than the other one was. And so when you combine those, we're confident we can get some more supply chain savings.","There's also the standard cost of things like combined advertising, combined customer care, combined activities. But that's what we built up to this $2.5 billion. They are cost savings. But we believe that they are very much real, very achievable, and we believe that they'll grow. Certainly in that third year is when they get to that $2.5 billion level, but they are significant during the 2017 third-year timeframe. They will build starting in 2015 but build really in 2016 and really move toward significant amounts in 2017.","With regard to our confidence in the transaction closing, it really comes down to what the transaction is about, and that is bringing customers greater choice, bringing more competition to the marketplace, bringing expanded opportunities for customers to get bundled services, services that they want, and really to improve the broadband capacity that's out there for customers through our additional investments of some of these savings. So as we continue to go through the process, we continue to feel good about where we're at, and we are optimistic and continue to believe we'll close it this quarter.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, John. Thanks. A quick follow up on Simon's question. Have you had any indication from the DOJ or FCC either way in terms of approval?","And then second, if you can talk about the Mexican business, the same thing. What barriers remain to closing Nextel? And how do you think about integrating those businesses from here and the need to ramp up CapEx to do that? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yeah. So as would be normal in a transaction like the merger of DTV and AT&T, our legal representatives are having the normal process and contacts with parties within the rules in the normal course. I won't go into those details. But I will tell you, Phil, if you look at what's on the record out there and the benefits this brings, I think there's an easy path to see why this deal would get approved and the benefits it will bring to consumers. So I'll leave it at that. We continue to feel good about it.","With regard to Mexico, the process for Nextel first had to go through the U.S. bankruptcy process and the opportunity for other bidders to come in. That process has all been completed. The U.S. bankruptcy court has approved the sale. So we're now just left with getting the regulatory authorities in Mexico, IFETEL, to approve it. We're in, as you might expect, normal contact, and that would be normal in a deal, respectful contact and working through issues with them. Our experience with them on Iusacell, our experience with them on the regulatory framework that they've set up, and the economic environment they set up gives us confidence that that deal could close shortly.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And in terms of integrating those two mobile businesses once you have them?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yeah. So we will operate as one business. We will get significant benefits from the two networks. And so we will be able to utilize the infrastructure of both companies to really help us manage and really prioritize capital investments, so it really will allow us on a combined basis to ramp up the networks much more quickly. As we mentioned in my prepared remarks, when you combine the two companies, they clearly have a leading spectrum position in Mexico, which also gives us an opportunity to very efficiently ramp up.","Your comment or question, Phil, with regard to will we need to spend capital on that asset, absolutely. We intend to get the network quality up to our standards. And as quickly as prudently possible, we're working through those plans. And once we get the Nextel Mexico merger completed, we'll have all the information at our disposal to finalize those plans, and then we'll come back to the Street at the same time we do with the DIRECTV merger and update you on those plans. But it will take some additional capital. But quite frankly, in the company the size that we will become once the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deal are closed, it will be a very manageable level of additional capital.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue, that will come from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey, John.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Hey, Mike.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Just a couple things. I guess first on the wireless side, I think your comment the way we would read it is that phone-only ARPU and service revenue from a year-over-year growth perspective, have we bottomed out and hit the tipping point there? And then secondly on wireless, what's the experience that you're having with customers that are on the Mobile Share value when they go to upgrade? Are you seeing any unusual churn activities around those guys?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Mike, quite frankly, we're not seeing any unusual churn activities, really. I don't mean to be inappropriate, but the 1.02% postpaid churn is the best we've ever had. And if you go beyond, if you subdivide our postpaid base into postpaid smartphones, as you can imagine, the trend is even lower. So we feel very good about that.","With your comments with regard to service revenues, when you look at our service revenues this quarter, clearly it was impacted by, so to speak, a full year of opportunity for customers to transition to Mobile Share, and really not only about a month, no time prior to the first quarter of 2014 and only about a month of 2014 first quarter for customers to transition. So this is going to be the starkest comparison or the most significant comparison time. We expect those comparisons to get easier or to be less challenging as we go through the year because we've established much more of a stable Mobile Share value base as of the end of the first quarter compared to where we were at the end of the first quarter last year.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","John, if I can just sneak one in, just thinking about cash flow, any thoughts on plans for factoring in 2015, a magnitude question? And CapEx run rate a little lower than we anticipated, is that just ahead of the deals closing?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","CapEx is just what we needed. It is lower than the run rate. We're not changing any guidance on CapEx. It's just more of a philosophy to spend it as you need it, don't spend it early.","With regard to factoring, you can expect us to factor every quarter this year. Part of that process is to get an established track record on that. We did do it in the quarter. Even with the factoring we did in the first quarter, we added to \u2013 as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we added to our total investment in our Next customer base by about $500 million. But I think we expect to continue to use that securitization process in an effort to eventually get to a point where we'll have another option for financing our business, whether we choose to use it or not.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great, thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. Hey, John, just a couple questions. First actually, can you give us a number of how much factoring was done in the quarter? And then a couple follow-ups to previous questions, the 70% of adds coming on no subsidized plans is a big number. Is that the top that we can expect, or can you push that still higher?","And then lastly, switching gears over to wireline, margins were off, EBITDA margins were off a little bit on a year-over-year basis. Can you give us a sense for maybe what's driving that and how that should trend on a year-over-year basis? Should we continue to see declines, or with some of the costs coming out of the Connecticut properties, do you expect that to be bottoming around here? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","So, John, let me try to make sure I hit all these, and challenge me. If I skip one, let me know.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Sure.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","First, I think we mentioned that we had about 65% take rate on Next on about 6.2 million net adds and upgrade sales, so around 4 million Next sales. You guys can do the math on an average price of a phone to get the gross receivable. We mentioned that we increased our receivables, net increase in our investment in our customers by about $500 million. The offset to the rest of the purchase price was about $1.5 billion of factoring, and then some collections from customers from previously sold Next phones in early 2014 or even a few that we sold and 2013 that are now paying us monthly fees that we are collecting and keeping at the company. So we're not subject to prior monetizations or securitizations.","On the net adds, at 70%, I think the key assumption there is we've seen this 60% \u2013 65% Next take rate before and we've seen it again this quarter. The one thing I will tell you is that to get it to 70%, we had about 5% or about 300,000, a little over 300,000 BYOD devices. Those are great net adds for us. While they don't bring any equipment revenue, they don't bring any equipment expense. And so that's a good deal for us. They often join Mobile Share value plans, so they are sticky customers.","That is the unknown, if you will. That 300,000 is a little bit below what it was running on a quarterly basis the last three quarters of last year. But this is typically a slower \u2013 first quarter is typically a slower quarter. We're still encouraged by the level that \u2013 that will be the determinant of where we come out, whether we come out in that 60% to 65% range or if we get higher than that. We'll just have to wait and see. But I do feel very good about the fact that in total that no-device subsidy is at 70%. And quite frankly, the overall base on Mobile Share value for smartphones is at 62%, so we're running hotter than that.","And then third, the amount of those customers that are actually paying us monthly for Next today is down in the 32% range. So I'm very optimistic that the monthly Next ARPU piece, the monthly billings piece, is going to pick up from that $6 level.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Right.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","EBITDA margins, we're going to continue to focus, particularly in wireline, on cost savings. I think you're aware that we did an early \u2013 voluntary early retirement program. I think our take rates on that were in the 3,300 range, so we'll see some savings from that going forward.","Additionally, we did see some pressure in the first quarter as we converted some of our former backhaul or interconnection in Connecticut from company-owned to leased arrangements. So they moved out of depreciation in some of those characteristics into COE. And we'll manage through that and manage the efficiencies of our operations. We'll overcome that during the year. So those are the things we're working on to improve those margins. And as I said, we're still confident with our guidance, and that guidance included improving margins in wireline, wireless, and overall.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett J. Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Just to follow up a bit on churn, if I listen to some of things you were saying, you've got a growing share of your base on Mobile Share value plans. And there's obviously a lot more value in those plans, so they're more attractive. You have a growing percentage of your base on smartphones, which you said have a lower churn profile. And you keep selling tablets, meaning your average customer probably has multiple devices, and usually that means lower churn. So is it reasonable to think you could actually continue to improve churn from here? I know the second quarter of last year is a tough comp, so putting that aside. Or are there mitigating factors, including the competitive environment, that might just create a little bit of a floor on where you can go right now?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","I'll say this. We're very pleased with where we came in on churn in the first quarter, particularly with the noisy and competitive environment that we operate in. But we are not getting into the fact that we can't do better from here on out. We're not predicting that. We're not guiding to that, but we're certainly striving to do that. You are right, Brett, that the second quarter of last year is going to be really tough comparison. But with that being said, we still are striving to do better each and every quarter than we did the last quarter, and we'll keep that effort up.","When you think about Mobile Share value accounts, there are just under about 20 million of those accounts, and they average just under three devices per account. I think we can get you the detailed numbers, but it's probably about 19.5 million accounts, and there are about 2.9 devices per account. And yes, that really does help with churn.","Additionally, our smartphone churn is lower than our total postpaid. Effectively, our feature phone churn is higher. And as we've reduced that base down to 16% now of our postpaid base and we're seeing flow share of only about 6%, we're optimistic that we can increase the smartphone base. And that will give us another lever to really make an attempt to manage churn to a lower level. With all that being said, it is a competitive environment, and we have to be ready to handle whatever situation issues, offers come out from other parties in this environment, regardless of the logic that may or may not be behind them.","Brett J. Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, and just as a quick follow-up, since you mentioned the feature phone base, as you come towards the tail end of migrating them to smartphones, how do you think about that residual base? Is there a proactive effort to get all of them into smartphones, or is there just an acknowledgment that some of those customers will probably eventually just come to end-of-life and you're going to let them go?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","We don't want to necessarily lose any customers, Brett, we want to keep, and we've got a lot of really good ones that are still on feature phones. But the issue is the functionality of our networks is so dramatically different when you're using a smartphone, and the value our customers can get out of our networks is so significant, is so much greater with a smartphone. So we're certainly encouraging that.","What I will tell you that's encouraging to us, though, is that we're finding that we're having real success in the prepaid space, in the traditional no-subsidy or low-subsidy model prepaid space and still getting really good ARPUs and still using a lot of maybe lower cost but a lot of smartphones there. We had a significant number of smartphones added to our prepaid base. So I would tell you that a feature phone that may not want to go to the full postpaid smartphone relationship might stay with us in a prepaid relationship and still get the benefits of some very good network and quality and phones, and yet do it in a different pricing in different subsidy mechanism.","Brett J. Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you for taking the question.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thank you. Can you give us a little more color on what you said about seeing some increased signs of some improvement in SMB and passed homes with fiber, some additional businesses with the fiber build? How many additional businesses have you built? And what are some of the signs that you're seeing a little bit of a turn in that part of the business?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","So, Frank, we've built \u2013 800,000 customer locations have been passed with fiber. What we did is we built a significant amount of those to customer order, where customers, existing customers, new customers order that and want us to build. But we also built a measurable amount to, if you will, into areas where we were confident we could sell and be effective. In those areas that we've built and spread the copper before we had a contract in place, we are now aggressively selling into those areas, and we have been pleased about the ability to penetrate those buildings and to sell into those. So that's the encouragement.","In many of those buildings, you've seen how it works. You can go into a building. It might have 20 potential customers in there, and you have to sell to the first one. And once you get the first one sold, you can come back and then have some credibility with selling to the second, the third one. So we are making some significant progress in getting those first sales inside the building. And the team is working hard under Ralph de la Vega's leadership to then go back and really maximize all the opportunities in those buildings. People love the fiber and the high-speed that it provides, the quality of that service. So this investment ahead of an order is starting to show signs of paying off. That's what's encouraging.","Additionally, we're continuing to see interest from our normal business, small business customers, and some of our packaged deals with regard to a combination of our bundled mobility and wired IP services. I don't want to suggest that we are seeing the small business market take off, but we are, and our numbers will explain the reason for me saying that. But we are seeing continued strong demand for IP and strategic based services, those Ethernet-based services, those IP-based services.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And what should we expect going forward on a quarterly or annual basis for these types of businesses that pass? How many more do you have?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","We're going to get to 1 million business customer locations passed. If you think about the run rate we've been on, it's pretty easy to think that we can get to that 1 million by the end of the year. That would be a very reasonable process. We've publicly stated that we can get there by the end of the year or shortly thereafter. So that is what I think you can expect.","With regard to predicting growth rates or trends in the small business area, we haven't done that. But I will tell you on the overall Strategic Business Services, I am encouraged that we're at the 32% level of revenues. I'm very encouraged that it's reached $2.6 billion. I'm very encouraged that even in this tough environment it grew 15% on an adjusted basis. And when you take into account FX pressures, it would have grown 17%. I think the team is doing very well, and the network we built is attracting customers for its quality, its security, and its speed.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. Good afternoon, John and Mike.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Hi, Amir.","Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, AT&T, Inc.","Hi, Amir.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I just wanted to follow up on the questions around the competitive landscape. How do you think about the level of promotional activity for the course of this year versus last year? And specifically, how should we think about your strategy going forward? Last year, obviously, you made a concerted effort to adjust pricing in order to migrate more of your subscribers onto Next. Do you foresee needing to have to do that again? It doesn't seem like, based on the comments that you made on ARPU trajectory, but I just wanted to confirm.","And then I'd also be interested to hear your thoughts on the Google announcement today and whether you view it as a possible new competitor over the mid to longer term, even though it seems fairly limited in scope based on what they announced today.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Okay. I think with your first question, Amir, I think you'll continue to see us taking actions on the strategy that we have laid out already; that we are going to continue to focus on profitable customers and providing smartphone growth, Mobile Share value, getting customers on Next or BYOD, and continuing to migrate. Now we've got 90% migrated to usage-based plans, and use the LTE deployment of phones and the, so to speak, year-over-year growth, data growth we've seen of those phones of about 50% to then drive data growth and then drive higher buckets. So that's the strategy there.","Sure, I'm certain we will have some promotional activity, as we always do, but I wouldn't suggest to you that it would be out of the ordinary, out of the normal process. I will also suggest here that we are just in the beginning phases of the connected car, of the Internet of Things, and of the opportunities that that's going to provide us. This really deep, high-quality, 308 million people that are covered with LTE or have LTE available to them is really a great thing for all the Internet of Things product and services, whether they be the connected cars or the other platforms we have out there. And we believe that over terms, we'll see really great growth there. I think we added close to 700,000 connected cars in the quarter. So it still has a long way to go, but it's growing very quickly. And remember, what we're seeing today is really just mostly the wholesale arrangement, and here as we mature through this process, we'll get that opportunity to get the retail arrangement.","With regard to Google, I would suggest to you I'm not an expert on the matter, so I don't mean to be, but I understand your commentary about it's very limited. So I understand it's limited. It's got a very limited number of devices. That's not generally the way we like to present options to customers. We like to provide a lot. My understanding it's limited in this case. My understanding also is that there's going to be very limited distribution and customer care. And those things are items that we found our customers value. So we'll just have to wait and see, but it's just another one of the plays in the environment that's out there.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks very much for the color.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Take care.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue will come from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, maybe two if I could. Just the first one, Verizon is getting a lot of attention on the OTT strategy, both skinny bundles and the wireless side. But depending on how things shake out, AT&T could be the nation's largest video player. Could you give us a sense as to the timing and what we should be expecting coming from AT&T on this front? Are you working on this pro forma knowing that DTV deal is behind you, or do you have to wait for the DTV deal? I think people would love to know where you guys stand on that.","And then just second, I think, John, you've thrown out a deleveraging target at some of the conferences of about 1.8 times within a three-year timeframe post the deal. Could you divide \u2013 waterfall how you get there from a combination of operations and asset sales? And then rumor has it you're running the real estate group at AT&T now. Could you map out where the buckets for asset sales inside of AT&T are and scope it for us? It would be helpful. Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","So let me get to a couple things. One, I won't give any detailed plans about post-DTV AT&T. I don't think it would be prudent at this time. But what I will tell you is that over-the-top distribution of video on wireless, on broadband connections with or without linear subscription is something that I'm sure we'll see and something that we will see be a part of packages in the future. My own experience is that I see it as an add-on to a subscription package. And I think we believe that that will be the way a lot of the opportunities will go, but we're certainly open to it, and we're going to certainly be in a position to help and develop that part of the process. I won't go into the Verizon situation or any specific offers on our part.","With regard to deleveraging, I will go this way. We're expecting free cash flow to exceed dividends and provide cash not only this year but into the future to pay down debt. That's one. Two, we're expecting EBITDA to expand, not only just from the acquisition of DTV but from the content savings \u2013 excuse me, from the cost savings that we've talked about even today. And that will expand EBITDA even more, which will by simple math help the metrics of net debt to EBITDA. Third, we'll continue to look at all aspects of our asset portfolio. As I've mentioned before, we have a about a $300 billion total asset portfolio today that will only get larger with DTV and Nextel Mexico. And so we will continue to look for opportunities.","I would suggest to you that if you look at our record over the last three years, we have a pretty reliable record of generating over $15 billion worth of cash from asset monetizations, and we've done it very tax efficiently, so we've netted a significant amount of that cash to be able to use. And we'll just continue to do the same process that we've done. I wouldn't expect anyone to think that we are complete in that process, but I'm not going to get into listing any specific items.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Sure. Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions, two if I could. Just one, could you disclose what the postpaid revenues were in the quarter? I think it's something that you've given out in the past. I didn't see it in this quarter's release.","And then secondly, if we just take a step back on the wireline business, you talked about the investment you made, a lot of broadband for homes with the VIP project. How should we be thinking about the impact that should have on broadband units over time, being able to grow that residential broadband business? Does it take a certain amount of time before you get some benefit from the sales, or is there something else that we should be looking out for in terms of impact there? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Mike, I'll let Mike and the team follow up with you on the details of the postpaid revenue details, and refer to what we put on the website. Whatever we give you, we'll make sure it's out there on the AT&T website. I don't have those numbers right in front of me.","With regard to the wireline business, the VIP project, and specifically I think, Mike, you're probably referring to the 57 million IP broadband locations, I'd suggest to you this. What we really need to see is the DIRECTV deal to close because the transaction, the key to being successful in that area is that customers want a bundle. And so with the closing of that transaction, we'll be able to have a bundle not only of the video services that DTV provides, but of the broadband services that we can provide.","As I mentioned before, about 30 million of those 57 million broadband locations, a little bit under that number, don't currently have a video product. Once we can do a real bundle with owner's economics and provide the efficiencies of one truck roll, the efficiencies of one service call, the efficiency of one troubleshooting call for the customers, one offer, one pricing structure, we believe that that will not only be good for our company, but it will be very good for customers that they'll have a new competitive offer out in the marketplace.","And so we think that the completion of our DIRECTV-AT&T merger is a key factor in that process and a key factor in bringing great quality services to customers. And from our surveys and from the information I've seen, it's what customers want. So that will be the focus point. I would suggest to you that we'll probably have more to say on that and give some insights to that when we have our Investor Day, which will likely be within about a month after the closing of DTV.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Sure.","Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, AT&T, Inc.","Okay, Tony, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you very much, and that question will come \u2013 Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, I have two, if I may. The first one, I was wondering if you can give us an update on your fixed wireless strategy. I know that was part of VIP a while ago, but I was wondering if it's changed at all with what you received in the AWS-3 auction.","And then the second question is, it's my understanding that for the AWS-3 debt that you raised to pay for those proceeds that you're capitalizing that interest. I was wondering if you could just talk about how much debt is actually being associated with the AWS-3 auction. Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","So first of all, your second question on AWS, yes, we are capitalizing that, and the amount of the debt that is being associated with that is a ratable share of our overall debt portfolio. The overall interest cost has come down significantly over the last three years as we've refinanced debt. But it is an allocated share based on the $18 billion, approximately $18 billion purchase price. So that is what is getting capitalized.","With regard to the fixed wireless local loop, Colby, I wouldn't suggest to you that anything's changed at this time. We still have the commitments out there in the DTV transaction, and we still stand ready to live up to those and to satisfy those in full. We think that's a clear benefit for the consumer and the marketplace as a part of that transaction. But we're still confident that we can satisfy that, and we'll see how that comes out. That's probably \u2013 the finalization of the DTV deal is probably going to have to come before we're going to go through and I'd be ready to discuss any modifications, if any, to the fixed wireless local loop plans.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thank you. With that, I want to thank all of you for being on the call today. Our work the last few years sets us up for a transformative 2015. We are ready to move quickly once the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deals close. Our networks are in place, our customer transformation is on track, and we are seeing tangible results in our Digital First and software-defined network initiatives. Our performance in the first quarter adds to that confidence.","Wireless turned in another solid performance in a competitive environment. Wireline's focus on profitability and strong demand for IP services brought margin stability and growing IP revenues. We are ready for our Next transformative steps and we are excited about the opportunity we have before us.","One last thing before we go, as a good friend of ours, Kathy, would tell you, on your way home tonight, don't text and drive. It can wait. Thanks again for being on the call. And as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you very much.

Thank you for joining us today. With me on the call is John Stevens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John is going to provide an update with perspective on the quarter, and then we'll follow that with a Q&A session. Let me remind you that our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website, and that's ATT.com\/investor.relations.","But first, I need to call your attention to the Safe Harbor statement before we begin. As you guys know, it says that there could be some comments today that might be forward-looking, and as such they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens, to discuss our financial and operational highlights.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in AT&T. Before we discuss the quarter, I'd like to take a moment and do a quick reset of what we have put in place at AT&T. With the close of our DTV acquisition, we became a unique U.S. competitor. We are the first scaled communications and video provider to offer customers fully integrated nationwide products. Our focus is on profitable growth, and we believe that we have in place the products and the platforms that will enable our success.","First, you're probably familiar with our new operating segments, Business Solutions, Entertainment & Internet Services, Consumer Mobility, and International. These segments are built on a series of investments that have set the stage for a new kind of company. Our network investments over the last three years is unprecedented. At a time when customers value and need connectivity more than ever, our integrated high-speed wireless and wireline IP networks are in place, ready to meet the growing data demand.","We invested in a deep spectrum position. When you combine the spectrum we bought in the AWS auction along with the WCS spectrum we already own, we have 40 MHz of spectrum in the pipeline that we can use to meet growing customer demand, plus we've added our spectrum from Leap. This provides an efficient way to meet the increasing demand for mobile data.","We're also investing in next-generation software-defined networks. We plan to virtualize and control more than 75% of our network by 2020 using cloud infrastructure and SDN.","Behind all this is our focus on profitability. Our improving margins are due in large part to our ability to reduce costs and manage our customer base, including letting our customers manage the smartphone handset cycle. Project Agile savings are coming through. Automation and Digital First have reduced customer call volumes by an average of 2 million calls a month. Simplified offers help as well. So do the simple blocking and tackling efforts of expense controls, getting it right the first time, and working capital efficiencies.","We also are being smarter and growing revenues. We've exited some low-margin businesses, such as Global Hubbing. We have seen increasing capital efficiencies not just with lower trailing operating expense, but also driving lower unit costs as we continue to invest in our world-class networks. In effect, we are doing more for less. And our expected cost synergies from DIRECTV give us even more runway to reduce costs.","We are uniquely positioned as a company. No other company has the assets and capabilities in place that we do. We are confident that our investments have positioned us with a sustainable and efficient long-term leadership position.","With that as background, let me cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on slide four. I'll begin by reminding you that third quarter results include DIRECTV operations since our acquisition as of July 25. These results exclude the first 24 days of DIRECTV operations in July.","Our financial results this quarter provide further support that our strategy is on target. Consolidated revenues, margins, and adjusted earnings all delivered solid growth in the quarter, and our cash flows were exceptionally strong. In the third quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.74. That's up nearly 14% over last year's third quarter. This includes adjustments for mostly non-cash Cricket network decommissioning and DIRECTV merger-related costs.","The strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. Consolidated revenues grew to $39.1 billion. That's up nearly 19% year over year, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. But we grew revenues even if you exclude DIRECTV. And again, this number does not include the first 24 days of DIRECTV revenue, as we are reporting under GAAP accounting. If you add those revenues to our GAAP number, consolidated revenues for the quarter would have been more than $41.2 billion.","Besides DIRECTV, we also had growth from solid gains in our Business Solutions segment, including Strategic Business Services and data and strong IP data revenue growth in our Entertainment & Internet Services segment.","We also had another strong quarter generating cash. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled almost $11 billion, up more than 20% over last year's third quarter. And free cash flow was $5.5 billion. That brought our free cash flow dividend payout ratio to 57% for the year. And when you take a look at the last two quarters, you can see that we're delivering the financial results that we expected when we started to transform our business. Combine the second and third quarters, and you'll see adjusted EPS up more than 12%, $20 billion of cash from operations and $10 billion of free cash flow, and record Mobility EBITDA service margins in each quarter. Those are the kind of financial metrics we are shooting for, and we firmly believe we are positioned to keep that rolling.","Now let's take a look at our operational highlights, starting with Business Solutions on slide five. Our Business Solutions segment includes both wireless and wireline results from our business customers. Mobility is the way business gets done these days, and going to market with a total connectivity solution plays to the strengths of our company. We can see the benefits of this approach in this quarter. Business wireless and Strategic Services revenue growth more than offset declines in legacy wireline products. Wireless revenue growth was driven by gains in both wireless service and equipment revenue. Margins were an even better story. Our focus on profitable revenue growth and cutting costs from the business drove a nearly 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in EBITDA margin.","Breaking the segment down further, we saw revenue growth in three of our four customer categories, enterprise, small business, and the public sector. Our business wireline revenues were down due to pressure from legacy services, but we continued to see growth stabilization in our wireline data revenues. Total data revenues grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and now comprise nearly 60% of wireline business revenues.","Growth in our most advanced data products is outpacing declines in legacy data services. Strategic Business Services revenue grew by more than 12% year over year. And when you adjust for foreign exchange, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 15%.","We also have improving year-over-year wireline small business trends the last few quarters, and that continued in the third quarter. Plus, when you include Mobility Solutions, we actually grew small business revenues. This gives you a better idea of how our Business Solutions team is competing and winning.","Mobility is just one advantage we bring to the business market. We continue to drive fiber deeper into our wireline network. We've deployed fiber to 950,000 new business customer locations. As you can see in our business results, we're just beginning to tap this growth opportunity. Our move to software-defined network architecture is not only allowing us to add compelling new services such as NetBond and Network on Demand, but it's also helping us reduce cycle times and move to a lower-cost capital and operation structure.","Network on Demand has been met with strong customer response. The product allows customers to adjust network bandwidth as needed in real-time. Today it's available in more than 170 cities, driving improvement in cycle times. And we've already signed more than 275 customer deals. Business Solutions focus is making the network on demand, the office mobile, and the cloud highly secure. That's how we're running our business, and we are excited by the results.","Now let me talk about our Entertainment & Internet Solutions (sic) [Services] (11:01) results on slide six. This is basically our former Consumer Wireline business and the DIRECTV U.S. operations. Even though we had DIRECTV only for part of the quarter, the results reflect the growing revenue and increased profitability that we expect to receive. Reported revenue almost doubled year over year.","But even more dramatic was the improvement in margins. Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%. That's up more than 800 basis points year over year. Essentially, we've converted a quality video business with limited scale into an industry leader earning solid margins through our DIRECTV acquisition. And we think there's plenty of room to improve even more with the expected cost synergies from the DTV deal.","During the past few weeks, we have reached a multiyear agreement with Viacom for U-verse and DIRECTV subscribers, and we believe we are on a path for the best content pricing going forward. Our approach is to develop a win-win situation for both us and the content providers, and I encourage them to look at our wireless and broadband assets to widen their distributions. Early results have been promising.","We are also seeing some early success on the revenue synergies. For example, we are selling DIRECTV in virtually all our 2,200 company-owned stores. The next step is launching certified dealers and online as well as ramping up sales in our call centers. It's starting to make an impact. DIRECTV net adds picked up shortly after the deal closed and were solid throughout the rest of the quarter. That drove 26,000 satellite net adds post deal close. We now have more than 25 million video subscribers in the U.S. It's important that we do this right coming out of the gate. We've been holding back much of our cross-selling promotions as we train service reps and technicians for a premium single-service experience, so we will see the benefit of those strategies impact future quarters.","As expected, U-verse video subscribers declined in the quarter. Net adds dropped with fewer promotions and shifting our focus to the lower content cost DIRECTV platform. We added 192,000 IP broadband customers in the quarter, as migrations from our DSL base continued to slow. U-verse video losses also put some pressure on broadband numbers due to our high attachment rates. But we are confident we can work through this as our single-service experience for broadband and satellite is rolled out.","As we said, it's early in our integration of DIRECTV. We don't even have a full quarter of results, yet our integration efforts are on or ahead of target, and early results indicate this deal will prove to be everything we thought it would be and more.","Now let's move to our Mobility results on slide seven. AT&T's Mobility operations are now divided between the Business Solutions and the Customer Wireless segment. That information is in the investor briefing and stat profile. For comparison purposes, the company is also providing supplemental information for its total domestic wireless operations.","Let's start first with the total domestic wireless operations financials. We have a compelling value proposition, great network, superior customer service, and fair pricing. All this sometimes gets lost in the competitive noise. Our focus is to provide the best customer experience while increasing profitability and not just chase customer counts. Our third quarter results drive that point home. We had our highest ever wireless service EBITDA margins at 49.4%. Our Consumer Mobility business helped drive that with service margins of more than 50%. AT&T Next sales are a big part of that success, but we also have been very aggressive in taking costs out of the business and increasing efficiencies in our Cricket operations.","Total wireless revenues were flat year over year. Lower year-over-year smartphone upgrade volumes impacted equipment revenues, and Mobile Share Value plans did the same to service revenues. As expected, with most of the conversion to Mobile Share Value plans behind us, we saw increasing stability with our service revenues, which were essentially flat with second quarter levels.","We also continued to see steady growth of AT&T Next and Mobile Share Value plans. About two-thirds of our postpaid smartphone base is on no-subsidy pricing, with more than 40% on Next. That gives us substantial opportunity to continue to grow equipment revenue as these customers upgrade their smartphones. For the quarter, nearly 80% of the smartphone sales were on Next or BYOD. We also continue to see growing phone-only ARPU plus Next, which increased by nearly 5% year over year. We also turned in another strong net add quarter as postpaid tablets, Cricket, and the connected car drove our highest net adds in nearly five years. Those details are on slide eight.","Total net adds came in at 2.5 million, as we continue to see the impact of our Cricket acquisition and connected car strategy. The company added 289,000 postpaid subscribers with about 620,000 tablets and computing devices. We also had a record 1.6 million connected device net adds. Most of these were connected cars, where we added about 1 million.","But perhaps the biggest story in the quarter had to be our continued strength in premium prepaid. This has been a remarkable turnaround story for us. We added 466,000 prepaid voice subscribers in the quarter after losing subscribers in the year-ago third quarter. These subscriber gains came from both Cricket and our GoPhone products.","We also completed our Cricket network conversion in the quarter. We are seeing Cricket deliver great ARPUs. In fact, the ARPU from Cricket smartphones net adds is nearly $10 more than our postpaid feature phone ARPU losses. We continue to grow our branded smartphone base. We added 1 million in the quarter. Our added voice subscribers were also positive in the quarter.","Total churn was down year over year thanks to lower prepaid churn, even with shutting down the Cricket network. Postpaid churn for the quarter was up year over year, as we focus on higher-value subscribers. However, year-to-date postpaid churn is running at 1.06%, just slightly higher than last year's best ever full-year churn of 1.04%.","Here's another way to look at churn. We are adding premium prepaid subscribers whose ARPU is higher and subsidy costs are lower than postpaid feature phone subscribers who have the highest postpaid churn. And our success in the prepaid market is resulting in improvement in total churn. Cricket gives us a quality prepaid offering for the more value-conscious customer, same great network, quality customer service, and the flexibility prepaid delivers with subscriber acquisition costs that are much lower than our postpaid voice.","Now let's look at our international operations. That information is on slide nine. Our international segment provides wireless services in Mexico and satellite entertainment services in Latin America. Let's start with Mexico. We are taking the first steps in our investment cycle in Mexico and pushing hard to replicate the same great 4G LTE network experience there that we have in the United States. So far we're making great progress. By the end of the third quarter, we've already covered about 29 million people with our 4G LTE network. And as of today, we now cover more than 30 million. This puts us on plan to reach 40 million by the end of the year and provide a high-quality platform to sell on.","Mexico's financials reflect our network investment and the work being done to bring IUSACELL and Nextel's operations together. This is the heavy lifting of the wireless business, but we have done it before, and we are confident we can do it again successfully.","We're also confident that we will grow market share. We have a great leadership team in place and a solid plan not only to deploy the highest quality network but deliver a superb customer experience as well. It's a great opportunity, and the potential synergies of a 400 million POP North American calling area make it even better than we first imagined.","Our Latin American DIRECTV operations are showing solid growth on a local currency basis. But foreign exchange rates, including our decision to adopt the SIMADI rate in Venezuela, are pressuring our results. Revenues, ARPUs, and margins are all pressured by FX, and subscriber results are being hampered by challenging economies in the region. But importantly, our Latin American businesses have cash flows that allow us the opportunity to better position our operations. We'll continue to work through these headwinds and work on operational efficiencies in Latin America.","Now let's move to consolidated margins on slide 10. Our focus on profitable growth is clearly seen in our consolidated margins. Adjusted consolidated operating margins came in at 20.3% in the quarter. This was a dramatic improvement over the year-ago third quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was nearly 200 basis points higher than a year ago.","There were several reasons for this improvement. First, the DIRECTV acquisition increased the profitability of our pay-TV business, but just as important was our focused sales approach in wireless and U-verse video. Project Agile savings also are coming in ahead of plan. Our simplified offers and increased efforts to take care of customers on the first call has produced results. Call volumes in our Mobility centers continue to drop, down an average of 2 million calls a month when compared to the year-ago third quarter.","We also have been highly effective with our cost optimization efforts. That has helped drive down costs for access and in our supply chain. We're also keeping an eye on the force by minimizing outsourcing expenses. Overall force has been managed through voluntary retirement programs, normal attrition, and normal reductions in operations.","Trailing operating expenses from capital investments also were down year over year. We also have been highly efficient with our capital spending and unit costs are decreasing, essentially doing more for less. All this adds up, and DIRECTV gives us an opportunity to expand margins. We have our target to get to $2.5 billion or more in savings. We already are realizing some of that in our content and supplier relationships. We really like our momentum here, and we are confident we can continue to expand margins and cut costs, even with pressure from our international operations.","We also believe healthy cash flows are fundamental to our success. Let's look at slide 11 for those details. We continue to execute and deliver strong cash flows. In fact, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the year. In the third quarter, cash from operations totaled $10.8 billion. That's our best cash generation in 12 quarters. And we generated $26.7 billion in cash year to date. Capital expenditures totaled $5.3 billion, about the same as last year's third quarter. Free cash flow was $5.5 billion and $12.8 billion year to date.","In terms of the uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion, which gives us a dividend payout ratio of 44% for the quarter and 57% for the full year.","Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.28 times, which was better than our original expectations. Our focus is on maintaining a strong balance sheet. We paid down more than $5 billion in debt early, and we still have more than $6 billion of cash on hand. These strong cash flows are a fundamental part of our business. This gives us the financial strength to invest in our business, reduce debt, and return substantial value to our shareholders.","Now let me close with a quick summary and updated guidance on slide 12 before we get to your questions. First, let's address guidance. We are increasing our full-year EPS outlook to the $2.68 to $2.74 range. We also now expect free cash flow to be in the $15 billion range or better this year. All other full-year guidance is reaffirmed. Our focus on profitability is a big reason we're able to do this. In the quarter, we saw growing revenues, expanding margins, and double-digit adjusted EPS growth, but just as important was our ability to generate cash from our business. Cash from operations was strong and free cash flow gave us excellent dividend coverage.","We are seeing positive signs in our largest segment, Business Solutions. Customers appreciate our integrated solutions approach and are migrating to our newest software-defined network services. We also saw our highest ever wireless service EBITDA margins, with an incredible turnaround story in prepaid unfolding. And we closed the DTV acquisition in the third quarter, and the integration process is on target and positioned to exceed expectations.","This is an exciting time for us. We believe we have the pieces in place to redefine our business and our industry.","With that, I will turn it back to Mike so we can get to your questions.","Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, AT&T, Inc.","Okay. Cathy, so we're ready for the Q&A. And if you can queue up the first question, we'd appreciate it.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, that will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Go ahead, please.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. I wanted to touch upon the commentary around cash flow, John, if I may. If we take a look at your raised outlook for the year, it does seem as though there's a little bit of a tempering in the cash generation in the fourth quarter. I would love to hear about what you're spending priorities are, and more specifically how to think about the longer-term cash generation capabilities of the joint entity.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Great, Amir, a couple things. One is there's always some seasonality in the fourth quarter with the holiday sales in our wireless business with the purchase of handsets and so forth. So there's always some seasonality, as you would find also with our wireline, particularly our large business segment. Also, we generally have larger tax payments at the end of the year than we do earlier on, so those are the things that are impacting us. But I would tell you if you do a year-over-year comparison to where we're at and what we're projecting with regard to the $15 billion range or better, I think you'll see that we're continuing to have really good cash flows throughout the rest of this year.","Secondly, with regard to future years, we would stand by what we've said earlier. That is that we expect free cash flow to provide us with a dividend payout ratio that's in the 70%. We're not moving away from that. We're not shying away from that at all, and expect that to continue to be the case. We're certainly proud of these results and glad that we exceeded what we had promised, but we're going to be careful and prudent in predicting our results as we go forward. But we're real excited about where we stand and the future cash generation of this business.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. And then if I may, a follow-up here in thinking object the joint entity moving forward, particularly when it comes to the potential opportunities with positioning the company and targeting your end markets. At your analyst update, you had highlighted that there are areas for potential cross-synergies, revenue synergies and opportunities. Specifically, I'm thinking about the 15 million DIRECTV households that don't have access to AT&T Wireless services. I was wondering if you can give us some color in terms of how you plan on going after that opportunity and how we should think about leveraging the breadth of the full portfolio to target areas where you may have one subscriber on one service and not on the other.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Right, let me take that quickly. First of all, the first revenue synergy that we've really gone after and we've seen good success and, quite frankly, we're very excited about the results is in the cross-selling of DIRECTV as a satellite product in our company-owned stores. We have about 2,300 company-owned stores, and virtually all of them are actively selling DIRECTV now. And some of them never sold a video product before, so we had to do some training and some learning. But what we found as we came through the quarter, we were able to sell more and more out of those stores. And we got very optimistic about it, and it gives us optimism for the fourth quarter. So that sales effort and that first line of synergy, if you will, from revenue opportunities from the retail distribution chain is working, and we're real optimistic about it.","The second one with regard to cross-selling DIRECTV and the wireless customers, we needed to go through a process of making sure our privacy policies and a bunch of other administrative policies were lined up consistently, so customers had a seamless experience and an easy experience. We've done all that, and I think we've now got in place one of our call centers to service those customers on an integrated basis, and we're moving forward with starting to sell that.","Based on the really great news we saw from the retail chain, we're really optimistic about seeing those sales results unfold in the fourth quarter and next year.","The last thing is our service technicians have been installing broadband for us or U-verse for us, but they haven't been installing DIRECTV. So we've been putting them through a training program, and we're expecting that to roll out, the first set of technicians to roll out after fully trained on installing satellite in the home, in probably November or so, the early part of November, such that we will then be able to sell a single truck roll installation for broadband and video. We're very excited about that. It will be a measured approach. We're going to have to \u2013 we don't have everybody trained on the first day. But we're excited about what that will bring and think that will bring some not only good performance in the fourth quarter, but quite frankly, really look forward to that kind of performance, positive performance and impact next year. So that's the way we're thinking about some of those things, Amir.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for taking the questions.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","No problem.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS. Go ahead, please.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. If we could focus a little bit on the guidance, first of all, John, is it possible for you to give us where we are on a year-to-date basis in terms of the $2.68 to $2.74? And then maybe what's driving the change in terms of is it just wireless margins that they were definitely ahead of where we were, or are you realizing synergies faster or if there are any other moving parts would be great? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah. So we're at the $2.09 mark today, and that was ahead of our prior plans. As you know, the $0.74 was ahead \u2013 I'll say it was ahead of our most recent plans. That has really been driven by cost efficiency. And it's driven by savings across the board, whether it's a lower number of calls into the call centers, whether it's the really top-notch performance of our Digital First initiatives, whether it's the streamlining of our installation process through our, what we call Project Halo or High Automation Low Overhead process, whether it's the software-defined networks. All of those things, whether it's just blocking and tackling, taking calls into the call center and getting answers right the first time, all of those things, all of those things are driving cost savings.","And we have seen some better performance, as I mentioned, in our Business Solutions. Our Business Solutions team is really doing well in a tough economy, particularly in the enterprise and the public sector space, but really, really well in the small business space. And that gives us optimism. As we mentioned with wireless, we're seeing growth in that area. But we are seeing the acceptance of our Network on Demand, our NetBond, our software-defined networks all moving customers in a positive direction. So it's all of those things giving us optimism for the fourth quarter. With that being said, certainly wireless and its performance goes without question that it is helping drive earnings performance.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. John, maybe just to dig a little bit into the churn commentary, your thoughts on whether or not we're seeing a spike up in involuntary. And then how does that pace out if we look at the feature phone subs? Are those the ones that I'm assuming most at risk there?","And then secondly, just on the ARPU side, I know last quarter you benefited from year-over-year easy comps. I'm assuming that as we get into the fourth quarter, we should restart that trajectory and year-over-year declines getting better?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Let me take them separately, Mike. On the churn, first and foremost, yes, the feature phone churn is hitting us and having an impact on us, and those are decisions we made not to chase those customers. Can't make the math work on not only the pricing for those customers but the impact throughout our base. But secondly, we believe that we're picking that up and showing tremendous improvement in the prepaid space with Cricket. So we are seeing total churn come down, which I think is really important.","With regard to ARPUs, we did have an easier comparison in second quarter of 2015 to second quarter of 2014 because of some promotional activities that took place in second quarter of 2014. But we've seen stabilization in our ARPUs and in our total service revenues, so we feel optimistic about the business going forward. But once again, we're going to be focused on profitable growth, not just chasing customer counts or specific targets. We're going to really be focused on just getting the most profits out of the business.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","John, just a quick follow-up on the churn commentary. Is there anything happening on the involuntary side that you're seeing there?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","No, Mike, I wouldn't turn you to that. We haven't seen a significant change in bad debts. I'd like to point or forced off (36:48). I wouldn't point to that. Our customer base is \u2013 quite frankly, we're very lucky to have the quality customer base we have. We're very fortunate.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, John","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks. So first on EPS, should we be thinking for 2016 of the mid-single digit or better off of the $2.71 midpoint, or should we be thinking about it a different way given the DTV deal? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Phil, let's look at it this way. We're not changing our guidance for 2016 going forward, so the mid-single-digit growth rate is still good.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","The $2.71 is the...","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","I'm not going to refer to \u2013 it's still good even with this adjusted guidance.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, so $2.71 is the right starting point. Thanks. And then on Project Agile, can you give us an update on what the overall cost-cutting level is here and how we should think about that pacing in the next few years?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","I'd say this. We're going to expect it to continue growing over the next few years. What we had said originally was that we were shooting for $3 billion of cost savings. I would suggest to you that we're probably somewhere between a third and a half of the way there, and that we plan to at least get there, get to that total target or exceed it. And then I'd point to the $2.5 billion of targeted DTV merger synergies. And certainly based on what we know now, we expect to see us get there or exceed those. So those would be the two points.","I would hope that we could exceed the Project Agile targets based on the progress we've made so far. These efforts do take time and investment, and we've been spending that time and investment over the last couple years to get here. We're seeing the results pay off. We're going to keep our focus in this direction, but we would hope to be able to exceed it.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you very much. Good evening. John, can you talk a little bit about the video momentum? And you went through some of the channel changes here. On a net basis you did have subscriber losses, but I think you said before that you're hoping to grow your video subscribers over time. So perhaps you can just take us through the quarter and you showed some good gross adds on the DTV side. What's going on there with churn, and when do you expect to return to positive video adds? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Simon, good question. I think we had a slide on this with a chart that can tell you what was going on. Prior to the deal, there was some real pressure in the satellite video area. Performance was less than it had been last year. And then as you see it coming out after the merger and after we started rolling out sales in the stores, you could see that we really picked up the trend, and we expect that to continue. Secondly, with the rollout this quarter of the, if you will, one-truck roll or single-service experience where we can install TV and broadband at the same time, we not only expect the satellite TV to pick up, but we also expect the broadband, IP broadband, to pick up because people buy those things together.","And so we're hopeful that we're going to see \u2013 we'll be able to show you some improvements and trend improvements continuing off of the third quarter in the fourth quarter. I won't make any predictions about specific levels, but we are optimistic with what we've seen so far. We think the trends are headed in the right direction. And we think the slide that we put together that shows that differentiation between 2014 and 2015 will give you good insight into that.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And the U-verse decline, is that run rate or is that all the gross adds shifting to DIRECTV, or is that a churn issue as well?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","U-verse is a couple things. One, certainly the lower-cost platform has been our first choice for net adds. Two, because of our focus on profitability, we really got away from promotional pricing, and those customers who were cost-sensitive just had a propensity to churn. When you first put those steps in place, we saw a little bit of higher churn in the second quarter. We're seeing a little bit higher in the third quarter because of that disciplined approach. But I would tell you that I think we still have a solid, very good, very high-quality customer base in U-verse, and we're certainly looking to continue to serve those customers with the best products and services. I think we're focused on lowering churn and keeping those customers quite satisfied.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just a quick point of clarification and then a question. You talk about the fulfillment accounting methodology change in the slide. Is that your previous methodology change from August, or was there something new?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Brett, that's the same change. And if I could, before you ask your question, let me give you guys some insights on it. On a year-over-year basis in this quarter, the fulfillment accounting had about a $0.02 impact. That is the differential between applying it to DIRECTV and U-verse this quarter as opposed to just applying it to the U-verse product last third quarter of 2014, and so that did give us some help.","Additionally in this quarter, I want to point out. We had about $0.01 of help from the CAF [Connect America Fund] funding activity that went on and what we applied for. By the same token, we had about $0.01 of hurt or pressure from the Mexico operations that we didn't have last year. And if you look at our income tax expense, except for setting aside anything that we treated otherwise, there's about $0.02 of income tax pressure, EPS pressure from income taxes. So when you look at the fulfillment accounting and the other unique items that occurred, they balance off with the CAF funding and fulfillment accounting generating about $0.03 of benefits, and Mexico and the income tax was generating about $0.03 of pressure. So we treated those all as going \u2013 because they're going to be going forward, because they're going to be continuing, I want to make sure I pointed that out.","With that being said, Brett, I interrupted you before you got to ask your question. I apologize.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, that was helpful. The question is we have a lot of new data points and disclosures that we had fun modeling tonight. But one of the things that we see here is we have video ARPU and we have IP broadband ARPU trends in your new Entertainment segment. And I guess as you think about your strategy going forward, your bundling strategy, do you have any guidance you can offer us to think about the right way to think of the trajectory of those two key items because they're so critical to the revenue outlook for that segment?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","I think we're going to be looking to continuing to protect and improve on the trends that we've seen from growing those ARPUs. But likewise, with these assets that we have in place, I would suggest to you that our ability to capture the market, we're in a very good position to capture the market now that we have video where we had broadband before without any video, and now that we have broadband where DIRECTV had video but didn't have broadband before. So I want to suggest to you that we are going to look for profitable growth and focus on that, but we are excited. We are positive about the fact that in some of those cases, we have some growing ARPUs.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So just to be clear, it sounds like you're really excited about the opportunity to add more customer or more revenue generating units. That's going to be a big piece of how we think about shaping revenue growth through that segment.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","We are very much \u2013 we're very excited about the ability to add customers, absolutely. I don't want to suggest that we're not going to focus on profitable customers; certainly we are. But we're very excited about the opportunities. I'll go back to the cross-selling opportunities. I go back to \u2013 we've got high-quality video products, and we've got a high-quality wireless network and high-quality broadband capabilities, and they have capacity in all of them. And so that's a great way to expand your profits, by expanding the customers on those investments that you've already completed.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you for the color.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead, please.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could. Just first, John, a little bit following up on that question, just in terms of looking at the new way that AT&T is presenting itself to the marketplace, should we be looking at modeling the wireless business separately and the consumer business as giving us two very unique pictures of two very unique businesses, or is this really just AT&T Wireless the way it's always been run and we really should just be thinking about dividing it between the two pieces? That would be the first one.","And the second one is on CapEx. There are so many now new parts of the business. Could you give us how CapEx is now being allocated between the Latin America, Mexico, and the domestic business units, and how we should think about all those different pieces trending? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","So a couple things. One, David, for investor and analyst ease, we've provided total wireless and then provided the consumer wireless, the ability to get to the business wireless, and we've tried to be very upfront with regard to our financial presentation. So hopefully we've been successful with that. But we tried to do that to make sure you had that information. Two, I would suggest to you that as you look at it, the margins and the EBITDAs and profitabilities are \u2013 they are certainly different but they're not materially different. They don't significantly skew one way or the other. So I'd just make that observation for you.","With regard to how you model, I'll leave that to you guys' modeling. I can tell you the way we focused on it is what the business relationships we're selling and what our consumer relationships we're selling, and that's how we focused on it. But I think the information is there to do it either way. And I think it's going to be a matter of what you're most comfortable with. As we go forward and we see the platform we built with connected devices start showing more growth even than it already has, it will be beneficial for everyone to have this split.","With regard to CapEx, I won't get into specific dollars on a quarterly basis, but I'll give you these insights. On DTV Latin America, our Latin America properties, I would expect that they will be generally self-sufficient; that the cash flows that they generate will be self-sufficient to cover their CapEx needs. I would suggest to you if we have customer growth opportunities, we'll be prudent about that and make sure that we don't miss out on a good customer. But generally speaking, it's going to be self-sufficient from a cash perspective.","On Mexico, I would suggest to you that the $3 billion we announced some months ago with regard to the build-out is still a good number. We've started on that process. I won't tell you that every POP, every 4G LTE POP costs the same amount to create. Some of the networks were more advanced, and so some of the earlier achievement may be at a more efficient cost, unit cost. But I would suggest to you that $3 billion is still a good number.","And then we'll continue to invest, albeit at a slower rate, because we've built the platforms out. We'll continue to invest in fiber, in wireless capacity, and in success-based capital for DIRECTV \u2013 for our satellite video product, much in the same way you would have seen us in the past taking into account the fact that the ramp-up in CapEx for VIP is now behind us. We've gotten to \u2013 we're 950,000 business customer locations passed with fiber. We committed to 1 million. We'll get to the 1 million, but that's the only piece that isn't done.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Go ahead, please.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes, thank you all very much. I was hoping that we could spend a bit more time talking about churn. It seems as though there are some natural feature phone issues that are on the postpaid side anyway. Prepaid is faring quite well. Could you help us understand if we should be expecting more of that across the industry? Is this an AT&T-specific item that will stick us with for a few quarters, or how we should see that?","And then secondly, I'm wondering on the DIRECTV synergies. What might be the first opportunity that you would have to update us on whether you are on or ahead of plan for that $2.5 billion? Thank you.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Sure. On the feature phone phenomenon, I would tell you that yes, our base of feature phones continues to get smaller. So over time, we'll lessen the impact this has on our churn.","Secondly, Jeff, I would leave it to you guys to talk about it or to decide whether others in the industry are taking this approach. It appears to us from where we see customers moving around that some of the other carriers are not taking the same approach, and they're focused more on customer counts than they are necessarily on the profitability of the customers. But I think you would be the better judge of figuring that out. And I say that based on the offers I see that we are dealing with and the noise in the market.","On the $2.5 billion, I think first and foremost, you'll see it in our results. But with regard to updating you, I think we'll continue to update you on the process like we've done today where we talked about how the retail stores are generating sales exceeding our expectations, how the single-truck roll is going to start rolling out November, those kinds of things. And I think you'll see us also update you like we did with the Viacom announcement where we basically said that we're going to get best-in-industry pricing for our platform. And so that would imply that we are getting to or meeting or exceeding our synergy targets.","With regard to specifically reporting on the $2.5 billion number, I don't expect to be doing that the rest of this year or early next year because we are still in the midst of really getting it done, and we're more focused on getting it done than we are on reporting out on what it is.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much, and we'll try and sort it out. You aren't making it easy for me in my first quarter, but I'm doing my best. Thank you.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","I'm sorry about that, Jeff.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","No, no. I'm delighted to be here.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","We're trying to make it as easy \u2013 we really did put the financial statements together in a way to try to make it as easy as possible to see.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you, I appreciate it.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","So we'll do our best.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks for taking the questions, two if I could. First, going back to the 2016 guidance where you described improving free cash flow, I was curious if that relates back to the free cash flow guidance in August. Or does that now refer to the updated free cash flow guidance for 2015?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","That applied to the free cash flow guidance of $13 billion or better.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then secondly, can you just talk about in wireless how you're thinking about device installments versus the possibility of using leases as an alternative financing mechanism for customers, and how you see the environment evolving competitively for your mobile smartphone customers? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Mike, good question. First and foremost, with regard to installment plan versus a lease, we certainly have the financial capability and wherewithal to manage either one, to do either one, and we're open to it. But quite frankly, right now our customers seem quite pleased with the installment program. And simply put, they seem to like it because at the end of their term, they own the phone. And the phones have continued use and functionality for them, and they continue to use that. And to some extent, we're seeing a side of that from this continued use of bring your own device activities in our company where people are bringing in devices that they already own and hooking them up to our network.","But from a company perspective, it's more of a decision, and Ralph de la Vega and Glenn Lurie and the team follow it really closely. It's more about what the customers want. And if we see that the customers are going to want that program, we'll certainly consider \u2013 we certainly have the capability to do it. But right now we believe that the customers' satisfaction comes from that ability to own the phone at the end of that agreed-to term, and they feel real comfortable about that. And quite frankly, the difference in price I don't think is measurable from a lease to the \u2013 depending upon what situation you have. But when you get down to the real costs of it, it seems like it's worked out well for us by doing the installment plan.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Sure.","Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, AT&T, Inc.","Cathy, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great, thanks for taking the question, two if I could. First on wireless and just following up, broadly do you see value in actually selling the phone to the customer? In other words, does it matter whether somebody gets their new iPhone from you or orders it from Apple and it sits on their books?","And secondly on broadband, a couple quarters now where you're overall losing customers. Can you just give us a little insight on what the trends are in DSL and particularly where those losses are coming? Are those people in areas where you don't offer U-verse, or is it additional migration over to U-verse in areas where you do offer it? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Sure. On the value side of customers, it's more about being able to provide in the stores a full scope customer experience and take care of all their needs. That's what we're concerned about. From a perspective of \u2013 if they buy the phones somewhere else and bring it to us, we're thrilled with serving them in that way. We don't have the cost of handling the phone or we don't quite frankly have the cost of financing the phone either on an installment plan or through a subsidized program. So we're open to it. Right now on the equipment installment program that Apple has, they sent us a high number of phones through that program, and that's fine. We love to serve our customers that way. And if that's how they choose to buy the phones through Apple and Apple finances them, that's something we can definitely work with. So it's really more about what does the customer want, and how we make sure that we provide choices and services to make it easy for our customers.","With regard to our broadband trends and specifically in DSL, the first comment I'd make to you is over the last few years, the real trend has been a migration from DSL to IP broadband. And that's been something that we've encouraged ourselves, and we're beginning to complete that process or near completion where the DSL customers we have left is a much lower percentage that have IP broadband capabilities from us. So we are through that migration process.","And then secondly, they don't have television in these areas, or I should say we didn't have a video offering. These were generally out of the U-verse footprint, but now we do. And now we'll be able to provide them with a video offering through DIRECTV, and we're very pleased with that. So we are hopeful that now this nationwide video service will help us in improving our overall broadband positioning. But particularly our U-verse broadband footprint where we have the higher speeds and where customers generally buy video and broadband together, we now can sell that together. So that's how we're thinking about it. That's how we look to it.","I'm going to tell you. I think on the consumer side we're down into the 2 million range on total DSL customers. That's not I think the exact number. It will be on the stat profile. But I would suggest to you it has changed dramatically over the course of four or five years, where it used to be 90%-plus of our broadband base and now it's a much lower percentage. So we've gone through that migration not completely, but almost completely.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great, thank you.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Thank you.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","With that, I want to thank all of you for being on the call today, and I'll just give you a few closing comments before we go. The third quarter clearly delivered on our transformation strategy. We saw double-digit growth in our key financial metrics, including another outstanding free cash flow quarter.","The integration of DIRECTV is also on track. We expect to meet or beat our $2.5 billion cost synergy target, and we're just beginning to unleash potential promotional activities to drive bundled sales. You can see our increased confidence in the guidance update, where we raised our adjusted EPS and free cash flow expectations for the year. We believe this is just the beginning. We are positioned as a unique competitor and the first scaled communications and video provider to offer fully-integrated nationwide products, and we fully expect to increase our momentum as we go forward.","Thanks again for being on the call.

[Operator Instructions] Just as a brief reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Michael Viola, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael Viola","Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I\u2019m Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and John Stephens, AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Rand will provide an update of our key 2019 initiatives, and John will cover our operating results. And then, we will follow that up with a Q&A session.","Before we begin, I want to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they\u2019re subject to risks and uncertainties, results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations website.","I also want to remind you that we\u2019re in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum Auction 103, so we can\u2019t address any questions about that today. As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, that includes our news release, investor briefing, 8-K, associated schedules, etcetera. And one more item before I turn it over to Randall, we\u2019ve scheduled our WarnerMedia Day for the afternoon of October 29 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. We will discuss more details on the new streaming service, HBO Max, and more details will come, but go ahead and mark your calendars.","And so, with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Randall Stephenson.","Randall Stephenson","Thanks, Mike. Good morning. The headline of the second quarter and the first half of the year is we\u2019re hitting each of our commitments we made for 2019, and you can see those on Slide 3. I\u2019ll start with our new leveraging plans, which are right on track. Since we close the merger last June, net debt is down $18 billion. We expect to further reduce net debt about another $12 billion in the second half of the year, and that should get us to a 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA range by year-end. And to the extent that we can overachieve on that objective, you can expect we\u2019ll take a hard look at allocating capital to share buybacks in the back half of the year.","Wireless is about half of our overall EBITDA and it continues to fire on all cylinders. Last quarter, we grew revenues, EBITDA, and phone subscribers both postpaid and prepaid. Wireless service revenues were up 2.4% in the second quarter and we\u2019re continuing to see the payoff on our investments with a world-class network.","Our wireless network has been named fastest, the best and the most reliable by independent testing services. FirstNet continues to be the driver of our network performance as well as our 5G leadership. And at the end of the quarter, we were about 60% complete with our FirstNet coverage, ahead of plan. And we are now targeting 70% completion by year-end.","And our FirstNet build is accelerating our 5G deployment, as we deployed FirstNet, we\u2019re installing hardware that can be upgraded to 5G with a simple software release. As a result, we\u2019re on track for nationwide 5G coverage by the first half of 2020.","Turning to WarnerMedia, there was another strong quarter, merger synergies remain on track and we had solid operating income growth across all three business units. This was a record year, 191 Primetime Emmy nominations for WarnerMedia and HBO alone scored 137 nominations. That was the most in its history. So, what was the result of all of this?","We had very strong HBO digital subscriber growth in the quarter, and we\u2019re setup really well for the second half of the year. Bottom line, HBO\u2019s stepped up investment in content is working. And this will be critical as we launched HBO Max next spring. And as Mike mentioned, we look forward to share a more about HBO Max in October.","Our Entertainment Group continues to make solid progress, we didn\u2019t just stabilize EBITDA, we actually grew it by 1.1% in the quarter. Later this summer, we\u2019ll beta launch AT&T TV in a few markets, that\u2019s our live TV service over broadband. We have some really high expectations for this product, and we\u2019re going to learn from the pilot, and then we\u2019ll expand to more cities as we go to the year.","IP broadband revenue growth remain strong, we continue to see a solid growth in our AT&T Fiber product. That product now reaches about 14 million customer locations or 22 million when you include businesses. So, all in all solid, steady progress against the commitments we made coming into the year. And appealing even more confident that we\u2019re going to meet or exceed each of those commitments for the full year. In fact, this morning, we\u2019ve raised our free cash flow guidance for 2019 to the $28 billion range, that\u2019s up $2 billion and we\u2019ve reaffirmed all of our other guidance for the year.","So now for more detail on the quarter, I\u2019m going to turn this over to John, and he\u2019ll take you through the results. So, John?","John Stephens","Thank you, Randall, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our financial summary on Slide 5. As Randall mentioned, we\u2019re on track with all our financial targets. And in many areas, we\u2019re ahead of plan. Adjusted EPS was $0.89 in the quarter, including $0.02 impact from a higher effective tax rate. We continue to expect low-single-digit growth for the full year, as we are set up for a solid second half of the year performance.","We grew revenue both on a reported and pro forma basis in the quarter. In fact, all segments are growing on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin was up 90 basis points with the addition of WarnerMedia, strong growth in Mobility, and continued improvement in our Entertainment Group.","Our cash flows were very strong on the quarter. Let\u2019s look at this on Slide 6. Cash from operations came in strong at $14.3 billion, that\u2019s up 40% and free cash flow was a record $8.8 billion. The addition of WarnerMedia operations made and impact, as did adding their receivables to our securitization efforts. The securitization lifted free cash flow by $2.6 billion. Our ability to generate cash continues to be impressive.","Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve generated $29 billion in free cash flow or about $4 a share. With the benefit of our securitization efforts, we have confidence to raise our free cash flow guidance for the full year to the $28 billion range. Our strong cash position also allows us to continue to invest at industry leading levels. CapEx was $5.5 billion and total capital investment was $6.5 billion, when you include the $1 billion of payments for prior vendor financing activity. And we reduced net debt by $6.8 billion in the quarter.","Let me speak more to deleveraging on Slide 7. We paid-off $18 billion in debt since we closed the merger, and we ended the quarter with our adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio at just under 2.7 times. This is down from 3 times leverage ratio, when we close the deal. And we\u2019re squarely on track to hit our year-end target of being in the 2.5 times range.","Year-to-date, we\u2019ve reduced net debt by nearly $9 billion, that includes about $7 billion from free cash flow and nearly $4 billion in asset monetizations, offset by about $2 billion of vendor payments and other purchases of assets. And these sales have come from assets that contribute no EBITDA.","Looking at the remainder of the year, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll hit our year-end leverage target. To the extent, we can overachieve with that target you can expect will take a hard look at allocating capital to share buybacks in the back half of the year.","Let\u2019s now look at our segment operating results starting with our Communications segment on Slide 8. The story of our Communications segments this quarter is stable revenue [Technical Difficulty] EBITDA and margin growth, while adding phone subscribers.","Our Entertainment Group is delivering EBITDA growth. And Business Wireline revenue trends improved in the quarter, thanks to strength in strategic and managed services and about $125 million from IP licensing. But even without those licensing proceeds, Business Wireline revenue trends were the best that we\u2019ve seen in years. And when you factor in strong Business Wireless performance, our Business Solutions revenue grew 2.3%.","On the cost side between, the team is doing great work in controlling content, promotions and other operating costs. Solid cost management was evident throughout the business, especially in our Entertainment and Business Wireline units.","Let me give you some more details starting with Mobility on Slide 9. Our Mobility business continues to perform very well. Service revenues grew by 2.4%, EBITDA growth was even higher at 3.1% and EBITDA margins expanded by 80 basis points with service margins of 56.1%.","We had a strong quarter with 355,000 phone net adds, including 72,000 postpaid and 283,000 prepaid. And we added 388,000 smartphones in the quarter further strengthening our customer base. Postpaid phone trend was up slightly to 0.86%, but was down sequentially.","And at the same time, our prepaid business, especially Cricket continues to perform at strong consistent levels. Prepaid revenues were up nearly 10%, we had our 18th consecutive quarter of phone growth, and churn hit an all-time low at both cricket and AT&T prepaid. With the network leadership and FirstNet expansion that Randall talked about earlier, we\u2019re confident that our wireless business will get even stronger as we evolve to 5G. In short, our network investments particularly our spectrum deployment are paying off, and we\u2019re not done yet.","Now let\u2019s go on to our Entertainment Group results on Slide 10. Our focus on long-term customer value continues to impact our Entertainment Group. EBITDA grew both year-over-year and sequentially. This was the second straight quarter of EBITDA growth. Year-to-date EBITDA was up about 4%.","Expense reduction outpaced revenue declines, setting the stage for EBITDA growth. Broadband revenue growth helped us as well as continued growth in video ARPUs. The number of premium TV customers on the two-year price lock declined by more than 600,000 in the quarter.","Video subscriber numbers were in line with what we said to expect for the quarter. Premium declined 778,000 and DIRECTV NOW declined 168,000. And as Randall mentioned earlier, later the summer, we\u2019ll begin piloting AT&T TV, our thin client broadband TV product, the best important milestone with our fiber deployment reaching $14 million customer locations, and satisfying our fiber build commitments. This will be an important driver of growth going forward. In fact, we had more than 300,000 AT&T fiber net adds in the quarter, and IP broadband revenue grew by 6.5%.","We expect AT&T fiber penetration to grow as the service matures. Bottom line, we remain comfortable that we\u2019ll meet or exceed our Entertainment Group EBITDA that target for the full year. And lay the groundwork for continued stability beyond 2019.","Let\u2019s move to WarnerMedias\u2019 results, which are on Slide 11. WarnerMedia continues to be free cash flow accretive. Our expense management with merger-related synergies are on track. We expect to hit a $700 million run rate by the end of this year. And HBO Max is slated to launch next spring. Overall, WarnerMedia had another strong quarter with 5.5% revenue growth and solid operating income growth. HBO revenues grew, thanks to strong content sales, driven by home entertainment and international licensing.","Turner revenues were up about 2% on subscription revenue growth, and this includes the advertising impact of not having the NCAA Men\u2019s Final Four championship this year. It will be back on Turner next year. And at Warner Bros., theatrical revenues increased due to home entertainment games and a highly successful release of Mortal Kombat 11, which drove game revenues.","With that, Mike, we\u2019re now ready to take questions.","Michael Viola","Operator, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And looks like first, we have the line of John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.","John Hodulik","Great. Thank you. Maybe some questions on the Entertainment segment. And specifically, on the video subs. John, you said you\u2019ve got about another 1 million subs left on the promotions. When did those promotions expire? And maybe if you could comment a little bit on the programming disputes you\u2019re having with CBS and Nexstar. One, is this \u2013 is expectations for resolution there driving some of the belief and continued growth in EBITDA in that segment? And then, how do you expect that to impact the sub trends as we look into the second half of the year? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","Hi, John. It\u2019s Randall. I\u2019ll take the carriage disputes that are going on with CBS and Nexstar first, and I\u2019ll hand it to John, let him just kind of reconcile the subscriber numbers for you. As everybody probably knows, CBS has pulled their signal off DIRECTV as has Nexstar. And there are two very different situations.","On CBS, it\u2019s kind of an interesting situation. The bid asked candidly is not that wide. But it\u2019s kind of an interesting dynamic with them. We sent \u2013 that was a reasonable fair offer over five days ago, and it\u2019s been Cricket\u2019s. We haven\u2019t heard anything, haven\u2019t yet had a response to the offer. When you\u2019re as close as we are, we find a little interesting that we\u2019re still sitting here dark and not having interaction with CBS. I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re probably distracted with other negotiations right now, but I don\u2019t know.","Nexstar, it\u2019s a very different situation. Nexstar, as you know basically their product is broadcast, the four big broadcast stations free-over-the-air content, I might point out, and their opening bid in the negotiations like a 100% increase. And not only was it a 100% increase, but the assets that they\u2019re trying to acquire that they don\u2019t yet own yet. They were asking for a rather significant increase on assets they don\u2019t own. So, it began with kind of a nonstarter. They\u2019ve pulled their signal and gone dark.","Now the spread is they\u2019re asking for a 50% increase on broadcast channels that again are free over the air. And so that one may take longer, but we\u2019ll just have to be a resolute on this one. We\u2019re just not going to impose those kind of price increases on our customers. And interestingly enough, unlike other times we have gone through these type of blackouts where companies have pulled their signal.","Our customers and world of streaming are finding other ways to access this content. And so, there\u2019s other technologies, these technologies can even flow right into the programming guide in our DIRECTV lineup and some customers are at a pretty significant rate finding other ways of getting to that content, so that one could take a while. CBS, I\u2019m optimistic, but hopefully we\u2019re just going to back to the table and get this closed.","John Stephens","John, taking that forward, we\u2019ve got about a 1 million customers left, as I mentioned on these price locks, and those price locks expire in the fourth quarter. Pretty much ratably I\u2019d say throughout the second half of the year. But in November, as they closed out, and we expect to have through the process by the end of this year, so we\u2019d expect to continue to see some of the impacts of getting to this value based long-term customer value approach that we\u2019ve taken on those customers and continue to see some of the same trends we\u2019ve seen.","Additionally, we have \u2013 as you\u2019ve seen the EBITDA grow and the performance of the business being really solid, certainly stable, but solid in my mind. You can see that; we believe that this value of customer long-term value customer approach is working. So, on the intake side, we\u2019re going to continue to file that, and that will also continue to lead us to some working through the rest of this year.","But that being said, we\u2019re encouraged about our early insights in the AT&T TV. We\u2019re encouraged about the ability to get out of the beta, learn from it, and take it forward the rest of this year. So, when I look at 2020, and we\u2019ve been through the two year price locks, we\u2019ve been through a full year of adding a long-term value based customer and we have the potential to use AT&T TV.","We have more optimistic expectations for 2020 that gives us the basis to believe that our margins will continue to be stable next year.","Randall Stephenson","And just most importantly, what John just went through is, as we come out of back end of 2019 and the customer base is cleaned up. We will have a customer base that is going to be perfectly suited for HBO Max. And we really had a really strong second quarter with HBO. And I got to tell you what we saw on HBO in the second quarter, particularly on the digital subscriptions that were added, we\u2019re gaining more and more confidence that this DIRECTV base, as we come out of 2019 is going to be ideally suited for driving HBO, HBO Max penetration as we launch that next year.","John Hodulik","Thanks a lot, gentlemen.","Randall Stephenson","Thanks for the question, John. We\u2019ll take the next question, operator.","Operator","And next in queue, we\u2019ll go to the line of Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Philip Cusick","Hey, guys. Thanks. Following up there, you\u2019ve given through the second quarter some thoughts about typical seasonality in video losses in 2Q versus 1Q, and it came through around that 100,000. How do you think about typical video losses in 3Q versus 2Q? And should we expect a continued sort of subdued level of promotion in video until you get to the wider AT&T TV launch?","John Stephens","Yeah, Phil. I think, you should expect \u2013 as you call it subdued or what we call at the long-term value focus promotional activity, I think that\u2019s right. You should expect that. We have some normal summer activity with video, I wouldn\u2019t expect that to change. What I would tell you though is the balancing of that with the same number of customers, the amount of customers getting off these two-year price locks.","Putting that together, what I\u2019m trying to say is, we\u2019d expect this level of losses to continue and are predicting what they are, but we need to get through this 1 million customers base and some of the other, if you will, less the value-conscious-focused promotions that we\u2019ve done in prior years. We need to get through those that will take us through the end of the year to do that.","The positive side of that is, I don\u2019t know what AT&T TV is going to do for us. I think, it\u2019s going to be a focus of real results in 2020, because we\u2019re going to roll it out later this quarter and then we\u2019ll test it. But you can be assured, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on this long-term value of the customer.","Operator","And next up in queue, we have the line of Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thank you very much. Turning to the balance sheet on the buybacks, can you help us think about, how you\u2019re going to balance buybacks versus continued deleveraging once you get to the 2.5, where do you \u2013 where would you like to end up on the balance sheet and how are you going to divide your free cash flow between the two?","And then if you could update us on the $6 billion to $8 billion of net asset sales, you\u2019ve obviously sold almost $4 billion already. But where do you see that trending at this point? Thanks.","John Stephens","So, Simon, I want to take the asset sales first. Feel really good about where we\u2019re at. The \u2013 and I bucket them \u2013 I put them in two buckets. One is a straight asset sales, Hulu and Hudson Yards, and that was the $4 billion. But we\u2019ve also done a whole collection of other working capital impacts just like the WarnerMedia securitizations, a whole collection of that kind of activity. So, we feel really good where we\u2019re at.","With regard to the asset sales, we\u2019re \u2013 I think, it\u2019s public knowledge that we\u2019re out there selling our collection of about 1,300 U.S. cell towers that we still have, we still own. We have a whole collection over a 1,000 cell towers in Mexico. We probably have 250 parcels of real estate with a couple of $100 million in the contract. We have an equity investment in the company called CME and their independent board is reviewing their strategic alternatives.","So, we\u2019ve got a whole collection of things that\u2019s not all of them, but we\u2019ve got a whole collection of things that gives us confidence in meeting that $6 billion to $8 billion range, and hopefully doing very well with regard to that $6 billion to $8 billion target.","And I\u2019ll remind you that that\u2019s on a net basis, too, so we\u2019re expecting to cover the investment we made in millimeter wave this year in the 24 auctions. So, the $6 billion to $8 billion target is going to include being to pay for that with the proceeds. We just got a lot of opportunities, we feel good about it, and I\u2019ll leave that with that.","With regard to the balance sheet, I think, if you can think about as we talked about after \u2013 the fourth year after the close of the deal. We look to be \u2013 I\u2019d expect, we\u2019d be somewhere around the 2.0 range or below that gives us great flexibility to pay down debt and take advantage of what now is a higher cash cost of equity capital than the cash cost of our debt capital. So, when you look at out of very methodical basis, right now, the cash flows of the overall operation on an after dividend basis can be enhanced by shifting some of your focus from debt repayment to buyback.","But I want to make sure, we stay focused on the fact that we\u2019re going to achieve, we expect to achieve our guidance. And we\u2019ll get there and that is our focus \u2013 primary focus right now to make sure we look [ph] that. We\u2019re well on track, we feel good. I think you can tell that just by the fact that we just raised our guidance on free cash flow. But that\u2019s how we think about it. So, these are historically low interest rate environment, and operating at these levels has been something we can very reasonably do, periodically we do and feel very comfortable about.","Randall Stephenson","Thanks. Simon.","Operator","And next up in queue, we have the line of David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","David Barden","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, the first one would be it\u2019s been a while since the Business Wireline side surprised to the upside, and I think that you guys have been trying to kind of just maintain it, but is there something structural or competitively that has evolved it, might be \u2013 this might be the first data point in the trend? Or is it more of an anomaly?","And then the second question, John Stephens, would be on the cash flow guide. Could you kind of parse down the increase in the free cash flow guidance? Is it related to lower CapEx, as you shift CapEx to vendor financing? Or is it related to the working capital benefits from the WarnerMedia asset sale or other things kind of that are going to come through the year? It\u2019d just be helpful to kind of get a picture of that. Thanks.","John Stephens","So, they could \u2013 let me take that free cash flow one first. And quite frankly, we\u2019re at the $26 billion range, feel very good about that. We did $2.6 billion securitization that we told you about. And quite frankly some would suggest that raising the guidance to $28 billion could have been raised even higher number than the $28 billion range. But quite frankly, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the network, our FirstNet team, our network team is [putting for sales] [ph] quite frankly ahead of schedule. They\u2019re being really efficient. But if they need more capital, I want to have the flexibility to do that and still meet what we\u2019re \u2013 what our guidance is.","If we can get software releases out quicker with regard to 5G, and put those in place, I want to retain the flexibility to do that. So quite frankly, the raise in guidance is something that\u2019s very reasonable to achieve, and feel good about it. And yet retains flexibility for us. So, I understand the reason for your question, but we have retained some flexibility in this to make sure that if we can continue to build at this \u2013 the 60% achievement level that we\u2019re at is nine months ahead of schedule. If we can keep doing this and the impacts of that overall wireless business are really showing up at lower churn in customer. We\u2019ve had a 1 million voice customers in the last year, 355,000 just in last quarter. So, feel really good about what it\u2019s doing. So, I want to be ready to support those really quality efforts, that\u2019s that aspect of it.","Randall Stephenson","On the B2B front, Dave. This is Randall. Look, U.S. business is pretty healthy, U.S. business is doing very, very strong. And we\u2019re now into since tax reform, I think, like our six quarter of really healthy fixed investment for businesses. And that tracks really, really well with what we do. And it\u2019s been a little soft in the last quarter or two with the China trade discussions. The administration didn\u2019t like to \u2013 for us to talk about that, but look business has pulled in and best with the last quarter or so as a result of the trade uncertainty.","But with all that said, it\u2019s been six quarters of pretty robust increase in business fixed investment and that tracks very well with us. Second is pricing has been pretty rational in this industry, and especially as we\u2019ve worked off a lot of those whole legacy products, we had this incredible pricing pressure. We\u2019re now in the market. What\u2019s growing are the new IP type services. And the pricing there in the marketplace has been pretty reasonable and stable, and the new products sets are doing well. You saw special service as we call them, but I think those were up 6% plus for the quarter, which is a really nice healthy growth rate for those.","And then we had some IP sales in the quarter, and that profit up a little bit. So \u2013 but even without that, the trends are really, really strong here. We feel good \u2013 we feel about as positive on this segment as we have in quite some time. And as businesses keep investing, we\u2019ll continue to be really bullish on this segment. And the IP sales by the way, I mean, I know those are come in big blocks, but they\u2019re not one time. We\u2019ve had these in the past had a couple in this quarter, and we\u2019ll have probably, I suspect, more in the future that\u2019s become a nice little opportunity for us.","And then, we haven\u2019t even talked about the Microsoft and the IBM deals that were announced just recently. And those are not inconsequential deals. Those have multifaceted implications. And predominantly, those deals addressed a particular area. The biggest cost item on AT&T\u2019s P&L are we call it the factory costs. But it\u2019s the network and the IT costs, the big iron costs. And as you have seen over the last few years, we have very consistently with all the activity in the network going on, we have very consistently driven those cost levels down on an absolute basis, 8%, 9%, 10% year-over-year very consistently.","We\u2019re kind of getting to a place where it\u2019s hard to continue getting those type of productivity increases. What we\u2019re doing with both IBM and Microsoft is leveraging their capabilities in large scale cloud deployments. And they\u2019re taking over a lot of applications for AT&T, moving those to the cloud. And what is going to do is allow us to continue at this type of cost reduction curve on the network and IT side of the house, and continue that momentum there. In addition, we are securing revenue opportunities with each of those companies, and actually have go-to-market strategies. That will allow us to continue to keep the momentum you\u2019re seeing on the wireline revenue side.","So, all in all, I would tell you, we\u2019re relatively bullish on the B2B side of the house, and hopeful that we continue to have economic growth, the trade situation doesn\u2019t become a distraction for businesses that we can continue and improve on this.","John Stephens","Thanks, Dave.","Randall Stephenson","Take the next question.","Operator","Next up, we have the line of Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. For the last few quarters, we\u2019ve seen a steady execution in the wireless business, and that\u2019s been without being fully deployed on FirstNet without really having had a chance to do a lot yet with 5G. But over the next year, both of those initiatives are going to be much more significantly deployed. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about your go-to-market in Mobility and whether you think over the next few quarters, there\u2019s an opportunity to maybe step on the gas a bit more? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","Yeah. Thanks, Brett. This is Randall, again. Yeah, look the wireless side of the house, we are feeling more and more confident every day as we execute through the network strategy in the FirstNet strategy. And as you think about growth in the future, you hit on the key elements. FirstNet is just in its infancy, and we have a few hundred subscribers that have moved to FirstNet. The first responder community is a rather large market, and it\u2019s a market where we come into it with very small share.","And so, our opportunity to grow share as we build out this First Responder Network is quite significant, and you\u2019re starting to see that play itself out. But that just as importantly is as we build out the FirstNet network, we\u2019re moving into markets where we have had a pretty thin presence in the past. These are rural communities. And as we move into these communities, we are standing up brand new distribution in many communities. And everybody on this call, who\u2019s followed this business for a while knows what the penetration numbers look like when a new entrant comes into a community.","The first market share goes quick. It comes to you quick; we\u2019re starting to see that as we stand up distribution in new communities. And we\u2019re at the very front end of this as well as we told you, we\u2019re 60% built out on our coverage. We have 40% more to go. So, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity left here.","And then the piece that\u2019s not inconsequential, in fact is probably the most important of all of this, is that AT&T now has claimed the network quality mantle. Network quality is ours, and we feel very strongly about this. And as I told you, we have been rated the best, the fastest and the high most reliable network by people who do this for a living on an independent basis. And as a marketing position, that\u2019s a great place to be.","And we\u2019re starting to see the impacts of this in key segment customer churn, we\u2019re starting to see it in terms of gross add capability. And just having a strong network quality brand and message in the marketplace by itself is a growth strategy. And so bottom line, we\u2019re feeling pretty bullish about the wireless business right now. John, would you add anything?","John Stephens","Brett, we think of the first responder community, has 3 million potential, to participate very little in that. We\u2019re growing it quickly now. But we also the secondary first responders, the guys who going in and restore power and restore hospitals, and work in that environment that don\u2019t necessarily wear firefighter hats or police badges, that\u2019s another 8 million or brings that total almost \u2013 that adds about 11 million to it. So that brings that community totaled about 14 million. That\u2019s a huge \u2013 that\u2019s the opportunity we view.","And then you think about them having multiple devices whether it be a tablet or a phone, and then you think about them having family members. So, it really is a very large scale. We are making great progress in getting authorized with agencies and adding customers. And adding customers, that were previously served by somebody else, but we\u2019re also very, as Randall said, this network is outstanding, and it\u2019s going to serve our existing customer base. And so, it\u2019s going to give us this opportunity quite frankly to lower churn to get better quality service to this existing 80 million customers \u2013 phone customers we have today. That\u2019s a real benefit that I have a difficult time putting a price tag on or giving predictions for. But I know it\u2019s a real benefit for us and for the shareholders, for the customers. So, we feel really good about that.","And that leaves us just in a very smooth transition into 5G. This 5G Evolution is going on now to 5G Plus with our millimeter wave and our 20 markets that we\u2019re in today. And with the 5G in the core network, where we\u2019ll have nationwide coverage next year, we expect by the middle of the year. So, we really are leading in 5G. We really are \u2013 and FirstNet is enabling this, and it\u2019s going to have a lot of benefits to it. So, you can understand why we do feel good. We do feel good about what the team is doing and how they\u2019re performing, and optimistic about meeting targets going forward.","Last thing I\u2019ll say is the accounting side of it, you get 70% of this complete by the end of this year. And our network guys have surprised me on the positive side before. We\u2019re going to have a lot of the CapEx behind us on the build side. And the remaining piece would be software upgrades, so we feel really good about the financial aspects of this process also.","Randall Stephenson","Thank, Brett. We\u2019ll take the next question.","Operator","Will come from the line of Mike McCormack of Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Michael McCormack","Hey, guys, thanks. Randall, obviously a lot of news out there and it seems like the last game was about to change, I guess, fairly dramatically in the wireless business. Just sort of thinking, what are your thoughts over the next three to four years as you see potentially new entrants coming in? How does that change the AT&T strategy going forward? And I guess, secondly on the Business Wireline side, just to circle back on that, it feels like \u2013 it sounds like you guys are going to much more on retention efforts around that. Is there something there with regard to share loss being stemmed that\u2019s also having a positive impact? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","I\u2019m sorry, Mike. That last question, say it again, Business Wireline on retention\u2026","Michael McCormack","Just on the Business Wireline side, it seems I\u2019ve been hearing that you guys been doing a much better job in retaining customers and probably shared to competitors. I just want to see if there\u2019s any commentary on that?","Randall Stephenson","That\u2019s \u2013 and it happens to be accurate. We have done a very good job as new big deals come up retaining those, and as I\u2019ve told you the pricing has been fairly rational in the marketplace. And so, yeah, we really have had not only on a retention basis, but also on an acquisition basis, picking up new logos. We\u2019ve picked up a number of new logos in the last year or so. And so that business, again, I just won\u2019t dwell on it, but it continues to surprise us in terms of how it\u2019s doing. And I\u2019d love to say it\u2019s all 100% great execution, but all of that was just good economic health. And American business is quite healthy right now.","In terms of industry structure, there\u2019s a lot of noise out there right now in industry structure. And the news this morning that maybe T-Mobile is close to having a deal with the DOJ. I just \u2013 there\u2019s a \u2013 there are so many ifs around industry structure and who\u2019s going to be in the market, and who\u2019s not. It\u2019s actually hard to respond to it. But to answer your question directly, if Charlie Ergen has wireless assets and distribution or Sprint T-Mobile happens or doesn\u2019t happen, candidly, it doesn\u2019t change anything we\u2019re going to do for the next three years.","Our strategy is pretty well baked, and I think the strategy is resilient as it relates to changes in industry structure. It\u2019s a strategy from a wireless standpoint that is, first and foremost, centered around FirstNet, getting the FirstNet capability deployed, built, standing up new distribution, tapping that new market and just continuing to drive network quality.","And then, obviously, the 5G deployment is high, high priority. Also, then pairing that with a unique content in HBO Max. It\u2019s not even here yet, but HBO Max will be a key part of this wireless strategy as we get into next year and pairing a very unique premium video content with our wireless and our TV and broadband business. So, whether anything happens with that or not, it doesn\u2019t change our strategy.","Now the status of these deals, it\u2019s obviously one that we\u2019re watching very closely, but there are so many ifs around, does the industry structure change or not. And the interesting part is it\u2019s set up where the DOJ is probably not going to be the last say on this deal. And I\u2019ve not seen this happen in M&A before, where the state AGs have positioned themselves, where they will be the last say on any deal that gets done and they\u2019re kind of in a position where they\u2019re going to be grading the DOJ\u2019s work as we go through this.","And so, thinking about state AGs and then the rumors and so forth in the marketplace, what level of comfort they\u2019ll take that the antitrust concerns and fix is Charlie Ergen coming into the wireless business, that\u2019s been decades in the making, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how they react to that. So, a lot of things up in the air. It\u2019s hard to say which way this thing goes, but at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t change anything we\u2019re doing.","Operator","Next up, we have the line of Michael Rollins of Citi.","Michael Rollins","As you consider balancing revenue performance and profitability, can you discuss the role that content exclusivities will play in the future for AT&T in 2 respects? First, on the content in sports rights, like NFL SUNDAY TICKET that you distribute through DIRECTV, and then second, separately, how you think about monetizing the content library in WarnerMedia on an exclusive basis, whether it\u2019s through HBO Max or other distributors like Netflix?","Randall Stephenson","Sure. Hi, Mike. Yes. So, start with the NFL SUNDAY TICKET exclusivity. That\u2019s something that served DIRECTV well for many years. However, unfortunately, right now, that content is tied to our satellite product. And so, it serves a good value as we come into the fall. It\u2019ll be an important retention tool. But in terms of an opportunity to grow our business with that, when it\u2019s anchored to a satellite product, it\u2019s kind of hard to utilize it. So hopefully, over time, we can address that and move it on to our other platforms. And I think it can be a really important piece of growing our other platforms.","As you think about NBA, Major League Baseball, a lot of the content that \u2013 is \u2013 content rights that are held by the Turner companies, whether it be TNT or TBS and the NBA Final 4, and then playoffs fit that as well, those are obviously really important variables. And they\u2019ve been very, very important in making Turner very unique content as we market it to other distributors, but also as we begin to put that content on our HBO Max platform. This will be at the early stages of HBO Max, but you should assume that ultimately, HBO Max will have live elements.","And those live elements, both unique live sports, premium sports, the ones we just went through, NBA, Major League Baseball, NCAA basketball, those are going to be really, really important elements for HBO Max. The same with news, and you can go through the areas of news that we think are very, very important, and will do quite well as an element of HBO Max.","So exclusive content has been important for as long as the TV business has been around. We don\u2019t see that changing, and you should assume that we will take advantage of opportunities, both within Turner and don\u2019t forget Bleacher Report. We have some great exclusive live content in Bleacher Report, from NBA to soccer, European soccer and so forth. So, a lot of opportunities to take advantage of the unique content deals that we have within WarnerMedia.","Operator","Next up, we have the line of Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays.","Kannan Venkateshwar","If I may on the Entertainment Business, if you just look at the performance this particular quarter, despite losing subs, you, of course, did well on revenues and EBITDA relative to expectation then. So, I guess, it\u2019s getting to a point where the yield is better than the sub-losses overall. And therefore, when you look at some of these new product launches, the central line device going forward and even DIRECTV NOW, how are you thinking about \u2013 what\u2019s the product vision behind it? Is it more to manage that? Or is it more for growth? And is video growth from a subscriber perspective really important going forward? Or should we just assume that because the focus is margins and growth, margins and top line stability, the focus will more be on price and costs?","Randall Stephenson","Yes. Hi, Kannan. This is Randall again. You\u2019ve nailed the equation. I mean, that\u2019s exactly what the equation is. It\u2019s \u2013 one has to ask, how is it that subscribers can decline like this and margins expand? And it says a lot about the customers that are staying on the network, that they tend to be very high-value customers, tend to be very valuable customers as you think about where we are going as a company. And that is distributing unique content through as many distribution points as possible.","And so, as you think about the product portfolio going forward, which is what you have teed up, it\u2019s interesting. The DIRECTV product is going to have a really long life, and they\u2019re going to be segments of the market for a long time, but that\u2019s how you\u2019ll address those segments of the market. This thin client product that were bringing to market, it literally takes the customer acquisition costs and cuts it in half. And the beauty of that is that you can begin to address a fundamental problem with the current linear TV business, and that is the price point, but the content costs just continuing to grow. You heard me talk about Nexstar wanting 100% increase on their broadcast rights and so forth.","We\u2019ve got to find a way to get the cost curve down on this product, so we can keep people into the product for a longer-term basis. So, as you drive customer acquisition costs in half on AT&T TV, the new product we\u2019re bringing to market, then you can bring the price points down and hold margins and still have the same value equation from a customer standpoint. So, DIRECTV, good product, will be there for a long time.","AT&T TV, you should assume, this will be the workhorse over the next couple of years. And we will put our shoulder and our muscle behind AT&T TV, get a lower price point, shore up this customer base over the next couple of years. And then the part that shouldn\u2019t be missed, and we haven\u2019t given any subscriber numbers on HBO digital because we just had Game of Thrones, and we added a lot of digital subscribers. And we will, as we get to the WarnerMedia Day, we\u2019ll give some visibility into those. But until we kind of know what the churn characteristics of a product like this looks like, we\u2019re going to be a little guarded about giving subscribers.","But here\u2019s what we do know, and that is HBO \u2013 DISH stopped carrying HBO. And year-over-year, we\u2019re actually up HBO subscribers. That tells you how strong the digital subscriber performance of this thing was. And churn is hanging in there pretty strong in the third quarter because as Game of Thrones went off, the HBO folks, we gave them more capital to invest in content. So, in comes the new season of Big Little Lies. It\u2019s performed very well. Chernobyl was a blowout success. After Big Little Lies ended last Sunday. Now we have Succession coming online.","The new season of Barry is coming into play, and this thing is just feeling pretty good. And so, as you think about a video portfolio, DIRECTV, AT&T TV, HBO, which we\u2019re getting more and more conviction that HBO Max is going to be meaningful, you can imagine that those are the places we\u2019re going to put our shoulder and our muscle as we move forward. And the implications of that to profitability, we think, are pretty important.","And so, we\u2019ll give more visibility on the WarnerMedia Day in October. But bottom line, we like how the video portfolio is shaping up here, and you can listen to that discussion and begin to appreciate where you would expect our marketing and customer acquisition muscle to go.","John Stephens","Randall, if I could, one thing to add. All that investment that Randall was talking about and all these new shows that\u2019s showing up, first of all, you\u2019ve seen the 3% revenue increase at HBO ties exactly to what Randall said. How are you doing that without strong digital performance? It\u2019s like all these new shows that he\u2019s talking about, we\u2019ve made those content investments. We continue to invest in content just like CapEx throughout the year. And that is in \u2013 that is already included in those free cash flow numbers that we\u2019ve shown up through this year and included in our guidance.","So, we are making decisions to continue to invest. We\u2019re doing that today. You\u2019re seeing the build on 5G today. You\u2019re seeing this investment in content today. And with all of that, we\u2019re still coming back to this kind of $4 a share of free cash flow, not only for the trailing 12 months, but for this year. So, I\u2019d say this, we are investing in the business, particularly in the comments around I made on WarnerMedia and HBO and those types, but also across the board. It\u2019s just really important to keep that in mind, and we\u2019re still generating just tremendous cash flows, not only in total, but on a per-share basis.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.","Timothy Horan","Randall, can you dive into the 5G strategy a little bit more? It does feel like now you could be a few years ahead of your peers, and it seems like a great opportunity to gain share, maybe grow ARPUs here, but are you going to be able to deploy the 5G software as soon as the FirstNet build has gone by the end of next year? And can you talk about maybe what the go-to-market strategy will look like? Will you look to gain share more so or will it be to grow ARPUs? And just practically speaking, from a customer perspective, how much more speed or network capacity or latency will they really see off the bat and starting in 2021?","Randall Stephenson","Yes. Hi, Tim. You bet. We are pretty consistent in talking about the advantages of FirstNet, and that it\u2019s allowing us to deploy this 5G hardware with one touch on the sales side. So, we climbed the sales side, and we\u2019re doing a number of things. We\u2019re turning up the FirstNet hardware and the FirstNet spectrum, and then we\u2019re turning up all this other latent data spectrum that we own as we climb the tower and putting the 5G hardware in place. And we\u2019ve put the beta alpha tag on the phone for 5G Evolution.","And I know some of our competitors didn\u2019t like that, but it\u2019s proving to be exactly what we told the market that it would be. You turn up all the spectrum, you put the new technology in place and there is a speed enhancement. And we are unquestionably the fastest network in the market just because of that capacity served. And we are literarily in the process of, by end of 2019, we\u2019ll have increased the total capacity of this network, John had a slide on this, by 50%. There are just inherent performance improvements from that alone that we\u2019re seeing and our customers are experiencing, and our churn is reflecting this.","Now 5G, to your question, will a software be ready? By mid-year next year, as we\u2019ve turned all \u2013 put all this hardware in place, we will have a nationwide footprint of 5G. So yes, the software will be turned up. And by mid-year, we\u2019ll have a nationwide footprint of 5G. We are also in the process of market-by-market turning up our millimeter wave spectrum 5G into that spectrum band. And as you know, when you put 5G into that millimeter wave band, that\u2019s when you get these radical speed lifts, and that\u2019s when you start to get the gig-type speeds. And we have it up in areas here in Dallas, for example. And I have a Samsung phone that I carry around. And I routinely, when I do speed tests here in Dallas, get over 1 gig speeds, get 2 gig on some occasions.","And so, you\u2019re going to have some radical step-up in speed performance as we deploy this in the millimeter wave on top of our lower-ban spectrum where we turn it up over the course of next year.","The really high-performance millimeter wave spectrum is going to come market-by-market, and it will take a while to deploy the really high-speed spectrum. As we turn it up, Tim, you should expect our focus will be a little different to some of our competitors. It is a business-driven focus at the go-down. And we think it\u2019s really important because we can deploy this technology. If somebody needs a connected factory or connected plant, we\u2019re doing this in Austin now, you will see us do that. If somebody needs a Wi-Fi replacement for their business operations, we can deploy and we can replace that. If somebody has IoT applications, we can begin to deploy this and roll these services out kind of commensurate with the network deployment.","And so, it will be business-driven at first. As we get broad coverage of the millimeter wave, and this is really important, as our customers begin to get handsets into their hands that can use this technology, which right now, is pretty limited number of handsets, but as we exit next year there\u2019ll be a significant \u2013 they\u2019ll be in the dozen more handsets where people can use this technology, then you\u2019ll see us ratchet it up, the marketing and the promotion. We don\u2019t want to get too aggressive with the consumer right now where there aren\u2019t handsets in the marketplace and there isn\u2019t significant coverage. That will happen as we go through the course of next year.","And we do agree with you that we have an advantage here. We have a deployment advantage, and we think we\u2019ll have nationwide, this broad 5G deployment mid-year, and that\u2019s going to be important for our customers.","John Stephens","And let me wrap up, and then hand it over for Randall for some closing comments. But specifically, on the quarter, we had solid revenue growth. And we met our service revenue growth in mobility. Quality EBITDA growth, solid EPS, strong free cash flows and continued investment in both content and network that are showing up in our results. So, we feel like it was a very good quarter, and we are very \u2013 and we remain optimistic going forward. Our ability to generate cash and manage our balance sheet is without question, and we feel very good about it. Randall, let me turn it over to you.","Randall Stephenson","I don\u2019t have much to add. I would we just point, all of the commitments we gave to you last year, at the end of the year, we are hitting every one of those. And we\u2019re checking the box on each of them. I am gaining greater and greater confidence we\u2019ll hit each of those as we go through the course of this year. The debt we\u2019ll have at a very reasonable place as we exit this year, I\u2019ll be \u2013 I fully expect that we\u2019ll be buying some stock back as we go through this year and the cash flows continue to produce.","And look, I hope you\u2019re seeing in WarnerMedia why we thought this asset was so important for us to own. This is a great business, great talent, great people running it. HBO is firing on all cylinders. Warner Bros. is doing terrific. And all this is coming together to give us great confidence that HBO Max is going to be something special in the marketplace. And we\u2019ll get more to that, more of that to you in October. We look forward to seeing everybody there. Thank you for joining the call, and look forward to seeing you.","Michael Viola","Okay.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'll now turn the conference over Senior Vice President, Investor Relations Michael Viola. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the second quarter conference call. Like Kathy said, I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations at AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John is going to cover our results, and he'll also provide an update on technology and infrastructure as well as an update on Time Warner and the FirstNet process. And then we'll follow with a Q&A session.","As always, our earnings materials are available on the new Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That's going to include our news release, 8-K, investor briefing, associated schedules, et cetera.","Before we begin, I'd like to call your attention our Safe Harbor statement that's on slide 2. The Safe Harbor statement says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially, and additional information is available on the Investor Relations website.","So now let me turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. Let's first look at our consolidated financial summary on slide 3. We included both a quarterly and a year-to-date view. While the second quarter provides a good snapshot, the year-do-date view actually provides a more complete picture of how we are performing in a challenging and competitive environment.","Year to date, revenue has been pressured by fewer phone upgrades and declines in legacy services. At the same time, our cost containment efforts are paying off, and it's showing up in our margins and our earnings. What we're doing on the cost side drove a 120 basis point improvement in adjusted consolidated operating margins year to date.","Earnings were strong. After adjustments, second quarter EPS was $0.79, up almost 10% for the quarter and up 7% year to date. There are a few things driving this strong EPS performance; first, as I just mentioned, lower costs. We're taking out operating costs and at the same time providing customers with a better experience through more automation, more digital interactions, more software and analytics, and more of our network functions being virtualized.","Second, our international operations are becoming more profitable. Our satellite business in Latin America continues to be profitable in a tough environment, and we are past the heaviest investment cycle in Mexico.","And finally, there were a few one-time operational items in the second quarter such as operating taxes that did help results. But we also normalized more than $0.03 of items that would have helped even more, including gains from a spectrum slot, asset sales, and a one-time benefit savings. Even with all these moving pieces, we continue to expect adjusted EPS growth in the mid-single-digit range.","At the same time, year-to-date cash from operations is solid. Our increased capital spending is reflected in our free cash flow. But once again, the guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect free cash flow in the $18 billion range for the year, albeit at the low end of the range. The timing of the FirstNet expenditures and reimbursements are expected to impact that number. And we still expect capital spending in the $22 billion range, subject to the FirstNet timing. Some of the differences between adjusted EPS and cash from operations in the second quarter and for the year reflect the depreciation changes we've previously discussed.","I want to say we saw some (4:20) working capital lumpiness in this quarter, inventory and vendor payment changes, which we would expect to sort themselves out as we work our way through the rest of the year. In addition, integration costs, inclusive of the Time Warner deal, have been adjusted out of net income, but still impact free cash flow, same for the settlement payments for our pre-merger DTV legal case with the FTC that was previously announced and accrued. All these impacted the quarter, but we don't expect a repeat for the rest of the year, and we continue to maintain our $18 billion range guidance for free cash flow.","Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with Wireless. Those details are on slide 4. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. Wireless operations.","It was another highly competitive quarter in Wireless. Our competitors tried just about every promotion in the marketing book. In fact, one of them even offered to give away their service for free for a year. We were prudent with our promotional activity. Instead, our focus was on giving customers a great video entertainment experience bundled with mobility. Our results speak for themselves. We grew our domestic branded phone base by 178,000, including 267,000 prepaid net adds. We grew our smartphone base by more than 0.5 million. We had a strong year-over-year and sequential postpaid improvement. We added 2.3 million subscribers. And customer loyalty was terrific, with our lowest-ever postpaid phone churn for any quarter at 0.79%.","At the same time, our EBITDA margin matched last quarter's all-time high of 41.8%, and our EBITDA service margin was the best ever at 50.4%. These results speak to the fantastic job our Wireless teams are doing with cost management as well as the underlying strength of our Wireless customer base and business.","Now, let's move to our Entertainment group results at the bottom of slide 4. Revenues and margin were relatively stable. Growth in IP and video services revenue offset legacy declines, and cost synergies and efficiencies offset pressure from content increases and startup costs for DIRECTV NOW. AdWorks revenues are [up] nearly 15% year over year. We continue to do well in addressable and local ad sales, utilizing our customer insights data. Addressable and local ads can generate CPMs that are 3 to 4 times that of our national sales, and we've been shifting more ad inventory to these areas to further improve our top line performance.","Total broadband grew for the third straight quarter, overcoming what is normally a seasonally slow second quarter. The strategy to simplify pricing, cross-sell broadband with TV and wireless service, and expand our fiber footprint has been paying off. We're far down the road in completing our legacy DSL conversions to IP broadband. That conversion, combined with extending fiber to more than 5.5 million customer locations, is strengthening our broadband position. In fact, the number of broadband subscribers on speeds 18 megabits or higher has increased by nearly 1.6 million in the past year.","Traditional video losses continued their recent trends. The second quarter traditionally has seasonal pressures, but we also are feeling the impact of the overall industry trend of more customers wanting mobile and over-the-top offerings. The pace of that change seems to have picked up a bit so far this year.","We continued to improve our traditional TV offers by simplifying the pricing and bundling TV with broadband and wireless, but we also know that traditional TV service is not for everyone. Many are choosing our over-the-top offering, DIRECTV NOW. Half of our DTV NOW subscribers are coming from traditional pay-TV, mainly from our competitors, and the other half had no pay-TV service at all. We introduced this service at the end of last year and have now reached nearly 0.5 million subscribers. This has helped us keep our total video base essentially flat from a year ago.","We continue to refine and improve DIRECTV NOW service. We recently launched our app on additional streaming devices, and we're continuing to increase the number of local channels that are available. And we're also beta testing a new platform that will include a cloud-based DVR. We'll broaden availability of this new video platform later this year.","Speaking of our Entertainment group, it's been two years since we closed our acquisition of DIRECTV. You can see the progress on slide 5. One of the opportunities we highlighted two years ago was the potential of bundling services and its impact both on subscriber trends and churn. Our results tell the story. For example, the number of wireless subscribers who also have a TV service from us has increased by more than 4 million, or up 31%, since the close of the DTV deal. Conversely, TV subscribers with wireless plans have increased by nearly 1 million, or 18%. And the number of TV subscribers in our footprint with high-speed Internet service has increased by 10%.","While this is impressive when you look at all traditional TV subscribers, it's even more so when you break out our DIRECTV and DIRECTV NOW customers. This includes those who have migrated from our IP TV service, which is something we intended. The number of wireless subscribers with DTV has increased by 72%, while the number of DTV subscribers with AT&T Wireless has increased by 1.7 million, or 52%, and the number of our DTV subscribers in our wireline footprint with our IP broadband has grown by more than 2.7 million, to 67% of DIRECTV customers.","Bundling obviously helps subscriber and revenue growth, but perhaps the biggest impact is on wireless churn. We've seen postpaid churn fall 25 basis points since we closed the DIRECTV deal. We're doing this in one of the most competitive environments we've ever seen, and a big reason for this is the increasing attractiveness of our wireless and video bundles. In fact, if you look at any bundled customer, churn is lower when compared to customers with just a single service. These are our most valuable customers. We use the combined appeal of wireless, video, and broadband services to offer compelling packages that can't be easily replicated. It's a great way to differentiate our services in the noisy and competitive wireless and video marketplaces.","We also have been making great headway with our fiber build. We have the largest fiber footprint in the country, and we are ahead of the plan to reach our 12.5 million new fiber customer locations FCC commitment by mid-2019. In fact, by the time it's all said and done, we could be looking at around 14 million fiber-to-the-prem customer locations.","We're also on track to meet or beat the expected cost synergies from DIRECTV. We hit a $1.5 billion run rate with cost synergies at the end of last year, and we're on track to reach a $2.5 billion-plus synergy run rate next year.","Now let's look at Business Solutions results on slide 6. We continue to see the similar historical pressures in our Business segment. Strategic Services and Wireless are working hard to overcome legacy wireline losses. We continue to make incredible strides in cost management while increasing the percent of revenues that come from Wireless and Strategic Services. That's driving higher margins even with wireline revenues declining.","Let me give you one example of what we're talking about. Our legacy voice and data revenues were down more than $500 million year over year. But even with that pressure, EBITDA grew by more than $70 million, and EBITDA margins improved by 150 basis points. We're doing this by driving hard on cost management initiatives. Our focus is having the industry's best cost structure, and one way to do that is by implementing process automation and service efficiencies.","Our industry leadership in software-defined networking also supports our cost management goals. More than 40% of our network functions are now virtualized, and by year end it should be 55%, with a long-term goal of 75% or better.","Moving to our international operations at the bottom of slide 6, we saw solid improvement across our operations. Revenues grew and margins improved in both our Latin America and Mexico operations. In fact, EBITDA and EBITDA margins for our international segment have more than doubled year over year.","We did see an EBITDA benefit from a one-time item in Brazil during the quarter. In Mexico, revenue grew and margins improved both sequentially and year over year. Revenues were up about 10%. We added close to 500,000 new subs in Mexico in the quarter to pass 13 million. Our LTE network now covers more than 88 million people, or just about 75% of the country.","Looking further south, our Latin America pay-TV revenues were up more than 11%. Net adds were down, due mostly to seasonality in Argentina and losses in Brazil, but our video business in Latin America continues to be profitable and generate positive free cash flow.","Before we get to your questions, we'd like to provide an update on several topics that many of you have asked about. Our business update is on slide 7.","First, the Time Warner review process at the DOJ continues. We still expect to close the deal by year end, and we have the financing set up to do so. And our merger integration team is nearly complete with its plans for opportunities that this deal will make possible in advertising, bundling, and providing customers choice. Our goal is to hit the ground running once we receive final approval and build our leadership in the telecom, media, and technology space.","Second, we continue to invest and improve our integrated networks. Our wireless networks reach more than 99% of all Americans. Our spectrum position is broad and deep. In the top 100 metro areas today, we have about 100 MHz of spectrum deployed. This spectrum capacity helps us meet the tremendous demand that the new unlimited plans provide.","At the same time, we have about 60 MHz of additional spectrum. We'll deploy all these bands simultaneously with the FirstNet build. As you know, the cost savings from touching the tower only once are significant.","Our evolution to 5G is underway. While 5G standards are still being finalized, we're laying the foundation for tomorrow's faster wireless speeds today with 5G Evolution.","We also completed a successful trial of LTE-LAA, reaching peak speeds of 750 megabits. This is one of our first steps towards 5G and will provide faster wireless speeds and an enhanced experience for our customers who use our LTE network.","We've already launched 5G Evolution in Austin and Indianapolis and expect to be available in more than 20 markets by year end. We also launched the second fixed wireless trial using Millimeter Wave technology to deliver an ultra-fast 5G network experience to more locations in Austin. The trial participants can stream live TV on the DIRECTV NOW app and experience faster broadband services, all over a fixed wireless 5G signal.","By the end of 2017, we also expect to deploy LTE License Assisted Access and four-way carrier aggregation in areas of some 5G Evolution metros. LTE-LAA combines unlicensed spectrum with licensed spectrum through a carrier aggregation to increase network capacity, providing faster speeds and a better customer experience. We recently tested this technology in San Francisco, where we observed peak speeds of more than 750 megabits in a trial setting. We plan to expand LTE-LAA testing to additional areas of San Francisco and Indianapolis in the coming weeks.","We continue to move software functions deeper into our network. This gives us incredible flexibility to change network functions almost instantly while providing better customer service and driving cost efficiencies.","We've also embraced edge computing, which will drive low latency for 5G applications such as self-driving cars, augmented and virtual reality, robotic manufacturing, and much, much more. We're just scratching the surface here. Customers demand a powerful network with a seamless integrated solution. This makes our integrated network a powerful advantage for us.","Now, I would like to update you on FirstNet, where we're really off to a fast start. That update is on slide 8. The timeline has been set and the opt-in process is underway. We delivered plans to each state last month. They can opt in at any time. Already, five states have said they're in, Arkansas, Kentucky, Iowa, Virginia, and Wyoming. And we are looking forward to announcing a number of additional states in the near future.","These states are anxious to get started, and so are we. They want the highest quality network available for their first responders as soon as they can get it, not to mention the investment and jobs created by our FirstNet builds. We continue with our discussions with the other states and territories in this initial 45-day review period for the states.","It will be followed by another 45-day response period for FirstNet to answer any questions or concerns the states may have. This will conclude by mid-September. Once that's completed, the official 90-day clock begins for states to make a decision. This is expected to start in mid-September, with final decisions due by mid-December.","Work on the FirstNet network can begin once the state opts in, both hardware and software, and we're setting up a new business operation, sales, marketing, customer care, to serve these customers.","The advantage for the states that opt in quickly are many. First responder subscribers will have immediate access to AT&T's existing nationwide LTE network. Those subs will immediately receive quality of service and priority access to AT&T's $180 billion network. Those subscribers will also have preemption status on our network, which is expected to be in place by the end of the year.","FirstNet and AT&T take on all of the financial requirements of the build. No additional financial resources from the states are required. All of this is a powerful incentive for states to opt in.","The FirstNet build will be an important event for the country, first responders, and the industry. We see this as a great opportunity for efficient expansion, not only by deploying 60 MHz of spectrum, but also by changing the curve of increasing tower costs. The build will require equipment installations and new towers. We've closely watched unit costs and have been focused on creating a diverse community of suppliers and tower companies to increase competition and reduce costs.","We're studying our options. We're looking hard at new relationships. We're open to new or independent operators who may want AT&T as a customer and support a new model. The point is there's more than one way to get this work done, and we are committed to finding a way that meets the needs of our customers while keeping costs in line with industry economics.","So in summary, we had a very good quarter. Our teams are doing a great job of executing in a very competitive environment. Our cost containment efforts are paying off both in margins and earnings, and we're off to a great start with FirstNet.","With that, Mike, I will turn it back to you for our Q&A.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Okay, Kathy, we're ready for questions, and you can get started immediately.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Go ahead, please.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, folks. John, I was wondering if we could chat a bit on the progress that you guys are seeing in bundling video and wireless. You folks saw a material reduction in postpaid phone-only churn. Is there any way to quantify how much benefit you've received from bundling DIRECTV NOW in those promotions?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","First of all, thanks for the question, Amir. I think the way to look at it, it's really as we displayed on slide five. You can see that overall reduction in the total postpaid phone churn, and you can see the dramatic improvement over the, if you will, two years since the merger. And in those two years, another major activity that's gone on is dramatically increased competition, pricing that's somewhat challenging, people giving away service for a year free. So I think that slide, that presentation, shows it.","If you look up and see the details that we provided or the details I provided in my comments, it's pretty clear this ability to bundle, whether it be TV Everywhere, whether it's DTV NOW, whether it's the ability to get all of your video on your phone is making a huge difference.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Excellent, that's very helpful, and then just a quick follow-up, if I may. How should we think about the different puts and takes on the opportunity set for continuing to expand your margins? We continue to see improvement on wireless margins as a whole. It does seem as though there is an investment taking place on the video side with respect to DTV NOW, and then there is continued margin progress in the international operations. But if we think about the progress and the capabilities going forward, can you walk us through the opportunity set you still see going forward?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure, let me go through it this way. On a longer-term view, we're going to continue to see wireless revenue opportunities in prepaid. We're going to continue to see them in connected devices. Quite frankly, for us we're going to continue to see real opportunity not only in the immediate future but over time in FirstNet and what it provides. So those will be very important. And quite frankly, when you have churn at these levels, if you can maintain it, it's a gift that keeps on giving with regard to revenues and margins.","Secondly, if we think about this movement to equipment installment plans, we've essentially gone through that process and have completed that, which had some changes in our service revenue metrics. We've made it through the vast majority of that. So then you go through the next process we're going through with this move to unlimited, and we certainly have been through the higher dollar amounts, if you will, on the customer base by that because our customers are smart and they move quickly. And so that's occurred.","Now we're going through the transition with more customers, some of which who are doing it and causing us, if you will, eliminating some of their overage cost, but some of those customers who are buying up into a little bit of a bigger package just don't have to worry about overages. So that conversion is well through, and we'd expect to see that complete over the next year or so. So from a revenue perspective on a longer-term basis, we feel good.","On the wireless side on the expense piece of it, we still have a significant opportunity. From an overall perspective, we have about 40% of our network functions virtualized, both wireless and wireline. You've seen what's happened and the progress we've made in just getting from 34% to 40%, and we'd expect to get that to 55% by the end of this year and 75% or better by the time we complete. So there's more opportunity with that as well as automation, digitization.","Quite frankly then, as you put all that together, from a total company perspective, our data insights opportunity, our advertising opportunities are significant. And quite frankly, as you saw this quarter, our international operations were getting through the investment cycle. It's gone as we expected. They're particularly in Mexico adding a great number of customers, but across Latin America also. So we're doing well. We just need to get through that process, and those are the opportunities to see costs be managed very well and margins continue to grow.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks very much for the incremental color.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. John, maybe just a quick comment on the phone adds \u2013 phone losses rather on the postpaid side, a bit better than we were expecting there. But I was just thinking about the feature phone base generally. Is there a level at which you think the pressures will start to subside in a much more meaningful way and we can drive towards positive phone adds?","And then maybe just a quick comment on the DIRECTV sub weakness you're seeing there. Obviously, you called out a few things. Where are those customers going? It seems like there's an investment in time and everything else to have the satellite put on the roof. Are these cord cutters, or are they moving to a cable offering?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","So let me take the first. First of all, Mike, and I don't want to be stirring turf (28:56) here, but AT&T added contract phone customers for the quarter because our postpaid phone adds in Mexico were positive 100,000 or more. And when you put those together with our domestic base, we were actually positive postpaid phone customers, just to clarify.","On the domestic side, we did see significant improvement sequentially and year over year, over about 250,000 improvement sequentially and about 100,000 improvement in customer count year over year. And really we're seeing that from bundling of services and being able to put this video and other services together with it. So it's working well. As everyone knows, you saw it in the churn numbers. And the best customer is the one you've already got and the one you can hang on to, and that's the most efficient.","With regard to feature phones, we are well through the process. I monitor, if you will, the percentage which is in the mid-90s of phones that we sell every quarter that are smartphones. And it's in that mid-90% range. And then I compare that to our base. And over the last few years, we made significant progress in getting those numbers aligned.","So I think we are getting close to the point where we are through that migration. It's not complete, but I would tell you we made significant improvements over the last few years. Because of that, we retain or have optimism going forward on the ability to show some improving service revenues, and quite frankly, be able to continue to keep churn down because we have customers operating on smartphones and taking advantage of the quality service. So we feel good about that.","And yes, I think, maybe not now, but maybe in the next year or so, we should see a feature phone level that is much more constant and have gotten through this migration. I relate it in a similar way to what we're seeing on the consumer side with DSL broadband, where you've seen we made great strides converting to IP broadband and are getting to a point where we're dramatically through that conversion, which is optimistic for all of us.","On the sub weakness, as I said in the first quarter and will say again, we had a significant number, a higher number than normal, a higher number year over year of involuntary churn. And so we went through that process and decided to take action on those customers. That's one.","Two, we are seeing on an out-of-footprint basis where we don't have fiber, we're seeing sub losses to competitors where they can bundle. We believe we're going to, if you will, arrest that or address that situation as we continue to build out fiber. And quite frankly, not only just the, if you will, 14 million or so fiber-to-the-prem locations we'll get to, but as we mentioned, as we develop 5G wireless technologies that allows for efficient delivery of video over our wireless networks, we'll be able to compete in that environment like no one else on a nationwide basis.","Those are the two things I'd point out to you, Mike, on the sub weakness. I will point out we did have some good growth in DTV NOW, for the over-the-top product pretty much offset the DIRECTV satellite base wireless customers.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","And, John, just real quick on the NFL Sunday Ticket, obviously you're going to be coming up in the third quarter with NFL kicking off. Anything we can be expecting unique on the bundling with that particular product, whether it be with DIRECTV NOW or wireless or anything unique?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Nothing to announce today, Mike.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","It's a good question, but nothing to announce today, respectfully.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, John. Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Hey, Phil.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First to follow up quickly, of the DTV NOW customers, how many of those are bundled with other products that you sell versus standalone? And are you reporting just paying customers, or is it all on the platform?","And then second on FirstNet, with states that are opting in now, when could you start rolling out that new spectrum? And can you talk about the offer to public safety customers in those states? How do those compare to consumer prices? What should we be thinking about in terms of adds coming on as those FirstNet offers start to hit? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","So the DTV NOW customer rates we're giving is paying customers that bundle with in many cases a large, large percentage of it, top of the head. But we can make sure we get that out appropriately in a post. But the vast majority of those are bundled with our wireless services. But as you know too, it gives us the opportunity. A significant amount of these, 50% or so are customers who have never had a paying video product before or haven't had a pay-TV product, so we're getting the opportunity to not only provide them video but provide them wireless, in some cases broadband, apartment dwellers and others. But we're counting paying customers, not promo customers.","Secondly, we will have the capability to roll out the spectrum once the states opt in. The challenge will be to get the plans finalized and to incorporate the final agreements with the states on coverage and towers and build-out and some of the negotiated terms and make sure we have effective plans for those. But I would certainly expect that we will have the ability to start rolling out spectrum this year. Until the plans are complete, I don't want to predict what we'll have rolled out or how much. We'll certainly do that as soon as we're confident of it, but we'd expect to do that right away.","Secondly, I think the offers will be attractively priced because there will be large numbers of devices, not only phones but cameras and other connected devices that add the ability for us to get good economics on good price points for fire departments, EMTs, police departments, and so forth.","But as much as that is very important to us, the opportunity to then utilize this as a footprint or a starting point to get into smart cities, to be able to help these state, local municipal governments manage other parts of their activities are really important and provide us a great opportunity, as well as just the fact that the increased coverage that may be required by FirstNet will provide us an increased opportunity to sell services to other customers, to provide other IoT services, or quite frankly, to reduce what might be minor amounts in the scheme of things but reduce whatever roaming costs we have left here on the domestic side. But I would expect the prices to be competitive, and certainly today's consumer prices qualify as such.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thank you. John, maybe first a quick question on the fall-off on the video side. How far through the involuntary churn on the DIRECTV satellite side do you think we are? And then with DIRECTV NOW, given the enhancements, the new content and the DVR, do you think you can get to a point where, given those two issues, you can start to see a blended video sub growth at some point? That's number one.","And then maybe longer term, you guys have talked about a number of initiatives on this call, the spectrum deployment around 5G and FirstNet, edge computing, 14 million customer locations. And I know that SDN plays a role in this, but you spent $22 billion in CapEx it looked like this year, last year. Can you do everything you're talking about doing within that budget, or should we expect spending to ramp as we exit the year? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","First and foremost, yes, I'd expect we can do it within those kinds of levels. I don't want to give guidance outside of this year, but I don't want to signal in any way, shape, or form any significant changes in CapEx. I certainly believe we can.","I'll note to you that on the FirstNet side, there is a significant amount of efficiency that is achieved by doing this at once, all of the spectrum at once, all the tower climb, all the deployment and so forth. And then secondly, there's a significant co-pay from the FirstNet organization, $6.5 billion. So absolutely we're going to be in a position to do this.","With regard to the video involuntary churn, I would expect we'll see some of this through the remainder of the year, and we would expect that it would to start to ebb as we go through the year. But I would expect we'd have some of it through the rest of the year. And certainly based on what the team has developed, what they've taken from customer insights and customer input, we believe that DTV NOW can certainly grow. And the cloud DVR and a lot of the other features that are coming out are in response to the studies the team has done with regard to what customers want and what would make the product better.","And so absolutely, we've grown 500,000 customers in seven months. It's pretty dramatic growth, particularly when we gave a couple, three months rest there while we tested the platform and really put it through performance testing. So I think there's clearly a demand for it, an opportunity for it and for us that allows us to get to a lot of customers we don't normally serve today, MDUs, millennials, people who haven't bought or haven't been able to have the creditworthiness to buy our premium products. So for us, it's a really attractive next step. Into the future the data insights that we'll be able to get and the ability to add advertising and other sources of revenue off of this will make this profitable while still being able to give consumers great choice and great cost efficiency for them as well as a good product for us.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. Hi, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Hi, Simon.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","On FirstNet, have you finalized how the accounting is going to work? You talked about the $6.5 billion co-pay. So how should we think about it? Is this is going to be grossed-up CapEx, how the puts and takes? I think you made some reference to a working capital impact maybe around the turn of the year. And then there were some media stories about potential org structures after the closing of Time Warner. Maybe you could just address that. Thank you.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","So let me just say this on the org structures. Randall Stephenson is still the Chairman and CEO of AT&T, and I expect him to do that for a long time. I don't expect any changes there before or after the Time Warner merger. With regards to the structure of the organization after Time Warner, I think Randall and Jeff Bewkes are going through that, working that process out. And I will definitely leave that to them I think to discuss. Oftentimes, stories are very premature. Those decisions are theirs, and we'll leave it at that.","With regard to the FirstNet, what I expect that we would do is we would disclose the gross amount of CapEx we spend inclusive of FirstNet amounts, then show to the investment community the reimbursement amount that would be recorded \u2013 would be expected to be recorded as a, so to speak, contra-CapEx account or reducing the total amount because it's not a cash outflow. It will be a cash inflow to offset the expenses, the expenditures we made, but we would expect to get both of that. Some amount of that $6.5 billion will be allocated to expense, and that expense would go in the same way we would expect to disclose it, give full information about it, be transparent about it. And that would be, if you will, a contra-reduction in our expense lines.","The customer count information and normal service revenues where we record like other customers, and then it's working out with regard to the accounting for the valuation of the licenses that we receive and the payments that we're required to make, the sustainability payments that we're required to make under the fund, and we're working through that. As you can imagine, this is a first of its kind public-private partnership, so we're working with our accounting firm to make sure we have clarity on that as we finalize numbers. We don't have those numbers finalized. We won't have those finalized until the state opt-in \u2013 or state and territory opt-in process is complete. So before that time, the actual numbers that we're going to be using will be still uncertain.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And did you mention some timing difference perhaps in the fourth quarter?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","So what I'd expect at this time, for example, we want to build a cell site and put up equipment and it costs us $500 and it's reimbursable from the FirstNet fund. We may finish that in month 11 and send a bill in the normal course, just normal processing. We don't get paid for that bill until month one of the next year or month two of the next year. We don't know how that will work yet. We haven't been through that. FirstNet has been very cooperative. We're dealing with this. I'm just suggesting that those may not match up exactly. We just want to be transparent about that. I don't have any prediction that they won't, but just wanted to make sure that this is a case of first impression not only for AT&T but for the FirstNet administrators. So while we've got a great collaboration going on, it's not done yet, and so we want to be careful.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'll go ahead and stick with the FirstNet theme. So thanks for taking the question. You talked a lot about the timing around starting to build out the network. With states already opting in and with you making your existing network available to the states, when can you actually start marketing the product and bring customers online? Essentially what has to happen between opt-in and going to market? And do you have any estimate for what the addressable market of incremental customers to your business could be over time? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","So we can start selling into the states. We started making those sales calls right now into the states that have opted in, and they certainly have an organization that was already set up, already ready to run, so to speak, fully prepared to go in our Business Solutions organization, have a whole team ready to do that, and they've been working on it. So, if you will, those sales activities start now, and I will tell you the sales activities work with industry groups already. So that could involve already making contacts, meetings with sales pitches, maybe not specific proposals, but sales pitches to industry groups and departments across the country. So that's been a very active process.","If you will, we haven't given out any specific numbers. I would tell you the opportunity is not only in the millions of potential customers out there with fire, police, safety, and other departments, but also quite frankly for all the related uses and whether we utilize this for a friends-and-family opportunity, whether we utilize this to sell smart cities, whether we utilize this to go in. and where we have an improved network coverage and speed situation because of FirstNet, we go back in and double down on our sales efforts into the existing marketplace. That's what this provides. Whether once we have a FirstNet build complete, what part of that build would be able to handle video. Does this extend our ability to do fixed-to-wireless local loop that we're already doing through the CAF II program and so on and so forth?","So I'm not giving any specific guidance, but I would suggest to you that it is real and it is something that we are excited about, specifically with regard to the police, fire, EMT, what I think people would most think about when they think about first responders. Now we do not have a very large percentage of that market share. We certainly underserve it, just like years ago we underserved prepaid and we've had some great success with Cricket and AT&T Prepaid. Just like our DTV NOW product is getting us into being able to serve customers in the video space where we were very much underserved, FirstNet is going to provide a lot of opportunities for us, but one of them is to serve a market where today we are underrepresented and we believe we can do a great job for those folks.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just a quick follow-up question, are there any product bottlenecks? In other words, do you have devices you can offer now that support the new spectrum? Is that necessary? Or is this really as quickly as the opt-in states decide they want to go with you, you can start lighting people up?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Yes, there are devices that are ready today, but there will be new devices. The team has been working with the manufacturers. We work in partnership with Motorola and others on developing new devices, new services, whether they be video-placed, camera location-based services, other, whether it be allowing for the devices to actually become report writers or, if you will, event reporting devices to allow the police officers to have more time on the street than back on the desk writing up reports, all of those things that we've been actively working on since the day we started this process, and we feel very optimistic about that. There are products today that we believe we can use to serve. There will be a whole lot more products, a whole lot more products and equipment out there as time goes on.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks for taking the question.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. John, a question on ARPU, it was a noisier than normal quarter with the full quarter effect of the unlimited plus whatever benefits you're getting from tailwinds there, seasonal forces, the EIP migration. But the net of it was it picked up, and we saw one of those last year in the second quarter. I was wondering if you can unpack the moving parts and what we should expect to see that number potentially do over the course of the year, given where we are.","And then the second, if I could, just a housekeeping item. I think, John, you called out two things, taxes and Brazil, as giving some tailwinds in the quarter that weren't normalized. If you could elaborate on those, that would be great. Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","So thanks, David. On Brazil, with regard to it, there was a Supreme Court ruling on a value-added tax matter that was not our case, but it was a case that we also had in front of them. It provided about \u2013 right around $60 million worth of benefit to us in the quarter. It's an item that we had been accruing and depositing cash for while we disputed it.","We now determined that we should win that case based of the Brazil Supreme Court ruling, and we booked that through the international LatAm results. We did not receive the cash for that. But it is an item we had been accruing for some time. And the, if you will, expense pressures have been going through, some in 2017, but certainly the vast majority in prior years. So that was that call-out. That is really the major item. But in a company where you file 250,000 tax returns and you operate all across the planet, you've always got tax disputes going on, and sometimes they go in your favor and sometimes they don't. That is what we were trying to say and make sure we were just straightforward.","If you look at our effective tax rate on the income tax side, it's a little bit low, but it's all good work. All the things have been working. We just had a couple of things come together with regard to working some things out with the taxing authorities, but we were just trying to be transparent with that.","David, with regard to ARPU, let me try to go about it this way. First and foremost, the shift last quarter to unlimited had an immediate impact of impacting our overage revenues because the folks most impacted by overage were the ones quickest to go into the unlimited. We've got smart customers. There were also some promotional activity impacts in both quarters. In this quarter, though, we're starting to see those immediate impacts slow down, and now we're starting to see we believe some of the customers, some of the customers buy up to have protection from overage charges. They may have been on a lower plan, but they now seem to want to buy up. Those are a couple of the moving parts.","I will also tell you we are continuing to get further and further towards completion of the equipment installment plan process. I know we've been talking about that for three years now or more. But quite frankly, it isn't complete, but it's near complete, and so that completion helps us compared to the rest in the industry. On the other side, our things like our insurance rate and insurance claim \u2013 or insurance processes, we're participating in insurance programs, and some of the administrative charges have helped our ARPU as those things have improved or increased, so that side of it.","On the rest of the service revenues, you'll see that we moved away from reseller, and you've seen that all year \u2013 all this year but last year on our reseller counts. We have moved away from that, and that is having a pressure on the overall service revenues. Likewise, we've been having gains in prepaid throughout last year and this year, and that's helping with regard to total service revenues outside the ARPU discussion.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions, just two, if I could. One on enterprise, particularly on the fixed side, you called out weakness in investment and some technology transitions. Just wondering if you can comment on what you're seeing on both the macro and competitive front.","And then secondly on wireless upgrade rates, again you're at record lows. Maybe, John, just wondering if this is more of the new normal, or whether you're expecting maybe a bigger pickup later in the year given some pent-up demand? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure. So on the upgrade rates, you're right. They were low. They've been low for the six months. For the full year, I would suggest to you, I would expect a pickup in the second half of the year as new devices come out. But I would tell you once \u2013 and quite frankly, the longer we get through the equipment installment plan cycle, the more we get back to a normal level where there are enough phones that are three, four \u2013 whatever the term might be \u2013 years old and need to be replaced, whereas in the first couple of years the phones were still new, and so customers weren't necessarily needing to do it.","Quite frankly, the transparency to customers with regard to what these things cost is impacting their decision-making. It's made it their pocketbook decision. While we would expect those to pick up in the second half of the year, and on overall basis, I wouldn't be surprised next year if it picks up from where it is today. But we would not expect it to go back to pre-equipment installment plan levels. I just wouldn't expect that to happen. For the rest of the year, predictions on what the rate would be would be inappropriate. We don't know how customers are going to take to the new devices, the new offerings and so forth, so we'll wait and see how that will come out.","I will tell you with regard to the new technology aspect, four-way carrier aggregation, the MIMO effect, some of the other things that we're doing with really upgrading our network and improving it, many of those can be taken advantage of with the new handsets. And so we are watching it carefully because we think those customers are going to have an even better experience with the investments we've been making on our network.","With regard to enterprise, what we're seeing is a couple things. There are these annual contracts, whether they be Q3, some are a little bit longer. But as they come up for renewals, there's a step down in these traditional prices. So we've seen a lot of that with regard to voice. And so we're just taking it slow, and we're just going through that. That's one aspect of it. Two, we're able to compete. I don't see it as a losing to competition aspect, but it's just the new pricing levels. Three, we're seeing very little business fixed investment in this space that's generating demand for us or anyone else for that matter. And I think the government's GDP programs, it's why we're so strong on tax reform. It's why we continue to push for tax reform because we think that will generate that investment and help us generate revenue on the top line.","Lastly, I will tell you that we continue to be very favorably received on the combination of our wireless and wireline at the business level, the ability to provide IoT devices and other wireless connections to employees, customers, engineers, HR departments, and so forth, to help them do their jobs, that we are doing what I consider to be just a very good job of continuing to fight the fight and keep customers happy, keep them in their relationship with us, and driving cost out at the same time to actually grow margins. But it's a tough enterprise environment and it's a tough legacy environment. And the team's doing really well to shift that to those Strategic Services into wireless.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Go ahead, please.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. Maybe back to the bundle, can you talk about how adding content helps upsell your bundle, I guess specifically the HBO upsell that you started in April? And any early thoughts on what Time Warner brings, any proof points as to what content does for the bundle, and perhaps next steps to the deal and sticking points on conditions? Thank you.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","On the Time Warner deal, I won't talk about any sticking points to the transaction. We'll leave that for another day or to when we get it approved. I will make this comment with regard to \u2013 Time Warner has got great quality content. Everybody knows that. I think it's undisputed. And so that's going to be great for us to bundle with our products but also great for us to sell to others who may want to bundle their products.","With regard to HBO, quite frankly, customers like it. Customers like the opportunity to have that with their phone. So we're just trying to provide what customers want. I would suggest to you \u2013 once again, I know this is simplistic, but the best proof we can give is the ability to look at that churn and see where that smartphone churn has gone, and knowing that a lot of that has to do particularly in this competitive environment. It's a very competitive environment, and why are people staying with us? I think in part it's because they like the ability to bundle, so we are seeing that quite well.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great, thank you.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Kathy, we'll take one more question.","Operator","All right, thank you. That will come from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Go ahead, please.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys. Thanks, John. It sounds like out of region you want to go with a quad-play wireless product, obviously with DIRECTV. Any sense how long this might take? I know you've done a couple 5G trials, or maybe even can use LTE out of region. I know you said basically half the DIRECTV customers were not paying for TV before. Do you have a sense of maybe what percentage of the customers that are with DIRECTV NOW that are wireless-only?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","I don't know, so let me say this. You're hitting it right with the fact of the question of can we generally \u2013 I don't want to be on an absolute basis, but generally on a national basis, we use our wireless network starting with our LTE and LTE-LAA with carrier aggregation and so forth, can we provide a connection that would allow for sub (1:00:18) video transport? And we believe we can. The tests that we've done have shown that. Now those are just tests, they're trial markets, and we need to expand them. As you combine the FirstNet build with this, you get more opportunistic because you're going to be out in the network, and you can take advantage of that touches to do whatever else you need to do to improve those capabilities.","Likewise, as we have talked about before, we are a big player in the CAF II funding, and are building a lot of that, and so there's a lot of other items to coordinate with FirstNet with our existing LTE network. We have the technology developments with, if you will, 5G Millimeter Wave, but yes, we can. So that is, if you will, our goal to take this 14 million fiber-to-the-prem type coverage and combine it with a 5G wireless to have extensive coverage across the marketplace and be able to provide not only great wireless, but video and other services, mobile broadband and so forth.","Tim, if I could, I think this is near you. We just got word that New Jersey has now become the sixth state to opt in to the FirstNet. So we continue the momentum, and I wanted to point that out while we're on the call.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, congratulations. Maybe lastly on the expense front, it looks like the trends have gone a little better on expense management. And I think in the past, you guys have said when you get over 50% virtualization you can really start to see some of the expense benefits. Just maybe any color on your confidence \u2013 basically because it sounds like you're sounding more confident on the ability to \u2013 virtualization to really reduce expenses?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Tim, we are confident. I think it's a large part the technology, our network guys, as well as our business operations guys, but we are seeing it. It's already happening. The issue with regard to 50% for me, Tim, is the math exercise that we've got most of the investment dollars behind us to get it to 50%. So then we can see the compounding of the savings going forward because we've got so much already done, if you will, in the book, completed. And so it's easier to build on that, whereas today while the team's doing a really good job getting it up to 34% at the end of last year, they were reinvesting to get there, and they're reinvesting money this year to get to 50% \u2013 55% by the end of the year. So it is absorbing some of the cost efficiencies. It's well worth it, great investment. But once you get over that 50% level, it becomes more of a pure \u2013 the benefits will exceed any of that additional investment in a clearer picture.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Okay, Kathy. John, do you want to make some closing comments?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Folks, I appreciate everybody's time, and I want to thank you personally for being on the call today, just a few comments before we go. It continues to be a highly competitive environment, but our cost containment efforts are paying off, and you've seen that in our margins and our earnings. The prudent management of our wireless business led to branded phone growth, record low postpaid churn, and best-ever EBITDA margins.","We also posted solid year-over-year and sequential postpaid phone improvement, and we are really excited about the transformation of our broadband business and the inroads DTV is making as well as the developments in our international businesses. Our strategic moves with Time Warner and FirstNet along with these quality current assets, employees, and customers that we already have are separating ourselves from our competitors and positioning AT&T for the future, so we're very excited about what's yet to come.","Lastly, one last thought before we go. As you make your way home tonight, please remember, no text is worth a life. It can wait.","Thanks again for being on the call and thanks for your interest in AT&T and good night.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

And the third quarter was obviously particularly impacted by it being the first full quarter with WarnerMedia results in it.","And just to cut through the clutter, what I typically would like to do is just go straight to the cash flows. And if you look at the cash flows for the quarter, I feel really good about the results. Our cash flow from operations was $12.3 billion for the quarter. That's up 14% year over year. And when you look at free cash flow, which is the cash available to pay dividends or pay down debt, that was a very healthy $6.5 billion, which is up 17% year over year.","And if you get beneath that, there's just a couple of areas that I think are worthy of pointing out. First is Mobility, and Mobility is growing. And that's significant because it's obviously our largest contributor to earnings and cash flow. And what I'd really point out is that growth is being heavily driven by our Prepaid business, which is running red-hot. And I think we're seeing Cricket truly begin to distinguish itself in the marketplace.","Then also when you look at WarnerMedia, all three divisions are growing. And WarnerMedia was immediately accretive in its first full quarter to the tune of $0.05 per share.","These strong cash flows have put us on track to hit our deleveraging objectives, getting to 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA by year-end 2019.","And John Stephens is going to go into this in more detail. But what you're going to see is that we're going to exit this year with our debt maturities over four years old that are going to be at a very comfortable level as we exit this year.","And then last, we made a number of pricing moves on video. And we're getting near the end of our fiber build project, which is basically laying the foundation for stabilizing our broadband and TV business profits in 2019.","So across the business we \u2013 obviously we have a lot of work to do, a lot of integration efforts going on with WarnerMedia. But I like the momentum. I feel confident that we're on track to deliver the plans that we've laid out. And as Mike pointed out, we're going to just go through the quarter today. But when we get together on November 29, we're going to give you a full blown look at our plans as we move into 2019 and beyond.","So with that, that's my high-level view on the quarter. And I'm going to turn it over now to John Stephens.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks, Randall, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for being on the call with us this morning. Let me begin with our financial summary, which is on slide 3.","As we've done in previous quarters, we'll be referring to comparable results for most of our segments on the next few slides. AT&T adopted new accounting standards this year that deal with revenue recognition, certain pension costs, and certain cash receipts on installment receivables. These changes impact our income statements and cash flows on a reported basis. So at the same time the company made a policy decision to record universal service fees and other regulatory fees on a net basis.","So getting to it. Adjusted EPS was $0.90 per share, which was up more than 20% for the quarter and up 18% year to date. Tax reform continues to have a positive impact on EPS, as does adoption of revenue recognition standards as well as the full quarter impact of WarnerMedia.","Earnings were pressured by strong smartphone volumes with the launch of the iPhone XS as well as some foreign exchange pressure, especially in our VRIO and WarnerMedia operations. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share growth at the upper end of the $3.50 range. The fourth quarter has traditional seasonal Wireless pressure. But our strong third quarter iPhone volumes and WarnerMedia will ease that impact.","Consolidated revenues came in at $45.7 billion, up 15%, thanks mostly to the Time Warner acquisition. When you look on a comparative basis and without Time Warner, revenues were essentially flat year over year. Gains in Wireless and Xandr, our new advertising segment, were offset by declines in legacy services, the impact of transition in our video business, and foreign exchange pressure.","Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the quarter were up year over year as reported and on a comparable basis. The addition of WarnerMedia provides margin support, but solid smartphone sales did drive some pressure. The biggest margin pressure continues to be because we're transitioning from linear to over-the-top video.","Our cash from operations and free cash flow continue to be strong as Randall pointed out. Free cash flow was $6.5 billion in the quarter and $14.4 billion year to date. This is even more impressive when you consider capital spending of $5.9 billion with no reimbursement of FirstNet costs in the quarter.","We continue to expect our capital spending in the $22 billion range this year. But we don't expect as much vendor financing in the fourth quarter as before. So now we expect to be in the $24 billion range in gross capital investment for the year.","We're feeling really good about our free cash flow position heading into the fourth quarter. We expect $1.3 billion of FirstNet reimbursements in the fourth quarter, since we've received the FirstNet authority's approval for the latest contract milestone achievement.","We also have another full quarter of free cash flow from WarnerMedia. And when you consider last fourth quarter's free cash flow of $4.5 billion, remember it included $1 billion of employee-related payments, including employee tax reform bonuses and some benefit funding plans.","When you take this all together, you can see how this gives us growing confidence in our cash position as we move forward. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow is a critical part of our strategy and gives us the financial strength to both invest in the business and improve our leverage position.","Let's now talk segment results, starting with our Communications segment, which consists of Mobility, Entertainment Group, and Business Wireline units. That information is on slide 4.","The tide definitely turned in Wireless. Postpaid phone growth continues. Prepaid had its second best phone net add quarter in more than 10 years, and service revenues grew by more than 2%. Total Wireless revenues were up more than 5%, thanks in part to higher equipment revenues.","Postpaid phone net adds continued its year-over-year improvement, adding 69,000 subscribers. That's the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement.","Prepaid added another 570,000 subscribers with 481,000 of those being prepaid phones. Strong sales did pressure margins, where we sold 700,000 more postpaid iPhones this year than last. But we grew EBITDA, and our service margin was still solid, coming in at about 50%.","Moving over to our Entertainment Group, we continue to see the impact of the video transition on our revenues and margins. We told you last quarter that we expect revenue EBITDA pressure to continue the rest of the year. And recently Randall talked about stabilizing the business next year. Revenues did improve sequentially in the quarter, but some of the margin pressure continued.","Third quarter EBITDA comparisons were also pressured by an additional week of NFL SUNDAY TICKET games, which we'll get back with one less week in the fourth quarter, and last year's Mayweather\/McGregor event, which was a record-setting event. Without those pressures, EBITDA was down about 14% year over year, an improvement from the second quarter decline.","We still have a lot of work to do, but we are committed to stabilizing EBITDA in 2019. John Donovan will provide more details on how we'll get to Entertainment Group EBITDA stability next year. But you can see the impact of some of the first steps we are taking in our third quarter results.","DIRECTV NOW net adds were 49,000. We've been very successful in building our over-the-top subscriber base. Now we're focusing on improving profitability; scaled back our promotions and special offers. We also moved toward market pricing in the quarter. We expected net adds to be impacted by these actions, and they were. But subscriber growth in the quarter exceeded our expectations.","Traditional TV subs continue to decline but at a slower rate than last year. U-verse improved, but we continue to see declines in DIRECTV subscribers. DTV subscribers were impacted by a 32,000 customer loss due to the elimination of our prepaid video product in Puerto Rico.","In Business Wireline, we continue to improve margins through cost efficiencies. Margins were up on a comparable basis, as these cost efficiencies offset legacy revenue declines. Part of the margin improvement and the revenue lift was from the realization of some intangible revenues in the quarter. But even without those revenues, margins were still up year over year.","Now let's look at WarnerMedia's third quarter results. Those are on slide 5. WarnerMedia had strong revenue growth with gains in all three business units. Higher subscription revenues at HBO and Turner and increased TV licensing revenues at Warner Bros. helped drive most of those gains.","Total WarnerMedia operating expenses were up year over year, primarily due to higher television production costs at Warner Bros., which were partially offset by expense declines at Turner and HBO.","In August, during our accounting call we estimated the amortization for Time Warner pre-acquisition, pre-release content was $600 million and would be included in segment EBITDA. Since then, we've done a lot more work, specifically on our purchase-price accounting efforts. And the amount amortized this quarter increased by about $200 million over what we expected to reach nearly $800 million in the quarter. But even with this additional $200 million charge, WarnerMedia EBITDA still grew.","Turner saw solid gains in subscription and content level revenues. Subscription revenues continue to grow, thanks to higher domestic rates and growth of Turner's international networks, even with some foreign exchange pressure.","Turner's advertising revenues declined 4%, or 3% excluding foreign exchange. Domestic ad revenues declined low single digits due to lower delivery across various Turner networks, primarily for kids and young adults. International ad revenues declined in the low double digits, reflecting pressure from foreign exchange rates.","Turner's operating income was up 13% reflecting revenue growth and a decline in operating expenses.","HBO also delivered solid subscription revenue growth in the quarter. Subscription revenues were up 7%, primarily due to higher domestic rates and subscriber gains in our national markets. Content and other revenues were down due to lower home entertainment and international licensing revenues.","HBO's operating income was up nearly 11% due to higher revenues and a decline in expenses.","Warner Bros. revenues grew nearly 8% in the quarter driven by higher television licensing revenues. Television revenues increased primarily due to higher licensing and initial telecast revenues, driven in part by the number of Warner Bros.-produced TV series. The actual revenues were mostly flat, which was quite an accomplishment considering the tough comparison to the year-ago third quarter.","Television licensing and films and a strong box office slate with hit releases such as Crazy Rich Asians, The Meg, and The Nun mostly offset the challenging theatrical slate and home entertainment release comps from a year ago.","Warner Bros. operating income was essentially stable, as higher revenues were offset by higher costs, primarily due to the higher TV productions.","WarnerMedia companies also continue to be recognized for their excellence in producing high-quality entertainment content. HBO, Turner, and Warner Bros. scored another impressive performance at the Emmys with WarnerMedia coming away with 37 primetime Emmy wins. And Turner and HBO added another 12 news and documentary Emmy Awards as well. CNN got six of those. I think that was a record for them.","Now let's look at our Latin America and Xandr results on slide 6. Total Latin America revenues and EBITDA were down year over year, primarily due to foreign exchange. Without the foreign exchange impact, revenues would have grown 5% on a comparable basis.","Subscriber growth continues to be strong in Mexico. We added more than 900,000 new subscribers and more than 3.5 million in the past year. We now have more than 17 million subscribers in total.","Service revenue in Mexico was down largely due to the decision we made in the first quarter to shut down the wholesale business that we inherited from Nextel as well as some FX pressure. Without those impact, service revenues would have been up year over year. While FX did impact our Latin America satellite operations, the business continues to be profitable and generate cash.","During the quarter, we launched Xandr, our new advertising and analytics business. And you can understand our enthusiasm for this business when you look at the results. Revenues were up more than 30% this year, partly due to our acquisition of AppNexus in the quarter. But even when you take AppNexus out, revenues were up 22% with EBITDA growing by more than 15%.","We believe we're just scratching the surface here. You can see what a difference targeted advertising makes when you look at the difference in the growth rates between AdWorks and Turner.","We're excited about the opportunity to apply our advertising technology to the Turner inventory. All together we have about $7 billion of consolidated annual ad revenues with a portion of that being addressable, highly targeted advertising.","AppNexus adds to our analytical capabilities even more and is a critical step in building our digital advertising marketplace. We'll talk more about this during our analyst meeting next month.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to John Donovan, who will provide an update on our Communications business. John?","John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks, John. Now before we get to your questions, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update \u2013 oh, sorry. Thanks, John. I'd like to spend the next few minutes updating you on our priorities as we close this year and head into 2019. That includes building on our momentum in Wireless, expanding our fiber footprint, managing our video transition, and executing on our FirstNet deployment, and lastly, building on our lead in 5G.","Let me begin with our Mobility business. As John told you, the Mobility business delivered strong results in the third quarter. After four years of industry transformation, we've turned a corner with service revenue growth. I'm confident in our momentum as we finish off the year.","We continue to focus on quality phone net adds, both prepaid and postpaid, and saw year-over-year success with both in the third quarter. As John mentioned, this is our tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in postpaid phone net adds. And we had the second highest prepaid phone net add quarter in more than 10 years.","We continue to be impressed with our prepaid customer base. Our prepaid business has very strong margins with a revenue stream that's growing at almost 7% year over year. From a pure value perspective, they look very similar to some of our postpaid base. In fact, through the first three quarters of the year, about 60% of our Cricket net adds have characteristics that would generate similar value that we see out of some of our postpaid customers.","Moving to the video business. We continue to navigate industry pressure. We have plans to bring EBITDA stability back to our Entertainment Group. Allow me to elaborate on that.","First, we're refining our four video products, tailoring them to customer needs. Our mobility-focused WatchTV is gaining traction. DIRECTV NOW is being updated to increase its simplicity and further differentiate the service. And our premium DIRECTV and U-verse services focus on the traditional linear TV viewers.","We've also begun beta testing our proprietary thin client streaming service and plan to roll out trials in the first half of next year. This will be a more measured roll out. And like our introduction of WatchTV, we expect this service to be EBITDA positive. And over time, it should lower our acquisition cost of our premium video service. And both of these use the common platform we introduced with DIRECTV NOW.","Second, we made the strategic decision to rationalize our promotions and special offers for DIRECTV NOW. We're taking a more tailored, data driven approach. Specifically, we focused on reducing promotions for low value, high churn customers.","Since launching DIRECTV NOW, we've learned a lot from our nearly 2 million subscribers about price elasticity and customer behavior with the virtual MVPD services. For example, we see customer behavior evolving somewhat like Wireless, with some customers seasonally shopping for shows.","We know our customer base now. And with our data, we'll continue to tweak our approach to optimize profitability and see our value proposition stabilize. This puts us in a more stable position as we set up a product realignment in 2019.","Thirdly, we're evaluating our program lineup. Content is the largest and fastest-growing cost of any video offering. We're evaluating our channel lineups and taking a fresh look at how we can align content cost with the price. It's also about what customers want. And many want smaller, value-based video packages.","And fourth, the two-year price lock promotion for DIRECTV and U-verse is being lapped. This gives us additional ARPU growth going forward and significant margin relief through 2019.","Another way we're working to improve Entertainment Group EBITDA is by driving broadband growth in our fiber footprint. We now cover more than 10 million customer locations today and plan to add 4 million more locations in the next year. We already have substantially more than 3 million broadband customers in our fiber footprint. And the longer we have fiber in the market, the higher our penetration.","In fact, we expect our fiber broadband base to increase by more than 1 million subscribers this year. This shift to fiber is beginning to drive IP broadband ARPU growth. The strategic pivot we're making with video, combined with our execution with fiber gives us the confidence that we will stabilize Entertainment Group EBITDA next year.","Finally, we're keeping a laser focus on costs in all of our businesses and maintaining our margins in Business Wireline.","Let's now move to an update on our FirstNet deployment, which is on slide 9. Our FirstNet team continues to execute extremely well. So far, we launched a nationwide FirstNet dedicated and physically separate network core with FirstNet traffic moving on it. We have priority and pre-emption in place, allowing continuous service during times of heavy traffic.","FirstNet devices are ready and available. These devices support all AT&T commercial LTE bands as well as the FirstNet Band 14 and meet the band priority selection technical requirements. And we're six months ahead of schedule with our network deployment already covering about one-third of the expected FirstNet area.","We're seeing in real time how we are performing in times of emergency with Hurricane Michael being the latest example. We began preparing for this storm before it arrived and our work continues even to today.","Because of these efforts, we were able to keep our customers, including first responders, connected during and after the storm in many areas. In fact, our network operated at 90%, and usually better, of normal performance in the areas affected by Hurricane Michael. And through our tight coordination with public safety, we rolled out network assets to impacted areas to keep first responders connected.","We also worked with local authorities to identify public safety agencies that were without service from their wireless provider and delivered hundreds of FirstNet-enabled devices to help these first responders carry out their important mission of keeping the public safe.","One first responder went as far to say, when everything else was down, FirstNet was working. That's high praise, and we're humbled that we can play a part in helping a community recover from such a devastating storm. That's what FirstNet is all about.","We continue to push our deployment. We're climbing towers and adding 700 megahertz, AWS, and WCS spectrum all at once. We're also adding new radio capability, which will enable us to upgrade the tower to 5G, without another tower climb.","The first responder community is a great sales opportunity for us. It's an area where we've been under-penetrated in the past. But with our dedicated network core and outstanding performance when it matters most to the first responders, we're making headway.","We now have more than 250,000 subscribers on FirstNet with more than 3,600 agencies represented. With a sales team dedicated to building this base, we believe there's a lot of opportunity waiting for us.","Now I'd like to talk about our leadership in 5G, which is on slide 10. AT&T is on track to be the first wireless carrier to introduce mobile 5G services in the United States in the next few weeks. This will be standards-based 5G. We plan to introduce 5G in parts of 12 cities by the end of the year. And we've announced additional 5G cities for next year, as we drive toward nationwide coverage of our 5G network.","Second, our 5G foundation is in place. We've completed 5G trials in several cities in the last three years. Fiber is the backbone of 5G, and we have one of the nation's largest fiber networks. Including businesses, we pass about 18 million customer locations today and are expanding that to more than 22 million locations by next year.","We plan for our 5G Evolution to be in more than 400 markets by the end of this year with nationwide coverage by mid-2019. Customers are seeing a dramatic lift in speeds with theoretical peak speeds reaching 400 megabits per second.","We also plan to launch LTE Licensed Assisted Access, or LTE-LAA, in parts of 24 cities by the end of the year. These are the building blocks towards the transition to 5G and can deliver speeds substantially faster than traditional LTE.","We're also the leader in software defined networking and are on track with our virtualization goals. This virtualization is bringing baseband units to the edge of the cloud or core and is going to be key for ultra-low latency that's in 5G.","Thanks in part to our FirstNet build, our fallow spectrum is being put into service at a rapid rate. We're on track to increase the amount of spectrum deployed by nearly 50%.","This is having a dramatic positive impact on our network, and others are noticing. We've been named the nation's best network by a September GWS OneScore study, which is the largest and most comprehensive network study of its kind. Our network already is a recognized leader, and we're taking steps to make it even better.","With that, I'll turn it back over to you, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks, John. Now before we get to your questions, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on our deleveraging plans. Those are on slide 12.","You know the commitments we've made. We plan to get to the 2.9 times range by the end of this year, drop that even lower by the end of next year to the 2.5 times range, and then return to historical levels by year-end 2022.","One big way we plan to accomplish that is through free cash flow growth. Our strong third quarter cash from operations and free cash flow results points to our ability to do just that.","We also continue to look for ways to monetize our large asset portfolio. We made several such moves in recent years, most recently the sale of our data centers and our under-utilized spectrum, combined generating over a couple billion dollars of proceeds. And we've identified billions of dollars of other assets where we can do more. So this is an ongoing process.","Our merger synergies will also help contribute, and they remain on target, $1.5 billion in cost synergies and $1 billion in revenue related synergies on a run rate basis by the end of 2021.","In addition, capital market options will be under consideration \u2013 or quite frankly, are under consideration. All options will be evaluated. We're going into diverse markets and looking at diverse investor bases. We'll consider make whole calls, tenders, as well as any other efficient capital alternatives. We've got that work going on now.","You can see how we are at managing our debt maturities by looking at what we've accomplished just since the merger closed. Since we've closed the deal, we've managed to spread maturity towers very effectively and expect to retire or refinance $28 billion of near- to intermediate-term maturities by the end of the year.","As you can see from our schedule, we've done most of that already. We've done this with cash on hand at the time of the close and utilizing diverse capital markets over the last four months. Our debt towers will look much different, resulting in very manageable annual debt payments.","We also have been able to lock in a portion of our debt into historically low interest rates. About 90% of our market debt is fixed rate, protecting us from rising interest rates. And when rates do rise, as they have in recent months, we have a natural hedge with our pension and benefit plans.","Simply put, a 1% increase in the discount rate today will decrease our pension plan liabilities by about $5 billion, so a very effective economic hedge.","Bottom line, our financial strength allows us to achieve our leverage targets and continue to invest in our business and return value to shareholders.","With that, I think we're ready to take your questions.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","John, go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And first, we'll go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Good morning. So, Randall, I think recently you talked about the free cash flow as part of the deleveraging, getting to a $25 billion floor, the value exiting 2018. I wonder if you could just elaborate on what's driving that? And how you see that evolving over the course of 2019? Thanks.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Sure. Hi, Simon. Thanks.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Morning.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Yeah, what I said through I think it was last month was that we had told The Street, we had told everybody we would do $21 billion-plus this year in free cash flow. And that includes $2 billion of merger costs associated with the Time Warner deal.","And so the $21 billion, plus the $2 billion, which doesn't recur next year, puts you at $23 billion. And that all \u2013 the $21 billion also only included a couple billion, $2 billion of Time Warner cash flow. So you put Time Warner in for a full year, you get to $25 billion exiting this year as a run rate.","Now if you just kind of want to test that number, if you look at the first quarter we just posted here, in terms of what our free cash flow was for this quarter at $6.5 billion, annualize that, and you're at a $26 billion-plus kind of run rate number.","And so just to kind of help you simplistically understand how you get to a $25 billion number, that's kind of the path that we're on right now. And that assumes no growth in our Mobility business. It assumes no growth in WarnerMedia.","We assume that we keep the Mobility business growing. We assume that we get the Entertainment Group, our broadband and TV business to stable next year, whereas right now it's declining on an EBITDA basis double digits. And then you get Mexico from an EBITDA dilution standpoint this year to we think we can get this thing to break even or positive next year.","So you put all that together, we get good EBITDA growth, which should drive cash flow growth. And so $25 billion is just a comfortable number that I put out there. And we're actually on a run rate that looks better than that now.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Yeah, Randall, just if I can (36:23) add to that, we're really far along on our 12.5 million [customer locations] fiber-to-the-prem commitment out of the DTV transaction. That'll be done some time around the middle of the year, has to be. So we have a support there for a capital management, capital spend management.","Secondly, we've essentially completed the Mexico 100 million LTE build. We're just about right there on the edge. So once again, that'll give us an opportunity to hedge that.","Third, the FirstNet team and the network team working with them have been remarkable. They're well ahead of the targeted builds. We spent money to do that, close to a $0.5 billion, a little bit over $0.5 billion this quarter that we weren't reimbursed for.","And so that bodes well for us as we have had our milestones approved and expect to receive $1.3 billion in proceeds, reimbursements for that contract this quarter. So all of those things are what are building this momentum about strong cash flows.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","I think it's important too to take what John said and I said about where we exit the year in terms of free cash flow. And then pair that with that last schedule John Stephens walked you through on our debt maturities.","We will exit this year with average annual debt maturities for the next four years of $12 billion, well within the free cash flow less dividend range. And so we feel like we've got it stacked up where the debt is very manageable. We can get to these deleveraging targets that John spoke of. And I think it's stacked up well right now.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks, Simon.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Take the next question.","Operator","And we'll go to John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Maybe for Randall, a broader question. You guys have voiced a lot of confidence in the financial performance, which we just heard, and the strategic vision of the company. But the market's clearly not giving you credit for a lot of these things.","As you talk to investors, what do you think it is that the market's missing? Is it what you just went over there, the cash flow profile of the company versus the debt? Or if you could just sort of \u2013 what do you think is missing from the equation, given the performance of the stock?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","I think in terms of missing from the equation, I feel like we're tracking on plan right now, John.","As I pointed out earlier, the debt is very manageable. I'm very comfortable with the debt, the deleveraging, and getting down to 2.5 times by end of year next year. I think the cash flow characteristics of the business today already have us there. And that assumes that we have no further growth in 2019 in terms of our cash and our EBITDA. Cash flow is growing at a 14% year-over-year pace.","And so I think what we're going to have to just demonstrate to the market is continued performance in the Mobility side of the business. I think we have very good momentum.","As I mentioned on the prepaid side, Cricket is just defining that category and doing incredibly well. And that's an incredibly profitable customer base that we're building there and doing very well. The postpaid is doing well. ARPUs are growing in Mobility. And EBITDA looks really good.","And so if we can get this, the Entertainment Group, which is our broadband and our TV business, to stability, and we get Mexico to EBITDA neutral, to even EBITDA growth next year, then you have an equation that looks like really good cash flow growth for the next three, four years.","And so I think what we have to do is continue executing and posting quarters. I actually am pleased with this quarter. And we continue to do this, I think the markets will reflect that.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","And is EBITDA growth a part of that story? I mean, just it declined about 2.2% this quarter. Last quarter it was down about 5%, which is a nice trajectory to be on. Do you expect that trajectory to continue?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Yeah, look, I mean, the EBITDA is driven by our Mobility business. And so can we get the Mobility business to good solid EBITDA growth? And I'll let John Donovan provide more color on that.","But I think we have a high degree of confidence that we can get Mobility to EBITDA growth. And so, yeah, to answer your question, we need to demonstrate sustained EBITDA growth on the company.","WarnerMedia, I mean you're seeing EBITDA growth today. Mobility, you're seeing us at EBITDA growth. Can we extend the Mobility EBITDA growth and get Entertainment Group to flat? Then there's your recipe for EBITDA growth. John, would you like to add any color on the Entertainment Group?","John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.","I'd love to. So if you look at the components of the Entertainment Group, what I think gets lost sometimes is it's a broadband-led world out there right now. If you look at the broadband portfolio, our fiber footprint build has given us a lot of inventory to sell into.","If you look at the industry's rate of decline on linear video, you find that we're doing dramatically better than the industry where we have fiber footprint. We're doing dramatically better than the industry in churn and acquisition where we have 25 meg and greater.","Where our stress is is in the linear, in areas where we're priced with just the linear video. And we're going to have to take actions to continue to improve how we're doing there.","But with the fiber inventory that we've got coming online back half of this year, first part of next year, we have a lot of footprint to sell into. And within the quarter, not only do we have broadband ARPU growth, each month of the quarter got stronger. So we feel very good about where the broadband footprint is, in particular the fiber area. And that will help us with the video business, the linear video business.","Probably the most important thing to draw attention to is the transition of the video business within. And if I could take just a minute to talk through what we've done there.","We thought it important as a 25% market share player in linear video that we be prepared to own the customers in this transition. And so when we put together an OTT product, DIRECTV NOW, we wanted to catch our customers. And I mentioned to you on prior calls that a large portion of those customers were either coming from cable or were coming from cord-cutter categories.","So we now have enough experience there to know that that business is a little bit like the prepaid Wireless business. We have seasonal shoppers who are shopping for shows. It's very promotionally intensive for roughly a third of that base.","And we're going to continue to curate that portfolio in a way that allows us to become more profitable. So as you think about the profitability of the video portfolio, the full-service premium product is going to continue to be driven by footprint. We feel very good about how broadband assists us there.","We're going to take our learnings in DIRECTV NOW and be more discriminating about the content that's provided and the profitability of that content. And then for mobile-only, we've got WatchTV, which right out of the chute is a profitable product.","And so I would say that right now we're very well-positioned as we roll into 2019 to be confident that we're going to get EBITDA stability in the video portfolio alone. That coupled with the strength of broadband will give us a really good EG performance overall as we roll into 2019.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for the color, guys.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks. Just can we take the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan","Thanks, guys. John Donovan, if I could follow-up on what you just said. Can you dig into more on the trends in linear and DIRECTV NOW this quarter? I think that we and other people were a little surprised by the numbers, given the commentary about resiliency in September in DIRECTV NOW, but you said it was better than expected. Was the sequential slowdown a gross add or mostly a churn challenge? Thanks.","John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.","Well, if you look within the portfolio of the base that we've got, a lot of you folks have done your analytics, done surveying, and it's shown that DIRECTV NOW product, generally, we have tremendous engagement.","But within DIRECTV NOW, it's a tale of two cities. It's folks that are just jumping from promotion to promotion and really spinning in the industry between us, Hulu Live, YouTube TV. And so what we're learning, where and who those customers are, what people are viewing.","And so we actually expected a far worse outcome than we had. Its resiliency we \u2013 when we raised pricing and took promotions off \u2013 we were not at all promotional or very, very limited promotions of that product overall. And then we started to shift our mix.","So what we're after is customers that are highly engaged, that find the product compelling and use it a lot. That will lend itself towards being able to be supplemented by an ad model over time. And so what we wanted is to secure that base. And that's what we're going to focus on.","So going forward, our own team forecasts the growth of the OTT category lower than I think a lot of the analyst community does. Because after a first big slug with the introduction of fulsome packages, we're starting to learn now the customer base that's using this.","And so if you look at linear TV, it's really going to be about broadband and how do we use broadband to lead ourselves into premium TV. And then get an OTT package that's well-suited to the people that are going to be the heavily engaged users.","That customer base that we burned off, if you will, in the third quarter, and that we may or may not going forward chase in any given quarter, is always available. It's very promotionally-sensitive and price-sensitive, so you can always go get that business when you find the economics to do it so \u2013 or advantageous as a result of, for instance, what you can do on ad-supported models.","And so we learned a lot about it. We've streamlined the content packages. We've changed the mix of customers we're taking in with a bias towards getting people that are heavily engaged, that are buying on the higher end of those OTT offers.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks, Phil. Go ahead, Phil.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan","I was going to say, can I follow up once more on the question earlier? John, did you just say to expect stability in video EBITDA next year, as well as growth in broadband? So are you guiding us now to growing Entertainment EBITDA?","John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.","No. What we're saying is we expect to see stability in the Entertainment Group as total, fueled in part by our solid performance in broadband as we get the 14 million fiber-to-the-prem customers available to sell into.","So the broadband results, which we are optimistic about, will add to our ability to get to overall stability in the Entertainment Group.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan","Great. Thank you.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","We'll go to Amy Yong with Macquarie Research. Please go ahead.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you and good morning. Maybe one on advertising. Can you talk a little bit more about Xandr? I think a lot of us have seen cable's JV (48:31) in the past. How are you thinking about this differently? What are you doing differently?","And I think you recently signed up Frontier and Altice. What's been the receptiveness with those two in terms of the ad community?","And then maybe as the last part of the question, how does this then shape your view on Entertainment EBITDA? Thanks.","John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.","So this is John. Let me try to take a stab at it and ask Randall to jump in. First of all, when we looked at our opportunities with regard to the data analytics and the information that we had available, as well as the advertising opportunity, the first thing was to go out and get a collection of talent that has been established at Xandr that can really give us different insights, different capabilities, and we've done that. The second piece was then to get the \u2013 and so and those included data analytics capabilities that are specifically talented towards or gifted towards the advertising space.","Secondly, you need to get the technology platform and the ability to continue to develop data driven products. AppNexus was key to that, not only with their supply side and demand side platforms, but quite frankly, with their core talent, which is their engineering group. That brings us engineers that have this capability and have dealt with this for a long time, a great experience there.","When you combine those assets then with the tremendous data we have from a 25 million customer base in the video space, when you combine that with a significant inventory of advertising slots, whether it's the Turner inventory slots, 14 minutes in an hour of TV, or the 2 minutes from DIRECTV, you have both the data and the inventory capabilities. That's what this is about.","We have started that process with AdWorks, specifically from the legacy DIRECTV. And you've seen those results, double digit revenue growth. The quarter was 22% without AppNexus, tremendous performance. And we're proving that it works in that linear TV space.","I think we had announcements with regard to a couple of the other, if you will, distributors joining with us with regard to this, both Altice and Frontier. So we're starting to get traction with some of our other participants in the industry that view the team and the resources and the capability as being highly attractive. We'll continue to work on those efforts.","But longer term, if you can continue to grow this and use this capability, it can provide so much flexibility on your \u2013 from your customer base on linear TV, on the DIRECTV NOW, and the over-the-top. Quite frankly, then moving it on to Wireless and other areas.","The reaction I think from the business community has been positive. The reaction from our advertisers, I think it's been generally positive. I think we need to \u2013 we will continue to focus on proving that we can do what we say we're going to do, which the team is certainly doing.","And the opportunities are bright, particularly if we can move towards similar results across our total inventory of ads as well as attract other participants to join with us to increase the overall quality. Randall, anything you'd like to add?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","I think you covered it quite well. We just \u2013 we could \u2013 we have a lot of confidence as we build the mechanical tools and put in place a marketplace where people can design campaigns, measure campaigns, and do it without a lot of human intervention, which is what AppNexus does today in the digital world.","As we stand that up, can this 22% growth that we're experiencing on just our DIRECTV inventory \u2013 and keep in mind, that 22% growth we saw on the DIRECTV inventory is on a subscriber base that's declining 3% year over year.","And so if the revenues are growing 22% on a declining subscriber base, does that translate into a more fulsome inventory over in Turner? And can you drive growth rates that look that attractive on the Turner side? We actually have a high degree of confidence we can. This will take time to put these tools in place and develop the capability. But we have a high to \u2013 we really have a high degree of confidence here. And we're very enthusiastic about this opportunity.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Amy, I know you asked about the advertiser business. Did you have another question in there?","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","No, I actually wanted to just follow up and see if Xandr at all shapes your view on Entertainment EBITDA group's \u2013 and hitting stability? Thanks.","John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.","Yeah. And I think as John earlier covered, we're focused on improving that EBITDA trends and we're looking towards stability coming in 2019. And that's going to be both from the video strategy that John laid out and marketplace actions as well as continued improvement in broadband from our fiber-based products.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","I think the other thing, John, I would add is that \u2013 we mentioned it in the formal notes, is that two-year price locks that we have in place are rolling off. And the traditional linear video ARPU as a result of that can move to market pricing on most of the base. And us rolling past that is a really important lever for us going forward.","John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.","Even if the content costs continue to escalate at 10%.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","So next question if we could. Thank you, Amy.","Operator","We'll go to David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess the first one for John Stephens on deleveraging. So, John, could you \u2013 two things I guess, two sub-parts.","Could you elaborate more specifically on kind of what assets specifically are of a large enough magnitude to be relevant to the deleveraging conversation? And also does the deleveraging target have an asterisk next to it relevant to spectrum spending? And ignoring the millimeter wave, things like CBRS and C-Band. Or are you guys comfortable with where you are spectrum-wise and you can focus exclusively on the deleveraging?","And then just a housekeeping item, kind of following up on Amy's question on advertising. I think advertising is kind of showing up in a lot of different places. It's being double counted in some other places. It's being eliminated in third places. So could you kind of just run through, John Stephens again, kind of where we're seeing advertising show up? And what's being reported where? Thanks so much.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Great. So let me take the last one first. Advertising is showing up at about a $400 million run rate. And just pure advertising in the AdWorks, the advertising segment, and that is from ads that are sold on the legacy TV, linear TV business, or in DIRECTV. So the revenue is showing up in advertising segment as well as about just under $6 a month on the customer base in the Entertainment Group. And then that is eliminated through company eliminations at the corporate segment.","Secondly, there's about $40 (56:12) worth of revenue this quarter from AppNexus. That's reported in the advertising business segment and only there.","Third, there is about \u2013 we run about $1 billion, or maybe it's a little bit less than that, this quarter in advertising in Turner, in WarnerMedia. That's reported there. That is not reported in the advertising segment because Turner manages that, WarnerMedia manages that internally.","And then what we do is we provide a supplement to show you a full picture of the advertising capabilities or revenue streams for the total of AT&T. And that supplemental adds those two numbers together and that's included in our disclosure sheet. So that's just an effort to make sure we give you full transparency with regard to what our total advertising is.","So that's how it's recorded. That's how it's reported and it gives you comparable information for DIRECTV compared to other participants in the TV industry, gives you the information appropriate for advertising, gives you the information appropriate for WarnerMedia, and how they compare to others in the media industry. So it's just an effort to make sure we give comparable data that you can utilize as you look at other companies.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","With regard to asterisks, there are no asterisks. The 2.5 [times] range, which means if we come in at 2.51 [times] or 2.52 [times], we're going to say we met our mark. That's what the range is about. It's not \u2013 it's about 2.51 [times], 2.52 [times] and we did our jobs. We're not that \u2013 we don't want to come across as being that precise or that forward knowing that we can predict that. But there's no asterisk with regard to, if you will, any asset purchases.","With regard to asset sales, I'd just say it this way. We go through the listing of real estate we have, and I know this sounds a little bit \u2013 if we go, for example, the new opportunities on credit process that came through the Tax Reform Act (sic) [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] (58:14). We have real estate all over the country that falls into those. We have a whole different category of real estate sales that may qualify or may be interested on that. If you think about our administrative buildings and, quite frankly, across the total new AT&T, you've got a whole opportunity.","So I'm not going to get into any major transactions. Certainly, as you can imagine, that might not do anything to help the valuation process. But we're looking at everything. And needless to say, that total listed \u2013 total dollar amount of assets is material even for us, and we'll continue to work it and focus on it.","We got a great plan. We have cash from ops, managing CapEx as we go forward with so many of our projects getting completed. That generates great free cash flow and solid EBITDAs with merger synergies and improvement in our business, that we've got a great way to get there.","The asset sales are an additional way to make sure that we meet and exceed these goals. But no list of assets on this call today.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Okay. We'll take one more question.","Operator","And that will be from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for getting me in. I'll ask about Wireless. Can you help us think about the churn step-up in the quarter? Whether it was tied more to pricing actions or any sort of change in the competitive backdrop?","And then seasonally, I think there's been another step-up that you've typically seen in the fourth quarter. Do you anticipate another step-up off of the 0.93% that you saw this past quarter? Thanks.","John M. Donovan - AT&T, Inc.","Yeah, if we start with the revenue side of the formula, we feel pretty strongly that with the last four or five quarters of growth \u2013 and that's just not year-over-year improvement. When we go to absolute growth, you start to have that kick into the base of your revenue.","We took price action, so we expect the churn to tick up as a result of those price actions. And a lot of that has subsided now because the price actions occurred in late first and through the second quarter. And so we feel very good about where we are right now in both customer acquisitions.","And by the way, by the data that we looked at, if you take the third quarter, we believe we were the least promotional of all the carriers out there. And yet provided some good net growth on both the traditional postpaid business at Cricket, which you've heard a lot of excitement about today. So if you look at the total performance on phones, smartphones, we had a really good quarter. And we're starting to get growth out of Cricket. We're getting growth in the core business.","And we're the least promotional of all the carriers, both from the standpoint of when you look at our share of voice in advertising and the financial promotions, incentives for customers. So we're executing with things like stores and close rates and traffic-driving and putting \u2013 bundling up. That still continues to be a very effective acquisition tool.","So if you look at share of gross adds, and I'm sure you folks on the call here will run that, you start to look at how we've been doing. Our share, flow share in the business has improved dramatically year over year. And that's where the strength is coming from.","The last thing I'll say is that the iPhone launch is very different this year than last year. The sequencing of the more expensive device, the timing of availability of those, that difference does net into the results. So net of that, we feel that that business was a strong third quarter. And we're very confident in the momentum of that business going forward.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","So with that, again, thanks, everybody, for joining the call. And just as a recap, first full quarter with WarnerMedia under our belts. And we have cash flow growing nicely. Operating cash flow 14%, free cash flow 17%.","Mobility is back to growth and executing well. We feel really well about \u2013 really good about where it's headed into 2019. WarnerMedia executing very well, and the first full quarter is accretive to earnings by $0.05 a share.","And going to exit the year with our debt portfolio at a very reasonable place, deleveraging plans on track, getting to 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA by the end of year next year.","So bottom line, we feel like we're stacking up well for 2019. And appreciate everybody joining us and look forward to seeing everybody on November 29 in New York. Thanks, again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for AT&T, Mr. Mike Viola. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Viola","Okay. Thank you, Lori and good afternoon everybody. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us today. As Lori said, I am Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. John will provide an update with perspective on the quarter and then we will follow that with a Q&A session. Let me remind you that our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website and that\u2019s att.com\/investor.relations.","I need to call your attention on Page 2 to our Safe Harbor statement. Before we begin, the Safe Harbor statement says that some of our comments today maybe forward-looking. And as such, they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T\u2019s website.","Before I turn it over to John, let me cover Slide 3, cover our consolidated financial summary. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.69, that\u2019s up more than 11% over last year\u2019s second quarter. This includes adjustments for a non-cash charge related to Leap\u2019s network decommissioning and other merger-related costs, which include DIRECTV and Mexico. This strong year-over-year growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexican wireless operations as well as the impact from our divested Connecticut wireline business and our equity investment in Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil.","Consolidated revenues grew to $33 billion. It\u2019s up more than 2% when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut wireline property. This growth was driven by continued solid performance in wireless as we repositioned our smartphone base. We had impressive gains in strategic business services and strong wireline consumer revenue growth. Cash flows also grew significantly in the quarter. Cash from ops for the quarter totaled more than $9 billion, up more than 13% over last year\u2019s second quarter. And free cash flow was $4.5 billion and more than $7 billion on a year-to-date basis and that brought our free cash flow dividend payout to 67% on a year-to-date basis.","And so with that overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens and he will discuss our operational highlights. John?","John Stephens","Thank you, Mike and hello everyone. Thanks for joining us today and as always thanks for your interest in AT&T. As you can see in our second quarter results, our moves to transform the company are working and working well. We grew revenues, expand the margins and achieved double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Cash flows were strong allowing us to invest in our business, return substantial value to shareholders and strengthen our cash position. Our moves to reposition our smartphone customer base are working achieving the expected results. Almost 80% of the smartphone base is already on Mobile Share Value plans and 68% of our smartphone sales and upgrades were on AT&T Next. When you are adding the customers who brought their own device, nearly three quarters of smartphone sales were without subsidies. This helped drive strong postpaid phone-only with Next ARPU growth and best ever service margins.","In wireline, our transition to IT services continues at a strong cliff. U-verse services are more than 70% of consumer revenues and helped drive near 4% adjusted revenue growth. Strategic services are now a third of our wireline business revenues and continue to grow at a very strong pace. So, all in all, a very strong quarter as we begin the diversification of our company. Our growth in cost initiatives, such as Project VIP and Project Agile, are working. We are executing at a high level and we have a solid foundation for growth as we move forward.","Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at our operational highlights starting with wireless on Slide 5. Our wireless strategy is working. Our efforts to reposition the smartphone base to the no subsidy model have taken hold. We continue to see solid evidence that our efforts are paying off. First, the most significant shift of our smartphone customers to Mobile Share Value plans is behind us. This has helped stabilize service revenues, which were essentially flat for the quarter. There was heavy promotional activity on last year\u2019s second quarter, which pressured service revenues. So, our disciplined sales approach this year helped in our year-over-year comparison.","Second, as service revenues stabilized and the number of customers using AT&T Next increases, we have seen our postpaid phone ARPU with Next increase steadily. It was up more than 6% year-over-year. And our postpaid phone-only revenues increased sequentially reaching its highest level in three quarters. We are about halfway through the expected Next sales cycle as customers upgrade their smartphones. As they do, we expect continued ARPU with Next growth as more customers upgrade. Our focus on costs, Cricket\u2019s operational efficiencies and other cost savings programs, such as Project Agile, help drive strong margin expansion in the quarter. Our adjusted wireless EBITDA service margin was 48.5%, our best performance ever and an almost 600 basis point improvement over last year\u2019s second quarter. The story of the last six quarters has been repositioning our smartphone base. This has moved subscribers away from the heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly pricing. For the last several quarters, customers on pre-Next pricing have been ahead of us, but we are starting to see the benefits of the strategy.","Let\u2019s talk more about that on Slide 6. We have made remarkable progress in transitioning our customers to Mobile Share Value plans. In a little more than a year, nearly two-thirds of our smartphone base has moved to the no subsidy discount pricing of Mobile Share Value. While customers continue to choose these plans, the growth rate is slowing as the penetration has been achieved. On the other hand, the revenue growth opportunity with AT&T Next has much farther to go. About 68% of our smartphone sales in the quarter were on AT&T Next, but our Next customer base is only about 37%. That gives us substantial opportunity to grow revenues as these customers upgrade their smartphones.","We expect penetration rates for both Mobile Share Value and AT&T Next to continue to grow. AT&T Next and Bring Your Own Device are about 90% of postpaid smartphone sales are company-owned stores and have programs \u2013 and we have programs in place to generate similar or better rates in our other channels. And the Mobile Share Value plans, continues to draw new customers. Only about 12% of our smartphone base is still on unlimited data plans and that has been steadily dropping as customers choose to move to our new Mobile Share Value plans.","We also continue to see growth in the percentage of our postpaid base on Mobile Share Value family plans or business plans. That total has reached 96% in this past quarter. These plans tend to be more sticky with lower churn. We also turned in another strong net add quarter as postpaid, prepaid and connected devices drove our highest net adds in more than 3 years. Those details are on Slide 7.","Total net adds came in at 2.1 million subscribers, including 410,000 postpaid subscribers and 1.4 million connected devices. Cricket is really kicking in the gear. Prepaid voice had a strong turnaround year from a year ago. We gained more than 330,000 prepaid voice customers after losing about that many in the year ago quarter.","Our process has been benefited by our ability to transition the Cricket customers to our new high-quality 4G LTE network. Our strong sales efforts and the near completion of the Cricket integration helped drive that turnaround. 97% of Cricket customers are now on our GSM platform as we continue the integration and as we shutdown the CDMA networks. These are premium prepaid customers, almost all are choosing smartphones when they go onto our GSM platform and about two thirds of the gross adds are choosing our highest value plans. Those are plans that have higher ARPU. In fact, those ARPU levels are similar and sometimes better than other carrier\u2019s postpaid ARPU. And we are doing this integration faster and with less churn than we originally anticipated even with our network conversion. We had our lowest ever prepaid churn, thanks to continued progress with Cricket even as we decommission the networks.","We also had our second largest connected device net add quarter ever. Our leadership in connected cars drove that growth. Our relationship with eight car manufacturers producing more than half of the new connected cars in the United States is driving this as more and more manufacturers make connectivity a key part of their new car strategies. The company had 7.2 million branded smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the second quarter. We increased our high quality branded smartphone base by about 1.2 million in the quarter. This includes branded upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number. The smartphone momentum, plus strength in prepaid, led to a positive branded voice net adds in the quarter. Churn continues to be solid. Postpaid churn was down slightly from the first quarter of this year. And for the year, we are still running below last year\u2019s best ever annual postpaid churn record of 1.04%. Total churn was also impressive. It dropped 16 basis points to 1.31% from 1.47% in the year ago quarter, driven in large part by the significant improvements in prepaid. And branded churn was also down year-over-year as we added more than 740,000 branded devices.","Now let\u2019s look at our wireline operation. That information is on Slide 8. The repositioning of our wireline base also is working. The challenge here is to maintain margins while transitioning customers to IP services from higher margin legacy services. That\u2019s not a simple task. But the team\u2019s extraordinary efforts to control costs and focus on profitability has helped stabilize or we can expand margins as we made this transition. That was true this quarter even with about $40 million or 30 basis points of additional pressure from spring storms that hit our network and our footprint. We have taken several measures to make this possible. You know of our efforts to exit low margin wholesale businesses causes revenue pressure, but it does improve the future of our business. Our customer service focus has helped to reduce cycle times in provisioning services for customers and added network on demand capabilities with our next generation network investments. These efforts were recently recognized by IDC, which named AT&T a leader in seeking new innovations to improve customer service.","Our Project Agile is more of a mindset than just a cost efficiency program. We are not only finding ways to take costs out of our business, but also working to make things simpler to start with for both our customers and us. Our transformation IP technologies continue to drive strong performance in both strategic business services and wireline consumer in the quarter. Adjusted strategic service revenues grew by nearly 14%. And when you adjust for the foreign exchange pressure, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 16%. At the same time, we see the impact of IP with our data revenues. Total data revenues are nearly 60% of wireline business revenues and more than half of those revenues are from strategic services as we transition customers from legacy data services. This has helped drive total data year-over-year revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter.","Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 3.9%. However, if you adjust for the impact of our discontinued wholesale businesses and FX, the decline would have been 1.7%. There was revenue pressure across our wireline business operation, but was most pronounced in wholesale, where we have been focusing on profitable sales even if it meant a reduction in revenue. Small business revenue was down slightly over the first quarter of the year, but we continue to see fiber sales accelerate and we are very excited to hear that AT&T has been named the highest ranked brand in overall business wireline customer satisfaction performance in the J.D. Power small-to-medium business segment for 2015. That\u2019s quite a tribute to the business teams\u2019 efforts in this space.","On the consumer side, U-verse services are more than 70% of consumer revenues and adjusted revenues grew about 19% year-over-year. That helped drive our strongest consumer revenue growth in 5 quarters, growing by 3.7% when adjusting for the sale of Connecticut operations. You also see our focus on profitability and repositioning our customer base with U-verse. Video net adds dropped with fewer promotions and are targeting of high value subscribers. We did add about 240,000 IP broadband customers in the quarter as we continue to reposition our DSL base to IP. That work is nearing completion with less than 1 million eligible DSL subscribers left to transition.","Now, let\u2019s look at consolidated margins, which are on Slide 9. The strength in wireless and stable wireline margins had a positive impact on consolidated margins. In the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew to $11.1 billion and the adjusted consolidated margin was 33.6% compared to 31.5% last year. That\u2019s more than 200 basis point improvement. Adjusted operating income also is showing continued improvement. It was $6.5 billion, up 12.4% year-over-year. And adjusted operating income margin grew to 19.6%, up more than 190 basis points from the year earlier second quarter. This was largely due to cost focus initiatives, which included Project Agile, our strength in wireless, growth in consumer revenues and gains in strategic business services. The company also benefited from lower trailing expenses from capital spending as Project VIP was completed. And our move to next generation networks is starting to make a real difference as well.","Now, let\u2019s move to cash flow, where we had an outstanding quarter. The summary is on Slide 10. Our ability to generate cash continues to be strong. Cash from operations totaled $9.2 billion, that\u2019s nearly four times our dividend commitment and our best cash generation in seven quarters. And we generated $15.9 billion in cash year-to-date. Capital expenditures totaled $4.7 billion and $8.7 billion year-to-date. We still expect standalone capital spending in the $18 billion range this year, but we are now including our expansion efforts in Mexico in that amount. Free cash flow was $4.5 billion and $7.2 billion year-to-date. We are well on our way to hitting our standalone free cash flow guidance we gave you earlier this year. We now expect standalone free cash flow, excluding any impact from DIRECTV in the $12 billion range or better and this includes the operational and capital impacts from our Mexican acquisitions.","In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion, which gives us a free cash flow to dividend payout ratio of 55% for the quarter and about 67% year-to-date. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.15, similar to the first quarter. We did issue debt in the second quarter to help finance our acquisition activities. Our long-range goal is to get these levels back to the 1.8 range and expect our cash focus to be on paying down debt in the near-term. The strong financial performance in the first half of the year sets us up well for the transformation and diversification of our business.","Now, let me close with a quick summary of the quarter on Slide 11 before we get to your questions. Our transformation plan is working. When you build the great network, develop next generation products and focus on the customer, good things happen. This focus drove strong results in the quarter that\u2019s all growing revenues, expanding margins and double-digit adjusted EPS growth, but just as important was our ability to generate cash from our business, which we did. All this is in line or better than guidance that we gave you earlier this year. These results add to our confidence that we are on track to hit our standalone guidance metrics.","Wireless financials were solid as we near completion of our shift to Mobile Share Value plans. Next take rates continue to increase helping drive increasing postpaid phone with Next ARPU. Our prepaid brands are doing great and our expense management helped drive our best ever service margins. Our move into Mexico positions us as the only company who owns and operates a North American mobile service area that will serve more than 400 million people with 4G LTE service. And we expect to reach 350 million people by year end. Owning these network assets not only provides a high level of service quality for our customers, but also gives us owner\u2019s economics advantages.","We are also very pleased that in order to approve our DIRECTV transaction with certain conditions, it\u2019s circulating at the SEC. We expect final approval at anytime. We won\u2019t be able to address any of your questions about the deal today during this call, but I can tell you this. First, as far as any conditions that Chairman Wheeler alluded to earlier this week, we feel very confident that we can make an adequate return on any investment we make as part of this deal. Our threshold for investment in determining what\u2019s best for our shareholders has not changed. Second, we still fully expect to achieve $2.5 billion worth of cost synergies from this transaction. That also has not changed.","We plan to webcast an Analyst Day from Dallas very soon after the deal closes to discuss our strategy in much more detail. We are more confident than ever about the opportunity this transaction brings. We are building a unique communications and entertainment company, that we believe will not only transform us, but transform our industry as well. And we are very anxious to talk with you about it.","With that, Lori, let\u2019s go ahead and take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go to John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","John Stephens","Good afternoon, John.","John Hodulik","Hey, the two things I think that stood up the most in the report were the service revenue trends and the wireless margins. So, first, on the service revenue, given the trends you are seeing and the slowing shift to the Mobile Share Value, do you feel confident that we can get to growth in that line item in the second half of the year given the competitive environment? And then on the margins, big improvement there, 600 basis points in the year-over-year basis. I mean, there were some add-backs, but is this \u2013 is that the kind of improvement we should see throughout the rest of the year? Thanks.","John Stephens","Yes, John, good question. Thanks. First, let me say this, we are pleased with the team\u2019s efforts on the cost containment and that really help push the margins up. They did a great job and they continue with that focus. On the service revenues, we did get a little bit of benefit this year or this quarter from the promotional activity that took place last year. So, the disciplined sales approach that the team took was really important to driving that good performance in the service revenues. While we are not giving specific guidance on either on service margins or on the specific amount of wireless margins, we are going to stay with our guidance that we did have out there that we continue to expect to grow overall revenues in our business and that we are going to continue to expect to grow margins both on the wireless and on the consolidated side. So, I will stick with that, but yes, we are very encouraged by it. The discipline that the team has shown is impressive and we see every reason to continue that focus and discipline.","John Hodulik","Alright, thanks, John.","John Stephens","Thank you.","Operator","We will go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Phil Cusick","Hi, guys. Thanks. I guess if you could talk about Mexico, can you expand for us on the plan there. You have talked about $3 billion investment. How does that split out across CapEx, OpEx? What\u2019s the timing? And when can we see those networks really integrated and ready to start ramping growth? Thanks, John.","John Stephens","Yes, so thanks, Phil. The $3 billion capital investment is capital dollars. It\u2019s expected over about a 4-year period. It won\u2019t \u2013 I won\u2019t suggest you and it will include updating 100 million POPs to LTE. But as I have said before that won\u2019t be linear, each additional POP won\u2019t have the same capital investment associated with it, because we will focus our efforts on those in best position to be upgraded and those best positioned to serve customers. That\u2019s how we will get the 40 million we are targeting by the end of this year. So the, if you will, capital will not be spread evenly or ratably over the cycle time. With that being said, I think you can view us as getting to that 40 million next year and at the end of, I think it\u2019s \u201818 we have talked about, we will get to the full 100 million. That\u2019s the spread plan that we have, Phil. But the $3 billion is capital dollars.","With regard to this year, what we really want to make sure is clear is as we spelled out in the separate international segment, the international business right now is requiring some investment. We are aware of that. We expected it. And we are going to make those investments. And with that investment and the investment in capital this year, we still believe two things will happen. We will be able to come through in the CapEx in the $18 billion range for the total company, including the Mexico CapEx and we will generate free cash flow in the $12 billion range or better, including both the capital and operational expense requirements of the Mexico business.","Phil Cusick","If I can just follow-up, the $18 billion in CapEx this year implies a nice downtick in the U.S. spending, what\u2019s driving that? Are you finding that you just don\u2019t need to spend it or are you sort of pushing that out to next year?","John Stephens","Well, I think a couple of things. And the simplest thing is to say network team did a great job in getting the work done and we\u2019ve got 300, nearly 310 million POPs with LTE right now. And we are putting on a spectrum to use as opposed to building towers. And so that aspect of it is just a utilization of spectrum we own and capabilities we have that don\u2019t require as much CapEx. Secondly, the 57 million IP broadband and what is now approximately 900,000 business customer locations passed with fiber. Once again, the network guys have done a great job in getting the Project VIP initiatives completed. And when they are done, there is the additional spend isn\u2019t necessary, because the project has been concluded not for lack of anything, but for success. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving our changes. We continue to focus on working capital and construction work in progress and driving down cycle times and a whole host of other efforts, the team is doing really good work on and that\u2019s also helping out, but it\u2019s really positive things that are driving this capability. We are going to continue invest in capacity. We are going to continue to invest in successful sales. We feel very good about our ability to continue to respond to customers in a positive way.","Phil Cusick","Thanks, John.","John Stephens","Thank you.","Operator","And we go to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack","Hey, guys. Thanks. I had just a quick comment on competitive positioning, thinking about the handset losses in the quarter. Clearly, it\u2019s seeding a little bit of share here at the benefit of probably margins and probably some of the ARPU trends, but just maybe a comment on those sub-losses you are seeing in the handset side, the quality of those subs. And then, secondly John, your thoughts on cash taxes as we look into 2016?","John Stephens","Couple of things. Mike thanks for the question. First only, let me say it this way, on a branded net add basis we were negative, on voice we were positive. We added voice customers. Now on the postpaid category, we did lose some feature phones, which have our lowest ARPUs. But on the prepaid side with both our Cricket and GoPhone brands, we added some premium customers. I think I mentioned that two-thirds of our Cricket customers are buying out of the higher plans. Those are $50, $60 month plans. Two thirds or more of our customers are buying those plans. And those ARPUs are higher than the feature phone ARPUs we are losing and quite frankly, higher than a lot of \u2013 some people in the markets postpaid ARPU. So we are getting great tradeoff. The beauty of that, though and the thing is helping margins. So, there is very low acquisition subsidy costs with regard to those customers. We did sell over 7 million smartphones through the \u2013 in the quarter. A lot of those were in our prepaid space, but we did sell that. Beauty of it is that the customers are satisfying the financial requirements of those phones such that it\u2019s allowing us to keep our margins up.","Mike McCormack","And John, we are seeing a meaningful amount of those sort of postpaid feature phones moving over to the Cricket brand or prepaid brands?","John Stephens","No, those will be migrations. So we would account for those as migrations, so you wouldn\u2019t have those in our net add numbers. The 330,000 voice net adds in prepaid were all customers we acquired that had not had service with anybody before or we took from other providers. So we feel really good about our competitive position and we are really excited about our prepaid brands and very excited about what\u2019s happening with Cricket and quality of the customers we are getting. And quite frankly, the great job the teams done in the accelerating the integration, getting us over on the \u2013 on our GSM or LTE networks, getting smartphones to these customers hands and really providing quality service. Churn is \u2013 the reduction in churn is really impressive. And you can see from our slides, overall churn \u2013 total churn was down 16 basis points, that\u2019s mainly driven by the improvements in our prepaid.","Mike McCormack","Okay. And the cash taxes in \u201816 as we look at it?","John Stephens","Yes, I think the key issue in cash taxes in \u201816 would generally be expected to go up because of the tax rules and currently in place right now. No legislation for bonus depreciation. With that being said, there has been a bill that came out of the Senate finance committee I think just last week. There has been a lot of activity in the house to extend the various tax extenders, research bill and credit and other things and include bonus depreciation. Some say for a 2 years cycle, others say 3 years to 5 years cycle depending upon which piece of legislation we are talking about. If those happen, we would see a significant benefit from a company who invest in the United States and invest in jobs through CapEx in the United States. So that\u2019s yet to be seen as what will happen.","Mike McCormack","Okay, great John. Thanks.","John Stephens","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","We will go to David Barden, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David Barden","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first John if I could ask the wireless margin question another way, which is looking at the sequential change in the cost, there is about almost $750 million of sequential costs went away after you subtracted out the merger and integration expenses. So could you kind of parse down what happened quarter-over-quarter in the wireless business and can we expect this starting point to be where we should look at wireless margins for the rest of the year and in \u201916. And then, I guess, as a second question, it\u2019s no secret we are all trying to figure out the implications of the potential conditions here. But I think as the level is set in that conversation, could you kind of go through what you are able to talk about in terms of the scope of the current GigaPower initiative, the economics around that initiative, cost of home passed and so we can kind of all be on the same page in that conversation? Thanks.","John Stephens","So let me start with the wireless, right. There are a couple of things we need to be focused on. One is we made significant progress with regard to Cricket and the integration of it. So we have been able to free up a lot of spectrum over the year to take in capacity in a very efficient and low-cost way. So be able to serve customers more effectively get more LTE. Secondly, we have \u2013 the Cricket as you know the company we bought was operating at a \u2013 and it will say that challenge environment will challenge results from a margin and operating income perspective. The team has put in place integration plans and activated those and effectuated those. They are now improving and growing EBITDA and operating contribution in that piece of it. So if you go back if you look at the prior public company we bought the lead company and you can get a sense if you can turn those numbers positive, you can have a real improvement on your quarter, that\u2019s one.","Two, we have seen efforts in our customer tier and specifically in our mobility customer care centers, where we have done a whole variety of settings, whether it\u2019s the sales guys keeping consistent sales offers out there, with the \u2013 whether it\u2019s the retail stores having the sales agent spend more time to make sure customers explain it, whether it\u2019s moving towards getting it right the first time and getting the first call resolution or it\u2019s our extensive investments over the last few years in Digital First and allowing customers to, for example order, upgrade, buy different packages, pay their bills, those types of things on their smartphones. All that has driven, call volumes down significantly into our care centers to the tune of, we will probably have a drop for this year of about 10 million phone calls out of our mobility care centers alone. So that\u2019s another activity that\u2019s going.","Our LTE network is a lower cost network and we are continuing to see people use more data and buying up into bigger plans, that\u2019s helping. Additionally, we are seeing our customers seem to want to hold their phones longer under the next plan, at least longer than we had initially expected. And with that, we are seeing cost savings there. So those are all part of what we saw in the second quarter. And we are optimistic that we will be able to continue much of that momentum maybe at different levels, but we are going to be able to continue that momentum going forward. So we are very optimistic about that.","With regard to the transaction, I won\u2019t make any comments. With regard to GigaPower, we have announced an effort to go into 25 major markets to place fiber to the prem in those. We have done it and started in some initial markets in Dallas and Austin, some others. Our initial results have been very encouraging. Our sales have exceeded our expectations. We are seeing great, if you will net promoter scores from our customers who take those services. And we are encouraged by that. And I think based on prudence how these \u2013 the comments with regard to it is that, but we are encouraged by what we have seen out of GigaPower and the capabilities it brings, not only to our customers, but to us as a service provider.","David Barden","Great. Thanks, John.","John Stephens","Thanks.","Operator","And we will go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much. John, I was wondering if you could switch gears back to start assessing the competitive environment, particularly in the wireless arena, there has been a lot of discussions around levels of promotional activity in sort of the first part of the year, whether or not we are at elevated levels or sort of depressed levels versus last year. As you look out towards the remainder of the year, you had mentioned that you are taking a disciplined approach, I was wondering if you can give us a bit more color in terms of your strategy going forward here in terms of either from a promotional standpoint or if there is some new products coming on the line with this merger, the type of strategies that you are taking for customer acquisition?","John Stephens","Yes. So let me just say it this way. We are certainly evaluating and watching our competitor\u2019s moves in the marketplace. What I would tell you is that we are not responding to each and everyone from a discounting program. We have shown that kind of discipline. We have responded with \u2013 with an effort to make customer care easier, customer service easier, customer data situations, like rollover data, where we can meet some of the customers\u2019 pain points and satisfy them. And we have done a great job in providing value customer solution with our prepaid brand. Those are the kinds of things we are going to do and continue to do. I think you have seen it in our numbers that this disciplined approach has paid off. And as I mentioned, we did have positive voice net adds. So we feel good about what is done to positioning. Quite frankly, the biggest strategy play that we have had in that wireless base was probably acquisition of Cricket and giving us that capability that platform and the distribution to really serve those value customers in a different way. But if you will, yes, it\u2019s a competitive market, it continues to be noisy, a competitive market, but it\u2019s been that way for sometime and I wouldn\u2019t expect necessarily to change. But I do like our ability to compete with the tools that we have that are different than our competitors. Having that premium prepaid, having Mobile Share value, having Next, having connected cars and connected devices, having all those tools in this great network, I believe we are in the best position to compete going forward and are looking forward to that opportunity.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you. And then if I may one brief follow-up in thinking about sort of churn levels and then we have seen sort of a tick down from the prior quarter and in thinking about the scope of the competitive landscape, how do you think that sort of churn should progress through the course of the year?","John Stephens","Yes, we won\u2019t give any predictions, I mean, specifically on that. We are focused on churn as a way of giving good service, lowers churn, lowers churn, gives good profitability. So, we certainly value it. And we will continue to focus on it. I will just leave it to say that through 6 months, our churn on a postpaid basis is lower than last year\u2019s full year. And last year\u2019s full year was our best year ever. And then secondly, as I mentioned, if you peel through our numbers, you can see our total churn dropped 16 basis points, which means our prepaid churn, which I did mention had its best quarter ever for us. And our prepaid churns are improving. So, we are really focused on it. And we believe that gives us that opportunity to really generate value, still being very competitive in the marketplace.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much for the additional color.","John Stephens","Thanks, Amir.","Operator","We have Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. John, during your statements, you mentioned that you are increasingly focused on driving profitability in the wireline side and you know that there was a small loss of video customers against that strategy. It implies you saw something in the market that you just didn\u2019t want to respond to. So, if you could maybe give us a little color in terms of what you saw, what you didn\u2019t like, and where you are really focused strategically? That will be helpful. And just along those lines since the broadband numbers, we are just a little under run-rate on U-verse I think you talked about where you were from a penetration standpoint in an upgrade cycle, if you could revisit that? That would be helpful.","John Stephens","So, a couple of things. One with regard to we do have a tremendous focus on driving cost out of our wireline business. And as all of you know, when legacy services drop off, they usually have very high margins to go with them. So, as we are growing our strategic services, U-verse services, we are really focused on controlling costs, so we can replace \u2013 to maintain our profitability. With that being said, on the U-verse video side, the first point to make is second quarter is always seasonally a challenge. You got a lot of relocations. You got a lot of students returning from college. And with our currently limited footprint with regard to video capabilities, it\u2019s always a challenge for us. The issue then is do you go out and do a lot of promotional activities to stimulate growth? We chose to be very disciplined and very limited in those promotional activities. As you can see, it really had a unique impact in the sense that our revenues grew 3.7% or almost 4%. So, it was from this disciplined approach of not getting out of hand with regard to promotional pricing. That\u2019s how we think about it. When we are capable of bundling all our services together, we are very optimistic about our ability to compete.","With regard to our IP broadband, it really has more to do it this time, not only with the seasonality, but also with the fact that we were converting our DSL at a very high rate to our IP broadband or a high-speed broadband. That process has left \u2013 has achieved 13 million of these high-speed broadband. And we are only about 1 million left. So, coming from a number of years ago, where we had 14 million to convert, we are down to 1. And so you will see \u2013 it\u2019s just a different pool to draw from. Once again, as we have a somewhat challenged video footprint at the current time, the opportunities before us are clear with that high-quality broadband service that we have. So, I will leave it at that.","Brett Feldman","Alright, thank you.","John Stephens","Thank you.","Operator","We go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Thank you very much. John, it sounds like the FCC is getting ready to put out the final rules for the broadcast incentive option. You have put out a commitment around $9 billion under certain conditions. Can you just review your perspective on the 600 auction? And then any color you can give us on securitization during the quarter? Thanks.","John Stephens","Yes. So, with regard to securitization, Simon, we did do some this quarter. They were about $1 billion this quarter and we did about $800 million in the year ago quarter, so a slight increase in the securitizations, I am assuming you are talking about the net securitizations, continue to see strong demand, continue to see a real interest in that investment by a number of banks at very attractive rates. And we are getting to the point now that we have lapped the full year and are building a history with regard to this program, which is very good for the company. This has to give us flexibility going forward. So, very pleased with it, expect we will continue to do it, but the differential year-over-year was not dramatic as it may have been in some prior quarters. That\u2019s one. Two as far as overall spectrum goes, we are always interested in looking at spectrum and the opportunities to improve our spectrum position and we planned for that on a regular basis. With regard to participation in the broadcast auction, we did offer to participate when we first announced our intention to acquire DTV. We will wait and see what the final terms and conditions with regard to any approval of that merger are, but in any event, I would suggest you that will be interested and prudent in investigating the opportunity see what\u2019s available and participate in an appropriate way as we move forward.","Simon Flannery","Great, thank you.","John Stephens","Thanks, Simon.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Joe Mastrogiovanni","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. John, so you are on track to bring the CapEx down to the $18 billion range, but this does follow some heavy investment the past few years. As you look out over the technology roadmap, like 5G coming down the pipeline, do you anticipate that we will see another period of elevated investment?","John Stephens","Good question, Joe. I would tell you that\u2019s kind of a longer term perspective. What we are seeing is our move to get this fiber deep into the network and getting LTE out deep into the wireless network and the solutions that we are finding in a software-defined network opportunity, we see a real opportunity to actually strive to bring investments, if you will, lower or more efficient from historical levels. Right now, I will tell you that this year\u2019s investment is going to be in that $18 billion range, which is about 15%. We are certainly \u2013 we are not going to give any guidance with regard to next year or the year after. And we will give an update on this year\u2019s guidance, if and when in our analyst conference if we get that opportunity. With that being said, I think there is a real opportunity with some of the activities are going on in software-defined networks on a longer term basis to actually bring that in capital intensity to a more modest level.","Joe Mastrogiovanni","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We go next to Frank Louthan, Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Frank Louthan","Great, thank you. Can you give us an update on how many homes you\u2019ve passed with GigaPower and sort of what the cost is running on that right now? And then secondly, on the wholesale business, what exactly is the trend there? Are you losing share or is it just lower pricing or is lower volumes or where is that actually going?","John Stephens","So, on the wholesale business, first thing is we exited our mobile housing business. We have really turned that down, not pursuing it anymore. That\u2019s having a significant impact on the global \u2013 on the wholesale business. That\u2019s the first point. The second point we are saying is the continued \u2013 not only pressure on the legacy analog services, but a movement towards more efficient IP strategic services. So, when the customers move up, sometimes they have both services in place, but even after they shut off the legacy services, the strategic services oftentimes have more efficiency. And so until the volumes grow to absorb that, there is a disconnect between those revenue sources. But with that being said, we still feel very good about the \u2013 our win percentages and our ability to hold on to that business and our ability to grow going forward. The biggest first issue with regard to wholesale though is the fact that we have decided to get out of some business and on the second piece is some of this growing as they have transitioned to strategic services to Ethernet and other things. But we will continue to be positive. We will continue to be able to compete well in that wholesale space.","With regard to GigaPower, it\u2019s just we are not giving out cost per unit pricing this time. And let me give you some insights into why that would be challenging at this point. There is a difference between whether you do it to multi dwelling units or whether you do it to a single home and a single residence. So, all of those factors at this stage could mislead folks with regard to any kind of factual numbers. So we have chosen not to do that. But we are just getting started with the fiber to the prem activity. We are pleased with it. I can suggest you that we are probably still in the early stages of it. But the take rates, the satisfaction rates continue to outperform our expectations with our customers.","Frank Louthan","Okay, great. Thank you.","John Stephens","And Lori we will take one more question.","Operator","Very good, that is from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","James Ratcliffe","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have two on the wireless side, if I could. First of all, can you give a little color about what\u2019s driving the improvement you are seeing in prepaid churn, just improving credit quality or better retention, something else going on there. And second, given the continued growth in Connected Cars, any insight you can provide around the economics around those what ARPUs running and if there are any subsidies or revenue shares involved? Thanks.","John Stephens","So on the prepaid business, there is a couple of things. One, great plan, great attention to our customers, but quite frankly, they are right now a great network. So they are getting great service with cost efficient plans. And we are able to do it because they are paying for their own phones. So it\u2019s really just a lot of hard work by our network team and getting these customers converted from the network that they were on the CDMA network they are on onto our LTE networks. So they are having a great experience, that\u2019s one. Two, we are giving a good pricing. We can do that because they are paying for their own phones essentially. So and then our sales team and our operations team is working very hard to integrate the quality of our networks, our backbone and our cost structure.","All of those things are what\u2019s driving, but the churn is really I am sure has a lot to do with these great networks that they are writing on. So I would suggest to that. On the Connected Car, there is kind of three relationships I think of when I think of that connected car and our revenue side. There is one of the wholesale relationship with the auto manufacturer\/dealers and that\u2019s the ability to deliver on-time information, real-time information to the cars or take it from the cars for whether it would be design, marketing activities, analysis, upgrades to mapping and so on and so forth. That\u2019s a wholesale relationship we have with the auto manufacturers. And as we continue to develop applications and they continue to develop applications and information needs out of that process, we will continue \u2013 we are hopeful to continue to grow that revenue.","The key to that is much of that activity can be done off-peak hours. And so the auto manufacturers can gather that time and gather that data at times when it\u2019s very cost efficient for us to do it. So we can utilize our networks when they are somewhat under utilized and they can still a really good quality data. Two, there is that\u2019s ability to put it into a Mobile Share Value plan and part of our Mobile Share Value plans has had add-on service. We are just getting started with that. We are very optimistic about the opportunities there. But quite frankly, the cars first are just rolling off. And secondly, there are some promotional time and promotional activities where that capability is available before we sign them up to a retail package. So that process is just getting started. We feel very good about it. And I think it fits within the overall connected life strategy that our mobility team is running.","And then lastly, there is a prepaid opportunity for somebody who doesn\u2019t own the car, but yet wants to utilize that connectivity in their car. And we are seeing some utilization of that today and we will continue to see that develop. We are optimistic and very jazzed up, so to speak about the opportunities of the Connected Car. I would suggest the company that\u2019s our scale and size. We look to this to being not only a success in the today\u2019s net adds and today\u2019s relationships with our business customers, but a success going forward in revenue generation and margin generation improvement. Lori, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","That will be from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Tim Horan","Thanks a lot. So John, a great job on the financial discipline, so you think the wireless expenses is a good run rate here. I know there is a lot of moving parts, do you think maybe you would a little light on the marketing this quarter or that was an impact then? Can you also just lastly give us some data usage statistics? Thanks.","John Stephens","Yes, I am sure, Tim. Well, let me say this, on the margins, there is always going to be seasonality and we are always going to have the challenges there in our business. We are going to have a much smoother seasonality. We may have because of the way we have shifted the business, flip some of the pressure quarters and the hiring quarters around. We will have more smoother. But we will have additional activities as we get into the holiday season with more units and more activities with regards to that. Secondly, while we are going to continue to be disciplined with all costs including marketing, I would suggest we will continue to market and believe we have been effective with our marketing, but have not shut it down. With regards to \u2013 Tim what was your last question?","Tim Horan","Yes, wireless daily usage and where maybe customers are in terms of utilization of their existing capacity of? ","John Stephens","Yes, we continue to see data growth per handset to be significant. And it\u2019s been running at kind of the 50% year-over-year increase for a while. With regard to the data plans, we are seeing customers a couple of things. We continue to see customers go to bigger data plan, some of the 20 gig and bigger plans. And anything that\u2019s helped our service revenues this quarter was we continue to see people do some overages even though we gave \u2013 we gave roll over to our customers to help them manage their plans. They took advantage of it. We continued to see some over usage. So we view that opportunity to get customers to buy some bigger buckets and move themselves out of that stress opportunity. But usage continues to be a positive for our revenue opportunities and continues to be something and our guys watch very closely. So we keep this high quality service.","Tim Horan","Thank you.","John Stephens","Thank you. Thanks Lori. For everyone on the call, I want to thank you for being with us today. In closing, let me say this. For the last 3 years, we have laid a plan that deployed next generation networks, that develops some innovative products and services and that has been focused on repositioning our customer base. And at the same time, we have been focused on cost management. Second quarter results show that this strategy is working. We now stand ready to continue this process with our strategic investments, in spectrum, in Leap, in Mexico, as well as our pending transaction with DIRECTV. We are ready to take advantage of our new opportunities as we transform our business and our industry. Thanks again for being on the call. And as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good evening. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our conference call for today.

Please go ahead sir.","Michael Viola ","Thank you, Lorry and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. It\u2019s great to have you with us today. As Lorry said I\u2019m Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Stephens, Chief Financial Officer. Randall will provide some opening comments then close with 2015 guidance, John will cover our results and then we\u2019ll follow that with a Q&A.","Let me remind you our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. Please call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement before we begin which says that some of our comments today maybe forward-looking. As such they are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially.

I also want to remind you that we are still in the quite period for FCC Spectrum Auction 97 or the AWS-3 Auction so we cannot address any questions about Spectrum today. So with that overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&Ts Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Randall Stephenson. Randall?","Randall Stephenson","Hey Mike. Thanks and good afternoon. Fighting cold around here Lorry may end up having to handle this call for us. But before John takes you through the results I want to take just take a couple of minutes and frame where we are. 2012 to 2014 was a really period of unprecedented investment for AT&T and for the industry for that matter. And during this period we built our LTE network to cover more than 300 million people, we expanded our U-verse broadband footprint to 57 million customer locations and we deployed fiber to 725,000 business locations. And at the same time we reengineered our mobile network and we now deliver the strongest LTE signal in the U.S. ","Now at the same time we've been aggressively repositioning our wireless customer base. We're giving our customers now a choice of moving away from heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly prices. And as a result our customer satisfaction continues to climb and defections continue to fall and you can see that by our record low annual postpaid churn rate. And we also delivered our best ever full year adjusted EBITDA service margins. We've also made a significant investment to migrate our wireline customer bases to the new platforms. At the end of 2014 76% of our broadband customers were on our fastest IP based platforms and our strategic IP based business services now represent a $10 billion annualized revenue stream and it's growing 14% when you adjust it for the Kinetica sale. ","And that brings us to 2015, because with these foundational investments largely behind us and several strategic investments announced to-date the ground work's now being laid for 2015 and beyond. And today our customers are expecting us to deliver video across all of our platforms whether it's traditional linear video or over the top on U-verse broadband or video to the mobile device. So we've been assembling the pieces that we need to do exactly that. DIRECTV quickly and significantly shores up the economics of our U-verse video product and it brings us the best content relationships in the industry. ","Our fixed broadband footprint will quickly begin expanding to 70 million customer locations in the U.S. when we complete the DIRECTV transaction. And in the Cricket acquisition it\u2019s proven to be a cost effective way to strengthen our spectrum portfolio which is a prerequisite for in the mobile video delivery business. We also laid the ground word for expanding these capabilities outside the U.S. We've always believed the demand for the mobile internet and economic benefit experienced in the U.S. would be repeated throughout the world. And so with that we have been looking for opportunities to gain a wireless foothold in key market for the regulatory in the investment climate is right. ","And used cell and net cell international\u2019s Mexico give us this opportunity. The changes in the Mexican legal and regulatory framework make it attractive for a new entrant to invest and we close on use of sale and then once we complete Next sale we will have a very deep spectrum portfolio and this is the first element needed for a robust mobile internet offering. ","We will now have the ability to expand our U.S. network directly into Mexico building one seamless network that's spanning 400 million people. And whether it\u2019s cross border businesses, Latino customers and either Cricket or AT&T or Mexican consumers we will be the only company with mobile internet capabilities spanning both counties. And don\u2019t forget DIRECTV brings the premier video business in Latin America. ","So the bi-product of this is represented on Slide 5, you go 12 months now AT&T\u2019s revenue is going to look very different. It will be much more diversified. The way we integrate our products and services will be different. And when in 2015 post DIRECTV our revenues will come from four areas, our largest will be business solutions, that includes both fixed and wireless services and is growing nicely in fact in the fourth quarter that area is growing nearly 6%. The next area will be our consumer TV and broadband business, then third will be our consumer mobility business, then obviously our Latin American businesses where satellite TV and then the Mexican mobility businesses will be our fastest growing area. And we like this mix a lot, and by the end of the year we are going to be uniquely positioned in a world of high-speed connectivity dominated by video and is going to be a very different business. ","So, with that I am going to turn it over to you John to go through 2014. ","John Stephens","Thank you Ran and hello everyone. Let me start with our consolidated financial summary which is on Slide 6. We finished the year strong with solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues grew to more than $34 billion up 4.5% when you adjust for the sale of our sale of our Connecticut properties. This was driven by strong wireless growth as we continue to reposition our business model and adjusted revenue growth in wireline, thanks to gains in the Strategic Business Services and U-verse. ","For the full year we saw adjusted consolidated revenue grow by more than 3%. This helped drive strong EPS growth. Reported EPS for the quarter was a loss of $0.77 however when you exclude the significant items we disclosed in the last weeks, earnings per share was $0.55. That\u2019s up nearly 4% from a year-ago. And if you consider that last year included about $0.02 of equity income from our divested America Movil interest, that percentage would be closer to 8%. Adjusted EPS was up slightly for the year even after a $0.06 impact from the sale of our America Movil investment. ","These adjustments include $0.94 of non-cash pressure from the year-end mark-to-market charge for our benefit plans. This was almost a reverse of last year when we had a strong mark-to-market gain. The actuarial loss was largely driven by a decrease in the discount rate but was partially offset by strong performance of our benefit plan investments. We also had a $0.25 non-cash pressure from the write-off of certain network assets which we told you about earlier this month. And we had $0.13 of cost associated with wireless integration, DIRECTV transaction cost and the loss on the sale of the Connecticut properties.","Now let\u2019s turn to our operational highlights starting with wireless on Slide 7. Before I get to the quarter, it\u2019s important to take a look back at the full year and see how far we've come with repositioning our wireless business. It\u2019s been almost a year since we first introduced our Mobile Share Value plans and began to accelerate the move of our smartphone base off the subsidy model to AT&T Next. ","Since that time the results have been dramatic. First, we've had nearly 3.3 million postpaid net adds, thanks to strong growth of phones and tablets. That\u2019s our best full year gain in five years. And this includes more than 700,000 postpaid phone net adds during the year. These postpaid gains along with an end of year surge of connected device subscribers, thanks mainly to the connected car, helped to drive 5.6 million total net adds. Our strongest growth in three years. Just as impressive, we added nearly 5 million new smartphone subscribers during the year. These high value high quality customers have an ARPU of about twice that of non-smartphone subscribers. ","At the same time, we had our best ever full year postpaid churn. That\u2019s a remarkable achievement anytime, but even more so when you consider the intense competitive environment we face during the year. ","We also had our best ever full year adjusted EBITDA service margins. We achieved that even with record full year smartphone sales. This is the impact of AT&T Next. Already more than a quarter of our postpaid smartphone base are on equipment installment plans and more than half of our smartphone base has moved off the subsidy model pricing. These are the long-term results we have talked with you about throughout 2014. A repositioning of the smartphone base is working with nearly 70% of our postpaid base now on mobile share plans.","Now let\u2019s look at fourth quarter results starting on Slide 8. Let\u2019s begin with net adds where we had another strong quarter. We added nearly 2 million total subscribers led by postpaid and connected devices. We added more than 850,000 postpaid subscribers thanks to strong growth of tablets. These tablet gains more than offset a slight decline of feature phone subscribers, but we also grew high quality postpaid smartphone base by another million in the quarter. This includes upgrades and migrations which we don\u2019t include in our net add number. Connected devices also continued their strong growth as the Internet things begins to evolve. Nearly 1.3 million connected devices were added in the quarter including 800,000 connected cars. ","Prepaid showed a loss in the fourth quarter however the Cricket brand is showing momentum with positive net adds after losing customers in the pre-acquisition a year-ago fourth quarter. The Cricket integration is going strong, distribution\u2019s been expanded, churn is improving and now nearly three quarters of the customer base has transitioned to the AT&T network. Our fourth quarter\u2019s is traditionally a strong sales quarter and you see that in our results. We had record smartphone postpaid gross adds and upgrades, with more than 10 million smartphones sold in the quarter. That includes record total upgrades, those customers choosing to stay with AT&T and commit to new device plans. Our upgrade rate exceeded 11% in the quarter. Smartphones were 94% of all postpaid phone sales, another record for us in the quarter.","As expected, postpaid churn was up in the quarter. The fourth quarter traditionally sees increased levels of churn for all carriers. And when you add in the intense competitive activity in the quarter, it\u2019s no surprise to see churn at these levels. But even with all this noise in the market, postpaid churn levels were comparable to two years ago, the last time a fully refreshed iPhone hit the market. And this was the first time that all major carriers were able to sell that phone during the busy fourth quarter. ","Now let\u2019s look at revenue gains on Slide 9. Total wireless revenues grew nearly 8% as the revenue mix shift we have seen throughout the year continue to play out in the fourth quarter. Equipment revenue growth tapped 70% with strong AT&T Next sales. Service revenues were pressured as customers continue to sign up for Mobile Share Value plans and move away from the traditional subsidy model. ","We now have more than 18 million smart Mobile Share accounts covering nearly 70% of our postpaid subscribers and about 58% of our postpaid smartphone base is on no subsidy pricing. Mobile Share customers continue to buy up to larger buckets of data. Half of our accounts are on the plans of 10 gigabytes or larger. That compares to 27% a year ago. And we\u2019re seeing a move to even bigger larger data plans, nearly 20% are on plans of 15 gigs or more. That\u2019s three times more than a year ago. This helped drive an 18% increase in data billings.","The take rate for AT&T Next increased to 58% in the fourth quarter or about 5.9 million new Next customers. This impacted cash flows, but we consider this an investment in a great customer base that we are more than willing to make. We also had about 400,000 customers who bring their own devices onto our network. ","The next take rate was a step-up from prior quarters, while we continue to see strong customer response at our company owned stores and agents with a Next take rate of about 90% of upgrades, the take rate for Next to our other retailers was much less. The strong holiday sales played a role here. We typically have a higher percentage of our sales with other retailers in the fourth quarter. These stores are still becoming familiar with Next plans and our sales show that, plus with a rush of the holiday season, sales personnel with these retailers don\u2019t always have the time to take the steps necessary to close the Next transaction. We will continue to work with these stores and expect the take rate at those locations to pick up in the future. ","As expected the strong Next take rate helped drive the second consecutive quarter of sequential ARPU growth when you factor in Next billings. When you add in Next billings you get a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us every month. Our average monthly Next billings were up about $28 per month even with the introduction of the Next 24-month plan. As the Next pace grows so does the impact of billings nearly 27% of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next. ","Now let`s move to our wireline operations on slide 10. The transformation of our wireline networks IP technology has helped drive year-over-year wireline revenue growth. We say it again has helped drive year-over-year wireline revenue growth when you adjust for the sale of our Kinetica operations. We're really seeing the overall revenue impact of the strategic business services and the U-verse. ","Total adjusted U-verse revenues increased by more than 20% and are now about two-thirds of consumer revenues. And strategic business service revenues grew by more than 14% and are now 30% of total wireline business revenues. Growth looks even stronger when you adjust out the impact of foreign exchange. Overall adjusted wireline consumer revenue increased 2.4%, adjusted wireline business revenues were down 1.8%. However if you adjust for the effect of discontinued Global Hubbing businesses and foreign exchange that decline would have been just about a 0.5%. ","We're still dealing with the impacts of an uneven economy. But enterprise revenues were up slightly. However the lack of new business formations continue to pressure small businesses. Wholesale also saw pressure in the quarter in part due to our focus on profitable sales. These results helped drive a sequential improvement in wireline margins which were up 120 basis points over the third quarter of 2014. That's a reversal of trends in recent years when we had seen sequential declines between the third and fourth quarter. ","U-verse subscribers also grew in the quarter. We added more than 400,000 high speed broadband subscribers and now added 2.1 million for the full year. We finished the year with 12.2 million high speed broadband subscribers or more than three quarters of our broadband base. The transformation to IP broadband is a remarkable accomplishment for entire wireline team. U-verse CD subscriber net adds came in at 73,000. Net adds were impacted by a strategic move to improve the profitability of our wireline consumer business. With our high content costs we targeted profitable, long-term value subscribers with lower churn rates while still taking market share. ","Now let's take a look at margins on slide 11. We will start with our wireless margins. Wireless margins were pressured by strong smartphone gross adds and upgrades, investment related expenses and wireless integration costs. We mentioned earlier that we had our best ever full year adjusted service margins even with record sales thanks to AT&T Next. We also see the impact of Next on our quarterly results. Our wireless EBITDA service margin was down slightly when compared to a year ago. The fourth quarter of 2014 saw 2.6 million more smartphone sales than in the previous year. And if you compare the results to two years ago when smartphone sales were comparable service margins improved over 700 basis points. ","Wireline margins improved from a year ago. Wireline margins usually are flat or down between the third and fourth quarter but that trend changed last quarter. There was pressure from investment expenses and content cost but this was offset by growth in wireline revenues and solid execution on cost initiatives. For the quarter our adjusted consolidated margins were 14.2% compared to 15.5% a year ago quarter and just under 13% two years ago. Strong smartphone sales also pressured consolidated margins but our continued efforts for cost efficiency helped offset some of that pressure. ","Now let's move to cash flow [indiscernible] on slide 12. For 2014 cash from operations totaled $31.3 billion and $5.7 billion for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $21.4 billion and $4.4 billion for the quarter and free cash flow before dividends was $9.9 billion and $1.3 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow was impacted by the nearly 6 million AT&T Next sales in the fourth quarter. We pay upfront for those devices while our customers pay us back overtime. The record upgrades and strong iPhone sales with a higher sales price mix made an impact as well. ","This speaks to our willingness to invest in our premium smartphone customer base. We aren't going to turn away good business to manage to a cash flow number. We have the financial strength to finance devices for our best customers, we have the lowest churn and higher ARPU and that is our focus. ","At the same time our Next receivables significantly increased while our bad debt ratios stayed at traditionally low levels. These are high quality receivables we did monetize 1.2 billion of the Next receivables in the quarter as there continues to be great interest for financial institutions and we do expect future sales of those receivables. ","Also in the fourth quarter we sold our Connecticut wireline operations to Frontier for $2 billion. Our asset sales strengthened our balance sheet and cash position. In fact we had more than $10 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand at the end of 2014. We had more than 3 billion in combined free cash flow and asset sales during the fourth quarter with $18 billion for the full year. ","In terms of usage of cash dividends sold of 9.6 billion for the year and we continue to have one of the strongest yields around. We also announced the dividend increase last month. This is the 31st consecutive year that we have increased the dividend that puts us on a small and select group of companies. That should give you a good idea of how we look at our dividend, saying that dividend is important to us is another statement we consider the very important aspect of our shareholder return and are committed to it. ","At the same time we maintain the best credit ratings in the industry. Net debt to adjusted-EBITDA was at 1.75. And as we told you at the end of the last year the company will continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, but I suspect that with pending investments in the near-term we may go over our 1.8 times net debt to EBITDA target. Also as we told you earlier, after we closed the DIRECTV transaction our focus with free cash flow after dividends will be on paying down debt. That\u2019s a look of fourth quarter end of 2014 I would now like to turn it back to Randall to talk about our 2015 outlook. ","Randall Stephenson","Okay, thanks John. We are going to provide more definitive 2015 guidance after we closed the DIRECTV transaction and we do expect that to happen in the first half of this year. Let me frame for you what you can expect from us this year, and I am going to start by talking about AT&T on a standalone basis, that is before our Mexico and DIRECTV acquisitions. What we expect to deliver is continued consolidated revenue growth, our adjusted-EPS growth will be in the low single-digit range. We will have expanding margins, consolidated wireless and wireline margins. We will also have improving free cash flow and improving dividend coverage. ","I think capital expenditures will be in the $18 billion range, the same as we got earlier and that\u2019s thanks for the completion of a lot of the Project VIP initiatives. Now if we include Mexico and DIRECTV, the first thing I would want to note is that, we now expect to achieve ever higher multiyear synergies than we had communicated and anticipated we announced the DIRECTV deal. And so when you add Mexico and DIRECTV we anticipate no delusion to our adjusted-EPS, meaning our adjusted-EPS growth including Mexico and DIRECTV will be in the low single-digit range. We would like to 2015 a very different company. We'll be a company with the ability to deliver video to any device. We'll have a unique capability to integrate solutions across the diversified base of customers, geographies and technology platforms that are mobile, fast and highly secure and we will have a path to profitable TV growth. And we'll have a nice set of growing Latin American businesses positioned well in video and the mobile internet. ","So that\u2019s where we are focused for 2015 and beyond. We are very excited about the opportunities that are ahead here for us. And so with that Lorrie I think we are ready to take questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. ","John Hodulik ","Couple of strategic questions for Randall if I could. First Randall you\u2019ve been able to put together a Mexican strategy at a very reasonable cost. Is that how we should expect in terms of Mexico given the expectation that AMX is going to spitting off a large piece of their business over the next year or so. And then if you could expand that you also have a large footprint now in South America, especially Brazil, what are your thoughts on that market? And then maybe the same for Canada, you talked in a recent release about a North American calling market. If you could comment on your view on the attractiveness of those markets, that would be great. ","Randall Stephenson","Sure John, thanks. I will start with your question on Mexico. And the American Movil asset sale has been one of those things floating out there, nobody really yet knows what that\u2019s going to look like. And for us if we wanted to move into Mexico there were a couple of really unique opportunities in front of us. And just to try to flush out what was going to be required by American Movil to sell their assets seemed like an uncertain process. So we pursued use to sell and then with the Nextel Mexico assets what we have here is a set of assets, a spectrum portfolio that is really a robust spectrum portfolio, a nice cell site grid that will be a very nice place to start in a nice customer base. And so we have the makings for what we need for a very viable and strong Mexico strategy, where our America Movil sales assets are not and so that\u2019s what we try to do is chart a path that that would get us into Mexico and get us a platform that would sustain itself. And we like these assets. We think these assets are more than sufficient to compete in Mexico and to go and compete aggressively and take share, so feel good about the assets we\u2019ve got. ","On South America and Brazil, it\u2019s too early to say John. What we have down there is the best pay-TV business in Latin America and it\u2019s a business that continues to grow. It\u2019s got a great brand name down there. DIRECTV has done a very nice job of assembling some nice spectrum in various Latin American markets where they\u2019re doing a fixed wireless type solution for broadband, so there are number of markets where they have line of sight and the ability to bundle broadband with the TV product and their brand is strong enough that where they do that they have really-really good success. And so we\u2019re actually anxious to get the transaction closed and leverage those assets in Latin America and it is, it\u2019s a really good product, a really good footprint, a really good brand. So we\u2019re excited about getting it.","On Canada, I think right now we have about as much as we as a company can handle, we\u2019re not prepared to start talking about going north of the border right now. We\u2019ve got a lot to execute on the DIRECTV, get the deal approved and then we\u2019ve got some serious integration efforts that we need to get busy on and then obviously building out Mexico is going to be a full core press for the next couple of years. So we\u2019ve got more than we can chew. We\u2019ve bitten off more than we can chew right now and you\u2019ll see us focused on what we\u2019ve consummated to-date.","Operator","We got to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack","Randall, I guess just following on, you started off the conversation with the discussion around revenue diversification. What is your thought, just as you look at the US wireless landscape into 2015, with respect to how bad can it get from here, with respect to pricing and promotion. From AT&T's standpoint, is share loss okay? Are you willing to accept sort of lower-end share loss? And then maybe one for John, just thinking about free cash flow into 2015, if we ex-out DTV and the acquisitions, just if you could frame out the moving parts there to give us a little more comfort on the dividend payout. And also maybe just a comment on whether or not you have talked to ratings agencies about the appetite for how high leverage could go? ","Randall Stephenson","Yes Mike. In terms of the wireless business, when you look at 2014 there\u2019s some aggressive pricing in the marketplace, but John I thought did a nice job of giving a good basis of compare to 2012. And so fourth quarter 2012, there were three competitors with an iPhone in the marketplace that was the last time there was a major iPhone launch. And our churn rate this quarter was very comparable to what it was in 2012 and this quarter there were everybody in the market had an iPhone and so the churn rates in the fourth quarter relative to what we've seen in the past were fairly consistent. When you look at the churn rates for the year in light of what I think was a very robust pricing environment we had our lowest churn rates ever. ","Now as we move forward what we\u2019re really going to be focused on is the smartphone base. You\u2019re going to see us continue to penetrate our customer base with smartphones. We added a million in the fourth quarter by itself. And you\u2019re going to really see us focused more and more intently on the business side of the equation. And you\u2019re seeing how we\u2019re laying out what our segmentation -- of what our business segments will look like as we move into 2015. And we\u2019ve had a lot of success really focusing on the business segment with our wireless products and bundling that with VPN solutions or security solutions. And as I mentioned in the opening, that when you put those two areas together, we\u2019ll not put the two together, but when you look at our enterprise business segment both fix line and wireless combined, it\u2019s growing 5.8% in the fourth quarter. That business segment -- that segment of customers churns lower than any other segment in the marketplace. It is price competitive, but it\u2019s interesting when you bundle it with VPN and other product sets, if you have a very-very nice business that grows very nicely and as John showed we\u2019re expanding margins as well. So we\u2019re really focused on the high end customer base. ","The area where we\u2019re seeing a lot more pressure in the market is in the feature phones. We churn feature phones much higher than our traditional smartphone base and so that\u2019s what Cricket serves the purpose to do is to help us address that into the market with a very robust and aggressive prepaid product and as John pointed out in his comments Cricket we\u2019re getting to the transition and it is now growing our prepaid base is growing that customer base is obviously a very nice complement to what we\u2019re doing in Mexico, we\u2019re looking forward to taking advantage of the Mexico footprint to with Cricket and as you noticed in the last week we've announced that pre-unlimited calling from the U.S to Mexico and you will see more and more of those offers materialize going the other way as we build out the Mexican footprint and the Mexican network. ","John Stephens","So, Mike this is John and with regard to free cash flow let me frame it up this way. As you know we've announced -- we're committed to do about an $18 billion range for CapEx that's about a $3.5 billion reduction in the CapEx or improvement in free cash flow, that's step one. ","Step two is with all our free cash flow -- with all our CapEx spending and investment there comes some trailing expense. With a reduction in our CapEx we'll see a reduction to that trailing expense that will not only help us with margins but will also help us with free cash flow. So those are two major steps. ","The third one is we have invested significantly in our customer base with regard to Next. High quality receivables, the banks continue to be interested in them but we have a portfolio of those that we will be able securitize this year and we will see some turnaround and payback of cash for those that we haven't securitized, so we're optimistic about that. ","That will be pressured, those things will be pressured by the continued success of Next, so we may reinvest some of those Next dollars that we [indiscernible] this year, we may reinvest in our customer base, we will make those judgments as we go. And then we will see some increase in taxes but not significant but we will likely see some increases in taxes. With all of that being said we're very comfortable about the increasing free cash flow and improving dividend coverage guidance that Randall mentioned. ","We carefully talked to the credit rating agencies, work with them on our plans and try to be transparent with what we have going on. I would expect we will see some -- they have made some announcements on their own and I am sure they will make their decisions as we kind of go through the rest of this year and the final VTV integration plans that we have they will come out and make their viewpoint shown. But those -- and I would tell you those conversations have been productive and constructive but they are well understanding our strategies and our approach.","Mike McCormack","John, I guess without the crystal ball, but thinking about the phone on the ARPU level, is there a level of penetration of the value plans inside your base where we should start to see that more stable? I know in the past, you talked about maybe stability as we get into 2015 on various moving parts. But I guess just isolating phone-only ARPU, getting a sense for when that might be more stable? ","John Stephens","Yes, so Mike as you know on the phone-only ARPU when I think about that I think a phone-only ARPU plus our Next billings and if you look at that then sequentially they grew. And the difference between the historical service ARPUs and the service ARPUs plus Next billings that gap has been closing. You guys can figure out the math but quite correctly when you sell almost 6 million phones in the fourth quarter on Next and you start billing those for the entire first quarter and throughout next year on a $28 or $30 a month basis you can understand our optimism about improving ARPU's as we define those and remember we are fine that way because that's what the customer is paying in cash every month. ","So we feel real good about where we're going and the where the process is, we're not predicting or giving a guidance with regard to when ARPU plus Next billings will be greater than they were in the prior year quarter. But we look forward to getting through this year and continuing the progress especially after having a fourth quarter where the sales team did an outstanding job of adding almost 6 million customers to the Next program. ","Operator","Next we will go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Phil Cusick","I guess the couple of things I want to hit -- one, if you could just clarify guidance. Is guidance to revenue and EPS growth, really just if we pull Connecticut out 2014, and, if so, what are the base revenue and EPS numbers? ","John Stephens","Yes. Maybe -- we'll pull out Connecticut as you said we're not giving detailed analysis of the product line or sub products but your assumption Phil that it is without Connecticut is correct that is the base line. ","Phil Cusick","Okay. Thanks, John. And then second, if you could talk about Next, 58% in the fourth quarter. What's going on in distribution? Are you going to expand that further? And do you expect a working capital drag in 2015 to be larger or smaller than 2014? ","John Stephens","Yes. So the Next sales go like this, in our company owned stores, in authorizations great performance more than 80% nearly 90% as we mentioned, great take rate in a busy fourth quarter. Quite frankly on the large national retailers and the manufacturer owns retail stores the take rates were smaller but in the fourth quarter they had a lot of activity for us, they sell a lot of our phones, a higher proportion of fourth quarter because of the holiday season than any other quarter. And so we're optimistic about Next take rates increasing overall through the year and we're also optimistic about working with the national retailers and the other retailers to provide them additional support on how to sell Next and how it works. ","So we're still real positive about Next and believe that we will get the number of customers on the non-subsidy plans in line with the number of customers on Next plus bring our own device. So we are really moving directly out of the subsidy business, that\u2019s a good thing long-term and short-term. With regard to the -- if free cash flow impacts will have the flexibility to monetize, we expect to have the flexibility to continue to monetize large blocks in these securitizations, it's worked very well. The banks continue to have very much interest. And as we stated before we want to continue a regular pattern of doing this so that we build the history for this out the -- that will keep us with flexibility and financing going forward. I would suggest you that the activities we have going on now are not intended to be looked at to generate cash flow in out of them in, in out of the sales to pump up cash flow in any way shape or form, it\u2019s really more of just a prudent management process throughout the year, we'll have flexibility to push forward or pull back to depending upon continued interest rates, continued attractiveness from the banks, and so forth, but so far the process has gone extremely well. We have been very pleased with not only the demand but also the financial terms. ","Randall Stephenson","We'll continue to be confident this Next take rate [indiscernible] as John said in our retail channel we are now hitting 90% it\u2019s a learning curve. People learning how to sell this and the mechanics and the process for doing a handset financing program. We then moved it into our agent channel which is a very extensive agent channel. In the beginning it was not very impressive and the agent channel is now beginning to perform at levels that look like our retail channel. And so then you move into the big box retailers, it will follow a similar curve. And we come to the holiday season and John mentioned it then they are pushing volumes and this takes a little bit more time to sell a handset that's financed rather just one in a box. And so it\u2019s just going to be a learning curve, and we are going to stay patient but we actually feel very good that the numbers continue to move in the positive direction. ","Operator","Thanks we go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Simon Flannery ","Randall, you talked a little bit about DIRECTV. Could you just give us a little bit more insight into the deal process? The 180-day clock expires in March. I think you referred to a first-half close, so how that's going? And any updates on the synergies? I think you talked about higher numbers. Is that content synergies? Is that more bundling synergies? Is that something that's going to come in early on, versus later? And I think you also talked about video to any device. I know Verizon has talked about an over-the-top rollout in mid-year. So is this something that you are going to have a similar type offering this year? And is that contingent on the DIRECTV close? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","First of all deal process, you nailed when the 180 day clock is running again, but obviously there is a legal challenge going on between the content providers and the FCC and that\u2019s kind of the big unknown in our process right now. We are hopeful that the two parties the FCC and content folks can get that deal settled in short order. I believe there is court proceeding let\u2019s do here soon that will help to determine the pace in which that progresses. But even with that Simon, we are still fairly confident this thing gets done first half of the year. And so I can\u2019t get any more refined that because of this issue. And so this issue would be the only issue that will cause a delay of the 180 day clock to our knowledge right now. ","As it relates to the synergies, it's a fairly predictable formula with us and we do these large scale deals and when we are doing the deals we tend to be fairly conservative. And we have obviously have begun with the DIRECTV management team some forward discussions and getting to a level of detail that\u2019s appropriate within the confines of the DOJ review and so forth. And so we are starting to see details on the channels and then channel costs and so forth. And as a result as you start drilling down through it, it's fairly much across the board we are seeing better opportunities and what we baked into the original deal economics. And so that\u2019s why we are feeling pretty confident that we will exceed the merger synergies that we announced at the time that we did the deal. ","And across the board there are looking good. There are even revenue synergies, when you have 20 million DIRECTV customers that are very, very high-end customers and see what the wireless penetration rate that we have in that customer base it looks really good. The opportunity to be able to sell mobility into those channels and so forth. So across the Board cost synergies, a few revenue synergies, it\u2019s all looking better to what we had anticipated when we announced the deal. ","And then in terms of video to any device, this is one of the key opportunities that we were pursuing. When we did this deal our customers are demanding video to be delivered across any device. And so one of the primary objectives we will have coming out of the close of the deal is taking advantage of the [content] [ph] relationships that DIRECTV has and our wireless customer base, we envision customers being able to walk out of our stores with content available to them on devices that they have purchased in our store. You are familiar with the order deal that we have done with the Chernin Group, where we are developing over the top content with them and taking advantage of ways of delivering that to our customers as well, so it's going to be a multi-faceted approach in terms of how we bring video to our customers, but we\u2019re looking at multiple channels and channel line-ups that we\u2019d be able to accommodate into our wireless customers both tablet as well as handsets as well as our broadband customer base 16 million broadband customers. And so stay tuned, there\u2019ll be more to come, but this is a high priority for us is getting the content delivered to the mobile handsets and tablets.","Operator","We go to Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Joe Mastrogiovanni","A couple follow-on questions, if I could. John, if there was an attractive opportunity in Latin America, maybe something sizable like America Movil is expected to be, given your funding requirements over the next few years, do you think a transaction like that -- you could do a transaction like that and stay within a comfortable leverage range? Or should we expect some equity component for a sizable transaction? And then, Randall, part of the strategy of allowing the base to move to new pricing, with the help on the churn side, and while we saw the benefits of that over the prior two quarters, we did see churn return to a level similar to two years ago, as you pointed out. Are you comfortable with the current pricing strategy in place right now? And do you think this fourth quarter was more of a one-time-ish in nature, or should we expect churn to remain at elevated levels as we move throughout 2015? ","Randall Stephenson","I\u2019ll answer John\u2019s question on Latin America. The America Movil thing is just too uncertain even answer your question on and I will say it again, we\u2019ve got all we can handle right now in Mexico. And we\u2019re going to be focused on getting Nextel International closed, integrating that network, integrating those customer channels, integrating the distribution channels and getting ourselves scaled in Mexico, so anything else is just kind of speculation and then probably isn\u2019t worth conversation at this point. ","In terms of churn, I would tell you I\u2019m comfortable with the performance we had in the fourth quarter as it relates to churn. And I\u2019ll say it again, when we compare it to two years ago which was the last major iPhone launch and only three national carriers carrying the iPhone to have a comparable level of churn, with the kind of pricing moves we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace versus two years ago, I think that\u2019s pretty good performance. And this performance for the quarter, we\u2019re comfortable with. We are as I mentioned before, really focused on that area of our customer base that tends to have the lower churn and that is our business customer base and the high-end consumer customer base where we\u2019re experiencing the churn. ","As John said in the feature phone side of the house and we will address that with our Cricket platform. And so right now who can call where pricing goes in this industry? I haven't the slightest idea. It moves, it\u2019s very volatile, but right now we\u2019d like the value equation we have in the marketplace. We have a customer base that demands reliability, that demands speed and that demands quality. They demand a very sophisticated consumer channel and business channel, we have probably the most sophisticated business channel in the industry for B2B. And we think it\u2019s very important and we think also that that B2B customer segment is more and more demanding security solutions integrated all the way through the cloud with our net bond strategy and that\u2019s proving to be a very powerful combination in the marketplace. So that\u2019s where you\u2019ll see us focused and like I said I can\u2019t predict where pricing will go.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David Barden","Maybe first one, just Randall, obviously your views have been expressed on this Title II as a way to get to the net neutrality issue. But I guess from the investment community standpoint, are you of the view that there is going to be really anything different about the business, in terms of the business you do, or how you do it? Or are the investments you are making kind of on a middle- to long-term basis? If you could kind of talk us through the investment side of that equation. And then, John, just a question on the write-down of the copper plant. Could you talk a little bit about what that was, where it was, and what kind of expectations we have for that going forward? Thanks. ","John Donovan","Sure Dave let me give Randall a break and I\u2019ll take the copper question first. We went through a study and in our business there is active payers that are copper payers that are connected to customers and serving customers. There\u2019s spare payers in that network that are available that are in great working condition and available to be used if needed. And then there are what we would consider dead payers or payers that need significant repair work that are not connected to any customers, they need significant repair work and investment to make functional. ","We did a detailed study across our network by our network engineers in conjunction with that, identified marked and made the decision to abandon those ineffective payers or what we would -- what the [indiscernible] dead payers. We have plenty of capacity to serve our customers with our active payers and spare payers, so we don\u2019t expect any limitations on that. That\u2019s how we went through the process it was a very extensive process that was a very unusual process to go through. We don\u2019t expect any further write-offs like this we're not aware of any and we just felt it was appropriate to recognize this fact anybody has found our business has seen the change in our access line customer base over the last five or six years could understand that we would have peers that would be inactive and in this case ones that were not economical to activate not to mention the fact there is not demand for us to make that [indiscernible]. So that's the background on just across our traditional wireline footprint. ","Randall Stephenson","A favorite topic title 2. ","David Barden","Sorry Randall. ","Randall Stephenson","Look I will address it from a couple of perspectives. First net neutrality, what this debate started out as to be pursuing was how do we protect net neutrality, a neutral internet. And I would tell you I am not -- I don't know if anybody in the industry who really argues that we shouldn't have net neutrality and indeed the President laid out four principals for what that meant. And we look at those four principals and said we're okay with those. ","Those four principals is what resulted from all of this was the FCC were given authority to enforce those four principals, it has no bearing or impact on our investment decisions none whatsoever. What causes us pause is if the way you effect those four principals is by categorizing the internet and wireless services as title 2 communication services that's a different deal, alright and that's something we have to say what does that mean and whether the implications of categorizing these services as title 2 services to our industry. ","And the example I give is we're right now trying to obsolete our old legacy telephone services moving to IP or to all wireless and there is a very specific process one has to go through to obsolete those services and replace them with the new advanced services. And we're working through that with the FCC, it's a very collaborative process it works but it takes a lot of time to make that happen. And we think that we might be able to get to a point where we can obsolete these services or begin replacing them with the new services by 2020 that's an aggressive time line. ","The idea of beginning to put our wireless services and our broadband products under those categories and subjecting ourselves to that kind of regulatory oversight is what causes us pause and when we say we are pausing investment till we understand where this is going, that's what we're referring to. ","Now Chairman Wheeler can find some creative solution, categorizing these as title 2 but doesn't cause the industry to slowdown, doesn't cause investment cycles to slowdown, does not cause innovation cycles to slowdown. It will give us some confidence and relief to continue investing at the same pace we have. But till we have kind of have clarity we're saying we're just on any new investments we're in a bit of a pause mode but it's really up in the air right now. ","There are a lot of ways of getting what the President has articulated he wanted to accomplish. One of them is the Congress is working on it and that is that the Congress would pass legislation that would give the SEC the authority to enforce the four principals that the President articulated were important. That works to us, that puts us very similar to where we are today and probably doesn't change our investment thesis for anything we're trying to do. ","But these really strident heavy handed regulations on wireless and broadband if we go down that path that's what causes everybody some apprehension and uncertainty and begins to change investment thesis and so forth. So it's up in the air, right now we're just anxious to see when the SEC comes out, so we now begin to formulate our plans. ","Operator","And we will go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Amir Rozwadowski","I was wondering if we could chat briefly about your commentary that post the completion of some of your pending acquisitions, and some other initiatives that seem to be on the table, your debt coverage ratio may go over that sort of 1.8 times level. Could you perhaps give us a sense on where that could go? And, perhaps, what is your priority maintaining your near-term credit rating? It sounds like discussions with credit rating agencies have been constructive. But I was hoping to get some clarification, if possible. ","John Stephens","I will take that if you look at the Direct TV transaction based on some of the most recent published financials you will know that there is a cash fees in that transaction that would approximate about 15 billion and I think if you go back to the last financial statement their gross debt level could be at $18 billion to $20 billion level that would be the debt we would be adding on as well as any impacts from closing Nextel and [indiscernible] as compared to our first quarter. ","And then we've got some other -- as we mentioned we can't talk about the special options and so we won't do that, but will have other impacts from matters ongoing that will impact our debt range. ","With regard to that it is very conceivable that our net debt to EBITDA ratio would go above two, I think that's assumed and possibly in somewhere in between the 2 to 2.5 range, I know that\u2019s a great wide range but that\u2019s where we feel comfort right now stating in. Those are the kinds of levels of debt that we would expect that could occur once we close all the transactions. What we would then focus on doing is because we will have accretive free cash flow after the DTV transaction as we said before we would take the excess cash flows after dividend and use that to commit that to paying down debt as quickly as possible. ","We suggested over the course of the three year cycle that ought to get us back to what is more traditional levels, for us that\u2019s a 1.8 times net-debt-to-EBITDA. And if you look at our current cost of borrowings, some of our recent transactions but quite frankly our entire portfolio today, we have after tax cost of debt well below 3%, so its producing interest expense at a very acceptable level at 1.8, where just a few years ago our expense rates were higher. ","You might have gotten a comparable answer with the 1.5 or 1.6 net-debt-to-EBITDA. So that\u2019s where we are at. We will let the debt rating agencies deal with it as they see fit, but we are comfortable with where we are going and we understand the implications. ","The last thing I would tell you here is as we announced last week we set up a facility with a collection of banks in 18 month, three year, five year terms for over $11 billion, the net after tax cost of that debt averages less than 1%. And we have been very transparent with our plans and activities, such that reasonable people at the banks are in this process are still very interested in providing a significant funding at very attractive rates within ability for us to prepay without penalty and ability just to live the if you will facility open until such time as we needed. ","So we feel really good about where we stand in the crowded market. We will continue to work on it but we will continue to feel good about where we are at. ","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much, John. And just one additional follow-up, if I may. In addition to your significant acquisition activity, you folks have also been successful at monetizing some non-core assets over the last 12 to 24 months. I was wondering if we should consider this element of your strategy, and how it may fit into your priorities for 2015. ","John Stephens","Yes Amir, it\u2019s a great question. I am not going to comment on the specific items. I think we started talking about monetization assets back three years-ago. I think that was the first major transaction we had done was a Yellow Pages transaction. So if you think back from that timeframe to today, you understand that -- I mean you clearly understand the multibillion, tens of billions of dollars we generate, I will say this we have a $300 billion of assets on our balance sheet and we have a history of being Fortune 100 type publically traded companies, we are done yet. We have an opportunity to do more. We will continue to evaluate and as management we have an obligation to maximize returns on our assets. So getting to high utilization and high results that\u2019s part of our responsibility, we will continue to focus on it. Though the balance sheet as large as ours it would be inappropriate to collecting the things are complete. There is always opportunities. ","Operator","And that is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Brett Feldman ","So, earlier, Randall was talking about lessons learned as you move up the curve with Next. One of your competitors, T-Mobile, has learned that they can change the way they provide credit to their customers. They are placing a higher priority now on payment history than some of the traditional credit metrics. Have you learned the same thing? And is there any change in the way you are extending credit to your customers as they adopt Next? Thanks. ","Randall Stephenson","I don\u2019t think there are lessons learned, I think all of us over the years in this industry know that you know your customers better than anybody else does. And customers that have been with you for a period of time regardless of what their credit scores are you tend to treat differently. And we have for many years done that whether it be on the fixed line side or broadband, U-Verse customers who pay us well that may have lower credit scores, we have actually gone ahead and extended them services like U-verse which requires significant upfront investments and so forth. You are doing on the business side of the house too, you know your customers well. And so you are willing to invest in your customers that you know who may have credit scores that are weaker than what a new customer you will be willing to do with the new customer coming with a low credit score. ","So there are not any new games in this business, we have all been playing this credit scoring game for a long time. It\u2019s a fairly predictable process, we know our customers well, we know when we tweak credit policy, what to expect and within what timeframe to expect that reactions. And it\u2019s actually gotten fairly mechanical and arithmetic to be quite honest with you. So I don\u2019t think there is any new science out here on this. ","Brett Feldman ","And are you finding that the banks that you are working with are recognizing those lessons that you have learned in the way they finance your receivables? ","John Stephens","Absolutely. We have gotten very high, that\u2019s one of the reasons why we have high demand in a securitization process and we are able to get the pricing levels that we are able to get. So they recognized that and quite frankly all of you know, most of you go to our financial statements and our provision for bad debts and understand with a company that has over $130 billion worth of revenues, you can clearly see just how effective we are at managing -- particularly in a difficult economy how effective we are in managing our receivables. The team has done a very good job across the board business consumer through processes just like Randall described.","Randall Stephenson","You bet. Thank you Brett. Thank everybody for joining us and taking the time to listen in on the call. As we articulated at the beginning, we feel very good about where we\u2019re going in 2015. As we get to the end of 2015, we\u2019re going to be talking about a very different business and a very different company and we\u2019re excited about it and look forward to working with you over the course of this year.

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to Susan Johnson, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Susan Johnson","Thank you, Cathy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. It\u2019s great to have you with us today. I am Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. John will provide an overview with perspective on the quarter. Then we will follow up with questions and answers.","Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, that\u2019s www.att.com\/investor.relations.","Now, before I turn the call over to John let me quickly cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 3. We had our best consolidated revenue growth in more than two years up 3.6% driven by strong wireless growth, our best consumer wireline growth since the introduction of U-verse in 2006 and rapid growth in strategic business services.","EPS for the quarter was $0.71 when adjusting for some transactional expense associated with the Leap acquisition. When compared on an adjusted basis that\u2019s up nearly 11% over last year\u2019s first quarter. Consolidated margins were up year-over-year due to wireless expansion margin expansion offsetting wireline pressure.","Cash flow started the year strong. In fact cash from operating activities for the quarter was the highest it\u2019s been since 2007 $8.8 billion. Our solid cash flow allowed us to make significant investments in Project VIP and the growth drivers of our business. Capital spending was $5.8 billion and that gave us free cash flow of $3.0 billion for the quarter. We also continued to be opportunistic in buying back shares as part of our repurchase program. In the first quarter, we bought back about 37 million shares for $1.2 billion.","Now with that overview I\u2019ll turn the call over to AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?","John J. Stephens","","Thanks, Susan and hello everyone, and thanks for joining us today and for your interest in AT&T. Before I get to our operational highlights, let me take a moment and give you a broader view of our business strategy beginning with slide 3. As you know, we have been working very deliberately on multi-year plan to transform our business.","In the first quarter, we really began to see the benefits of this transformation effort. You\u2019ve seen us transform our networks from the legacy services to an all IP platform and a best in class network. Project VIP is accelerating that transformation through our LTE deployment, U-verse expansion and fiber build to businesses. We also reached a significant milestone in the quarter with our domain 2.0 initiative. We named two leading companies, Amdocs and Juniper Networks, as primary vendors that will help us achieve our vision of a user-defined network cloud of modern cloud-based architecture.","We also make significant strides in transforming the wireless customer value proposition. This transformation began with the move from feature phones to smartphones. These smartphones soon became the remote control of our lives and drove significant data usage. In recent years we began the transition to usage based pricing and away from device subsidies.","In the first quarter, we accelerated that transformation, thanks to the transparency and simplicity of our Mobile Share and Next plans. At the same time, we transformed our wireline business from legacy services, such as DSL to IP networks and IP services. In the first quarter this transformation helped drive our strongest consumer wireline growth in years. And in business our strategic business services continued its steady growth. And our transformation is not slowing down.","Yesterday, you saw us announced plans that strategically target 21 new markets to expand our ultra-fast fiber networks to deliver U-verse with GigaPower. Moves such as this are one more indicator of our ongoing transformation. Behind all this is the strength of our balance sheet, our strong cash from operations allows us to return substantial value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, while still having the ability to invest in our future.","Now let\u2019s get to our highlights for the quarter which begin on Slide five. We had an impressive start to the year. Let me begin with a quick overview of the quarter. We made major moves in wireless that are reshaping the way we do business. We completed our Leap transaction and have begun the integration process. This will accelerate our prepaid initiative as we launched a new Cricket brand in the second quarter. And we have reached a critical point in our wireline business where we can clearly see that our Project VIP plans are working and transforming the business. These efforts results in our strongest consolidated revenue growth in more than two years while also driving double-digit adjusted EPS gains. And we did this while still dealing with a very weak economy.","To start wireless execution was superb in the quarter. We had our best postpaid net adds first-quarter in five years and revenue growth was strong. We also made massive strides in changing the subsidy model giving customers greater choice and a more transparent way of choosing their wireless equipment and service plan.","AT&T Next take rates were strong as more and more customers chose the installment plan method of purchasing handsets. And the shift to Mobile Share plans was nothing short of incredible. The number of new Mobile Share counts and connections tripled year-over-year with nearly half of our accounts now on 10 gigabyte or larger plans.","At the same time, U-verse continued its steady march of transforming our wireline business. In fact we had our best consumer wireline revenue growth since the introduction of U-verse about eight years ago. And the outlook for U-verse continues to be solid, as we expand the U-verse footprint and look to increase penetration.","Transformation also continues in business wireline, strategic business services revenues were up more than 16% in the quarter. So, a very solid start with excellent momentum. Now let me provide more details starting with our business our wireline, our wireless business on slide 6. Perhaps the biggest story in the quarter was the strong growth in total and postpaid subscribers, we added more than 600,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter with smartphones and tablets leading the way, that\u2019s more than twice as many as the year ago and the best first quarter in five years.","Overall, we had more than a million net ads in the quarter, as we showed year-over-year improvement in every customer category. In prepaid, we continue to make progress in adding smartphone subscribers. In the first quarter alone we added 255,000 prepaid smartphone subscribers to our network, this help drive year-over-year prepaid revenue growth. Also during the quarter, we took a major step in transforming prepaid with the close of our lead transaction, adding 4.5 million prepaid customers of which nearly 70% are using smartphones. We are really excited about this new opportunity. Churn continues to be a solid story for us. Total churn was stable for the quarter with postpaid churn down sequentially and up slightly year-over-year. That is a great achievement and what is definitely a noisy competitive environment.","We believe Mobile Share will have a positive long-term impact on churn. In fact, postpaid churn got progressively better throughout the quarter. As the transition of our customer base to usage-based plans accelerates, so does the shipping of our handset sales to AT&T Next. Those details as well as revenue breakouts are on Slide 7.","The transformation of our customer base can be clearly seen in this quarter. The combination of AT&T Next to Mobile Share value plans has annual level of transparency in the smartphone buying model that customers haven\u2019t seen before. This new model lets customers choose, what plan best suites their need, and many customers have been choosing to move after subsidy model for simpler pricing and for a large number of our customers that means AT&T Next. More than 40% of smartphone gross add and upgrade to the quarter were on AT&T Next, that\u2019s up from 15% in the fourth quarter. We shipped away from the subsidy of subsidy model as major implications.","First, when we shift two equipment and service as customer signed up for the next contracts you. You see that in our strong equipment growth to the quarter with slower service revenue growth. Second, AT&T Next accelerates the move to LTE capable devices. About 57% of smartphones on our network are LTE capable providing a superior customer experience on a best-in-class network that also means the honorable sufficient network? And third we see this as an investment in our high quality customer base and in customer choice.","It peels back the layers of the subsidy model and allows customers to make clear choices. It also helps build a stronger bond with our postpaid base in a noisy competitive environment. And we believe we are well positioned to use working capital in this way. With our strong balance sheet, we believe we can do this prudently and effectively.","Another important aspect of Next, is that these are highest credit quality customers, that\u2019s Next was designed for and that\u2019s who is selecting Next. I talked earlier about our transformation, it leads us to a different set of metrics, than what we have used in the past. Next in a shift to equipment revenue changes the way we look at ARPU. Phone-only ARPU a metric we have shared for sometime and which includes only service revenue increased by 0.4% in the quarter.","However, phone-only ARPU plus Next monthly billings increased by 2% year-over-year. This move to Mobile Share plans in the quarter was incredible, more details is on slide 8. During the quarter, we introduced several new Mobile Share value pricing plans for both families and individuals to help customers move out to subsidy model. First, we introduced new attractive pricing for the 10 gig or larger plans for customers who purchase a phone with AT&T Next or bring their own device.","Second, we rolled out similar value pricing for one and two gigabyte plans. At the same time, we made it easier for subscribers to move off the traditional subsidy model by allowing them to take advantage of these attractive new Mobile Share value pricing options in advance of upgrading to Next. We see this as another investment in our customer base. The cumulative impact of these changes was significant.","First, the number of Mobile Share accounts and connections rose sharply in the quarter, increasing by more than 50% since year-end and tripling year-over-year. Second, there was a major migration of subscribers to Mobile Share plans up 10 gigs or higher. Customers bought up more than two-thirds of Mobile Share account activity with the gigabytes or higher plans in the quarter driving overall penetration to almost 50%, that\u2019s up from just 27% in the fourth quarter of 2013.","And third, these new offerings prompted about 1 million postpaid subscribers who were on unlimited plans to elect to shift to Mobile Share pricing. This helped drive the overall number of smartphones subscribers on tiered data pricing to 81% that\u2019s a full six percent point increase in just one quarter. At the same time, we added more than $1 million new postpaid smartphone customers that includes customers who are staying with us and upgrading from feature phones. Our postpaid smartphone sales continue to run in the 90% plus range and our total postpaid smartphone base is at 78%.","Now let\u2019s look at margins on Slide 9. In the first quarter, wireless EBITDA service margins were 45.4% that\u2019s a 220 basis point increase from year ago levels. Even though we had a significant increase in postpaid gross add year-over-year. The margin expansion was driven by several factors, such as the move to the 24 months upgrade, network efficiencies, and operational improvements. Next also had a positive impact on margins.","All these activities more than offset the pressures we saw in the quarter. Cause of strong net adds both postpaid and total customer growth, additional promotional activity relating to our transformation, additional customer care costs related to Mobile Share and Next, and increased start-up investment in prepaid and digital life.","Our actions to improve margins also help to ease the pressure from about 1.1 million accelerated smartphone upgrades that occurred in the quarter. These are customers who took advantage of new pricing and move to Mobile Share plans and upgraded early. Without this boost, Next take rate would have been closer to 35%. In total, we had 2.9 million AT&T Next sales in the quarter. And now more than a quarter of our postpaid smartphone base is on a Mobile Share value non-subsidy pricing, and is no longer tied to the subsidy model.","Another margin comparison to total wireless EBITDA margin that was stable year-over-year even with all the growth in investment activities we had underway in the quarter. There is a lot of moving pieces in our wireless business last quarter. The huge shift to Mobile Share plans, the tremendous popularity of AT&T Next, the increase in total and postpaid net adds, and the transitional way for the subsidy model. But it all comes down to customer choice. We are making the buying process as open and transparent as possible and then letting customers manage the process. We believe this is not only best for our customers, but best for our share holders.","Now, let me turn to our wireline story starting on slide 10. The wireline story continues to be one of the transformation. That transformation began first in consumer when we introduced U-verse, since that time we have flipped the revenue model. But once with the declining revenue stream at a 4.3% growth in the first quarter accelerating from 2% a year ago.","Total U-verse revenues are now at nearly $14 billion annualized revenue stream and still growing at almost 30%. And U-verse now represents almost 60% of consumer revenues. We also see the transformation in our broadband results. More than two-thirds of our total broadband base are about a 11 million subscribers are now on U-verse broadband, highest speed and highest quality product. These gains drove total positive broadband net adds in the quarter. And we are positioned to continue that growth as our U-verse footprint expense and penetration improves.","It also helps drive total broadband ARPU which was up 9% in the quarter. U-verse TV continues to be popular as we added more than 200,000 subscribers churn continues to be low as penetration is growing. And U-verse voice, our voice-over-IP product just passed 4 million customers. We also announced that important initiative in the over the top space with the churn in group.","We are excited about the new venture and believe the combination of our two skill sets can create something truly impressive. We hope to start rolling out an offering later this year. Now let\u2019s move to business wireline which is on slide 11. While wireline consumer was the first out of the gates with this move to IP, wireline business started the process a little later, but you can still see the transformation going on there as well.","The clearest way to see it is in the steady consisting growth of strategic business services. These are services such as VPN, Ethernet, hosting and other advanced IP services. Those services now make up more than 26% of total business wireline revenue and growth is up more than 16% year-over-year.","Overall revenues were down year-over-year inline with the slow economy and recent trend, but there are positive signs. In enterprise, our global business services we actually showed slight service revenue growth year-over-year, given recent headwinds that seemed as very positive. The biggest drag on the quarter was wholesale. It was challenged by network grooming, as wireless carriers aggressively decommissioned the legacy circuit.","However, if you look at our retail business by itself, enterprise, and small and medium size businesses total revenue was down only slightly in the quarter. And when you look at what business customers\u2019 pay us for their total AT&T bill, both wireline and wireless total retail revenue actually grew year-over-year. We expect our transformational IP will continue to make headway in the business space. At the same time we continue to look for the signs that the economy will improve and provide us with additional lift.","Now, let\u2019s look at consolidated wireline margins on Slide 12. You see the impacts from our transformation on these consolidated margins. For the quarter our consolidated margin was 19.3% up 40 basis points year-over-year. Wireless margin improvement help to offset wireline pressure from the trailing expenses tied to Project VIP. Wireline margins were down from a year ago, but essentially flat with fourth quarter. Declines in legacy services, and content, and retransmission price increases pressured our results.","And this pressure was partially offset by relative consumer revenues and gains and strategic business services. At the same time Project Agile is gaining steam. Project Agile\u2019s are new initiatives that is improving efficiency and how the company organizes and operates to deliver best-in-class customer experience as in all IP, all mobile and all cloud services company. We are taking our initial cost savings from Agile and reinvesting in the Project. We expect one rate savings in the $3 billion range by 2017.","Now let\u2019s move to cash flows our summary is on Slide 13. Our ability to generate cash continues to be strong, in the first quarter cash from operations totaled $8.8 billion or about $1.70 a share, that\u2019s the highest cash from ops in seven years and almost four times our quarterly dividend commitment.","Capital expenditures were $5.8 billion as we took the strong cash flows and invested in Project VIP. And free cash flow before dividends was $3 billion on track with our full year guidance even as AT&T Next changes the subsidy model.","In terms of uses of cash, dividend payments for the quarter totaled about $2.4 billion and we repurchased about $37 million shares for another $1.2 billion. Our board of directors has also approved a $308 million share buyback as we continue to be opportunistic in buying back shares. Since we begin buying back shares about two years ago, we have bought back about 13% of the outstanding shares of the company and save more than a billion dollars in cash from eased divided requirements.","We also continue to look for opportunities to monetize some of our assets. This included more than $400 million in sales of Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil shares and real estate in the first quarter. We continue to move forward on our brands to sell our Connecticut wireline properties to Frontier for $2 billion and we expect that transaction to close by the end of the year.","During the first quarter we also closed our Leap acquisition. A high level look at that strategy and integration of Leap assets is on Slide 14. First and foremost the acquisition of Leap has clear and immediate benefits and value creation. The value of the spectrum what we see was significant about $3 billion in value. At the same time we will be able to get significant value from Leap\u2019s $3 billion tax net operating loss and turn that into real cash for shareholders. And finally, we immediately refinance about 90% of Leap\u2019s debt which will save us $500 million in interest expense or just the remaining term of that debt.","When you add these synergies together, the value of just these items was greater than the total purchase price of Leap. From a strategic perspective, the acquisition of the Cricket brand accelerates our move into the prepaid space. We planned to launch the new Cricket brand in the second quarter combining with AT&T\u2019s existing prepaid operations to create the new cricket with the national presence and more than 3,000 distribution points across the country. The focus will be on simple plans with affordable devices helping customers take advantage of this thing, of the smart new choice in no contract wireless and all this is not a best-in-class network.","We are also integrating Leap customers and its networks. The customer transition is expected to take about 18 months as we move customers off of the outdated CDMA network on to AT&T\u2019s GSM network. We will start deploying unutilized spectrum immediately, continuing our efforts into 2015. Integration costs are expected to be about $1.2 billion over a two year period with about half of that expected in 2014.","CapEx will be in a $1 billion range, but significantly offset by efficiencies with other wireless bill plans and with the majority of the spend targeted in 2015. Leap operational pressure will drive $0.05 of dilution in EPS this year with most of it in the second half of 2014.","We are very excited about this new growth opportunity and expected to really kick start our new prepaid strategy. We are also updating our outlook for the full year after Leap acquisition. Those details are on slide 15. We now expect consolidated revenue growth of 4% or greater for the year as we hold in Leap and see continued strength in wireless and wireline consumer. We continue to expect stable consolidated margins, which includes Leap operational pressure. So we expect EPS growth in the mid single-digit even with the dilution from the Leap operations and continue to investment in growth initiatives.","We still expect capital spending to be in the $21 billion range that we gave you in January with most of Leap\u2019s integration impact in 2015. We also expect free cash flow in $11 billion range at even with expected strong Next sales and Leap cost. And you can expect us to continue to invest in our business transformation and growth opportunities.","And now I will turn it back to Susan for quick summary of the quarter and then we can get to your questions.","Susan Johnson","Thank you, John. Our recap of a very solid quarter is on slide 16, we definitely saw the impact of our business transformation in the first quarter. Revenue growth was strong that includes the best consolidated revenue growth in more than two years and the strongest consumer revenue growth since we launched U-verse. That help drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth for the quarter, wireless was led by the best first quarter postpaid growth we\u2019ve seen in five years and AT&T Next and Mobile Share are transforming the customer value proposition, and put a large dent in this subsidy model while accelerating the growth of larger tiered data plan.","In wireline we are seeing the impact of our investments in IP. U-verse continues its robust growth and business continues to transform with growth and strategic business services. I will now close out the call with a quick review of our Safe Harbor statement and then we are going to open it up for question-and-answers.","Our Safe Harbor statement is shown on slide 2. This presentation and the comments we are going through make contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks. Results may differ materially, details on our SEC filings and on AT&T\u2019s website.","And now Cathy let\u2019s go ahead and we will open up the call to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, very much. Good afternoon, John, if we could start with the guidance revision, and in particular, the Next impact. Can you just talk about the context of where you are in the middle of April versus where you were in January, when you set the original guidance? It sounds like Next is gaining more momentum than you expected. So if you could give color around this 35%, 40% - are you expecting that to be 50% next quarter or 60% in the second half? Some color around what you expect, what we should think about there, and how that has changed over three months. You gave the monthly take rates last quarter; you didn't do that this quarter. And then if you could just touch briefly on Europe. Any update to the commentary around, perhaps, the window being closing there? Thank you.","John J. Stephens","","Thanks, Simon. Thanks for your question. First and foremost with regard to Europe, we stand by what we said before for all the same reason we said before the window is closing by the day, but I will say this as you can see from these results and as Randall and I and others have said before we are focused here on this market and you can see why from the success that we\u2019ve had in this first quarter, see why we have that focus here in the United States and remains there.","With regard to the Next impact from an adoption standpoint, what we wanted to make sure everyone was aware of that, we made a decision in February to allow customers to early adopt or early upgrade under Next and that drove about 1.1 million early adoptions that drove the margin pressure quite frankly in the first quarter, we were able to overcome it, but those early adoptions to drive some pressure, so the real normal kind of a run rate for the group of customers that were qualified under a normal 24-month process ended up being about $1.8 million, and that\u2019s about 35%.","So we did grow from that December 20% or the fourth quarter overall 15% up to 35%, and we will see how it goes forward. I wouldn\u2019t expect that same acceleration from the 15% to more than 40% because of that early adoption, and quite frankly because of the early adoption we may have some impact on the customer during the last three quarters of the year because they move their adoptions up and causes that margin pressure in the first quarter. But I do \u2013 we\u2019re very pleased with the take rates, customers seem to like it and we\u2019re going to expand some of the channels we have the sales in. And so I do believe that the 35% is going to become a new standard, we may do better than that and we\u2019ll see how it goes as we move forward, we\u2019re not giving a specific prediction.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So there has been a little bit of a change in your expectations, I guess, versus when you set guidance originally, because I guess you are only changing revenues at this point. But I guess there are some puts and takes on the other lines.","John J. Stephens","Yes, I mean so what we do on our revenues is really off the strength of consumer wireline, what we saw there, and quite frankly off the strength of wireless as much as Next certainly we\u2019ll have an impact, but really it was much more about postpaid net adds and total net adds. And as we mentioned earlier what we\u2019ve seen in churn and this improving churn picture that we\u2019ve seen throughout the quarter giving us optimism about the full year and a ability to raise that guidance to 4% or greater. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving the change in guidance.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good. Thanks a lot.","John J. Stephens","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike L. McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys thanks. John, just thinking about the higher Next uptake, I think, than what was initially anticipated, and outpacing. The impact on the cash flow \u2013 obviously, you are not changing your guidance for that, but were there anticipated levers that you are thinking about pulling there? And is VIP factoring part of that thought process? And then thinking about wireline margins, what are we thinking about the puts and takes there as far as the ability to increase margin? Does Agile have a positive impact? And thinking about U-verse margins overall, are they starting to contribute in a more meaningful way?","John J. Stephens","Thanks for the questions, Mike; let's make sure I knock them all off here if you will, first and foremost with margins in wireline, [we feel we are at] [ph] in our VIP build process, we are going to continue to see some investments and the customers in the build through 2015.","So while we are working very, very hard to improve margins as we did sequentially in the first quarter as we did we expect real margin or larger margin improvements in 2016 and forward in wireline, so it\u2019s the first point. Agile is definitely generating savings and we\u2019re optimistic about its impact. But right now at this time we are choosing to reinvest the savings wherever we can in a prudent manner to accelerate the overall growth of the company.","Third with regard to free cash flow the real thought process on not changing guidance as a couple of different factors one we came down with the final Leap business plan, we are focused on getting the unutilized spectrum into service right away; we have some commitments on a 90 day and a 12 month process, quite frankly that\u2019s \u2013 putting that spectrum to use, the team is really good at it. They are already well underway on it but it\u2019s not a capital intensive, it\u2019s adding it to already existing network, the big piece the capital the transformation and the CDMA network to our GSM network is going to really have a capital pressure in 2015. So that\u2019s the first point.","Second point is our working capital is evidenced by our cash flow operations of $8.8 billion, our working capital was very strong. And we have efforts across the board receivables, payables, inventory management a number of items. The success the overall team showed is being able to achieve good cash management gives us the confidence to keep free cash flow guidance at the same level even with these increasing Next sales.","So really that\u2019s where that\u2019s going. With regard to your specific question on financing and VIP, we have a very active process in evaluating that. We have not done that. We haven\u2019t committed to do that. It all comes down to costs, and whether we can do it in reasonable manner from a cost perspective. We are optimistic about the ability to do that and we have a - we are well down the road and talking to really qualified parties who\u2019d be interested in participating with us; we haven\u2019t made that decision yet.","Mike L. McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC","","Great, thanks John.","John J. Stephens","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you and our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS. Go ahead please.","John C. Hodulik \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Okay. Thanks. John, could you just give us a little more detail on the accelerated upgrades that you saw in the quarter? Is that going to continue into the second quarter? And if possible - I could probably figure it out - but if you could quantify the impact on margins. And then as it relates to service revenue growth, we saw a deceleration there, but then stronger customer adds than we thought. How should we expect that to trend through the year? I mean you know, it was a big decrease quarter-to-quarter. Is that going to continue, or is this a sort of a new level? How do those two variables work out? Thanks.","John J. Stephens","Well, let me make sure I get things knocked out here for you. John first of all the 1.1 million, let me give you this impression, or this explanation. First and foremost, with an average unit costing about $600, those that are sold on Next would cause us to recognize $600 of equipment expense. On a revenue side, we would start by measuring those receivables which will be $600 million and then basically taking two charges against those, one for an interest charge for the receivable being payable over 20 months to 26 months.","But secondly, for the forgiveness of the remaining receivables when the phone is traded in and we\u2019re not giving specific numbers, I will tell you, we have gone by model by model and evaluated the trade-in value, and we take into account all kinds of variables, whether we sold the model, the day it was launched whether we sold the model, six months or eight months after launch, so on and so forth. How other related models been selling in the used market, whether there is an overseas market, we take all this into account. Essentially though I can give you this kind of guidance, on the day we issue it, you could have a write-down on the revenues from the handset from anywhere from zero to 25% depending upon the different facts and circumstances.","I\u2019ll just give you that as the way to think about it, you can make \u2013 you could then take that differential, those discounts on interest and those discounts on the trade-in value, and compare how much of a loss that generates per unit, it will give you the idea of kind of the pressure we face in the first quarter from those accelerated units.","Secondly, I can\u2019t give you specific guidance on how that continued upgrade opportunity will impact this in the second, third and fourth quarter. The same program is out there, it\u2019s the available number of people that take advantage of it, had shrunk for two reasons. One because the 1.1 million customers already took it and two because we\u2019ve expanded time and some of the people are recovered by, now would have qualified anyway. And so it will work itself down, I would suggest you though the strongest piece of it may have already occurred just because it was so successful on the first quarter. ","We forgot the customer adds. John, we are not giving specific guidance on that. I will tell you, we were very pleased with the strength of the customer adds improved throughout the quarter. And the churn improved throughout the quarter. So we believe that this combination of Mobile Share, Next are quite frankly transparency and pricing and if you will, upfront honestly with customers is working. And we believe that\u2019s going position us well in this, what I call noisy competitive environment. So we\u2019re optimistic about going forward with it, but we are not giving any specific guidance.","John C. Hodulik \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks John.","John J. Stephens","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Joseph Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Go ahead please.","Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. John, given the growth you are seeing in data, now with a plan to sell prepaid more aggressively on the LTE network, how comfortable are you with your spectrum position? And you know, we have seen the comments about potentially reevaluating your participation in the broadcast auctions. How do you view your need for low band versus mid band spectrum?","John J. Stephens","Good question Joe. Let me first, be clear on something with regard to the broadcast spectrums. We would like to participate at the auction, we are and have been working with the commission to establish auction rules that will fairly promote a good result for AT&T, but we will also pull out successful result for the auction. So we are interested in participating. With that being said, I will tell you, I\u2019m very pleased we got the Leap transaction done. And that we are able to work through with the SEC and the DOJ to get that completed.","The unutilized spectrum that we have available to us immediately in over 200 markets that our team is putting into service right now is actively getting that done is really helping us and will help us in quality service in dealing with the network demands. This acceleration through Next in these early upgrades to LTE devices is really helping us with our network, because our LTE network is our most efficient.","So we\u2019re moving a lot of customers on to that and that\u2019s another way we\u2019re dealing with our issues. If you will though, the first and foremost is we feel pretty good with our spectrum position right now we feel like we could position ourselves well with the transactions the spectrum deals we done over the last few years. And we\u2019re optimistic about it, but as with anybody we are always looking to continue to have that available. Last question again Joe, was on prepaid and quite frankly that\u2019s a great opportunity for us particularly with the new Cricket brand that if you will platform that distribution, that customer saying that we haven\u2019t necessarily focused on in the past.","Second, we believe the network differentiation will provide a real opportunity there. The third as we mentioned 70% of the cricket, new Cricket customers use smartphones. So over that 18 months when we have to transition them to GSM smartphones, it will be really \u2013 it could be very opportunistic for us if we\u2019re able to figure out away to take our next program trade-in and provide those kind of quality handsets to our prepaid customers, not only elevate the cost, but give them a real quality experience. So we\u2019re optimistic about all that, we\u2019ll have to do \u2013 have a lot of work ahead of us, but we\u2019re optimistic about it.","Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Great, thanks.","Operator","","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Hey, guys thanks. I guess, first, a really quick follow-up. I wanted to make sure that I understood when you talk about the revenue guidance increase; does that include the acquisition of Leap? Is that in there?","John J. Stephens","Yes, it does.","Philip A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And that\u2019s about, call it, 100 basis points or a little more. Is that fair?","John J. Stephens","100 basis points? That\u2019s a fair number, yes.","Philip A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, I guess, second question: as you think about the Next plan and sort of making it transparent for customers on what the handsets cost, are you seeing a different sort of selection of handsets for Next customers versus subsidized customers, when they walk in and they see what handsets really go for?","John J. Stephens","So I think it\u2019s a little early for us to make any conclusions on that I won\u2019t \u2013 I say that in suggesting that I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve seen anything that is really substantially different, so we don\u2019t want to leave you with the impression that we have and we\u2019re not sharing it. It just hasn\u2019t happened yet. But it is early in the process. I\u2019ll say it\u2019s as much as anything; it\u2019s been a great process for us. When we started the trade-in program last year about the middle of last year and learned about how the trade-in process would work and how to utilize and then taking those skills for us, quite frankly in the first quarter we\u2019re continuing to learn and continuing to refine the process. But I can\u2019t tell you we\u2019ve seen a dramatic change in purchasing activity.","","Philip A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just to follow up there, what is the sort of reverse logistics happening in that trade-in program? What are you doing with the phones now? And how do you expect to deal with them as the volumes, I would expect, ramp pretty aggressively in the next couple of years?","John J. Stephens","","So it\u2019s about expect from the next program itself we don\u2019t have very many trade-ins yet, right, because we haven\u2019t lapped the first year and that first 12 months cycle. But the expectations are couple one we are seeing great take rates on our insurance program, not only historically but specifically with Next. And so these trade-in phones we expect will be used in our insurance fulfillment that\u2019s one. Two we are working hard to figure out a way to make them cost efficiently deployable in our prepaid market whether in specifically in the new Cricket brand.","Three we always have the opportunity to sell them on the wholesale market which is what we did mainly last year, with the quality of the handsets our customers use and without having the international standard for handset technology, we were satisfied or pleased with the demand for our handsets that we dealt with last year and feel optimistic, because the handsets we may be dealing with this year might be newer in their lifecycle than the once we had do with last year. So those are the, if you will, mechanisms to make sure we get value out of the process.","Philip A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it thanks John ","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Tim K. Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","","Good afternoon guys. Great quarter. John, I think you blew through \u2013 definitely our estimates, but I think the Street estimates, on subscriber adds. Can you maybe give a little more color? What's going on? Do you think the overall market is just expanding, or are you guys kind of gaining share? If so, maybe talk about who you are gaining it from? And then I guess we were concerned, and there's been some concern out there, about the early termination fees that some of your competitors are paying. Can you talk about how that process hit you throughout the quarter? Thanks.","","John J. Stephens","Yes, sure Tim. Let me, first of all I would say that lot of the offers that came out right at the beginning of the quarter. I will say that they didn\u2019t have the impact but I will say that the impacts and everything we did change throughout the quarter, and specifically the biggest impact was the decision to push Mobile Share, value plans in February and early adoption of Next.","And when we did those two things in connection, we saw significant take rates and we saw improvements in not only in customer growth customer additions. But we saw a churn come down. And we saw that improve throughout the quarter. So the more customers understood the better it got in the results. So, I guess, real simply, while it's a very noisy, competitive environment, we were able to do well across the board we don\u2019t give individual porting ratios, but we were certainly positive porting in total. And very strong results from all aspects of our business. We don\u2019t have any reason to believe, we should be able to continue with, we need to see how things play out, and how we continue to play in this competitive environment. But we are optimistic about what we can do going forward.","Tim K. Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. ","","And then just maybe a longer-term outlook on Next. Have you thought at all about maybe just phasing out the subsidy programs and moving everyone over to Next in the next couple of years? Because it seems like it would be substantially more profitable. I know you talked about going through some of the economics there, but your subsidies were in the $400 range before that. And maybe it's $100 upfront here on Next. ","John J. Stephens ","Yes. So Tim I mean, we certainly continue those things I guess the first thing \u2013 and this may sound simplistic, but the first thing is it starts with the customer. And so our customers still and some of our customer still choose the subsidy program even in the first quarter. So we want to make sure we stay focused on what they have and what they want and be responsive to them. So that\u2019s the first thing, so I wouldn\u2019t suggest that it would be eliminated as long as there is a significant amount of customers who enjoy and prefer it.","I\u2019ll tell you this, so as we see the next program grow, who are expecting to see some changes in pricing and some ability for the consumer to drive efficiency in the market, maybe the handset providers are the \u2013 the transport companies couldn\u2019t drive themselves. And that will give us an opportunity to not only to your customers a better deal \u2013 as they drive efficiency, they will get savings. But we believe as they drive efficiency and get savings for themselves to give us the opportunity to get savings under the subsidy model. And that\u2019s a long-term optimistic point for us, so that $400 to reference Tim, we would hope based on the success of Next and the customers purchasing activities in that would help us to give us an opportunity to make in roads into that $400.","Tim K. Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. ","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Frank G. Louthan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thank you. I want to talk a little bit about the fiber builds that you have announced \u2013 they put them out yesterday. I just wanted to see what sort of the time frame and the commitment to those markets. And then talk just a little bit about the economics of deploying fiber \u2013 on the GigaPower product now versus what you saw a couple of years ago. It seems like the economics have improved for you. What are some of the drivers of that that are making that more of a feasible build than what you saw a few years ago?","John J. Stephens ","Yes, so first and far most right now the four markets that we\u2019ve announced in, specifically, Austin, where we made the most progress in \u2013 we are being able to view this within our scope of our VIP program and in our scope of U-verse, if you will able to direct dollars from that effort and move them into this fiber-focused effort of GigaPower.","What we\u2019re seeing there is take rates in Austin that surprised us that exceeded our expectations. We\u2019re seeing customers quality scores \u2013 very pleased. And what we\u2019re seeing is being able to sell much more online, in a much more efficient manner than necessarily we have done in the past. The key to the success there was that we\u2019re able to get kind of right way, and permitting and pull rights and other rights to build in the same manner as other companies which we haven\u2019t had historically.","And we\u2019re able to focus our build on the customers that drove demand as a oppose to the ubiquitous coverage. And so those two things really driving the success those two things drive the changes in the financial metrics when you can build where the demand is you can have much higher penetrations and get much higher returns to support that build.","We will start - in fact, I think there have been discussions today with many of the leaders of the market areas, the cities that we spelled out. We\u2019re very opportunistic, optimistic I should say about those markets and believe we\u2019re uniquely positioned in many of those markets because the existing backbone we have in many of those markets. So build off of and to provide that really high quality service.","Frank G. Louthan \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","Okay, great thank you.","John J. Stephens","","Thank you.","Susan Johnson","","I think I am going to call for the last question as we are almost out of time.","","Operator","","Thank you, that will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead please.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Hi guys, thanks for taking the question I appreciate it. So I guess I've got a couple of questions, if I could. So, John, thank you for your kind of walking through some of the accounting practices that go along with Next. I guess my math is that every Next customer is generating something around $500 of upfront equipment revenue relative to the traditional subscriber, who might be generating closer to $200. And that $300 delta times 2.9 million Next adds would be about $900 million of incremental equipment revenue relative to the old approach.","And that seems to foot with the year-over-year change in your accounts receivable working capital number. So I was wondering if we could kind of just go right to the nuts and bolts of it and see what was the Next impact on the quarter, specifically, from the differences in how you account now versus how you would have accounted if you just used the subsidy model? And then, I guess, the second question, if I could, was, it looks like you changed the definition of ARPU in the disclosures this quarter. I guess the old numbers look about $2 higher than or $2 lower than the new numbers. So I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about that change as well? Thanks.","John J. Stephens","Sure. First of all Dave, we\u2019re not going to give specific details, but let me give you a couple of points about what you said that I think are maybe a little bit need some refinement. First and foremost on day under the old subsidy model, we got about $240. We also got a $200 copayment, but we usually had about somewhere between \u2013 about a $40 activation fee, so that\u2019s the first piece. ","Second piece is if you think about an average phone cost about $600 and you would adjust that for an interest charge and you adjust it from anywhere from 0% to 25% contingency loss for the trade-in value reduction, you are going to get a much different numbers than $500. You are going to get a lower number than $500.","Second, if you think about what happened in the quarter, we had $1.1 million accelerated upgrade. So this next program generated those, that doesn\u2019t generate a benefit actually that generates pressure on the margins. So I think all of those items have to be taken into account. Specifically I\u2019ll tell you on the change in accounts receivable, yes, there is some accounts receivable change related to Next. Our total Next accounts receivables are going to be in the $2 billion range. I think we said at the end of last year was in the $900 million, but I want to be straight with everyone in a sense that the 12 months receivables, the billings for the next 12 months are in our accounts receivable line because they are short-term, the current assets. And those receivables that go up beyond 12 months are our long-term other assets. So it\u2019s not \u2013 the accounting rules don\u2019t allow us to be that \u2013 have that clarity with regard to it that\u2019s why we provided in our quarterly filings the total Next receivable.","With regard to ARPUs, you are right, we are changing it as we\u2019re shifting the model and having people pay for equipment, and choosing \u2013 they are electing to pay for equipment, and for in return, they are taking a discounted service price. Our new ARPU metric is service ARPU plus monthly Next billings and when you add those together which we\u2019ve done in our presentation you can see our growth rates still strong 2% on the ARPU side, so you feel good about that. But if you will, a view towards what the customer is paying us, you know writing the check to us for on a monthly basis.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","So, John, just on that \u2013 so you are adding service ARPU plus a portion of the equipment revenue back into the service revenue number for the ARPU calculation?","John J. Stephens","Just a monthly billings.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, just if I could clarify that\u2026","John J. Stephens","And David, that won't tie to equipment revenue, because the equipment revenue is \u2013 you're right. Much when it\u2019s recognized upfront. This is how much we \u2013 this is the $30 a month we bill a customer who is on a 20 month Next plan for a phone that costs $600.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Right. And for those advanced upgrade plans, the ones that kind of you allowed to upgrade early, did you book any revenue for those? Or did you just give them the phone?","John J. Stephens","","No. They came in and signed up to pay us, effectively the $30 a month for 20 straight months. So, yes, we booked revenue in the same manner as we booked all the others.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay. Great, thank you guys for helping.","John J. Stephens","","Thank you. Folks with that let me take a moment to thank all of you for being on the call today. We have started off the year very strong and have made major strides in transforming our business. As a result we saw strong revenue and EPS growth, along with major gains in our growth drivers. We drove a strategic shift, subsidy model by changing the way customers buy their handsets. It\u2019s been an exciting quarter and an exciting start to the year. And we look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. Thanks again for being on the call. And as always thank you for your interest in AT&T and have a good evening.","Operator","","Thank you.

Viola - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the second quarter conference call. It's great to have you with us today. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer.","We're going open with a summary of our results and then we're going to spend a little bit of time providing a strategic update of our business. We thought this would be a great time to just take a step back and look at how we've repositioned our company the last few years. Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. You can find the material at www.att.com\/Investor Relations.","Now beforehand I hand the call off to John, I need to call your attention to one more matter. That's the safe harbor statement which is on slide three. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking, they're subject to risks and uncertainties, results may differ materially, and additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. I also need to remind you that we're in a quiet period for the FCC spectrum auctions and thus we cannot address any questions about spectrum today. And so with that, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thanks, Mike, and hello everyone. And thanks for being on the call today. It's been one year since we closed on our deal to acquire DIRECTV and it's been a heck of a year. We are hitting the mark with their synergy targets. Our cost synergies are ahead of plan and we're about ready to take the wraps off some exciting new streaming opportunities that will expand our customer base and extend our video position. We've added nearly 1million U.S. satellite subscribers since we closed the deal. We were excited a year ago when DTV first came on board, and that enthusiasm has only grown.","We'll talk more about that in just a few minutes. But now let me begin by discussing our second quarter results, starting with our financial summary on slide five. Second quarter consolidated revenues grew to $40.5 billion, largely due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. But we also saw a growth in satellite video, advertising, and IP services on a comparable basis. This offset pressure from lower year-over-year wireless equipment sales and foreign exchange.","Adjusted earnings growth continued. After adjustments, second quarter EPS was $0.72 a share, up year-over-year and up about 7% year-to-date. This quarter's growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. And, we had more than $0.01 of pressure from compensation-related programs tied to our stock price. Most of this is from a success-based compensation plan we have for our bargain floor (3:37) employees. We're please for our employees, all our employees, in that they have an opportunity to share in the success that they have helped create for our shareholders.","Margins also continue to be a solid story, thanks to our focus on profitability and our best ever wireless EBITDA margins. We once again saw adjusted margin expansion on a consolidated basis and in every domestic business segment.","This solid performance helped drive strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $10.3 billion, with free cash flow reaching $4.8 billion, up 8.4% year-over-year. Our dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 61% and year to date, it's 73%. Capital investment came in at $5.6 billion for the quarter and $10.3 billion year to date. We also continue to find ample demand and great rates in the securitization market to help us manage our Next receivable. We received about $1.1 billion in the second quarter, or about the same as last year's second quarter.","Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with business solutions; those details are on slide six. Total business solution revenues were down slightly, due to the sale of certain hosting operations and foreign-exchange pressure. Solid wireless and strategic business service revenue gains helped offset lower wireless equipment sales and declines in legacy services. Business wireless revenues were up 2%, with service revenue growth outpacing equipment declines. Margins also continued to expand, thanks to business efficiencies and wireless revenue growth offsetting lower wireline revenues.","Looking at the customer segments, Small Business Operations continued to grow thanks to gains in wireless. Enterprise revenues were flat. However, if you adjust for the sale of our divested business and FX, that segment also continued to grow in the quarter. Strategic Business Services continues to grow at a healthy clip, up more than $200 million year-over-year. That's up 8.4% on a reported basis, and when you adjust for FX, growth was 9%. Strategic Business Services are now 36% of business wireline revenues. The growth of Strategic Business Services and Mobility is changing the revenue mix in Business Solutions. Those two areas now make up more than 70% of Business Solutions revenues, and if you look at total data and wireless, that's more than 80% of business revenues. So our transformation to next-generation products and services is well on its way in our business segment.","Now let's move to our Entertainment group results on slide seven. On a comparative basis, we grew revenues in our Entertainment group thanks to gains and satellite subscribers, broadband revenue, and advertising. This more than offset losses in legacy services while also overcoming the pressure from the record-breaking Mayweather\/Pacquiao pay-per-view event in the year-ago second quarter.","We continued to see solid gains in broadband and advertising revenues. Broadband revenue was up nearly 7% in the quarter, with IEP broadband revenues up 15%. Advertising sales also continued its strong growth, up double digits year to date, and it's now more than a $1.4 billion annualized revenue stream. We're well positioned in this space and we're looking to play a leading role in taking our ad offerings across all screens. At the same time, we again saw continued margin expansion, which points directly to the benefits of the DIRECTV acquisition. Our margins on a comparable basis were up 90 basis points, and were up even more if you adjusted for the prior year pay-per-view event.","Our second quarter customer video metrics were impacted by the usual seasonal pressures but improved nicely over last year. Our satellite net ads continued to be robust as we added 342,000 satellite subscribers in the quarter. More than 80% of our domestic video business is now on DIRECTV platform.","Broadband net subscriber results also were impacted by seasonality as we added 54,000 IP broadband subscribers in the quarter. When you include business subscribers, the company added 74,000 IP broadband subscribers. As we expected, this growth was below recent quarters with second quarter seasonality, but we expect IP broadband net adds to bounce back in the second half of the year.","Now, let's move to our U.S. Mobility results on slide eight. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic Mobility operations are divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations.","Increasing profitability and a growing subscriber base continues to be the story in our wireless operations. For the second straight quarter, we turned in a record EBITDA margin of 41.4%. Service margins were also a record, reaching nearly 50% in the quarter. Both were up 130 basis points year-over-year. A sharp focus on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove the margin expansion.","Equipment revenues were down due to a year-over-year increase in BYOD subs and a lower upgrade rate. Service revenues increased sequentially but were down year-over-year. At the same time, phone-only ARPU plus Next billing was up 2.5%, with average monthly billings growing to $70. This growth comes even as we see an increasing number of subscribers holding on to their devices longer after completing their scheduled Next payments.","About half of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, but 75% of postpaid smartphone subscribers are on a no-device subsidy plan. Postpaid churn came in strong, with its second lowest ever quarter at 0.97%. Postpaid phone-only churn was even lower, and smartphone churn was still lower. And even with the pressures from reseller, our total churn was very low at 1.35%.","Branded phone adds increased in the quarter. Branded domestic phone net adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up 185,000, thanks to strength in our Cricket brand. We also continued to expand our valuable smartphone base, adding nearly 800,000 domestic-branded smartphones in the quarter. And if you look at the chart on the lower left-hand corner of the slide, you can see that our overall phone base has more subscribers today than we did a year ago, thanks to strength in postpaid and prepaid smartphones. And our postpaid smartphone base by itself is up 1 million in the same time, as feature phones transitioned to smartphones.","We had another solid quarter in adding subscribers. Including our Mexico operations, we added 2.1 million new subscribers. That includes 1.4 million domestic wireless subs with connected devices, branded phones and tablets overcoming losses in reseller largely due to disconnects from our 2G network.","Prepaid net adds in the quarter were impacted by two events. First, we aligned our churn policy across our prepaid platform. This favorable impact was generally offset by the negative impact resulting from a network outage caused by a vendor's equipment.","As noted in our reseller numbers, we're starting to see some churn pressure associated with the planned shutdown of our 2G network at the end of this year. That will increase as we move closer to the shutdown. We'll manage through the process and the cost savings from one less network to support will be meaningful; so will the additional spectrum available to redeploy.","Now, let's look at our international operations. That information is on slide nine. Let's start with Mexico. We continue to make significant progress in building our customer base and deploying our 4G LTE network. We added 742,000 wireless subscribers in the second quarter as we near the 10 million subscriber mark in the country.","Our LTE deployment also was on track. We now serve 65 million people in Mexico with our most advanced network, and expect to reach 75 million by the end of this year. That brings our total North American LTE deployment to 380 million POPs. Our rebranding to AT&T also continues to make progress. We now reach 61 cities with the AT&T brand, including our largest market, Mexico City.","Second-quarter revenue was up 13% sequentially, driven by equipment sales and wholesale revenues. Revenue growth was impacted by lower ARPUs, as the competitive environment has intensified. In Latin America, our DIRECTV operations continue to show revenue growth, up 8% sequentially. Revenues are being hampered by challenging economics, however, we did see subscriber growth, adding 87,000 video customers in the quarter, in part due to the Copa America Soccer Tournament. But as you might expect, the earthquake in Ecuador did pressure our overall subscriber growth in Latin America. But even with these economic conditions, we continued to be profitable and generate positive cash flow from these operations for the quarter.","Now that we're midway through the year, let's take a look at how we are doing relative to the guidance we set out in January. That's on slide 10. We're on track to meet or exceed each of the metrics we have laid out for you. Consolidated revenues are growing at a double-digit pace, thanks to our acquisition of DIRECTV. This comes even with pressure from lower equipment sales and foreign exchange.","Adjusted EPS is up about 7% year-to-date, above guidance, but in line with where we expected to be at this time. Consolidated margins are stable, as margin expansion in our domestic operations is offsetting investment pressure from Mexico. We are focused on growing our valuable subscriber base across our business, including Mexico, where growth has been strong. We are willing to make additional investments to gain quality customers.","Capital investment is trending to the low end of our guidance at its current pace, and we are ahead of plans with free cash flow. Dividend coverage for the first half of the year was 73%. We continue to feel confident that we will meet or beat our free cash flow guidance for the year.","Now, I'd like to spend the remainder of our time providing a strategic update on our business. That begins on slide 12. As Mike mentioned, we have often updated you on our company strategy and direction. But today, we'd like to take a longer look at how we have uniquely positioned AT&T to lead in the rapidly evolving world of communications and video entertainment. Our goal is to be the world's premier integrated communications company, for both consumers and businesses, and we plan to do this in the most cost-efficient way possible.","This strategy did not happen overnight. It has been part of every business decision we've made for many years. No one else has our portfolio of assets. No one else has our cost structure opportunity. And no one else can offer the integrated solutions that we can.","Behind all this is a solid financial foundation that gives us the strength and flexibility to invest in our business while returning value to shareholders. This includes our strong liquidity position, our market-based compensation and benefit plans, and thoughtful debt management.","For example, we successfully negotiated workforce contracts that are market-based but also encourage employees to keep our owners' interest in mind while rewarding them when we succeed for shareholders. We also have a world-class board of directors, who provide great insight while at the same time, challenge us. This makes us stronger and helps us navigate through these transformative times. We are uniquely positioned in this industry. All of this will be critical as mobile broadband, high-speed connectivity and entertainment come together.","Let's first talk about the connectivity building blocks that we have assembled on slide 13. Since the introduction of the first smartphone, we've seen unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic. Even more incredibly, we expect that to continue to grow at a very strong pace. To meet this demand, we undertook several strategic initiatives to improve the capacity of our network for today and the years to come.","Here is what we've accomplished. First, we ratcheted up our investment cycle with Project VIP. This was crucial in getting the high quality, high capacity network we have today. Our 4G LTE network deployment was accelerated \u2013 fiber backhauled, deployed, and cell sites built. We now have almost 70,000 cell sites, thousands more than our largest competitor and our move into the Mexico wireless market further expands our LTE reach. We also drove fiber deeper in our wireline network. We added more than one 1 million business locations to our fiber network and we expanded our IP broadband footprint to more than 60 million customer locations.","The next phase of driving fiber into our network is our GigaPower deployment. Over the next few years, we expect to reach at least 12.5 million customer locations with our gigabit broadband service. We now have more than 2.2 million fiber-to-the-home customer locations and we expect to reach 2.6 million or more by the end of the year. Our already dense wireless network and expanding fiber footprint puts us in an excellent position as we move to more small cells and 5G. We've already filed patents. Trials are already underway, and testing is ongoing. When 5G is ready to roll, we will be ready as well.","At the same time we launched VIP, we moved to expand our spectrum portfolio. We have about 150 MHz of spectrum in our portfolio today, including 40 MHz of relatively untapped AWS and WCS spectrum. We have the best, most balanced spectrum portfolio in the industry. Adding spectrum is the most effective way to add capacity. This year, we expect to add 35,000 LTE carriers compared to the 18,000 deployed last year. We also continue to make smaller spectrum deals to round out our coverage and redeploy spectrum once dedicated to 2G and 3G.","Last week's move by the FCC to make high-frequency radio spectrum available for 5G wireless service is another step forward, providing us more spectrum. And while we are not going to elaborate, AT&T has applied to be a participant in the broadcast spectrum auction and has also submitted a bid in the FirstNet process that is currently underway.","Our network transformation is now pivoting to software-defined networking or SDN. With SDN, we are virtualizing network functions that used to require dedicated fixed equipment and software. SDN gives us flexible, dynamic and smart network capabilities. We ended last year with about 5% of our network functions virtualized and expect to reach 30% by the end of this year. We are on path to achieve 75% network virtualization by 2020. SDN also provides cost savings, which supports our drive to an industry-leading cost structure. Let's discuss that on slide 14.","Having an industry leading cost structure helps us expand margins and grow free cash flow. We now have a line of sight to continue margin improvement as well as reaching our goal of $20 billion in free cash flow. This is what we need to do to reach those goals. Step one, is achieving the cost synergies from our DIRECTV acquisition. We are on track to achieve $1.5 billion-plus run rate synergies with DTV by the end of this year. That puts us well on our way to hit our projected $2.5 billion-plus run rate savings by the end of 2018.","Step two is our work to drive efficiencies with Project Agile. This work includes our efforts to serve customers digitally, automating service delivery, streamlining operations, and other cost efficiency initiatives. Our goal is to generate a $3 billion run rate in cost savings and we are moving past the midway point of making that happen. We also have not been shy about exiting non-strategic businesses that don't fit our margin expansion profile. That includes global hubbing, and more recently, certain hosting operations. Obviously, that reduces revenue but increases overall profitability.","Finally, we must continue to lead the industry in our move to software-defined networking. We are virtualizing functions that previously required dedicated solutions, dedicated hardware, dedicated software, dedicated teams. This virtualization manifests itself into real sustained cost-savings throughout the network and the business. That's savings in both our capital expenditures and our cash operating expenses. It also gives customers greater control of their network services, more agility and simplicity in the way they do business with us, as well as better value on ours and our customers' hardware investments.","Now, let's look at something that really separates us from the rest of the industry \u2013 our integrated solutions approach. That's on slide 15. While it starts with connectivity, and cannot be sustained without an effective cost structure, you must have assets to create products customers want, delivered where and how they want them to be successful.","We've talked about these assets, but let's bring this point home. We are in every major market in the U.S. with reach around the world. We have a 4G LTE footprint that covers 380 million people in North America. We have more fiber connecting more buildings and more business customer locations than anyone else \u2013 that's in footprint and out \u2013 which helps us compete today but also positions us very were for 5G. And we're also the biggest TV provider in the world, and we're about to introduce an over-the-top product that we believe will be a game changer. DIRECTV now is scheduled to launch later this year, and we expect the millions of people who don't now subscribe to a video service and prefer a streaming option will be impressed.","At the same time, no one can match what we offer business customers. We have the ability to serve all business customers, from Fortune 1000 companies to the local ice cream shop on the corner. And no matter how big or how small the business is, almost every conversation with business customers begins with mobility and security, and that is where we excel. When you take our extensive fiber network, then layer on SDN, security and mobility, and new software-enabled services, you have the premier integrated business services company.","We believe we have a significant competitive advantage to use our connectivity and cost structure to offer integrated solutions to our customers. Whether you are in the C-suite of a major company to the master suite of your own home, and anywhere between, AT&T delivers. We have a robust, dynamic, and attractive set of products architected on a network that is flexible and able to quickly adapt to the future. That's table stakes if you want to be the world's premier integrated communications company, and that is exactly what we expect to be.","Now before we get your questions, allow me to quickly summarize, and that's on slide 16. We are very confident in our unique strategy. We have the assets we need and we are executing on our plan. Our DIRECTV cost synergies are hitting the targets. Project Agile is on track. And we are ahead in the move to software-defined networks. All this drives us towards an industry-leading cost structure.","But we're most excited about what lies ahead. We have a dedicated and skilled group of people working for us. From the crews staffing our work centers to leaders in the boardroom, we have a team of professionals focused on making AT&T the world's premier integrated communications company. Our differentiated position opens the door for some game-changing opportunities, and we're ready to walk through it. We're confident we can execute on our strategy and continue to build value for our shareholders. With that, let's go to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead, please.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.","Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. John, it looks like, in terms of the guidance as you kind of walk through it on slide 10, you're kind of tracking ahead of where you thought you'd be at this point in the year. As we look to the second half, could you talk about the major variables that would kind of maybe swing you back down towards more the base case expectation for the year versus the \u2013 or better part of the guidance that you were discussing?","And then second, I was wondering if we could just touch on this issue of kind of the economics of postpaid sub losses versus prepaid sub gains. I guess you had about 319,000 prepaid gains versus 180,000 postpaid losses. Could you talk about the relative economics of those two things? And are we looking at a net economic positive or negative trade-off when we look at that? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thanks. Thanks, David. Let me take the second question first. On the economics, so forth, the postpaid subs were losing a lot of feature phones. They're averaging about somewhere around $35, maybe a little bit less, than ARPU, and have costs associated \u2013 the postpaid do \u2013 with retaining them. On the prepaid side, we're probably closer to a $41, $42, depending upon the specifics, average ARPU, and much less \u2013 they're very, very small subscriber acquisition costs, upfront costs, maintenance costs by the very nature of being prepaid.","So from that standpoint, the economics are better, and it is being shown in our margins. When you look at our margins \u2013 total EBITDA margins or service margins \u2013 you can see that growth, and you can see the level. That's a part of what's driving it. So the economics are \u2013 and we're running the business on a branded basis \u2013 we think of branded customers and try not to make distinctions on classification. Really makes distinctions on economics, and I think it's showing up in our profitability.","With regard to the variables in the second half, there's a lot of things that happen in the second half. There's some seasonality in the fourth quarter in our wireless business. In our video business, we'll have the NFL Ticket come out and we'll have the launching of the DTV Now, and some of the over the top offers. So we'll have a whole host of things going on. I would just suggest to you we're very confident where we're at. We continue to do well. And I wouldn't suggest to you that there's anything necessarily unique or different about the second half of the year. It's just we're careful with our guidance and want to make sure we meet or exceed it; so we feel very good about we're at through six months.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.","All right. Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please. Mr. Cusick, is your phone on mute?","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you hear me, guys?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","We can, Phil.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. So, a little bit along the lines of David's second question, when would you expect we'd see more integrated promotions for video and mobile services? And you've talked in the past about having some excess margin to give up to drive faster sub growth. Do you feel like you've been doing that already or is that still pending? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thanks, Phil. So first of all, we have been doing some promotion, some offers, some marketplace adjustments based on how we look at the marketplace. So, some of that is already impacting our results, and we're still doing quite, quite well in margins with that. Secondly, our first integrated product, I'd refer you to is the 5 million customers who have already signed up who have a bundle of our in-home video product, whether it be U-verse or satellite \u2013 DIRECTV satellite \u2013 and our wireless. It's been successful. We've seen very positive results from our customers, so it is going well. You will see us continue to push that offering as well as others.","And then, I would suggest to you you'll see more things come out as we roll out our over-the-top offerings and other aspects. But right now, we are seeing some improvement in our attach rate of IP broadband with our video sales. And that is improving as we see the trends for the last four or five months. And we would expect to see some continued positive bundling, if you will, of wireless and video, as we've already seen 5 million people sign up for it.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","John, you mentioned DIRECTV Now. What's the long pole for getting that out at this point?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","I think there is a whole host of activities going on. I would suggest to you it's this way. While I believe that everything is moving well and all on our timeline that we've targeted, the biggest guidance piece on it is going to be, we're going to want to make sure it comes out with high quality and high performance. And so, as we develop this and test it, that will determine its timeframe. We'll want to make sure when it comes out, it's the high-quality product.","If you think about the technology development, that's on track. If you think about the assets we need to provide that, those have been acquired; those are on track. If you think about the contracts we need to get the stacking rights and digital rights, those are going well. It's just a matter of getting all of those things coordinated together and then make sure it's the highest quality product you can have at launch. But we are confident in that process, and feel good about targeting the end of this year to get that out.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Do you have a widespread beta product of that yet, even without all the content?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yeah, we are going through various levels of testing of everything, but we're not going through a detailed public discussion of that. But as you can imagine, we're going through a variety of levels of testing of that. But this is something we've been working on for a while \u2013 feel real good about.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks. John, maybe pointing to the build-up of the $20 billion free cash flow number on slide 14, it looks like you're at about a $16 billion base in 2016 here. You've got another $1.0 billion in synergies and another $1.5 billion in Project Agile. Is the rest \u2013 come from virtualization over that period? If you could give us a little more detail on that, and I would imagine you'll be paying some more taxes over time as well. So, how does it all fit together to sort of bridge us to that $20 billion number?","And then, as you talked about in the \u2013 some previous slides, you're a little bit \u2013 you've underspent the $22 billion bogey on CapEx a little bit here in the first half. Does that mean there's \u2013 we have a sort of downward bias to CapEx at this point? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thanks, John. A couple of things. One, if you think about the free cash flow and you think about the $15.9 billion that we started with last year, and you add in the kind of the $2.5 billion dollar opportunity with DIRECTV. You add in the \u2013 with the remainder of the $3 billion opportunity from Agile. And then you add in maybe a 1%, I'll say is an illustrative, reduction in capital intensity and some costs \u2013 some cash operating expense savings \u2013 you can see that those three items there can get you well over $5 billion.","In addition, we expect to grow our EBITDA and grow our profitability of the business. And so, when you put those things together, it looks to be an achievable, real, realistic path from last year's $15.9 billion to a $20 billion number as a goal in the near future. And so, that's what we are looking at. That's how we build it up. We're not giving a prediction date on that, but we feel good about the opportunities to significantly grow free cash flow.","With regard to our CapEx, just want to be very straightforward in the sense that we are at $10.3 billion, and on an annualized basis, that would come below the $22 billion. We will continue, as I've said before, to invest as appropriate, not towards a targeted $22 billion number, but rather towards a, what business cases make sense, and when it makes sense for us to be in the market investing. Sometimes that causes quarters to be much heavier in CapEx, like we had in the fourth quarter last year. And other times, like in the first six months this year, we spend at a lower rate. We're just being very careful with every dollar. But right now, the performance we've had for the first six months is a trend to \u2013 on the low end of our guidance.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Go ahead, please.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks. Hey, John, just maybe a couple of things. First, going back a little bit on the postpaid handset side. It looks like \u2013 obviously, feature phones have come down dramatically over the past eight quarters or so. As that sort of approaches a lower level, does that provide a tailwind to get postpaid phone additions back to a positive territory? And obviously, you've got DTV cross-selling, DTV Now products rolling out, or over-the-top products rolling out. I presume that could also help. And then, just secondly on the video adds for the year, the anticipation there, is it that DIRECTV continues to ramp? You've been doing a great job, but is it that or is it U-verse becoming less of a headwind in the back half of the year to get to a positive video number?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thanks, Mike. First of all, on the postpaid handset side \u2013 or on the handset side \u2013 we do think the 2G losses, as we go through the year, we'll see those. But getting past this year, you'll see the opportunity to have a more positive impact because we're through that process. Secondly, our feature phones, which include some 2G devices, but our feature phones are going down and as they go down and that, if you will, legacy product, so to speak, impact on our results is lessened, certainly we have a brighter opportunity \u2013 a better opportunity to grow out of those customer base.","And then third, on the bundling, as we really get into the second half of the year and are able to do single-truck install, which may be bundling of video and satellite and broadband, but also, that whole activity of bundling, the more time our teams get to do it, the better we'll get at it. And so from that perspective, we do think that'll provide us an opportunity to grow more wireless.","So all three of those things will help, and yes, we're optimistic about it. But I will tell you also, it's really about the branded net adds and the economic net adds. It's not about any one category of net adds. It's getting those customers that are the most profitable, the highest quality.","With regard to the video side, on a seasonality basis, we usually do see less. We see more pressure in the second quarter than the first half from the U-verse side. And from, and quite frankly, so has DTV in the past. So going forward, I would hope that we would see \u2013 we'd expect to see \u2013 some improvement on both sides. When you think about DIRECTV, things like the NFL Ticket Sunday, and some of the other offers, as we see these trends of bundling improving an attachment rates improving, we feel really good about the opportunity to improve our trends and get to our goal of positive video net adds for the year.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much and good afternoon, John and Mike.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Hi, Amir. How are you?","Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey, Amir.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good. John, so if we can touch upon that bundling question a bit more. If we go back to last year at the analyst update, post the close of the DIRECTV deal, you had highlighted some potential areas for revenue synergies driven by some level of cross-pollination of your respective customer bases. And I was wondering, where are you folks along that line? You had highlighted like there were, I believe, 15 million DIRECTV homes that don't have AT&T wireless, for example. Other opportunities seemed to be broadband plus video offering. Are you still at the early stages of that deployment? I'm just trying to assess, sort of, what kind of runway you do expect from a bundling opportunity perspective?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yeah, Amir, I would suggest we're at the early stages when you think about getting the workforce trained in all aspects of being able to cross-sell and do the bundling in the cross \u2013 and do single-truck roll installs and so forth \u2013 it takes a while. We have that completed; we have that process. But even as they all have been trained and they've all started to do it, it still takes some time \u2013 even with the great workforce like we have \u2013 to get really proficient at it. And we'd expect to start seeing that, as we've said all along, show some benefits in the second half of this year.","But once again, I would suggest to you, the team's done a really good job of doing the bundling between wireless and the video products alone. And getting 5 million of these customers to sign up for this bundled approach with regard to video and wireless, is just the best proof I can offer you that we've already done, they've already accomplished, that this works and that we have a real opportunity to exceed our merger integration synergies because we'll have an opportunity to add revenues to those. Well, most of those synergies were really focused on costs.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful. And a follow-up, if I may. If we look at the current U.S. mobile competitive environment, one of your competitors notably instituted a price increase, which can somewhat imply a belief that the competitive landscape is not as pronounced as it once was. If we look at your service revenue trajectory in mobile, we still see some impact from stable declines in ARPU. Is there potential opportunity for adjusting pricing, particularly around bundled offerings or anything along those lines that could provide some relief to the trajectory of service revenue there?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Well, Amir, once again, let me point you to kind of a complete picture of that. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the ARPU's right at $70 on a per-customer basis when you take into account the total billings. Those are really impressive levels, very good for us historically from any measurement \u2013 our straight ARPU prior to the equipment installment days, or in the most recent years, with the equipment installment. So, on a monthly basis from our customers, we're doing very, very well with the revenue base.","Secondly, it is a competitive environment, and it will \u2013 and it has been for years \u2013 and it will remain that. We believe that we are doing well with that, and we think it's proven out in our margins, in our profitability, and in our cash flows.","I will tell you just one side item that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. We had about 500,000 BYOD devices. We had customers walk in with 500,000 phones and said, can we connect them to your network? Those are all net adds. They don't show up in equipment revenue. And depending upon what package they show up, they'll show up in service revenues. But they are really profitable. They're low cost. We love them. That doesn't necessarily show up in your immediate look at the financials, but it is clearly showing up in our profitability and our margins. So, I would ask you to focus on those items as well as our service revenues.","Specifically with regard to our service revenues, you've seen our additional piece of our customer base shift to Mobile Share Value. I think we went from about 64% up to 75%. We did have some additional customers shift off of the \u2013 shift to the no-subsidy plans \u2013 which impacted service revenues. And we continue to do normal promotions through some of the incentives, credits, free services \u2013 normal promotion activity. All of those things are impacting service revenues as expected.","With regard to recent activities in the marketplace, we'll see how those play out. We're just focused on getting the best quality customers and providing really great service. Some of the changes we've seen give us reason for optimism. Many of the changes we've seen give us reasons to be real careful and watch how the market develops, and be ready to prepare and lead, quite frankly, in a market with the performance that we've got.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the incremental color.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go now to Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes. Thanks very much. I'd also like to add a competitive question to the mix. Typically, of course, the second half, the fourth quarter, a little bit more competitive. Do you feel like you are going to be as competitive as you've been last year? Is the goal to increase the number or the mix of net adds that you retain relative to where you've been over the past couple years? Just in general, how you feel about your subscriber base and your mix of net adds would be great.","And then, secondarily, if there's anything then you can share on where in your CapEx budget you have been able to do better, whether it's labor or equipment or what have you, that would be super helpful. Thank you.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Okay. Well, the second one first. On the CapEx budget, we've done well, kind of in all aspects of it. A couple of things. One, we've been able to \u2013 because of our software-defined network \u2013 we're starting to see a little bit of those savings. If you think about our buying capacity and the overall economic conditions, we've been able to get some volume pricing and some purchasing power benefits. Certainly, we're getting more efficient with what we do.","I will tell you, though, that one of the things I think people miss out on is that because of the spectrum that we've invested in over the last, say, five years or so, we've got a lot of effective capital deployment that doesn't involve a lot of dollars. It involves deploying spectrum, and that's a really efficient way to deploy capacity. And so, on a per-unit of capacity, our dollars can be really efficient because of the spectrum portfolio that we have that we're putting in use. I think that's a real big benefit.","From a customer base perspective, we're very pleased with the subscriber base we have, whether it's the business subscriber base that we have, what we saw in the small business side and the growth there, whether we see it in the enterprise side. When you look at the consumer side, the prepaid business is growing well, and quite frankly, the margin improvement from Cricket is helping drive the margin improvement in the overall business of wireless. So, that's great. And then of course, some of the premier customers in the video space are using our U-verse and our DTV services.","So, we feel great about our customer base. With regard to that, we're willing to invest dollars to retain and attract additional quality customers, whether here in the United States or in Mexico and Latin America. We'll be focused on that but we'll be careful with it. I would suggest to you the characteristics \u2013 the titles we give those prepaid, postpaid, over the top versus monthly subscription \u2013 are less important as the economics of the profitability of those offers. And that's what we'll be focused on.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, John. So that sounds like you are perhaps expanding the range of subscribers that you might defend or target than you might have \u2013 than relative to last year. If that makes sense.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Well, I'll say it this way. When your margins expand as much as ours have \u2013 about 130 basis points in both EBITDA service and, for example, in wireless, or in total margins \u2013 you have more room and more customers fall within that profitability level that are appropriate.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","That's well said. Thank you.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yeah. That's really what's going on. The team's done such a great job expanding margins, they've created more room to be competitive. It's the team's credit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. John, you noted that you're on track to deploy fiber to 12.5 million customer locations. You have 12.6 million IP broadband customers today, but there are 60 million homes in your wireline region that could get a broadband line. So I'm curious, as you're doing the fiber deployment, how are you deciding which are the right homes to upgrade in terms of whether you should simply upgrading existing customers or how do you determine whether it's a business case to go to some of those homes that you don't serve and deploy fiber there?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","There's two things that \u2013 I mean, the first thing I'd tell you, Brett \u2013 is that the ability to build the fiber to the home is a larger footprint than just the 60 million. So we can take the economics of going into some appropriate customer basis, whether it's an opportunity for real \u2013 better economics, better profitability. So, we have that kind of business-case process to it.","Secondly, I would tell you that with regard to the FCC agreement, there's particulars within the agreement that allow us to build \u2013 count so many greenfield builds, count so many more upgrades in the existing IP broadband footprint \u2013 to utilize in some cases multiple dwelling units, and then in many cases require some level, or a significant level I should say, of new builds. So, we have to coordinate all of that, take all of that into consideration. When you're done with that, you may still have some profitable builds that are at or above the 12.5 million commitment and you may go ahead and build those. We'll see where that goes over time and we'll see where that leads us.","But the ability or the schedule to build is an economics activity, a business-case activity with, of course, the opportunity to over-build in some areas being probably more timely and less expensive. But that might be capped by some of the regulatory agreements that we have in place, and we're going to certainly be respectful of those. But overall, it's kind of a normal business-case process and where we can serve our customers the best and get the best returns for them and us.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And just as a follow-up to make sure I heard that right, I think you said that you are considering taking fiber outside of your traditional wireline region if the business case makes sense. Is that \u2013 did I hear that correctly?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","We've already done it. We've already done that in many cities. So, I don't want to suggest to you that we haven't.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","How do you pick those markets? Are these places where maybe you've already done a lot of fiber for your LT networks so it's a natural extension or are there other characteristics that tend to be appealing?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Just customer characteristics, competitive situation, access to other facilities we might have, a whole collection of considerations, whether it's a technology corridor like Raleigh-Durham or other such considerations. But that's a normal business-case process for us.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, got it. Thanks for taking the question.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Sure.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. Good evening, John. So, going back to the presentation a year ago, one of the things that you said you were working on was a home media gateway. And I know there's a bit of product development in that, but perhaps you could just update us on how that's looking, when we might start to see that getting deployed?","And then there's a lot going on in Washington and obviously you can't talk about the auction, but maybe you could just give us some of your perspective on some of the agenda items at the FCC around special access, set-top boxes, privacy, et cetera, and any exposure you see there? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yeah. So set-top boxes, we have commented on that \u2013 the industry's commented \u2013 and there's been significant support, I think, from Congress on that. So, I think that we would expect, we would hope \u2013 we've seen the people coalesce and we'll see some changes into what the initial FCC guidance was on that.","On the special access piece, we think there's competition across the marketplace today. We see it and we would think that any kind of additional regulation of products that are already competitive will stifle investment and won't be good for consumers or businesses or the overall economy; so we think that's, if you will, headed in the wrong direction. We'll continue to present our case on that.","On Title II, we always expected the final resolution to be in the hands of the Supreme Court and we'll work through the process and follow the Supreme Court process closely, and then make our decisions going from then on. I would suggest to you those are really, kind of my comments on all of those matters.","With regard to assignment of the home media gateway, I'd suggest to you this aspect, that we continue \u2013 and I'm not going to be able to give you a detailed answer, I'm not going to try to, on a home media gateway. But what I will tell you is that we continue to believe that as we go through the process we can get cost synergies in DTV by standardizing the interfaces, whether they get the video over the satellite, whether they get it over the broadband or whether they get it over the IP television. And we continue to work on those activities, to standardize the graphic use interface, the set-top boxes and what you, what many would consider a gateway or a home gateway, for media. Those activities continue to be on and we'll continue to work for that. It's a natural efficiency and it's also a really good quality service for the customers.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. It sounds like that's a sort of, still a medium-term item?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yes. I would not suggest it's a near term item. I'd have to be honest. And I will go back with my team and follow-up on that, but right now I would suggest it's a medium-term.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Michael J. Viola - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey, Kathy, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Then the final question will come from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Go ahead, please.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Two quick ones, if you don't mind. John, can you give us a sense of what your services-only ARPU is, or if I bring my own device, what that is? Because I know my own children, they've been blowing through their data usage since they got out of school and that's a lot of new applications out there. Can you maybe talk about how much the current data volume growth can drive ARPU growth, in your opinion, over the next few years? And then I just had a quick clarification.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yeah. So Tim, certainly we are seeing buckets get bigger for our customers. We are seeing their demand so we're optimistic about that opportunity. We're careful about it because of the competitive environment and responding to, or at least understanding how competitors may respond to what we've done. So certainly, the data growth, as we spelled out in our slides, the data growth continues, and for us, as an integrated carrier with the backhaul and the fiber and the extensive number of towers and spectrum, we feel really good about our competitive position.","The question of how quickly we can get our data growth, or at what percentage that will be, will be a function of both the efficiencies we're putting into our data delivery as well as customer demand and competitor pricing. But, yes, there is absolutely a lot of growth in demand and usage, and we hope to capture that in additional revenues as we go forward.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great, and I think John Hodulik said you were halfway through your DTV synergies and Project Agile. Is that correct?","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","We're on track to get to the $1.5 billion \u2013 we say $1.5 billion-plus \u2013 run rate by December this year. So I don't want to suggest to you that that's the number for the year. It's the run rate at that level.","We'll get to it in December, and so we feel really good about where we're going for next year and the year after. And getting to the $2.5 billion run rate in 2018 is our guidance, so that's that piece of it. We are on track to get about half of those Project Agile savings today. That is correct, and we said that in the prepared \u2013 that'll be in the script. That's in the prepared remarks.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks a lot.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Sure.","John J. Stephens - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","With that, I want to thank everybody for being on the call today, and let me just give you a few closing comments before we go. It's been one year after our acquisition of DIRECTV and we are very pleased with where we stand. The integration of DIRECTV is on track. Cost synergies are ahead of target, and we've added nearly one million satellite customer since the merger. And our new streaming services are scheduled to come online later this year.","We believe our unique assets, our leading cost structure and our ability to offer integrated solutions positions us like no one else. We think this is just the beginning. We are positioned as a unique competitor and the first scaled communications and video provider to offer fully integrated nationwide products, and we fully expect to increase our momentum as we go forward.","As always, on your way home tonight, remember: When it comes to texting and driving, it can wait. Thanks again for being on the call, and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T and have a good evening. Good night.","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael Viola","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. As Tony said, I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer.","Randall is going to provide an overall business update and cover our 2018 business initiatives and John is going to cover results along with the 2018 outlook, and then will follow with our normal Q&A.","As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. It includes our news release, our 8-K, investor briefing, and a variety of associated schedules.","Before I begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're going to be subject to risks, uncertainties, and results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations website.","And so now, I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's Chairman and CEO, Randall Stephenson.","Randall Stephenson","Okay, thanks, Mike. What we'll do is start on page four of the deck. And I just want to take a moment and reflect on 2017 because by any measure, 2017 was a remarkable year. It's remarkable for our country, for our industry where we operate, and for AT&T. And it's been a long time since we've seen so many, what I would call, major public policy achievements compressed into a single year like we saw last year. And we're calling these achievements because the combined impact from these is going to be growth. It's going to be growth in U. S. investment and jobs and in wages. And all of this began early in 2017, as regulations across all industries were being rationalized.","In our industry specifically, the FCC returned us to a light touch regulation of the Internet. And this was the purchase that up until 2015, it allowed in the Internet to flourish in the U.S. tech sector to leave the world innovation. So, we obviously believe this is a step in the right direction, but this regulatory pendulum is going to keep swinging back-and-forth unless Congress steps forward and writes new laws to govern all Internet companies and to protect the consumer.","We believe that we need clarity. We need a long-term predictability on the rules of the Internet and on customer privacy. So, we're calling for an Internet Bill of Rights and you can expect us to take a leadership role on this as the discussion progresses.","Unquestionably, the biggest development that came out of Washington last year was around tax reform. Our public policymakers pulled the greatest lever they had available to them to stimulate capital investment, job creation, and wage growth. That lever was given U.S. companies a competitive tax system, one that levels playing field with the rest of the world.","We're in very early in the process, but you've seen it. Company after company is already announcing increased investment, hiring, wage increases, and employee bonuses, and we were first out of the gate. We announced bonuses for more than 200,000 front-line employees and a voluntary medical plan contribution for a total of $1 billion. And we also increased our 2018 capital expenditures by another $1 billion.","So, while public policy stole a lot of the spotlight, we did make a lot of progress on several strategic initiatives last year. The most important is FirstNet, winning that FirstNet bid. And this was going to prove to be the foundation for taking wireless network performance to a completely new level.","What we're doing is building a nationwide network with the latest technology. It's designed and it's hardened for America's first responders and then that will be our foundation for broad 5G deployment.","We're well underway with the build, including new sites in unserved or underserved rural parts of the country. We plan to deploy 40 megahertz of fallow spectrum that we've accumulated over the last for years along with the spectrum from FirstNet. And we'll also be deploying the millimeter wave spectrum from our FiberTower purchase and this is going to give us a quantum leap in both capacity and performance.","We move to Mexico, I'm really pleased with how the team is executing. They're doing so well. We added 3 million customers in 2017. We also made great progress leading the industry in terms of software-defined networking, 55% of our network is now virtualized. And as a result, you're seeing our networking and our IT cost structure falling significantly.","We also made progress moving our base of our high value customers into multiproduct bundles, saving them money; driving down churn, and earning more of their overall spend. And you can see the fruits of the strategy in our strong wireless performance this quarter in DIRECTV NOW's terrific first year in the market. Our fiber build continue to go strong. We know reach more than 7 million customer locations and expect to double that in the next 18 months. So, that's a look at 2017.","And what I want to do now is move forward to 2018 and talk about our priorities this year and that's on slide five. It's no surprise our top priority for 2018 is closing our deal to acquire Time Warner. We were obviously surprised when the government decided to try and block the merger because it is a classic vertical merger between two companies that don't even compete with one another.","With 50 years of legal precedent, it's the type of business combination that the government has consistently approved with appropriate conditions. Now, while we remain open to finding some reasonable solutions to address the government's concern, we do expect this case will ultimately be litigated in court. The trial date is set to begin March 19 and we remain very confident that we'll complete this merger.","We're also going to be laser-focused in 2018 on building the world's premier gigabit network. And again, FirstNet, combined with our fiber and our 5G deployment, is giving us a powerful platform to accelerate our move into a gigabit world. And I got to tell you, I love our position here. We expect to be the first U.S. company to launch mobile 5G service by the end of this year and our fixed 5G trials were also going very well.","We're learning a lot. We're gaining great insights into making this product a very strong commercial offering. And then, last week, the FCC issued an order that cleared the way for us to move forward with our acquisition of FiberTower and the vast majority of its millimeter wave spectrum licenses. It's what required for 5G. So, we get from FiberTower an average of nearly 360 megahertz of nationwide spectrum. And again, millimeter wave is critical for our 5G strategy and we'll be putting this spectrum to work later this year.","In video, we're going to launch our next-generation platform this spring. This platform will add cloud DVR capabilities, it will give us a third stream to DIRECTV NOW, and it will have a lot of further enhancements to the user interface. Now, I've been using this thing recently and I got to tell you, I think our customers are really going to like this. The experience is very good.","And so then before year end, we plan to launch in the next-gen product in a home centric configuration with a very thin hardware client. And just think about it this way, it's a very small, inexpensive streaming device plugged into your TV and then you connect it to any broadband service. There will be a voice controlled user interface with an integrated search feature and will allow you to search across any streaming video service that you subscribe to. So, it can be DIRECTV NOW, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, or even YouTube. It also gives you a premium live video experience in your home with the flexibility and ease-of-use what you would expect out of an OTT service.","We're also ramping up our advertising and analytics business. This was being led by Brian Lesser, who joined us last quarter. I think he's one of the best minds in ad tech. We're really excited about this opportunity because advertisers have made it really clear to us that they're looking for a trusted option in premium video advertising, looking for an alternative to the current digital ad duopoly that can bring advertisers scale and deliver results that are transparent and brand safe.","Once Time Warner closes, we'll be well-positioned to be that alternative. We think the entire industry, advertisers, publishers, and consumers, are more than ready for this alternative. And with Time Warner, we believe we'll have the right data, the right content and the right talent to build an automated advertising platform that can transform premium video and TV advertising.","2018, we're also going to be focused further on Mexico. Our business there is going to continue to scale. We continue to move towards profitability. We have great momentum in the market; nearly doubling our subscriber base in the last two plus years and our LTE build in Mexico is almost complete.","And then, finally, our industry-leading cost structure is proving to be a significant competitive advantage. We obsess over delivering the lowest cost per megabyte in the world and we still have a lot of room to grow. So, that's kind of a synopsis of what we'll be focused on in 2018.","What I'm going to do now is hand it off to John to give you a report on the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2018. So, John?","John Stephens","Thanks Randall and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me begin with our financial summary, which is on slide seven. The positive impact of tax reform led to some significant changes in both our reported fourth quarter and annual results. This impacted our balance sheet and fourth quarter earnings. It also led to us making some important decisions that impacted our fourth quarter cash flows. We'll walk through these impacts as we discuss the results.","Revenues were essentially flat year-over-year as a strong quarter in wireless equipment and in our international operations mostly offset declines in legacy, wireless and video services.","Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the quarter were down year-over-year due to healthy increases in wireless sales and expenses from our Entertainment group, offsetting those solid growth in our international operations. And for the full year, operating margins were up 40 basis points.","In the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.78, including a $0.13 positive impact from tax reform. Essentially, our ability to fully expense capital spending in the fourth quarter generated most of this benefit.","Remember, tax reform expensing provisions were effective retroactively to September 27th, 2017. We also made a number of other decisions with regard to with tax reform in mind including the $200 million in bonus payments to our frontline employees, an $800 million funding of our employee and retiree medical trust, nearly $100 million funding of our AT&T charitable foundation, and a number of other steps.","Adjustments for the fourth quarter include these special items; a $20 billion gain from our preliminary estimate of net deferred tax liability reductions generated by the new tax law, asset write-offs in our [Indiscernible] plant as our consumer fiber footprint continues to expand and we continue to serve new customers with those fiber capabilities, and additional storm and natural disaster impacts. And in the fourth quarter, those are primarily from Puerto Rico. Other adjustments include our annual mark-to-market pension plan re-measurement and merger and integration costs amortizations and some other adjustments.","Free cash flow was up for the quarter and was $17.6 billion for the year, even with the $1 billion of benefit payments made in connection with tax reform. CapEx for the full year also came in on target at just under $22 billion.","Let's now take a look at our operations starting with mobility, where the team turned in outstanding customer growth. Those details are on slide eight. AT&T's domestic mobility operations, as you know, are divided between the Business Solutions and Customer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company's providing supplemental information for its total U.S. Wireless operations and that's what I'll discuss today.","First off, we added 329,000 postpaid phone customers in the quarter, a significant increase on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. Postpaid smartphone net additions were even more at 400,000.","Altogether, we had more than 2.7 million new subscribers with gains in postpaid, prepaid, and connected devices. And looking at the full year, we added more than 2 million of our most valuable branded smarts phone subscribers to our base. One big reason for the success is reduced churn. Postpaid phone churn continues to run at record levels, dropping to 0.89% in the quarter.","Revenues were up in the quarter, thanks to strong smartphone sales. These sales also had an impact on margins. We had a year-over-year increase of 700,000 smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the quarter as our customers kept coming back and getting new phones. Our BOGO offer was also successful and helped drive this volume increase.","This growth impacted margins. But with record low postpaid phone churn, these customers will provide financial benefits years into the future. With these and many other efforts, we expect service revenues to improve throughout the coming year and turn positive for the year.","We take a disciplined approach in building our customer base. We'll continue to be keenly focused on cost management, but also look for efficient opportunities to reinvest in our customers and continue growing.","Now, let's take a look at our Entertainment Group results. Total video customers, IP broadband connections, and bundles all grew. DIRECTV NOW had a tremendous customer growth in its first year of operation. The 368,000 net adds in the fourth quarter gives us nearly 1.2 million customers in service, and we believe the best is yet to come.","As Randall mentioned, we're close to launching our second-generation platform. We're excited about the improved customer experience the platform will bring and the newer opportunities that will come along with it. This will include the cloud-based DVR, an additional video stream to the two we offer today, and a more robust video-on-demand experience.","You're also seeing us turn the corner with our Broadband business. IP broadband gains continue to be robust even as the conversion of DSL customers to IP slows the consumer DSL customer base dropped below 1 million.","We added nearly 600, 000 IP broadband customers during 2017. Broadband penetration rate in our fiber footprint, where we have marketed our fiber service more than 24 months, are nearing 50%. Last year alone, we doubled the number of IP broadband subscribers in our fiber footprint.","A big part of our subscriber success can be attributed to the integrated offers that we have. We continue to increase the number of bundled customers. The number of households, who take both video and wireless, increased by 160,000 in the quarter or about 700,000 more wireless customers who bundle with the video. That's significant because the churn rate of our DIRECTV customers who have our wireless service is nearly half that of standalone satellite subscribers.","At the same time, we continue to work through the ongoing transition of the pay-TV industry. This transition pressures revenues and margins. We will manage this transition as we have managed other transitions over the year, but expect the pressure to continue throughout 2018.","Now, let's look at Business Solutions results on slide nine. Wireless drove growth in our Business Solutions segment, but we also saw sequential improvement in our Wireline revenue trends. Wireless revenues were up 6% on the strength of smartphone sales, while service revenues were essentially flat. Wireline revenues were down 3.5% year-over-year, an improvement over previous quarters and up nearly 1% sequentially.","We now have 1.8 million business customer locations connected with fiber. That means more sales opportunities for the team. We also expect increased business activity following the passage of tax reform.","Margins felt the impact of increased smartphone sales, but Wireline margins were up significantly to 37. 8%, something like 270 basis point increase, as we continue to drive hard on cost-management initiatives.","A big part of these cost savings come from our move to a virtualized network. More than 55% of our network functions were virtualized by the end of 2017 and there's still more opportunity as we drive towards our goal of 75% of these functions virtualized by 2020.","Our International business also turned in another strong quarter. Those results are on the bottom of slide nine. We had growth across our operations. Revenues were up 16% as both DIRECTV, Latin America, and Mexico showed strong revenue and subscriber gains. EBITDA also was up significantly, thanks to strength in Latin America and improvement in Mexico.","Subscriber growth continues to be strong in Mexico. The 1.3 million net adds in the quarter pushed our full year growth to more than 3 million and our total subscriber base to more than 15 million.","And our Latin American satellite operations added 139,000 customers, thanks to the strength in their prepaid products. The business continues to be profitable and generate positive free cash flow.","Our business units turned in a great fourth quarter, but we also have done an excellent job managing our balance sheet during the quarter. Those highlights are on slide 10. We take pride in the disciplined management of our balance sheet. We see it as a competitive advantage and value generator for our shareholders. It's the foundation our company is built on and gives us the strength and flexibility we need to invest and to grow. That foundation became even stronger in 2017, thanks to tax reforms and thoughtful measures we undertook.","First, we de-risked the existing debt portfolio by extending maturities, primarily beyond 10 years as we prepare to close the Time Warner deal. And we did it cost effectively without significantly increasing our interest rates. Our weighted average maturity is now 14.5 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. And we diversified our portfolio with about a quarter of the debt denominated in foreign currency. This gives us ample near-term liquidity to meet the demands on the business and provide solid, long-term returns to our shareholders.","Second, our terrific cash flow generation enabled us to invest in growth, improve leverage ratios, and improve dividend coverage with a payout ratio of 68% in 2017. And with the passage of tax reform, we see a significant boost to our balance sheet, reducing $20 billion of liabilities and increasing shareholder equity by a like amount. This reform significantly improves our net debt to equity ratios as well as free cash flow and dividend coverage in future years.","We also are in excellent shape with our pension plan. Our pension plan assets returned over 14% for the year, and we are nearly fully funded with no significant cash contributions required for at least five years. This is the case even with a historically low discount rate.","If you apply the average five-year discount rate to our plan, it is essentially fully funded and at the average 10-year rate, it's actually overfunded. Coming from a strong position, we plan to increase our investment allocation to fixed income assets and lower our expected return on pension assets down to 7% from the current 7.75 assumption.","All these measures have a profound impact on our financial position and I would expect the rating agencies will take notice and begin updating their models. It certainly has changed our outlook on capital budgeting, improving the returns of a whole range of products.","As promised, we'll increase 2018 capital investments by $1 billion with tax reform. Even with that, we expect significant free cash flow growth in 2018 and going forward with our dividend payout ratio improving into the high 50% range this year. And we're committed to deleveraging after Time Warner closes with plans to return to historic levels by the end of 2020, if not before.","Our management team has worked hard to build and maintain a strong balance sheet. We also know the job is never done. But 2018 brings tax reform, FirstNet and a new accounting standard that will affect our financial results.","Let's talk about 2018 on slide 11. First, let's look at immediate impacts of changes in the tax law. Tax reform provides immediate benefits and its allowing the additional $1 billion in incremental investment in 2018, much of that targeted for fiber deployment.","The lower tax rate is also expected to increase operating cash flow by about $3 billion this year compared to pretax reform expectations. We're also confident that as other businesses increase investments, there will be a potential uplift in demand for our services. We can't predict exactly when, so we didn't assume a significant increase in GDP trends in our guidance, but we are optimistic that it'll come and we'll be watching this closely. We expect our 2018 effective tax rate will be in a 23% range. The full year's impact of tax reform is expected to be about $0.45 of EPS health.","FirstNet will have an impact on our 2018 financials. We plan to move quickly with the build-out and the timing of FirstNet reimbursements could impact our 2018 free cash flow.","For example, we may have FirstNet-related expenditures this year that aren't reimbursed until 2019. We planned in net FirstNet reimbursements against the capital and operating expenditures to which they relate, so there'll be no revenue impact.","We estimate that 80% of the reimbursements will offset capital expenditures with 20% offsetting operating expenses. We expect to expense sustainability payments as paid, net of any recoveries for FirstNet approved projects. We will see a $0.05 per share expense impacts from our sustainability payments and other operating expenses from our build-out in FirstNet operations.","Additionally, we will see a $0.05 a share expense impact from increased interest expense in 2018. This comes from placing our AWS and WCS spectrum in service and no longer capitalizing the carrying cost related to owning in that spectrum. And we'll see a $0.04 a share expense increased from the lower expected return on pension assets that we previously discussed. In 2018, we will see a $0.06 a share benefit from reduced depreciation expense that we generated by the copper abandonment that we recorded in the fourth quarter 2017.","And finally, the new revenue recognition accounting standard will have a positive impact on our near-term financials. Several items will be impacted, but the biggest of these are deferral pearl of commission expenses, which will increase profits in 2018; re-characterization of some service to equipment revenues for equipment that was provided with multiyear service contracts. This was expected to have an impact on Service revenues, but not a material impact on total revenues or on profitability; and a netting of universal service and other regulatory fees against the related expense. This is expected to significantly reduce both revenues and expense, but have little impact on profits.","We still have work to do on revenue recognition, but our initial estimate is $0.10 to $0.15 per share of positive EPS impact in 2018. Our results will differ from others because of our extensive Next program as well as our adoption of deferred installment accounting contemporaneous with our 2015 acquisition of DTV. Look for more detail disclosures in the near future.","The impacts of tax reform, FirstNet, copper plan abandonment, and rev rack are reflected in our 2018 outlook, and the details on our outlook are on slide 12. On a standalone basis, excluding Time Warner, we expect adjusted EPS in the $3.50 range as I said, inclusive of the items previously discussed.","We also expect organic growth in the low single-digits, driven by continued profitability improvement in Mexico, Wireless service revenues growing in the second half of the year, cost structure benefits from virtualization and automation, and those offset by continued transformation of our video, business, and legacy services.","Free cash flow growth will be strong. We're expecting about $21 billion of free cash flow for the full year, which approximates our expected adjusted net income. And we expect capital spending to approach $25 billion or about $23 billion net of expected FirstNet reimbursements. That includes the $1 billion of incremental tax reform investment. That's it in a nutshell. We ended the year with an exclamation point, thanks to customer growth, tax reform and FirstNet. And we're very excited about the year ahead.","With that, Mike, I will turn it back to you for Q&A.","Michael Viola","Thanks, John. Tony, we are ready for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","We'll take our first question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip Cusick","John that was a big nutshell.","John Stephens","Thank you.","Philip Cusick","So, if I can one for John and one for Randall. First, John, have you talked to the rating agencies about what the appropriate long-term leverage target looks like given the lower tax rate?","And then, Randall, sort of following up on things that John said, and I know it's early, but what have you seen from customers in terms of investing in their telecom services post tax reform, probably more conversation so far than orders. But how can that impact AT&T trends going forward? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","So, Phil thanks for that. And one clarification, Mike is here with me, I want to make sure I said this right. We expect to get to more traditional historic levels by 2022 or earlier. And I apologize if I said 2020. The correct number is 2022, which is consistent with the advice we've been giving every time we talk about the deal.","Philip Cusick","Makes a little more sense.","Randall Stephenson","Phil, we have been in discussions with the rating agencies, but we don't -- we haven't come to any conclusions. We are still in a give and take in that process and we'll continue that. I will -- so, I expect that this will impact their models. I also understand that they are also waiting for us to close the Time Warner deal and to update their models with the new Time Warner information. So, no answer yet, working on it, and we look forward to kind of continue those conversations with the rating agencies.","Philip Cusick","Thanks.","John Stephens","Yes, Phil, on the capital spending and investment that you said specifically in telecom. We track with this gross fixed investment. If you look at business, gross fixed investment anywhere in the world, our services tend to track with that.","Fourth quarter was like a number we hadn't seen in quite some time, gross fixed investment; I think it was over 6%. It was a very, very strong number. Around here, how do high-fives when we see those kind of numbers, because that's usually an indication of general spending, because when businesses spend more capital, they generally hire more people. When they hire more people, they spend more capital. And so, specifically, you'll see businesses adding people, and those people have to have computers, they have to have machinery, they have to have broadband connections, they have to have mobile services, they have to have data connectivity. And so that is a metric we watch closely.","The anecdotal evidence, and it's purely anecdotal other than the gross fixed investment, is strong. People are talking about investing more. You've seen announcement after announcement, company saying they're intending to invest more capital as a result of tax reform and so that is our expectation. I think history is a very good indicator of this and when you talk about when you see Apple talking about investing in more facilities and manufacturing in the United States, for a company like AT&T and anybody in our sector, that's a good thing.","So, we have pretty good expectations at the B2B side of our house, our enterprise business side could catch some tailwinds. We don't have that build in the guidance we've given you because it's just too early right now. But I'm very optimistic that we're going to overachieve most economic assessments of 2018. You're finally starting to some economists get out there and very bravely just talk about 2.7% growth; I think that is very low. And if we don't have a three hand on economic growth this year, I'll be sorely disappointed and surprised.","Philip Cusick","Correct. Thanks Randall.","Randall Stephenson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much and good afternoon Randall, John, and Mike.","Randall Stephenson","Hi Amir.","John Stephens","Hey Amir.","Michael Viola","Hey Amir.","Amir Rozwadowski","I wanted to touch base a bit on the video industry at this point. How do you think about the status of the linear video market? It does seem as though one of your competitors seems to be taking a more selective or focused approach in terms of their subscribers. How should we think about your go-to-market strategy for that business going forward?","And then, John, you had mentioned there are some ongoing pressures through this transition. How do you think about the margin profile of that business going forward? Clearly, you folks are investing in some of these next generation products. Given that those are still subscale, but growing but in investment mode for now, how should we think about the progression of returns of that business going forward?","Randall Stephenson","Okay, Amir, I'll go first. I'll talk a bit about the video industry and how we think about it. But since the day we bought DIRECTV, we assume that traditional linear video would be in a declining mode since kind of the nature of it, OTT and the ability to consume video on mobile devices, we believe would be the trend and the way where things went, we wanted to be in the leadership position and facilitating that kind of consumption of premium video on mobile devices. And we have been in the leadership position in that.","We have made an objective to ensure that we can transition. We run these transitions all the time, right? When you have technology transitions or business model transitions whether it's fixed phone service to mobile, whether it's a private line kind of service for business to VPN, whether it's -- you can kind of go down the list of whether it's feature phones to smartphones, we run these transitions and we think we're pretty good at it.","As it relates to video, we are standing up a video product that we are convinced will give us growth in the video platform for the next few years, and that's our DIRECTV NOW. So, as traditional linear declines, DIRECTV NOW, we think can offset that and not only that, but our traditional linear video will be repurposed.","You heard me talk about our next-gen platform that is home centric, a very thin client into the home. That will actually drive cost structure of the traditional video product down so that you could preserve margins in the traditional linear video as you grow in the over-the-top applications and video services. So, we're very bullish on video.","As we look at the numbers, our consumers are consuming more value than they used to, not less. They're consuming it on different devices. They're not just consuming it in their home. They're consuming it on tablets and smartphones, and that's where we want to be. And so we're rather bullish on that, Amir.","John Stephens","Amir, with regard to legacy or the linear TV product, think about it this way. First of all, key strategy is the bundle. When we are bundling with wireless or when we're bundling with broadband, we're seeing significant improvement. We mentioned that we've got another 170,000 homes this quarter that we've got bundled with wireless and 700,000 wireless customers that were bundled with our satellite TV product. That bundling allows us to have profitability from that combined account. It also creates higher value, lifetime value for each of those customers.","When you see us bundling with fiber, what we are seeing is a churn ratio rate that's about half the standalone satellite or video product churn. So, as we expand the fiber to 14 million over the next two years, you'll see us have tremendous opportunities to bundle with video. So, that is great.","In addition, we expect to pick up whatever video losses we have and more than that with DIRECTV NOW, and Randall spoke -- just spoke about the aspects of that, that opportunities to improve the revenues profitabilities and the reach to that.","And the last thing I'll tell you is with where to our satellite product. We're going to continue to serve what you might consider non-urban or non-suburban America, rural America. We're always going to have an ability to do that on a combined basis with our great wireless service and with our satellite TV process -- products such that we can continue to provide those who lives outside the city limits, so to speak, great quality, great choice. That's how we're thinking about the business. But as we've shown over the last two and a half years, that's all based on a relentless obsession with cost management and continuing to improve the cost structure.","And while the advertising opportunities are there for DTV NOW, there clearly also there for our traditional linear TV product. So, those are all the things we're working on. Is it going to be easy? It'll be challenging. But as Randall said, we've been through this time the transition many times before, and we feel up to the task of working through it.","Amir Rozwadowski","Excellent. Thank you very much for the incremental color.","John Stephens","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","BatyaLevi","Hi, this is Batya Levi for John. Two questions. One, just following up on the bundling strategy, can you talk about how bundling has started to improve sub-trends both on the video and voice phone side? And if we can expect that to continue into 2018?","And how will you balance that sub-growth with profitability? Do you expect wireless margins, which were kind of flattish this year, can they start to improve? And the entertainment profitability has been coming down. Can we see a stop at that? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","Yes, so Batya, it's good to hear from you. With regard to bundling on wireless churn, I can't give you a number of basis points, a precision amount of basis points in there. What I can point to is if you look at specifically postpaid phone, which is where the majority are really value-focused bundling is done, we're getting record levels of the low churn. And we attribute at least part of that to the bundling aspect. So, what we're seeing is working. That's the first thing.","Secondly, we're also seeing what was a very high level, 700,000 increase year-over-year in smartphone gross adds and upgrades. It continue to significant level of BYOD devices. So, what we're seeing is with this bundling opportunity, customers are continuing to come back to us that have been with us for a while and your customers are coming to us. That's what resulted, not only the great subscriber gains for the quarter, but in some of that, if you will, impact on cost and margins.","But when you look at the total profitability, we're very pleased with that and when you look at the churn impacts of that for years to come, you can understand why we make that lifetime value investment. So, that's how we're seeing that.","With regard to the video products, we're seeing a similar -- once again I can't point directly as a measurement for basis points. But as I mentioned specifically with fiber, it's cut in half on the bundling. But on Wireless, we're also seeing lowered churn. So, that's been, if you will, very helpful to the overall business.","But then when you put those multiple products together and it's not only the reduction service cost with the right to building and administration and so on and so forth, but it's also with that total customers and the ability to track all their services, we do see a long-term past-due greater value creation. That's how we're thinking about that bundling strategy, not on a day-to-day basis, but when you look at these, for example, going to turn on that longer term basis. Churn at these levels is implying 100-month and more lives for these smartphones, tremendous, tremendous opportunities. So, that's what we're looking towards.","Lastly, we're going to be able to continue to cut cost. And as we continue to cut cost through virtualization and automization [ph], we're going to be able to continue to maintain.","We have been on our path for the last four quarters of setting records in Wireless service margins and we chose this quarter to reinvest in our customer base. When you got churn at those sub-90 basis point levels, it seems like the right thing to do. And with tax reform and the other things that are going on in our business, we feel very comfortable that it is the right thing to do.","John Stephens","So, what I'd add to that, Batya, that there's probably no more powerful driver of margins in our industry than low churn. So, you think about what drives low churn. There are two big drivers. Customer SAT is the number one driver of lower churn. But the second is multiproduct bundles with our customers, the more relationships they have with this on different products, the more powerful the driver of churn is. And so that's why we relentless focus on both of these. But the multiproduct services are the second biggest driver of churn improvement that we have.","BatyaLevi","Okay. Thank you.","Randall Stephenson","Thank you, Batya. We look forward to you being on future calls also.","John Stephens","Did you fire John?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David Barden","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions.","Randall Stephenson","Hi David.","David Barden","Appreciate it. I guess I'm that guy this quarter again. So, John, just doing the math on kind of that long series of EPS adjustments kind of taking out the hurts and putting back the helps, it kind of gets to kind of low single-digit EPS growth $2.98 to $3.03 from the $2.92 of this year. And we're looking at--","John Stephens","Let me answer to this. Low single-digits, if you want to pick 1%, 2% or 3%, I'll let you do that and $0.08 of those items that I talked about. When you add them altogether, those items are total about $0.08 of net pressure. That's depreciation, the other three were $0.14 a pressure, net $0.08 of pressure that we're observing. So, just to be straightforward with that.","David Barden","Okay, good. Thanks. But on a net basis, still seems to suggest like something is still moderating from 2017. I think we saw about $1 billion of EBITDA pressure in 2017. And I was wondering if you can kind of talk about into 2018 kind of how that EBITDA versus non-EBITDA below the line stuff is getting you to that EPS number.","And then the second piece of it is just I mean last quarter, I asked us about the enterprise flattening out. You said that there was some green shoots emerging in the pricing environment. You've actually had a pretty stable enterprise Wireline business for the whole year now. And with the essentially level three merger kind of consolidating the space, is stable the new outlook or are we kind of turning a corner here? Thanks.","John Stephens","Yes, let me with the enterprise business. We did not, as I mentioned in our guidance that our basis for our guidance. We did assume a dramatic shift in the GDP. We certainly expect continued investment, as Randall mentioned. We expect that to turn into orders, we just didn't know when and so we haven't modeled that in.","With regard to the most recent activity, we did there were some management actions, the team took we saw some improvement in our trends on our legacy revenues and some continued positive growth on our strategic services. If that continues and we can continue to pressure that through the year along with some tax reform initiated demand, there's an opportunity for us to do better than what we've modeled, better than what we've given in the guidance. So, we are hopeful and we're watching and we're going to be careful with that.","With regard to the items, David, with regard to 2018 and the operational side, improvements in Mexico, continued strong performance in Latin America, we'll continue to see some pressure from legacy revenues like wireline voice and then some early challenges with wireless service as we lap the first year of unlimited and then a movement towards voice service revenue improvement in growth. Those are the things that are going on in the business.","One thing I will point out. Remember, about $0.05 of the pressure for next year is going to be an interest expense. That's a below the line item. That's from -- no longer capitalizing the interest expense regarding the spectrum we're going to put to service with the FirstNet. That was part of that $0.08 that I was talking about.","So, while we're not giving specific guidance on margins, or on EBITDA levels, I want to make sure I give you is much color as I should to your question.","David Barden","Thanks John. And just the kind of takeaway, is the EBITDA, kind of, trajectory still pretty much in the same ZIP Code or are we seeing that improve, and that's kind of helping that EPS story?","John Stephens","Yes, I'll just say it this way, you have to have good solid performance in the business to overcome those pressures and to still come in that mid-single-digits -- or excuse me, come into low single-digits EPS growth. You have to have strong performance in the business. And the biggest item that is on that EBITDA -- two big items that we talked about. One, depreciation, which we've laid out and then two is the interest expense. Those go in large margin to offset each other.","David Barden","Great. All right. Thanks John.","Randall Stephenson","David, I'm probably on the optimistic side of business spending, as you heard my answer to Phil's question. But as you just kind of look at fourth quarter up and down the business segment, it just -- wasn't just concentrated in one area, it was multinationals all the way down to small business. We're just showing signs of improvement. And so I find myself getting somewhat optimistic. The business spending is really going to accelerate as we work through 2018.","David Barden","From your mouth, Randall. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thanks. Good evening. Randall, you touched a little bit on 5G and you put out a couple of press releases this year. It was obviously in the news the last couple of days. Can you just talk about where you are, what you've learned from the trial so far, and what should we be looking to you and AT&T for 2018 in 5G? What are the used cases that will get you most excited?","And then, John, just coming back to the ASC 606, the $0.10 to $0.15, I think Verizon had said that by 2020, that would sort of wind down to kind of a neutral impact. Is that the same math for you? Thanks.","John Stephens","Randall let me think the ASC 606 first. Yes, over a period of years, it will balance out as the contracts lap each other. So, yes, that's the kind of thought. And as I mentioned, the other item is with us and compares us to others, we didn't adopt deferred installment accounting that coming lease in the cable industry, we adopted and that with the DIRECTV merger. So, a lot of the items along with our next accounting that we've already been using will, to some people, give an impression that our numbers are not as much as they otherwise might have expected. Randall?","Randall Stephenson","On 5G, Simon, the used case I get most excited about is the opportunity to have nearly, a nationwide broadband footprint and it could be a fixed line replacement. The capacity is there, the performance is there, there's going to be full gigabit throughput. And so I get very energized on the opportunity over the next few years to actually build out a nationwide capability for broadband for both business as well as consumer.","And so those are the ones, by the way, that from the technology is probably the easiest to scale and so forth. But as you begin to think about mobile solutions, we will be deploying mobile solutions in 2018 and it's going to be in 12 markets, that's what we've been doing. Think of this as a puck. Because, really, the thing is going to cause 5G to go slow more than anything else, it's just availability of handsets.","We're getting the equipment manufacturing moving, we're getting the supply chains moving, we're doing the sell-side acquisition, we're doing all the build type work, but getting the handsets at scale penetrated into the market will slow things down. So, that's why we're going to be pucks in the first part of our deployment in these 12 market, so it is a mobile solution. But it's not going to be a handset. There's not going to be that many handsets available. We'll be pushing the vendors to make that happen faster. But we know how long these things take and how long it takes them to penetrate the market.","As you think about other applications, the easy ones of that we all talk about is autonomous cars. And in fact, I just don't think those used cases work without 5G technology. It's all about low latency. People say 5G and you're thinking about speed. And speed and throughput is important. But the most important element is latency and having low latency 5G is the first technological innovation that truly gets us to low latency.","And as we think about a distributing cloud environment, we think we're in a unique place to begin distributing the cloud capability into our infrastructure. Think of all the nodes, all the access points that we have in our network distributing cloud at that level, we can take latency to a lower level than we think, virtually anybody else, but it will be a competition, it will be a race and we'll see who gets there first.","But the latency is exciting. The latency is also critical for as you think about super IoT, connected devices, and connecting everything. It's going to be important for virtual reality and augmented reality applications. So, we're taking this, to your point, used case-by-used case and that is what's determining our deployment and our build plans, our used cases and it's centered around predominantly these areas that I just articulated to you.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thanks a lot.","Randall Stephenson","Thank you, Simon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Amy Yong","Thanks. And following up on the Entertainment Group, you exited 4Q with really solid video trends. Do you still think you can grow a video pie and maybe perhaps, outpace the traditional pay-TV environment?","And I think, previously you've updated us on the mix of DIRECTV NOW subscribers, can you give us the mix of cord cutters and where they are coming from, that will be helpful? Thank you.","Randall Stephenson","So, a couple of things. We would expect to continue grow video customers with our DIRECTV NOW outpacing our linear customer counts in the sense of net additions. So, we do expect that.","Secondly, I would suggest to you that the mix hasn't changed much. We're still getting around 50% of them from cord nevers and around 50% of cord cutters or cord shavers.","Secondly, we are getting a disproportionate amount of those customers being multiple dwelling units, millennials, and others -- specifically those two groups and we're excited about that. So, as we move through the process we'll continue.","We still haven't seen a dramatic uptick in customers that are shifting from our full value product to the DTV NOW, but we continue to watch that carefully and continue to come up with different ways to make sure we can prove that and track that. But in kind of total video customer base, we do believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow just like we did in the fourth quarter.","John Stephens","Exactly our plan, Amy. We'll grow our TV customer base is the expectation. And as we continue to mature the DIRECTV NOW platform, we think we can actually do better. The new DIRECTV NOW platform has a lot more functionality. So, once you get cloud-based DVRs and you can put a third stream, now all of a sudden, you're entering a new marketplace with those as well and getting new functionality, we think we get higher penetration. So, we're actually very bullish on DIRECTV NOW. We think convinced economics will continue to improve as we move over the next couple of years.","Amy Yong","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question that will come from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matthew Niknam","Hey guys thank you for taking the question. One on capital allocation, I just -- with the significant cash savings you're laying off from tax reform, are there any areas of the business you're looking to potentially accelerate investment in beyond fiber? And on the fiber topic, does this change at all how you think about that 14 million fiber homes past target beyond mid-2019? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","Yes, I get it. Look tax reform changes everything as it relates to capital allocation, Matthew and if I understand that as well as anybody. But when you're suddenly looking at your after-tax returns improving by 20% roughly, it just changes how you think about your investment thesis. It changes the profitability equation on fiber as well as 5G and how you think about rural and how you think about FirstNet. And so it gives us the ability to consider starting to push our fiber deployments faster and further.","And it's early. It's hard to say what it will mean as you own a media and entertainment company. But how does it affect the decision-making as it relates to investment in premium content, as it relates to direct-to-consumer distribution and how fast you go in those regards.","So it's -- we've been planning for this for quite some time. But now that it's here and it's real, we're going through, we're digging in, and ask what are these projects that we want to be investing in and these initiatives we want to be investing in that could continue to drive growth over the next five or six years and let's take advantage of it.","John Stephens","Now, we are expecting more money on fiber to accelerate the process and achieve our goals and then we'll have the opportunity to look to expand.","Secondly, we are, if you will, excited about and I think the team is working very, very hard to achieve the FirstNet goals and even exceeding the goals set out by the FirstNet authority. That's a really positive thing for us. And while we were interested in doing that for some time, tax reform and the cash generate, the cash savings aspect that provide us that opportunity -- flexibility to go after that even more. So, those are two areas where I think you'll really see us utilize the benefits of the new tax laws.","Matthew Niknam","Thanks Randall, thanks John.","Randall Stephenson","You bet.","Michael Viola","Hey Tony, this is Michael; we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you, sir. That will come from Scott Goldman with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Scott Goldman","Hey guys, good afternoon. And thanks for fitting me in. Maybe Randall, if you can just talk a little bit about the wireless competitive environment. Obviously, still very competitive, but it seems like we've been operating in a pretty -- in a more rational environment of late, and that's driven some better results in fourth quarter. Just wondering how you think about, overall, what you're embedding in your outlook in terms of the competition in 2018?","And maybe just a quick one follow-up with John on that same question. How do you think about the puts and takes on ARPU based on the expectations for competition in 2018? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","My outlook for wireless competition is that it will continue to be intensely competitive and we don't see that changing. How people are competing has changed somewhat and how we're competing is changing quite a bit. I'm not going to go into a lot of details because we made some moves in the fourth quarter and you're going to see those continue into the first, second, and third quarter. We think are going to be very effective and has been very effective in the marketplace. But I'll call it smarter competitions, smarter way in approaching our customer base and in accessing new customers. We believe very strongly that combining video with our mobile product is a really important element.","And you will see us continue to do that. But actually, probably take it to new and different levels because it's proving so powerful on churn. We're also getting to place we've learned enough that is becoming very powerful as it relates to customer acquisition.","And so combining video with wireless is a really important driver and you've seen some of the industry begin to make moves to mimic that, which is usually an indication that you're having success and so you'll see more and more of that. But it'll remain competitive, but we feel really good about how we're set up, what we're doing in the marketplace and that we'll continue to even take that a step further as we move through 2018.","John Stephens","Scott, on the ARPU side, let me first make sure we're clear with regard to rev rack and the adoption of it and it's an unusual accounting change and then it's a flash cut. So, couple of the changes include regulatory fees, USF [ph] which we can't a service revenue today. And then also, in the expense line, they'll be netted. So, ARPU will come because we're pulling back out.","Secondly, there will be some of the service revenue that's called service revenue today we'll get allocated to equipment revenues in the future for that small number of situations where we still subsidize equipment.","Once you take that into account, you will have comparable ARPU and I just want to make sure everybody knows that. With regard to the opportunities for ARPU, I think about it in a total profitability situation, not just in an ARPU situation. So, we certainly are looking to do as strong as we can on ARPU and as many services.","But as Randall said at the beginning, we're relentless on this lowest cost per megabit provider. And as we get to that, we can be very successful with things like prepaid or other alternative levels of ARPU.","My only point is that though we bundle with regard to video and broadband wireless together and we get great ARPUs from those, there will be situations where we will look to accept lower ARPUs like in prepaid.","And because of the very low cost structure, because of the billing, or general administrative cost, because of opportunities to maybe get that analytics value out of it, we'll be able to still be profitable, or we'll be able to expand the base of customers and be able to make more total profit that way.","So, that's one of the reasons why we're not giving EBITDA margin guidance, is because we want to focus on this total cash, total profitability position. So, our ARPUs will continue to be measured relentlessly and we'll continue to analyze of them in the same way. I want you to understand that we're really focused of that total service revenue growth, total revenue growth, total profitability as opposed to just any one aspect.","Scott Goldman","Understood. Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","Very good. Thank you, Scott. And listen, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. 2017 was a truly unique year for American business, U.S. business. And I think 2018 is going to prove to be a really good year for the realization of the implications of what was done in 2017. And I think the consumer is going to be better off, I think wages are going to be higher as businesses invest more. And as a result, AT&T being a very U.S. centric company, we think we're going to have a good year ahead of us as well. So, again, thank you for joining us and look forward to talking to you next time.","Operator","Thank you very much. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"2400":["AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 23, 2013  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Susan Johnson - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","John Stephens - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Executive Vice President","Analysts","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","John Hodulik - UBS","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Joe Mastrogiovanni - Credit Suisse","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank","Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to AT&T's third quarter earnings release 2013 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). Also as a reminder, this teleconference is being recorded.","And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Susan Johnson. Please go ahead.","Susan Johnson","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. It's great to have you with us today. I am Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John will provide an update with perspective on the quarter, then we will follow with Q&A.","Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website at www.att.com\/investor.relations. I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on slide two. This presentation and comments may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks. Results may differ materially. Details are on our SEC filings and on AT&T's website.","Before I turn the call over to John, let me cover our consolidated financial summary which is on slide three. Consolidated revenue was $32.2 billion, up 2.2% driven by continued wireless growth, impressive U-verse gains and rapid growth in strategic business services. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.72. That's up more than 14% over last year's third quarter. This includes $0.03 from the previously disclosed transfer of spectrum and $0.03 from income tax items. When you exclude these items, earnings per share was $0.66, an increase of almost 6.5% year-over-year.","Cash flow continues to be strong. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled $9.2 billion and free cash flow was $3.2 billion and more than $11 billion, year-to-date. Also in the third quarter, we bought back about 55 million shares for $1.9 billion and year-to-date, we have returned more than $18 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.","With that overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?","John Stephens","Thank you, Susan, and good afternoon, everyone, and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Let me start with an overview on slide four. There is a lot we really like about the quarter. we grew revenues and EPS and cash generation continues to be robust.","But when you look at what's driving the business, the one thing that stands out is Project Velocity IP or Project VIP. As you recall, we announced this plan just about a year ago. We said we would invest aggressively to expand our 4G LTE footprint, that we would expand U-verse broadband reach and that we take fiber connectivity to a million new business locations. Thanks to the great work of our network organization, we have made terrific progress on all of these fronts, including having the nation's fastest and most reliable 4G LTE network. And you can see the positive results in our third results.","Our total Wireless subscribers increased by nearly 1 million and our mobile data revenues grew nearly 18%. Revenues from our strategic business services, including VPN, Ethernet, hosting and other advanced IP services posted strong growth of nearly 16%, and the one thing that has been the most excited is the outstanding performance and future potential of U-verse, we reach 10 million total U-verse subscribers this quarter. Thanks to our best TV net gain in nearly five years and a record third quarter broadband sales. That's quite an achievement in this tough economy.","This helped drive our first $1 billion U-verse revenue month ever and that's growing at 28% year-over-year. This has been an incredible seven years since we first introduced the service, but project VIP has allowed us to take this platform to a whole new level and we are obviously excited about the road ahead as we build on the VIP platform to create a network that is increasingly software-defined and video-centric.","With that in mind, let me give you a quick update on the progress of project VIP, starting on Slide 5. Our project VIP initiative, focused on expanding the growth platforms of our business. These include expanding our 4G LTE to 300 million POPs by the end of 2014, executing on our spectrum and network quality initiatives, expanding our highly successful U-verse services to 8.5 million new customer locations with high-speed broadband going to 57 million or approximately 75% of our wireline customer locations while also bringing faster speeds and brining fiber to 1 million additional customer locations. We are going to get this done, but at the same time, we are going to move to enhance our spectrum portfolio to meet the massive growth needs of our wireless data business today and into the future.","Un-drawing all of this, we are strengthening our financial structure and our balance sheet to give us the ability to invest and maintain financial flexibility. Even though it hasn't been a full year since we first laid out our plans, we are on track or ahead of schedule with each of these initiatives.","To give you a build update our wireless progress on Slide Six. Our 4G LTE build continues to exceed our original expectations. We now reached nearly 250 million pops. The performance of our network has been outstanding. We have the nation's most reliable 4G LTE network according to our analysis of data from Nielsen, a well-known and leading global information and measurement company.","PC World and PC Magazine also said our speeds are the fastest and RootMetrics, who study national network performance in 125 cities, said overall call, data and text networks ranks first or tied for first in 56 of the 78 cities studied today in the second half of this year. At the same time, we have also made significant progress in our spectrum position.","Last November, we laid out a carefully planned spectrum strategy that would help us meet our mid-term needs, I am pleased to say, we have successfully executed those plans. That includes the purchase of WCS spectrum, 700 megahertz B Block and other recently closed deals and we have already placed into services substantial part of the acquired 700 B Block spectrum. Along with other pending transactions, this gives us a strong runway for our LTE expansion as we look ahead to future SEC auctions to address longer term spectrum needs.","Our U-verse deployment is also well underway. Those details are on Slide 7. We had increased our U-verse broadband customer locations by about 2.5 million this year, with about 1 million of those being video capable. Ultimately, our 8.5 million customer locations will be video enabled.","In the third quarter, we also increased U-verse broadband speeds up to 45 megabits per second. We continue to rollout new markets but we already offer those speeds in every region to almost two-thirds of our U-verse base. And we are moving forward plans for speeds of 75 megabits per second and faster.","We have also begun deployment of 100% fiber broadband network in Austin, Texas that will deliver speeds up to one gigabit per second. So while this will help drive a strong U-verse sales in the third quarter, almost all our gross adds of the third quarter came from non-Project VIP areas. This means that there is even more room for growth. More opportunity as we go forward with our VIP footprint.","On the business side, our fiber build to multitenant buildings now reaches about 200,000 new customer locations. That's well on our way to reach our year-end target and our one million locations target by 2015. We have also made tremendous progress with our financial objectives.","Let's turn to slide eight for those details. We committed to optimize our capital structure while investing aggressively in our networks. I am pleased to report that we are on target across the board. First, we have moved to equalize our pension plan assets and liabilities for essentially fully funded pension plan. The Department of Labor has published a proposed exemption for our voluntary contribution of a preferred equity interest in our wireless business and this, along with an expected increase in discount rates, would move us to essentially fully funded status with our pension plan by the end of this year. We are very proud that we are one of the few companies that still provide a pension benefit and with these moves our employees and retirees can have the confidence in knowing that these benefits are very well funded.","At the same time, we have also taken steps to help manage our healthcare costs, both for employees and retirees and continuing to move toward low-premium, high value consumer driven plans. We have also been focusing on finding efficiencies in financing our debt. And even though our total debt is up, year-over-year, our interest expense this year is down. Our average effective interest rate is down more than 60 basis points per year, while the weighted average time of the majority of our portfolio has basically remained unchanged. We have also been active in monetizing asset which improves our cash position, the recent tower sale adds to our financial strength and adds to the flexibility provided by earlier transactions. These moves help support our A credit rating, the highest credit rating among U.S. based telecom companies and the foundation for all of this, cash flow continues to be strong.","On top of our capital investment, we have continued our share repurchase program. To-date we have bought back 684 million shares with annualized future dividend savings of more than $1.2 billion per year. Combining share buybacks with our dividend, we have already returned more than $18 billion to shareowners this year. More than $40 billion returned since the beginning of 2012 and we are doing this while maintaining a best-in-class credit rating. A significant achievement at a time of increased capital investment. That's a quick update on Project VIP.","Now let's turn to our operational performance, starting with wireless on slide nine. Data revenue continues to drive wireless revenue growth. Data is now at $22 billion annualized revenue stream and it's growing at nearly 18%. It has a lot of runway as customers continue to increase their data bundles. That helped drive 3.7% service revenue growth this quarter. And total wireless revenues were up more than 5% in the quarter.","Postpaid ARPU continues to be industry leading for the 19th consecutive quarter. We saw the total postpaid ARPU growth. That's a record unmatched in the industry and our phone-only ARPU, again, increased by more than 3%. Our phone-only ARPU includes smartphones, but also includes our lower and feature phones and wireless home phones as well, which makes the growth even more impressive.","We also had a very strong net add quarter. Those details are on Slide 10. In fact, we had close to a 1 million total subs. Versus the third quarter a year ago, our postpaid net adds more than doubled. Our 363,000 postpaid gain in this quarter, included 178,000 new smartphone net adds, they are part of our overall 1.2 million new smartphone customers which will I will walk you through on the next slide.","This was accomplished even though we did see some impact from handset supply constraints. We also lead the industry in postpaid tablet gains. Tablets continue to be strong growth opportunity for us, with strong margins and much lower subsidies and the vast majority of tablet added in the quarter were LTE devices.","While we are positive on smartphone net adds, we are seeing some pressure with our more price-sensitive subscribers on low-end 2G feature phones. We continue to be excited about our pending acquisition of Leap Wireless that allow us to better compete in the prepaid space and we are continuing to move forward to an expected first quarter 2014 close.","Speaking of prepaid, it had its best performance in two years. As many of you know, the migration of tablets to postpaid plans has pressured this part of the business and we are still seeing that, but the introduction of LTE-capable go phones and new pricing plans that helps for growth at the higher end of the prepaid space for customers interested in usage-based pricing.","When you add up the acquisitions on top of our organic growth, we added more than 1 million retail postpaid and prepaid subscribers in the quarter. Connected devices are also doing well as more businesses turn to us for productivity, through machine-to-machine solutions.","Reseller revenues increased year-over-year, however resell had a net loss of 285,000 subscribers, primarily due to losses in the low revenue 2G subscriber accounts. We are also seeing solid results in churn. Postpaid churn was down slightly year-over-year and total churn both, sequentially and year-over-year. Both are notable achievements in this noisy competitive environment.","Let's now talk about our smartphone growth, which I mentioned earlier. Details are on Slide 11. We continue to grow our smartphone subscriber base, both from new customers and some current feature phone subscribers upgrading to smartphones, a record 89% of our postpaid phone sales were smartphones and we now have 75% of our postpaid phone base on smartphones. We expect that percentage to keep growing. These are the premium subscribers in our business. They have twice the ARPU of non-smartphone subscribers and much lower churn and the average usage on smartphones is continuing to grow at a rate more than 50% year-over-year.","Smartphone set another third quarter sales record of $6.7 million and we added 1.2 million new smartphone subscribers in the quarter. We also continue to subscribers moving to the usage-based data plans. Overall, 72% of our smartphone base has selected these plans and a growing number are choosing mobile share plans. We added more than 1 million new mobile share accounts for the quarter to reach 5.3 million. These accounts include more than 16 million devices on mobile share keeping us on a pace of about three subscribers per account.","We continue to see strong take rate on high-end data plans for both mobile share and tiered data customers. In the last year, take rates have grown from 9% to 22%. With 58% of the remaining on medium-size data plans. So we have got a strong base but we still have room to grow. We have announced earlier this month that all new customers will now be on mobile share plans. Mobile share plans have already been popular with new customers and we offer several different plans that will best meet their needs.","Now let's take a look at margins on slide 12. Our wireless EBITDA service margin was 42%. That's does not include the impact on the gains from the transfer of spectrum. We sold 600,000 more smartphones in the third quarter than a year ago and we had a third quarter record number of postpaid tablets as well. But even with this growth, our wireless EBITDA service margins expanded 40 basis points year-over-year. Upgrades were far ahead of last year's pace and flat sequentially and our upgrade rate for the quarter was 7.3%. The upgrades continue to solidify our high-value customer base and move them to more efficient LTE phones.","So with a high level of upgrades, we have increased the number of subscribers under contract in the quarter. These subscribers continue to bring long-term value including our higher ARPU, lower churn and strong data growth. And increasing the number of LTE devices on our network is driving greater network efficiency as well as increasing data usage. It is also moving customers offer our 2G network, which eventually will allow us to repurpose that spectrum for other uses. More than 40% of smartphone subscribers are now on 4G LTE devices.","These efficiencies were offset somewhat by costs associated with new product offerings such as Digital Life and expanding our prepaid wireless offerings. We now offer Digital Life in more than 50 markets. Looking ahead, we expect lower year-over-year upgrades in the fourth quarter as we start seeing the benefits from our new 24 month upgrade model. Customers are also responding well to AT&T Next as sales increased through the quarter and we have continued to expand the program to additional channels. The strength of our network has become a real selling factor for our wireless business. We are seeing outstanding speed and reliability performance and greater efficiencies as more and more customers upgrade to LTE devices. Our accelerated Project VIP, LTE build and improved coverage add to this momentum.","Now let me turn to U-verse. And I would simply say, that I don't think there is a better wireline growth story in the industry than U-verse. Turn to slide 13 for those details. Strong revenue growth and record net adds are a compelling combination. And when you add in expansion of our platform to millions of more customer locations, it's pretty easy to see the runway for U-verse is very long. We have several important U-verse milestones in the quarter.","First, we reached 10 million total U-verse subscribers. More than doubling the number we had just two years ago. That includes high-speed broadband subscribers where we added third quarter record 655,000 customers. Almost 60% of our broadband subscribers are now on the U-verse platform. We also had a second-best U-verse TV net adds ever and the most in almost five years, which keep us as the fastest growing pay-TV provider in the country. In fact, we now have more pay-TV subscribers than any other telco. U-verse revenue growth has been just as in process and is the fastest growing part of our business. We had our first $1 billion U-verse revenue mom in the third quarter and this seven-year-old startup is now a $12 billion annualized revenue stream, growing at more than 28%. U-verse now represents 54% of total consumer revenues, which grew 2.4% in the quarter. The record of success gives us even more confidence in project VIP and U-verse build that goes with it.","Now, let's move to wireline business, which you can see on Slide 14. The broad outline for our wireline business trends continue what we have seen in recent quarters. Obviously, there's a challenging economic environment for business services. At the same time, we are seeing growth in productivity services, like advanced data, the cloud and the mobility. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, revenues from strategic business services, were up almost 16% in the quarter and have grown to almost a quarter of business wireline revenue.","Our U-verse broadband is definitely making noise in the small business space with record gains up nearly 100,000 new high speed broadband customers in the third quarter. That's quite an achievement in this tough economy. As our integrated solutions that take advantage of our global network and mobility strengths, we had several key wins recently. For example, GE announced that it will connect its machines through AT&T network and cloud, creating the first highly secure wireless communications network for GE's industrial Internet.","Another recent win Delta Air Lines will put over 19,000 mobile devices in the hands of flight personnel to help personalize the in-flight experience for Delta's passengers. These contracts highlight the importance of mobility and integrated IP network. The majority of our large business customers also purchased wireless services from us. We think the integration of wireless and wireline services for our business customers will be a big advantage going forward.","Now, let's look at consolidated and wireline margins on Slide 15. For the quarter, our reported quarter consolidated operating margin was 19.2%. This includes a 70-basis point benefit from the previously disclosed transfer spectrum. On and adjusted basis, year-over-year margins were down. Margin pressure was largely due to record smartphone sales and expenses related to project VIP investments. We told you a year ago that there would be pressure on wireline margins with project VIP, we are seeing that this quarter, including success-based U-verse customer addition costs and trailing expenses from our capital spending. This pressure was partially offset by growth in consumer revenues, operational improvements in network sales and support functions and a solid execution of cost initiatives.","Now, let's move to cash flow. Summary is on Slide 16. In the first nine months of the year, cash from operations totaled $26.9 billion, capital expenditures were $15.8 billion as project VIP investing rose and free cash flow before dividends was more than $11 billion.","In terms of uses of cash, total debt was stable in the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 46.9% and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.76. If you include the cash from the recently announced transaction with Crown Castle, our net debt to EBITDA ratio would drop to around 1.64. We also continue to buy back shares. We repurchased about 55 million shares in the quarter for just under $2 billion with our dividend. This makes our total return to shareholders year-to-date of more than $18 billion, more than $40 billion since the beginning of 2012.","We continue to look for opportunities to improve our business. We are working with regulators on our proposed acquisition Leap Wireless, and we continue to expect that deal will close in the first quarter of 2014, and we expect to close our recently announced tower transaction before the end of the year.","As I mentioned earlier, keep a strong financial foundation is a priority for us. Our balance sheet is sound, our debt metrics are solid and our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives while returning substantial value to shareowners.","Now before we take questions, let me close with a quick recap of the highlights for the quarter. Those are on slide 17. Project VIP network initiatives continue to move ahead of schedule. Revenue growth was solid.","Consolidated wireless and consumer wireline. Consolidated wireless margins were stable. Even with pressure from strong smartphone sales and Project VIP expenses. And EPS continues to grow. A solid wireless quarter was complimented by a tremendous performance by U-verse. And when you add in strong strategic business service results, our confidence in Project VIP growth platforms gets even stronger. Looking forward to finishing the year strong and building momentum as we move ahead.","With that, Susan, let's go ahead and take some questions.","Susan Johnson","Thank you, John. Tony, I think we are now ready to open it up for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question in queue will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Hi, guys. Thanks. John, I guess the first question is, how do you think about using the tower proceeds? And the 1.64 you just mentioned, is that the way the rating agencies looks at it, given the shifting obligations?","John Stephens","That's good question, Phil. First of all, I think the rating agencies will take into account the lease commitment and we are working through that with them for the stated first lease plus some level of renewals. We are going through that process now. Don't have a certain number for how much they will but I would expect it somewhere in the 10 to 15 year range of lease payments is what it seems to be approaching, which is certainly less than half of the total proceeds. I know those are real general numbers but you are right, they will take some of that into account. That's the first question.","The second question is, with regard to what are we going to with the proceeds. I don't have a specific answer for you on that. We are going to follow the same pattern we have had before. One, keep the dividends strong. Two, keep investing money in our networks to grow the business and to transform the business. Three, keep financial flexibility. We have been able to do all that before we got these proceeds. So we feel good about that.","The next issue is then, what do you do with the money afterwards? You pay down debt, you buyback shares, do you keep it for additional flexibility? We will go through that evaluation, but I will tell you, we are going to continue to be opportunistic and buyback shares. I think we have shown that over the last year and a half and that hasn't changed. But we will be careful and opportunistic with that.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","And if I may, just one other quick one. What have you seen from the last 30 days in terms of the impact of the government shutdown and business decision making, government decision making and how should we think about that for the fourth quarter?","John Stephens","Phil, it's an interesting question. First and foremost, from directly from the business that we get from the government, I wouldn't suggest you that it's a significant or material amount anyway. There has been some changes. There is so many from usage changes and some adjustments in the amount they are using. So from that perspective, it's not material, not significant in anyway.","From an overall perspective, on just the business environment, the regulatory environment and now the inconsistency or instability of the government environment, I think it affects all businesses and we are seeing that. Our customers are being careful and being prudent and because of that, business investment in general has been slower and as you can see in the employment levels, employment may also be impacted. So I think it is much more of an indirect impact on us than a direct impact.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Got it. Thanks, John.","John Stephens","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Thanks a lot. John, you went through Project VIP in some detail and obviously some add results. Can you help us think through the trajectory of the wireline margin? When do you see the peak dilution from some of this investment? Is this something that we are kind of close to bottoming or is there a few more quarters of pressure. Related to that, CapEx was up significantly. If you would spend the same level in Q4, you would be above your 21. Any sort of changes in the timing there or it a little bit higher than the 21. Thanks.","John Stephens","First and foremost, Simon, with regard to the CapEx spend, we are not trying to limit CapEx spending by a standard compared to last year. We are were trying to smooth it out and get into a normal course, so I think we are on track for the guidance we provided and comfortable with that, but I will tell you that the team that is building our networks is keeping things moving very quickly and we are encouraging that activity in the sense that if they can build it, we are going to be supportive of it. We think that's really good for the customer and services and the company as a whole, but I do not expect any variance from the guidance we provided previously on CapEx.","Secondly, with regard to margins, I will tell you that way the sales activity has gone and the way the build has gone, I would expect some continuing pressure, because of success-based customer costs and quite frankly trailing expense on the build out of the U-verse base and we are going to have build out the U-verse base certainly well in defense, certainly throughout '14 and into '15 - certainly expected in the '15, so we will see some continuing pressures.","I don't mean to suggest that it would be accelerating in any way, but I don't expect us to get back to our norm, higher level of normal margins for at least another year, but I am more than happy to pay for the success the team is having with regard to the customer additions.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik - UBS","Thanks, guys. John, on the wireless side, I have heard you guys say that that you are seeing pressure on the low end of the postpaid with some subscriber loss there. Is there anyway, one, you could maybe sort of trend that for us how that's been trending or talk about anything you could do to aggressive or maybe even sort of size the exposure there, because I think you guys have mentioned it before and I think that [some focus]. Then related two more major announcement today related to tablets. How are you guys think of that compared to the fiber that is another relatively small change or something there could be more [meaningful].","John Stephens","Let me go to the first question. With regard to the wireless market overall, it continues to be competitive and there continues to be a lot of, as I mentioned in my comments, noise around what's going on. I think the first thing to step back from is to realize that our churn was down year-over-year in total churn on postpaid basis and [churn], so even with all this activity our churn numbers are doing really well. We had expected, we are hopeful to improve on that, but we think the power of our network and the power of our customer service is certainly helping that churn aspect and that's the real measured business.","Secondly, I really want to point out, we are seeing some pressure in feature phones. We are seeing it from quite frankly two perspectives. One is about close to 70% of our feature phone losses come to us as smartphones. If you see in the quarter, we added 1.2 million smartphone customers to our base, but only 180,000 of those were new adds, the rest of them were conversions basically for our existing feature phone base, so that's where the most of them came from, so that's the pressure of the 2G, as a lot of our customers are stepping up and frankly doubling their revenue with us.","Now, there are some customers who are really price-sensitive, who are looking to others and we have come out with new plans both, in mobile share and in the tablet area to addresses those needs and try to give value on a reasonable basis to those customers, so I view this as kind of normal competitive process and with a great network, great customer service, we are going to be able to work through this very quickly.","Lastly, when we get Leap closed in the first quarter, we will have even another avenue, another methodology, another process, really to put in your portfolio and to challenge that low-end side of the business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to start off just by, maybe taking that question another step, John. On the network conversation we are having today, its night and day. You guys have really started to try to take ownership of that most reliable network position in the marketplace. But if you look at the subscriber performance, year-over-year, this year versus two years ago, you aren't really seeing, I think, a commensurate amount of market share that you are able to take from the rest of the marketplace with that ownership position of the most high quality network in the market. Can you kind of address how you want to try to monetize the increased capital investment that you have been making in creating this network in terms of more than just converting existing customers into smartphones but try to make more of it in terms of share gains?","Then I guess, the second question, if I could, just in terms of the Next program. Obviously, getting people to take the Next program is very value accretive to the business, both in terms of the absolute value that these guys pay you and also from an accounting perspective you get better margins from that. Can you talk about what percentage of gross you are seeing that are taking this program? So we can think about how its going to have an impact positively on the fourth quarter? Thanks.","John Stephens","Okay, good question. Let me kind of comment on both the questions, David. First and foremost, I would suggest to you that more than doubling our postpaid phone adds is something that I am impressed by. I understand you are challenging it, but I am very pleased with it, especially at the same time when we are growing the prepaid market with regards to the GoPhone because of the challenges that we have there. When you add that performance to 700,000 connected device adds, we are adding about 1 million customers to the network in the quarter. It is very good. And the reseller customers that we add, as we said, we have low revenue, we still do reseller revenue in the quarter even with the reduction in customers and there are mainly 2G type customers, which quite frankly, as everyone knows, we are in the process of repurposing that spectrum anyway. So it's dealing with a situation we are going to have to deal with over the next few years. So we are, if you will recognize the fact that there has been real improvement, we certainly are striving for further improvement.","When you get into the getting a return on the investments we are making I would suggest you this way, when you look at the total revenue growth of 5%, you really bring that Next issue into the revenue story in the sense of it is real economic revenue we are getting. And so our revenue growth, when you take into account are both service and equipment, it is down to 5% level. But if you look more at just, what you call a service revenue piece of it, David, the story goes like this.","First, we are growing smartphone penetration. So we are getting more people on smartphones. As they do that, they are using more data. That's why our key data growth of nearly 18% is. When you look at that then, we look at what they are buying and they are continuing to buy in high level data usage plans. So we doubled the percentage of customers who are buying, kind of the 10 gig plans over the year. It went from 9% to 22% of that customer base on usage plans.","If you think about that, that is just the start. There is a long way to go to add revenue through existing customers. When we complete the LTE build and we have this video centric network out there on the wireless space, we expect to see continued growth. All of that is just on the existing customer base and then you move forward with things like Digital Life, like the connected car, like the additional prepaid business we will be investing in. We are pretty excited and pretty confident in our ability to get really solid returns out of our investment.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Joe Mastrogiovanni - Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks. John, you mentioned that the competitive environment is getting a little more aggressive. As we look over the next six to 12 months in wireless, how should we think about the balance between subscriber growth and profitability and are you willing to accept some pressure on the margins to maintain or even pick up share if there is an opportunity with the new network quality metrics that you have been showing.","John Stephens","Yes. Good question. We are always interested in growth, but we are always interested in smart growth, the profitable growth. We are not going to do anything to build one stead up at the cost of our shareholders return to investment, but yes, you know, we are going to watch it very carefully.","The biggest change over the next six to nine months we will see I think is the continued build out and completed build out of our 4G LTE network, because that's a big advantage for us. Two, it will be our ability to close the Leap transaction and use that Cricket brand and infrastructure to really take advantage of that marketplace in a different way with different capabilities than we have today and that's what real positive for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks maybe a couple of questions. First, John, in relation to your comments on and you said this a couple of times the best credit rating amongst U.S. telcos. Is that merely sort of statement of where you are now or is that a commitment to maintaining this credit rating in the future?","I guess I am getting the obvious question here, clearly there's an ability to add a lot of leverage. Verizon just proved that out and you have pointed to rather large opportunities for a potential global M&A, so just trying to think that up.","Then secondly on U-verse, as you talk about the speeds, 45 megs and moving higher just how quickly can you sort of cover the footprint with these types of speeds. Has this started to change that market share momentum in those markets at all?","John Stephens","Great. Jason, let me take the second one first. On the 45-megs Verizon although reaching today two-thirds of the footprint today and we are already seeing - it's still early with the 45 megs, but just with the U-verse platform, we are already seeing significant changes improvements in churn and in customer retention capabilities. It's what is fueling the decision to invest not only in the capital, but also in the success based expenses of converting these customers to this U-verse platform, so we are already seeing that today. We expect that with the 45-meg speeds become standard and as we move even towards 75 or higher speeds, we think that just improves our opportunity. They would be sticky to lower churn and to retaining the customers.","We are also seeing some good ARPU activity in the overall Broadband segment. That also gives us confidence, so direct question of 45-megs, two-thirds of our customers have that capability receiving today in footprint. We are ramping that up and we are moving forward to go towards 75. It's early to say a specific tied into the 45 megs, but what we have seen with the U-verse platform in total has been really positive.","With regard to the credit metrics, quite frankly, having the best credit rating and having a solid A just the facts of where we are today. We are very proud of that, we have committed back last week or last year where we did the VIP announcement that are going to strive to stay in a single A rating, we have done that and we have done that while we are paying great dividends, while we are buying back shares or making capital improvements, so it's worthy a note that we, if you will, did what we said we are going to do and we continue to hold those ratings and continue to have a lot of flexibility.","With regard to any transactions, I have got now comments. There has been enough written and said about a variety of M&A. There's nothing new to add there. No comment with regard to any of that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment. Please go ahead.","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple if I could. First, as you think about the multi-year trajectory for the wireless margins, what would you say the three key things are there to deliver a better margin, especially in the context of the performance that you are looking for this year versus last year where the change maybe was a little bit more muted than maybe what the anticipation was at the beginning of the year?","Just secondly, could you talk a little bit more about the evidence that you are seeing in terms of more usage from the customers. You mentioned the tiers of rate plans that customers are in terms of high versus mid for data consumption plans. Is the upgrade rate at people going to more data usage driving a meaningful amount of that wireless service revenue growth yet? And is that something that you would expect to continue to get better as we progress each of the next number of quarter? Thanks.","John Stephens","Thanks, Mike. Let me give you four high numbers with regard to your first question as opposed to three. One, continuing the network efficiency that LTE provides and driving that efficiency that LTE provides. As we give our customers LTE devices, as we are sure to get them, we are able to grow more networks, I think will be a real driver of margin expansion. I think as we continue to manage the subsidy side, not only in educating the consumers about what this phones cost, not only getting value from a trade-in process and capturing the economic value of the trade-ins that Next might do, but also getting fair pricing on the equipment side, I think, will drive our margins.","I think the data growth you just talked about is a real driver of revenue growth and it's a driver of revenue that doesn't come with any of the normal billing, administrative, sales costs. It's existing customers buying and getting more value by using more and buying more from us.","Then the last thing is just a real focus, a management of focus on efficiency and a management of focus on streamlining our cost structure. We have had that around here under our One AT&T initiative. So we are going to continue those efforts. Those are the four things from a company perspective that really will drive continued progress in our wireless margins.","On the data growth, we definitely believe there's more opportunity for data growth. If you look at the $5.5 billion quarterly revenue base or about $22 billion annualized revenue stream, it's growing at nearly 18%. That is coming from having this great network experience which enables people to use it more, so they want to use it more. They are getting a better experience. So they are buying up.","As we mentioned, our usage-based plans, only 22% of them have high data buckets today. On mobiles here, that's 10 gig. On individual plans, that's four gigs. But we have seen that more than double over the last year. It was only 9% last year. Now it's 22%. That's a lot of runway to grow. So we feel really good about that. We think as these customers have a good experience, they continue to use it more. They are going to buy more gigs and be happy with it because of the experience. So that's where we see the data growth. I won't get into specifics about how much of the 5.1% growth is related to that or how much of the buy up of that, but we are excited about the opportunity it provides.","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment","Thanks for all those details.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. I am going to stick with the wireless margin theme. You mentioned Next, which you launched during the quarter. You have new upgrade policies that are taking effect now. In light of all that, how should we be sort of sizing the margin trends in wireless into the fourth quarter? Along those lines, what are some of the key inputs? In other words, what's your outlook for things like postpaid upgrade rates or overall smartphone sales within the context of levels that we have seen in the past?","John Stephens","So, Brett, it's a good question and I feel a lot of comments you had will be parts of the answer of the question. First and foremost, we are not giving specific guidance for the fourth quarter on those margins. But we are not changing our overall guidance for the year. We are going to stick by the guidance we gave specifically on wireless margins that we are going to grow margins, year-over-year. So that will give you some indication of what we expect in the fourth quarter.","Secondly, the push points that you mentioned, the upgrade cycle going to 24 months tied to the contract is a policy now tied to the contract. The Next improvement, this data revenue growth that we see, other efficiencies we put in, not only from the LTE network being more efficient but what we put in the cost structure, all of those things give us confidence that we are going to be able to meet that year-over-year LTE objective. So that's really how I think about it and why I feel comfortable with standing by the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank","And do you have any initial color you can give us on the adoption rate of Next?","John Stephens","Yes, we haven't been giving that publicly. And quite frankly, we are still pretty early in that. So as we get through a full upgrade cycle with the new device and plenty of supply on those devices and go through a holiday season, we will probably have a lot better insight. I am not committing to release that data at that time but I will tell you, it's early in the process. We have been pleased and we think it's been a good customer experience where they can capture the value of the trade-in phone, which is really the key to it. It's the economics that makes sense for both parties.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo","Thank you for taking the question. Just a question on the mobile share plan, I think you said 72% of your smartphone base is now under hedged. You have a year under your belt with this experience. Are these customers proving to be stickier customers I would think so, because your postpaid churn was lower than I was looking for.","John Stephens","Yes. Thanks, Jennifer. I think 72% of our smartphone customers are on usage based plans, so Jennifer that would include not only the mobile share, but the tier data. The mobile share is about 16 million of our customers. It's about 5 million accounts, about three per account but, yes, we are having good results with those with regard to the plans, not only with smartphones, quite frankly, in general. On churn, on revenues and on the quality of the customer experience, so while we don't publish those specific numbers, yes, we are having good results with that. We believe as we have shown with some recent changes in mobile share plan, it's an appropriate way for us to move forward.","Susan Johnson","I think, we have got time for just one more question, Tony.","Operator","Thank you. That question will come from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays","Thank you very much for taking the question. John, it does seem that you folks are benefiting from your investment initiatives that you announced just under a year ago. I was wondering if you may be able to provide us with some color on where you expect spending trajectory to go perhaps beyond just the near-term, because I know you addressed that in earlier question and if that has shifted given the fact that you seem to be ahead of plan with respect to your initial plan.","Also, I was wondering, if you could provide any color around the Supplier Domain 2.0 initiative that you have seen now that it's been unveiled and to the vendors, because it does seem that longer-term that initiative could provide significant cost savings down the line.","John Stephens","Let me try to address your questions. I think we said in the past that we would expect the CapEx for this year to be in $21 billion range and for '14 and '15 to be in the $20 billion range and at this time we are not adjusting that or changing that.","Once again, we are going to be very thoughtful about accelerating any build programs, and where we can do it efficiently, we will do that. I will tell you that the one due issue or one issue that's coming up is that with the Leap announcement and with our ATNI purchase, we may have some additional capital requirements related to those.","As we said publicly, we will announce the financial implications, specifically of Leap, when we close the deal which we expect to do in the first quarter, so we are not changing any of the guidance that we talked about for the three-year.","Longer term, we really do believe that software-directed networks are an opportunity for us. We think it gives us an ability to not only improve quality, but manage cost effectively, so we are excited about that. I think early results from that have been encouraging and the early results of our network team has been encouraging but I don't want to suggest to you that it is going to have an impact in the guidance that we have already given. I don't want to suggest or imply that we are going to move away from that.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays","Great. Thank you very much for the incremental color.","John Stephens","You are welcome.","First, let me close with a quick recap. We delivered strong EPS and strong revenue growth. We delivered solid wireless gains and terrific U-verse results for the quarter. We continue to make significant progress across our growth platforms, mobile data, U-verse and strategic business services and our project VIP expansion brings us even more opportunity. Our momentum is solid and we are setting the bar on network performance, which we believe, leaves us well positioned for future growth.","Once again very sincere in telling you thank you for being on the call. We really do appreciate your interest in AT&T and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning, everyone, and welcome.","As you know, on Saturday we announced an agreement for AT&T to acquire Time Warner. And the purpose of today's call is to provide additional background and perspective. AT&T also announced its third quarter results on Saturday, and we'll briefly go over those highlights as well. With me on the call today are Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; Jeff Bewkes, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner; John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. And also on the call is David McAtee, AT&T's Chief Counsel, who will take part in the Q&A portion of this call.","Before we begin, I need to call your attention to the Safe Harbor statement. It says some of our comments today may be forward-looking, and as such they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially, and additional information is available on AT&T and Time Warner's SEC filings and on the Investor Relations page of AT&T and Time Warner's websites.","As you know, we are in the quiet period for the FCC spectrum auction, so we cannot address any questions about spectrum today. I also need to \u2013 want to direct your attention to page 4, as that has information regarding SEC filings and now I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T Chairman and CEO, Randall Stephenson.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everybody. What we're going to do is Jeff and I are going to provide some color on the business combination, and then we'll spend our time addressing whatever questions you might have.","Look, we're convinced this combination, Time Warner and AT&T, is a perfect match for our two companies. Vertically integrated, we'll be able to bring a fresh approach to how the media and communication industry works for customers, for content creators, for distributors, as well as advertisers.","We'll be uniquely positioned to lead and even accelerate the next wave of innovation in terms of how people enjoy video entertainment. Time Warner is the global leader in media and entertainment with terrific brands and their brands we all know and love, from Game of Thrones to CNN and Superman, just to name a few. It is a vast content library and we believe it's the best on the planet, and hands down, Time Warner has the best creative talent and journalists in the industry.","When you combine Time Warner's content with our scale and distribution, we have 100 million plus TV, mobile, and broadband subscribers. You put that with our customer insights and the addressable advertising opportunities that flow from that, we think we build something here that's really special and it creates significant strategic as well as financial benefits.","With content distribution and customer insights, we'll be able to deliver new subscription, as well as adverting models and new content formats that traditional programmers have been hesitant to adopt, particularly for content, this design for mobile consumption and sharing on social media. Only content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with subscriptions will help pay for the cost of content creation.","And this two-sided business model, advertising and subscription-based, helps pay for creators to develop more great content and gives customers more choices in terms of how they get their content. And only AT&T will have the world's best premium content with the networks to deliver on every screen. We expect to close this transaction by the end of 2017, and I've been asked a lot why now. It comes at a time when the media and communication industries are converging, and Jeff and I sat down back in August to talk about where we saw the industry headed and how a combination between our companies would really remove a lot of the friction in the industry and help accelerate innovation in terms of content that's mobile, customized, and social.","The next wave of innovation in this business takes vertical integration of premium content and distribution, and I suspect the rest of the industry is going to innovate right with us. And by the time our Time Warner deal closes at the end of next year, we'll be nearly two and a half years into integrating DIRECTV and that work is going to be essentially behind us.","Our Time Warner deal is more of a bolt-on acquisition. It's not a normal full-blown integration like you've seen in past deals. The big part of the value of this transaction is Time Warner's outstanding leadership team and the amazing creative talent, the journalists that they put together. That's why we plan to run Time Warner the same way that it's run today.","If you would turn to slide 6 in the deck and let's talk about the capabilities this business is going to have. First, we'll be the leader in premium content. Time Warner has an amazing portfolio of content creation and aggregation and some iconic brands across programming and TV and film production. HBO is the number one global leader in premium content subscriptions, producing hit shows like Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley and Veep for its HBO and Cinemax networks. Warner Brothers is the largest film and studio in the world, hit franchises like Harry Potter, Superman and The Voice, and box office hits like American Sniper, and it has the best and biggest entertainment library on the planet.","Turner has top-rated basic cable network, TNT, TBS and Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and Tuner's premium sports rights, including the NBA, March Madness, Major League Baseball. And that combined with our rights of the NFL SUNDAY TICKET is going to create a very strong sports programming portfolio. And Turner has great digital assets like Bleacher Report, CNN.com.","If you look at slide 7, we'll have unmatched scale in distribution and customer relationships. 144 million mobile subscribers in the U.S. and Mexico, 45 million subscribers in the U.S. and throughout Latin America, make us the world's largest pay-TV provider. We have about 16 million U.S. broadband subscribers, and we have a growing OTT business with HBO NOW and soon DIRECTV Now. And also our joint venture with The Chernin Group, Otter Media has 1.2 million subscribers on its various SVOD services. And we have more than 88,000 retail points-of-sale across North America.","And third, all that will give us some robust viewership insights, and we'll use those insights from our TV, mobile and broadband subscribers to inform what content we create. We'll develop content that's better tailored to what specific audience segments want to watch, when, where, and on which device. And we'll use the insights to expand the market for addressable advertising. And addressable advertising is far more effective and more valuable both to the advertisers and to our customer. Owning content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with subscriptions will allow us to grow two-sided business models, help pay for the cost of content creation. And this two-sided business model, advertising and subscription-based, helps to pay for creators to develop more great content and gives customers more choices on how they get their content.","If you move to slide 8, I want to walk you through the highlights of the transaction. Then later John Stephens is going to dive a little deeper into this. So we're paying $107.50 per share. It's half stock and half cash, and the stock portion is subject to a collar. And we believe this is the optimal capital structure for a deal of this size. The financial benefits are straightforward and we think they're significant.","In the first year after closing it's accretive to margins and adjusted EPS and free cash flow on a per share basis. It improves our dividend coverage. It enhances and diversifies our revenue and earnings growth profile. And the structure of the deal allows us to maintain a strong balance sheet and strong investment-grade credit metric. The approvals are fairly straightforward. Time Warner shareholders will vote on it. And then we'll have regulatory reviews in the U.S., the EU, and a few other countries.","And so that's the structure of the deal. What I'd like to do now is hand it over to Jeff Bewkes, the Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, and let him take you through his slides.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Randall. Good morning, everyone.","I'm really pleased with this transaction and with Time Warner's future as part of AT&T. Joining forces will accelerate the evolution of both our companies, as we go where consumers are going in the converging worlds of media and communications. And that will drive more growth and more value for shareholders.","This combination creates both immediate and long-term value. For Time Warner shareholders, the price represents about a 36% premium to our closing price of $79.24 on October 19, and it also has a very attractive consideration mix of 50% cash and 50% AT&T stock for each Time Warner share. That gives our shareholder base roughly a 15% pro forma ownership in the world's leading integrated media and communications company, with a strong financial profile, as Randall just said, and a combined track record of success and innovation in both companies.","We believe the pro forma company is very well positioned to drive attractive growth for years to come. We expect innovation to be an important driver of that growth, since we see AT&T's distribution capabilities as an enormous opportunity for us. As I said, we need to go where the consumers are going, and that's increasingly mobile, increasingly multi-platform, and it's increasingly on-demand through new services via direct consumer relationships over broadband, and this aligns us with all of that.","Additionally, there is the huge opportunity Randall mentioned to utilize consumer insights to inform content creation. And that allows us to continue to create not just the biggest hits, but also content and programming that really engages with targeted passionate niche in the audience. We'll be able to do that more efficiently while also innovating very important new subscription and advertising models to increase consumer choice. So we see the opportunity to create tremendous long-term value in this combination, and that's what's driving this transaction.","As I said at the outset, AT&T's distribution capabilities significantly advance our direct-to-consumer efforts and our ability to develop new offerings for all the leading content that we already create and distribute today. And together with AT&T, we'll develop new innovative business models and forms of content that consumers will be demanding tomorrow in this ubiquitous, multi-platform, on-demand, and increasingly mobile environment.","So now I'll turn it over to John Stephens.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.","Let me provide the financial expectations that we have for this transaction and refer to slide 10. To recap, the purchase price values Time Warner equity at about $85 billion, plus approximately $21 billion of net debt from Time Warner. That brings the total transaction value to right at $106 billion. Time Warner shareholders will receive a 50:50 mix of cash and AT&T stock for their equity. The cash portion is already fully funded, with a $40 billion bridge loan and additional AT&T liquidity.","We remain strongly committed to maintaining a sound balance sheet and solid investment-grade credit metric. And we see significant opportunity for rapid deleveraging potential, given the attractive free cash flow of the combined companies. In fact, we expect pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA to be in the 2.5 times range by the end of the first year after the close of the transaction and approaching the 1.8 times range by the end of year four.","We see solid synergy potential in the $1 billion run rate by the end of year three. As you would expect, this is substantially cost-driven corporate and procurement type expenses, the kind we know how to get. But we believe there are also significant opportunities from the vertical integration of content and distribution. And the vast amount of data available from the combined company will allow not only a greater value proposition to offer advertisers, but will allow more informed and efficient content development. This transaction also diversifies and enhances our revenue mix. Strong cash flow and the lower capital intensity gives us flexibility as we grow these businesses.","As mentioned earlier, we expect adjusted EPS to be accretive in the first year, and free cash flow and free cash flow per share to be accretive within that same timeframe. The deal also improves our strong free cash flow dividend coverage. And as you saw, we just announced our 33rd consecutive dividend increase. We're shooting 100% raising the dividend with every chance we've had over the last 33 years. We are extremely proud of that track record.","Now I'd like to spend the last few minutes of this presentation giving you a high-level view of our very good third quarter results that we released on Saturday, starting with our financial summary on slide 12. Our teams continued to execute at a high level in the quarter. Third quarter consolidated revenues grew nearly 5% to $40.9 billion, in large part due to our acquisition of DIRECTV.","On a comparable basis, revenues were down slightly, as growth in video and IP-based services mostly offset pressure from declines in wireless legacy services and the second quarter 2016 transition of certain hosting operations. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, comparable revenues were essentially flat. We grew net income in the quarter. After adjustments, third quarter EPS was $0.74, the same as last year's third quarter and up almost 4% year to date. This comes even with about $0.02 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. Margins also continue to be solid, even with the pressure from our investment cycle in Mexico. Thanks to the team's focus on profitability and our best-ever wireless service margins.","All this continues to drive strong cash flows. We had our second highest ever operating cash flows of $11 billion, with free cash flow reaching $5.2 billion. That's more than $13 billion in year-to-date free cash flow. Year to date, our dividend payout ratio is 67%, ahead of our full-year guidance. Capital investment is on plan, coming in at $5.9 billion for the quarter and just over $16 billion year to date. We also continue to focus on our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which came in at 2.24 times.","Let's now take a look at our operations. Those details are on slide 13. In a competitive wireless market, we continue to effectively manage our business. This has helped us add subscribers, lower postpaid churn, and improve profitability. We turned in record wireless service EBITDA margins of 50.1%. This comes even as promotions eat it up at the end of the quarter.","We took a smart, strategic approach with our marketing moves. You see the impact in our postpaid churn. With all the noise in the marketplace, we had our second best third quarter postpaid churn ever. Postpaid churn of 1.05% was an 11 basis point improvement over the year ago third quarter, and this includes about 2 basis points of pressure from our 2G network migration.","Postpaid phone churn was even lower at 0.90%. That's a 14 basis point improvement over a year ago. We turned in another strong quarter of subscriber growth. We had 1.5 million domestic net adds. And when you include our Mexico operations, we grew our North American subscriber base by 2.3 million. The growth of our prepaid business continues to be exceptional. We added more than 300,000 prepaid phones in the quarter and prepaid revenues were up more than 20% year-over-year. This drove branded phone growth and helped increase our branded smartphone base by another 700,000 subscribers.","Turning to our Entertainment Group, on a comparative basis, revenues grew as IP and video revenue outpaced legacy declines. Margins also continued to expand at a healthy clip. Our reported margins were up 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by merger synergies and a full quarter of DIRECTV in this year's results. Overall, TV and broadband subscribers were relatively stable in the quarter. We added more than 300,000 DIRECTV subscribers and have added 1.2 million DIRECTV subscribers since we acquired DIRECTV in July of last year.","Our business solutions team also performed well in a challenging economy. Our flow share is good and we continue to see the benefits of an integrated wireless and wireline approach. Thanks to wireless, we grew business revenues in the quarter and we grew revenues in all our retail segments, enterprise, small business, and the public sector. Strategic business services also grew at a solid clip, up $240 million year-over-year. That's up 9.1% and when you adjust for APEX, growth was closer to 10%.","Let me close with a summary of the quarter on slide 14. We're proud of what we've accomplished in this quarter. Earnings continue to grow and consolidated margins are stable, even with the pressure from our Mexico investment. Year-to-date adjusted EPS is up nearly 4% and we had the second highest cash from operations ever. We answered competitive headwinds in wireless with our best wireless service margins ever and our second best ever third quarter postpaid churn. We added 1.5 million U.S. subscribers at positive phone net adds and grew our smartphone base by 700,000. The integration of DIRECTV continues to generate the cost savings and sales opportunities we thought it would.","We're on track to launch DIRECTV Now this quarter and are excited about what this brings. And Mexico continues to be a growth story, just a tremendous job by our team. They're ahead of plan with their 4G LTE deployment, with their rebranding efforts, and with customer growth. Our guidance for the year remains on track, double-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth with stable margins. And free cash flow growth has been strong with dividend coverage year-to-date at 67%.","As we enter the home stretch of the year, we feel very good about our results and we look forward to finishing the year strong. With that, I believe we're ready for Q&A and I'll turn it over to Roxanne.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we're ready to start our Q&A session. We'll start with the line from Amy Yong, Macquarie Research. Please go ahead.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. I was wondering if you can elaborate on some of the consumer products that you're envisioning on over-the-top. Obviously, you have DIRECTV Now, you have HBO GO. What do you think consumers want going forward?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Hi, Amy. This is Randall. I'll tee it up and I may ask Jeff to chime in, if he wants to add anything. So, you hit the big driver that we're envisioning, and that's the DIRECTV Now product that we'll be launching next month. And I'll tell you the more we iterate and work on DIRECTV and launch it in November, the more excited we get about what we will be putting in the marketplace, but I would tell you the more excited we get about what else we'll be able to do on this platform. And there are lot of things we really aspire to do with this platform, as you think about incorporating social into the platform. And as you begin to think about how you share content on this platform, clipping content that you're watching and sharing it with your friends via messaging or being social media. We think that \u2013 we don't think \u2013 we know our customers are really demanding that.","Now, what I would tell you is, trying to develop those type of capabilities with the current content providers is proving difficult. It's arm's length negotiation and people are, obviously, very protective of their content, and so it's just really, really hard to get these type of iterations and innovations on content done. So the thing that Jeff and I get most excited about, when we talk about this transaction is, now, in these over-the-top environments and platforms, we can begin to innovate our content much quicker.","We're under the same umbrella, the same ownership structure, and we can get past a lot of these content rights and so forth and move fast. And I will tell you, we are both convinced that as we innovate in this way and as we accelerate the pace of this innovation, it's going to attract others to want to do the same on this platform. So, those are kind of \u2013 a snippet of some of the things we're thinking about. Jeff, would you add anything to that?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","I'd like to add same idea. We've been trying, at Time Warner, to get more Video on Demand on not just our networks, but have it become a universal thing for every American. You go to your set-top, your television and that whole dial of networks, hundreds of channels, they should all be VOD, just like HBO or Netflix is. And we announced that and we made it available to all our distributors for all the Time Warner networks to turn on HBO more than five years ago, no payment extra. The condition was, we'll give you full VOD on your television platforms, on your broadband platforms, provided that it goes to every consumer with no extra charge. Everybody has got to get the same offer and we could just do it for our networks. We announced it first with Comcast years ago.","What we saw, to Randall's point, is that the various cable and other kinds of distributors took a long time to create that offering across every other kind of network. And often the reason was they're waiting for various negotiations of this cable company versus that network group, and you just didn't see a universal offering. It's what consumers were demanding. And so, we think with this, with the AT&T and DIRECTV our largest affiliate distributor on television, they're the largest and best at mobile delivery. And so when we want to bring more packages, more choice for consumers at different price points at every kind of level, upper, lower, more channels, fewer channels, more mobility, more innovation of the kinds of programming. And then with the advertising capabilities, we can make the advertising more interesting for your house versus somebody next door, the products you're interested, not the ones you don't need to see. And that means that more of the consumers get a better experience viewing. They get less interruptions. And it means that more of the cost of the programming, which is \u2013 there's an investment in programming, but more of the cost can then be borne by advertisers and consumers get a break. So the benefit for this, for consumers is pretty good, very good, and the benefit for advertisers is terrific, because if you look at what's happening in that world, advertisers need more competition. And this will give another outlet, not just the Google and Facebook one that's gaining all of the \u2013 has been gaining all the traction, but now you have yet another advertising choice that's equally efficient.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","And if we're right about this, and I think we're both really convicted that we can drive the industry and innovate in the industry this way and do it far more quickly. If we're right, as we begin to stimulate even more and more demand of video over-the-top on our mobile networks, the desire and the incentive to go faster on 5G deployment is heightened. And we get more and more enthusiastic about the world of 5G. The more we get into this and see what kind of services will be consumed over-the-top on our mobile network. So, it's just a real synergistic effect across everything from infrastructure investment back through the distribution platforms and content creation and advertising model, this just has a lot of opportunities for us.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question then comes from the line of John Hodulik, UBS. Please go ahead.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. Maybe a question for Randall. We've heard the wireless market continues to see increasing competitive pressure. Does this transaction help you in that arena at all? Does it help you differentiate the product or just provide you some sort of business diversification away from the wireless market?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","It accomplishes both actually. As we iterate quickly on these platforms and think about DIRECTV Now, DIRECTV Now is a mobile-centric product. And if this product is as good as we believe that it is and our customers really begin to enjoy it, there should be advantages of using DIRECTV Now on AT&T's network, and there will be. But at the same token, if we're iterating quickly into DIRECTV Now with the Time Warner content, then we begin to differentiate the DIRECTV Now platform as well.","And hopefully, as Jeff articulated and expressed, as we begin to iterate and innovate with the Time Warner content, I am actually convinced that if we're successive with this, it will incentivize other content creators to do the same and want to innovate on top of this platform as well. So, I think it gives us great diversification. 15% of our revenues after this deal is closed will be Time Warner, and which is media and entertainment. So the diversification is great. But I think it also gives us an opportunity to differentiate our platform.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","John, if I could add just one thing. I mean, it is a competitive environment in the mobile arena. But look at the results, record 50% wireless service margins, churn our second best third quarter ever, and even lower when you take into account the 2G migration. Look at the postpaid phone churn and you see that it's down at 0.9%. So, it is a competitive environment and there are a lot of promotional activities going on. But our mobility engine, our mobility team is performing quite well. And the capabilities that we get through this transaction only ensure that that part of our business can continue to operate very effectively, efficiently, and profitably.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amir Rozwadowski, Barclays Capital. Please go head.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for taking the questions. While some of the major trends that the combination seems to address are not lost on many, I wonder if we could dig in a bit more. Randall. to your comments on why now is the right time. Clearly, you have a lot on your plate at the moment. The integration with DIRECTV seems to just be getting started. You're on the verge of some new business models that you have mentioned on the OTT side. And arguably the revenue synergies have just begun with respect to DIRECTV. Does this signal confidence in your ability to execute on the integrated service provider model that is in place now or is this sort of timing with respect to availability of making this move with respect to the availability of the asset? Thanks.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Hi, Amir. Good questions. In terms of where we stand on the DIRECTV integration, Amir, as you recall, the biggest benefit financially from the integration were the cost synergies. And we set an objective of getting $2.5 billion per year of cost out of the business, $1.5 billion of that being this year. We're way ahead of schedule on achieving those costs synergies. And as you think about this transaction that we've put together here, closing end of 2017 timeframe, we're going to be way down the path of the integration activities and achieving those cost synergies and so forth.","The other element that was really critical in terms of achieving synergies from this was getting all of those content rights to distribute over our mobile platform. And so the DIRECTV Now, that required a lot of heavy lifting to go around all the content creators and get these new rights to distribute this content over-the-top to our mobile providers. Those are largely done. We're a little over one year into this, and all those content agreements are basically in place. That was a lot of heavy lifting. There's been an unbelievable amount of work and effort going into that. And now we're really early into deploying these new platforms. And I would tell you the more we get into the DIRECTV Now over-the-top platform, the more excited we get about the opportunity. And then as we think about the ability to bring Time Warner content into that, just the enthusiasm level just continues to go up and go up.","So I would tell you, I think the timing of the Time Warner deal as it relates to the integration of DIRECTV is actually a very good fit. I think the timing is very good bringing it in end of 2017, and we're going to be at a place where all of our installation crews for DIRECTV are integrated. We're doing one truck roll to the house. Our call center operations will be integrated at that point in time. And so a lot of what I'd call the key logistical difficult things to do in terms of integration, we'll have the lion's share of those done by end of 2017. We still have some what I'll call big IT type things, information technology development that won't be completed. But those aren't big rocks that are going to get in the way of trying to integrate Time Warner at this time.","Then lastly, I would tell you a deal like this, when Jeff and I met and we both gained conviction in terms of what was in the art of the possible here as we put these two companies together, and we both became convinced and convicted that it was the deal that ought to happen. These kinds of deals you don't sit around and wait for the perfect timing. Once you have a deal and you have a deal structure, given the potential for leaks and so forth, the objective is to push them through and get them done. And that's exactly what we did here.","And so there's never a perfect time for a deal like this. But actually, I think this fits very well with our own integration plans, and I also think it fits well in terms of how fast this industry is moving. The convergence in terms of media and distribution is moving fast. We want to be at the front of it. We don't want to be chasing it. And doing this deal now allows us to lead in this type of convergence activity and bring stuff to our customers that they want before other people bring it to their customers. So I think the timing actually works out quite well.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And if I may, one quick follow-up. What gives you comfort on the regulatory approval process?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","So I'll lead in on this. I have David McAtee, who is our General Counsel at AT&T. And so I'm not a lawyer, but once Time Warner closes, I'll play one on TV, okay? But I'll give you my layman's assessment of why I got comfortable with this, and then I'll let David clean up after me.","But when we looked at this, it's very clear that this qualifies, in every definition of the word, as a vertical merger. It's a vertical integration. And most of the deals, in fact all of the deals that have gotten in trouble lately over the last few years have been horizontal mergers, where a competitor has been taken out of the marketplace or the regulators were concerned that a competitor would be removed from the marketplace. This is vertical. Jeff's company is a supplier to AT&T and it is a pure technical vertical integration. Vertical integrations, where regulators have concerns with those, are remedied or addressed \u2013 those concerns are addressed through conditions.","And so we anticipate that the regulators may have some issues that they want to deal with on this. There may be conditions, but we're convinced that these type of issues can be handled with conditions, and it's rare. In fact, I'm not sure we know of a situation where vertical integration has been blocked by the government in our two sectors. David, would you have anything to add to that?","David R. McAtee II - AT&T, Inc.","Randall, that's right. What you've heard here today, Amir, is that in the mobile age, the legacy separation between content and distribution is really getting in the way of what consumers want. And it's only benefiting those entrenched incumbents who have little interest to change. And so as a result, we are looking forward to the regulatory process, which is going to be guided by facts and guided by the law.","And Randall is right. When you look at the modern history of media and the Internet, the U.S. government has always approved vertical mergers like this, and they do so for good reason. They put downward pressure on consumer prices. They increase competition and consumer choice. And in our case, they spur the sort of innovation and investment that Randall and Jeff have talked about. So we enter this process confident. We don't prejudge the outcome. We stand ready to talk to the regulators and to address any concerns they have.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","This is Jeff. The only addition I'd add is it will increase competition in advertising as well.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks so much for taking the questions.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you, Amir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you very much. I am joined by Ben Swinburne here, who also has a question. Randall, you moved into content with Otter Media and the partnership approach, and you've been pursuing that road, and there are obviously some benefits to that approach. What was it that made you feel comfortable that you could move from a partnership so quickly to full control of a content company of the size of Time Warner? And then, Ben?","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Jeff, good morning. I just was curious. If you look at over the course of your leadership time at Time Warner, you had a lot of success creating value spinning off and distributing assets, most notably Time Warner Cable in 2009. At that point, it seemed that the company had a strong view that content and distribution together was not synergistic. So I'm curious over the last seven years, what's changed in your mind to suggest now that combination is in fact attractive for your shareholders?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Randall, do you want me to go first?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Jeff, you start off.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","So two things. One is that the Time Warner Cable company and footprint was small. It was a regional cable company with the limitations that cable had at that time, about 12% of the country. And we weren't \u2013 that's the first part. And it needed to get consolidated to get more efficiency in the scale of what it did. And we didn't think that would be as well accomplished for a number of reasons, financial structure, regulatory approval, as part of a media company that we had at that time.","The second thing, which I think is more important, is the world is much different now. You now have net neutrality in place. You've got broadband distribution. You have mobile as an ever-bigger part of the distribution package, and you have a lot of incoming new distributor or competition coming from Facebook, Netflix, Google, Amazon. And so as the distribution world changes, having distribution capabilities to innovate on mobile sets, across broadband, and with the ability to speak directly to consumers, offer customized subscription packages and more effective targeted advertising, it's both more competition on both sides, and it allows us to have our networks be more attractively offered to consumers. And what I mean by that is VOD with better interfaces. And I think that the distribution industry \u2013 not AT&T and not Comcast, so far they've been good at this. But a lot of the distribution companies, particularly the cable companies have been slow to provide these innovations for consumers, and we think this will help spur that across the industry.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Furthering on Jeff's point and addressing, Simon, your question, the reason we believe that owning the content is so critical. When you're talking about doing really tight integration, ownership is always best. If you have to iterate and innovate quickly, it's really difficult to do in a partnering arm's length negotiated-type transaction. Our history is long in terms of examples of this; not the least of which was we had been, what I'd call, a tightly integrated reseller of DIRECTV for a long time. And it was an important part of our package. But you never could get the tight integration of the customer experience. We closed DIRECTV and we get the customer experience integrated. And then within one year, we've added 1.2 million DIRECTV customers. We've never even begun to approach a number like that when we were just partnering and reselling their product. And then as you think about, for example, the DIRECTV Now launch, we have been working three or four years to bring to market a mobile-centric package of content to our customers.","And we have been working aggressively to put this together and getting the content creators to agree to the rights to put this over our mobile platform was proving to be very, very difficult. We closed DIRECTV, and with those great content agreements that we now own at DIRECTV, within one year we've achieved all of those content rights, literally within a year, something we've been trying to do three years we achieved in one year after owning DIRECTV. I am convinced that as we try to bring unique capabilities of content to our customers and really integrate \u2013 I'm talking about integrating deeply, social aspects and interaction of our customers with content and so forth. As we try to do that, doing it in an ownership structure rather than a partnering structure, will happen faster. And I'll say it again, that I believe if we're successful at this, it will drive the whole industry to begin to innovate faster and everybody will want to innovate on these platforms in this same way.","So there's a long history, Simon, of where you try to partner, you can get there. It's slow, it's painful, just the contracting itself takes a lot of time, whereas when it's completely owned, you just move a lot faster.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you, Simon.","Operator","Our next question then comes from the line of Phil Cusick, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Randall, can you update us on the pace of improvement and the competitive environment in Mexico? And can you talk about what the Time Warner deal does \u2013 what Time Warner does in Mexico and the rest of Latin America and how AT&T can push that harder? Thanks.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","You bet. Mexico is going great. I think something that's been lost in the Mexico story is, Mexico City is like the largest \u2013 one of the largest cities in the world. It's a sprawling major metropolis. And we have stood up in the course of one year a full scale LTE network that is performing beautifully. And the business in terms of subscription growth continues to grow. Our distribution is growing beautifully. We're adding distribution at a very, very impressive pace, and that is individual who is leading that operation is just doing a terrific job. And I will tell you, we just continue to gain more and more conviction around Mexico.","And we have a long way to keep growing in this business and we're looking forward to now, as we scale our mobile subscriber base, as we scale the LTE platform and get really robust capacity and coverage, then you can begin to think about the things we're talking about here, distributing content to our customers in Mexico. And Jeff has probably one of the best lineups of content in Latin America that I've got to tell you, we're really enthusiastic about not just for Mexico delivering over our mobile platform, but throughout Latin America, where we have coverage in just about every \u2013 I think all but two countries in Latin America with our satellite product. And so Jeff, if you would, I'd let you talk a little bit about the capabilities you have in Latin America.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Randall. Our biggest overseas network business and sales business in Latin America, from Mexico all the way to Argentina, that's where we have \u2013 we're the number one non-local channel provider across all of Latin America. We've got it on satellite with you at DIRECTV. We've got it in pretty much most of the cable and telcos. There is not yet as much broadband or mobile as there will be, but there is a real growth in that market.","We also have a \u2013 we don't just have the U.S.-based networks like Cartoon, CNN, TBS, TNT, HBO that you all know. We also have a number of Latin American-based channels that strengthens our offering. So I think the match between the two of us in being able to help upgrade distribution and lead a real continuing buoyancy, just a secular take-up in Latin American countries of television services. It's a bit like where the U.S. was 20 years ago. Now, it varies from country-to-country, but potentially all that growth of the golden era of more channels and more TV is coming now across Latin America.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Jeff.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you, Phil.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of David Barden, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. I understand from press reports, Jeff, that you plan on leaving the Time Warner organization. Randall, could you talk a little bit about how the leadership will work for the new company in this kind of bolt-on structure? And then second, John, on the financing side, could you talk a little bit about the comfort level the rating agencies have with your proposed leverage and some of the funding rate assumptions that you've made in your accretion analysis? Thanks.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Randall, do you want me to start?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","I want you to start. What are your plans, Jeff?","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","This is Jeff. I don't know where you saw that. That's not right. I'll be staying after we close the deal. And we do have pretty deep bench of management at the Time Warner Company. Everybody is going to be staying and quite invigorated, both the business execs, the creative and journalism executives, and I too will be staying. So as any normal evolution over the years after that \u2013 years we're talking about \u2013 our next generation will be ready. And you've got some terrific execs at AT&T and in DIRECTV that can be part of this next wave of management. But that's the next generation and when it's ready, we'll hand over to them.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","And as Jeff and I were constructing this deal, there was not a single conversation we had, where I didn't talk to Jeff about talent. And keeping the talent in place was a critical piece of putting this deal together. And Jeff has an employment structure that is really comforting to me in terms of how he has his people compensated and so forth. David \u2013 and I know this will probably come as somewhat of a surprise to you, but I've never run a movie studio before.","And so keeping the talents and retaining the talent is really, really important to us. And I would tell you I feel like we have some good plans in place to ensure that we can keep the talent in place. The way we will organize the business, David, is Time Warner will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T, and it will stand on its own and will continue to operate at very similar to how it's operated today. We'll have to figure out the management art of how we affect the data beginning to influence content and how we allow the data and the customer insights that we have on our mobile platform and our TV platform to influence advertising that's delivered into the Time Warner advertising avails and how we begin to take advantage of that. And so there is a lot of integration work that's done at that level, but Time Warner will be operated largely independent and as an independent subsidiary of AT&T. John, you want to talk about the rating agencies?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure, thanks, a couple things. Rating agencies, we've had conversations with them. They're still considering in the push and pulls of the situation. One is the amount of debt is large and we're all aware of that. On the other side, the ability to generate $60 billion of EBITDA and $45 billion, so to speak, of annual cash from operations provides a great opportunity to service that debt.","Third, I think the agencies are evaluating the change, if you will, the diversification opportunities that this provides and the growth, the enhanced growth opportunity that provides. If you look at the transaction from a starting point on date of close, if you assume end of year kind of in the 2.7 times range net debt-to-EBITDA and getting down to close to our traditional target of 1.8 times after four years, that ability to lay that out gives us comfort that we certainly will remain investment-grade and would argue very strongly to keep our current ratings with those agencies. I would expect they'll come out with some interim announcements that will \u2013 as they work through the analysis, this is normal in this case. So that's really how we view it. From a rate perspective, I think the one thing I need to point out is over 90% -- or about 90% of our debt is locked into rates with about a 14-year average life. We don't have much floating debt at this time.","So first point I make to you is, this transaction really doesn't have \u2013 has very minimal effect on our current interest expense cost for the legacy AT&T. When you layer on the towers of debt of Time Warner, they fit very nicely on top of the towers of AT&T, and give a very manageable, very easily managed process for refinancing or paying down debt, so we feel very comfortable with that. Our assumptions were very conservative. We took a step up from a 30-year bond rate that we see today. We took a step up from that in our models in our traditional normal conservative approach. So we feel good about having the right level of interest expense for the incremental. And as I said, the basis is locked up for a long period of time. Thanks, David.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you, David.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Horan, Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks a lot. John, just two questions following-up on that. So in today's current rate environment, if you use more short-term debt, what type of rates do you think you can get? And secondly, just on the \u2013 can you give us maybe some color on the cash tax rate going forward? And just a quick follow-up for Randall. Thank, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Yeah, a couple of things. One, if you look at our overall average debt cost today, it's about 2.5% after tax. So pretty low, and that's with the longer term life, that's with the kind of 14-year average life. I think, Tim, you can see, it can certainly come below a 4.5% or 5% rate. You can certainly get down to the 3% on some of the short-term \u2013 shorter term debt and even lower, depending if you \u2013 how you want to go to floating.","We're going to work out the syndication of the bridge loan in the coming days and weeks, and we'll finalize that, but I want to make sure we are viewing this as a longer-term step. So we're not looking and the deal is not based on getting short-term rates for the next few years, but there is opportunity there compared to our assumption.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And the cash tax rate, John?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Yeah. I think on the cash tax rate, if you see the \u2013 the cash tax rate is going to stay very low through the bonus depreciation years. And if you look at Time Warner, their cash tax rate \u2013 their effective tax rate is lower than ours. Their cash rate is slightly higher than ours. So over time we would continue to expect the cash tax rate to be below the book effective rate. And on a post-merger basis, the book effective rate will be lower than AT&T's is today.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Randall, just quick question. It seems like zero rating is key part of the strategy here. Do you think that regulators are going to be okay with that strategy?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Regulators will be able to what, Tim?","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Zero rating, not charging for data usage of your own content. Will the regulators be okay with that do you think? That seems to be maybe the only real stumbling block on the transaction.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Tim, just I can't prejudge any of this. I just \u2013 I really don't know. We're just going to have to get into the process and put the data out for the regulators, and then begin that effort and the sausage will come out the way the sausage comes out, right?","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Good luck. Thanks guys.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan, Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I guess just a follow-up with that, if the FCC does decide to look at things like rate regulation for broadband, how does that impact your view on the deal and the optionality that it gives you?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Frank, the FCC has already started rate regulation reviews on broadband business, broadband services. And so look, that was always we felt the risk of Title II being implemented on top of this industry. I don't think it has any bearing, as you think about this deal. I mean, just rate regulation in general is just always the \u2013 I think is one of the great contributors to uncertainty in an industry like this when it's so capital intensive. So we're hopeful. The Chairman of the FCC as well as the President, when Title II was discussed, both said that they had no intention to regulate prices of broadband. And so hopefully that will be the case as we move forward with this transaction.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right, I guess a follow-up. Looking at the opportunities you have here, how does this impact your network plans with 5G and so forth? Are there additional opportunities here that could accelerate some of those plans after you close the deal?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","I would say you should anticipate \u2013 expect that to the extent that we can get the standards bodies moving and that we can get the vendor community moving that we would probably have a desire to move faster on 5G, certainly not slower. Our expectation is, as we begin to innovate with content, delivering content over these mobile networks, it's going to give us a lot more enthusiasm to go faster with 5G and not slower. And so we'll obviously do everything we can to try to accelerate all the efforts that are required to make this happen, but a lot of it is a logistical issue, standards bodies being set, getting equipment manufactured and so forth, but we're excited about it.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Frank, this is John. One thing I'd point out, with the diversification of the revenue stream and the reduction in the capital intensity that Time Warner brings to us, it brings us a lot more financial flexibility. And as we believe this ability to curate video to generate advertising, to be more efficient in production with all the data and insights we'll have, that should bring us profitability or revenue enhancements growth that will allow those decisions to fund the 5G on a very efficient basis while we continue to really manage the health of the balance sheet.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","It was a very elegant the way my CFO said yeah, he's preparing to invest. Randall, you better generate revenues. You just got to witness negotiation internally right here on the phone.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right, that's very helpful and good luck with the hearings on the Hill.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks. I appreciate it, Frank.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first on your core distribution business, with the decision to move into content on a larger scale, has anything changed with how you view the economics of your distribution business?","And then secondly for John on synergies, maybe if you can, give us some more color on the timing of the synergy ramp post deal close. Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","So why don't I start off with the synergies? First I want to focus that these synergies are supply chain. They are vendor costs. They're corporate focused. We continue to expect the business units, specifically the three business units that we operate, and then really these are not personnel focused. I just want to make sure that's clear.","When you think about our synergies, on a combined basis we'll be a company that spends close to $6 billion a year on advertising. And as we've proven, as our leadership and our corporate communications group has proven over the last year, we can mine savings out of combining two companies' advertising, corporate communications, because they've been very successful with that. We learned that from DTV.","If you look, quite frankly, at our telecom spend or Time Warner's telecom spend, they're not an AT&T shop extensively today. We've got a real opportunity to provide really highest quality services, and really from an investment base that we already have. That goes for both wireless and wireline. So that's a very direct one.","If you think about the platforms, we've been moving very quickly and very effectively at building a platform for DTV Now to distribute video over all kinds of screens. With that, we now have that ability to share that platform and that distribution device with HBO, with the Turner Networks, with the Warner Studios. We have a real opportunity to do that, and that's going to provide efficiency savings; and then frankly get into the things like what I call shared services, but efficiencies of payroll, efficiencies of accounts payable, efficiencies of cash management, all those kinds of things.","So we've done very detailed analysis of these cost-focused synergies. That's what gets us to the viewpoint that at the end of year three, we'll be on a run rate for $1 billion of cost savings and cash flow generation, and we feel very good about that. And once again, it's really focused on really the supply chain, and then of course the corporate structure, but we feel very good about achieving that.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And on just the core distribution business and whether anything changed that spurred the push more aggressively into content?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","No, the only thing that changed was our conviction about the opportunity to bring into DIRECTV and the DIRECTV Now development our conviction that unique content could really, really provide a meaningful benefit to our customers and the ability to iterate and innovate on that on top of the OTT model. We're just regaining a lot of conviction that this is going to be a really significant opportunity for our customers.","There is a huge customer base out there that we are convinced, while they don't subscribe to a bundle of premium content today at the right price point, over-the-top they will. And if you can bring a compelling price point and a compelling content package and some innovation with it, we are absolutely convinced that this is going to be very, very attractive for large group of customers who really aren't even in the market today.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it, thank you.","Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Roxanne, we'll take one more question, okay?","Operator","And that last question comes from the line of Mike McCormack, Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. David, maybe just a quick comment on the regulatory process. Could this be a DOJ-only process? And if so, how do you think they would look at it in the context of the Comcast-NBC deal? I guess one for Randall on just your view on the U.S. wireless market generally. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of diversification on AT&T's part. What do you think is the longer-term prognosis is in U.S. wireless given the competitive landscape? And I'll sneak one more in if I can on John Stephens just with respect to the handset adds. If it weren't for 2G losses this quarter, postpaid handsets would have been positive, I believe. As you step into 4Q, you'll see some more pressure. But looking into 2017, is there a return to handset growth at some point?","David R. McAtee II - AT&T, Inc.","Okay, Mike. David here. I'll start. You basically asked how will the regulators look at this deal. I think it's a wise question. Let me focus on what I think is the most critical issue. The regulators will focus on what the market structure looks like today and then what the market structure looks like post-transaction. This is a very important point.","Point number one is the structure of this industry will not change. There's no loss of competition. There's no loss of competitors. From a horizontal standpoint, the structure remains very much similar as it was today. And that's exactly what Randall and Jeff have been talking about in terms of the verticalness of this transaction. Point number two, the distribution model doesn't change. Time Warner has built an incredibly successful business distributing its content as widely as possible, and that won't change either.","So that leads to the question of what will change, and that's what's so exciting about this transaction. When you bring together wireless and content for the first time, you create a unique company that can work within that industry structure to innovate in very important ways that benefit consumers. Number one, you're able to take that wide distribution of Time Warner content and you're able to broaden that distribution, especially in the mobile world. And number two, you've heard it discussed here today. You're able to, with that combined company, innovate new platforms, new video experiences, things that can't be done by arm's length contract alone. You can't innovate through arm's length contract arrangement.","And so by doing so what the regulators will be interested in, first and foremost, is talk about what happens immediately after the transaction, and then talk about what happens thereafter. And so once regulators, we are convinced, understand the facts around what I've just described, they'll see a positive story when it comes to market structure and they'll see a positive story as it comes to innovation. And then ultimately we get to the point that Randall talked about earlier, is this innovation spurs more innovation, and it generates demand for video applications over mobile networks that is 5G; that's Sprint. And so when you put all together, it's a very compelling case that we look forward to discussing with regulators.","You asked about whether it'd be a DOJ-only process or whether the FCC would be involved. We know at this point, of course, that DOJ will be reviewing the transaction. At this point, we are determining which FCC licenses of Time Warner, if any, would transfer to the new company. And obviously, if there are licenses to be transferred, the FCC would review those.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Mike, as it relates just the U.S. wireless market, I think it's important to constantly remember in this industry how we cycle through times. We say, wow, it really is mature and it's just getting hyper competitive. And I can't help but reflect on \u2013 I think it was 2005, shortly after we bought AT&T Wireless and we launched the Razr, the Motorola Razr. And I will never forget how many people would ask me, what are you going to do after everybody has a Razr? This industry is mature, right? And, lo and behold, we invest in mobile broadband and smartphones come along. And smartphones take off and they become a catalyst for growth in this business for the last 10 years, literally.","And while all this has been going on in the smartphone, we have been accumulating rather aggressively, since 2012, a really big portfolio of wireless spectrum licenses. And we're sitting here today with 40 megahertz of fallow spectrum; fallow, waiting to be built into and deployed for video. Because now with these tablets and these smartphones everywhere, they're not just Internet access devices, they are video consuming devices. And so we have positioned ourselves to begin investing aggressively in ensuring that our customers can enjoy video. And now video and content that is uniquely curetted and developed for these kind of devices. And now we haven't even begun to talk about 5G. And as you think about 5G, video is a huge driver of it, but it goes so far beyond video, as we think about where it goes in a world of 5G, 1-gig type networks.","Now virtual reality can truly become reality. Augmented reality now begins to manifest itself. We're talking about autonomous cars. I mean, I am convicted. We are going to have autonomous cars traversing our major metropolitan areas in the next five years in a really significant way, depending on who you talk to in the autonomous car business, the developers and the inventors. They believe that the bandwidth requirement of an autonomous car is 1-gigabyte per car per mile, just huge bandwidth requirements; IoT, Internet of Things, healthcare.","I just think one of those moments where, yes, everybody has a smartphone, that smartphone is now becoming the launching point for what is next and we think what is next is really significant. And we now have the largest connected car portfolio in the United States. We have most major automobile manufacturers contracted with AT&T. And so we just think there's a lot of opportunity left, Mike.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, Randall.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Hey, Mike, with regard to your last question, let me make one point first. On our branded phones, we had net adds this quarter. I want to make sure everybody knows that. Secondly, the 2G migration and the decision to shut down that network on or about January 1 is impacting that and we had pressure in the quarter, particularly to our postpaid phone base because of that and that will alleviate next year, that's correct.","Third, we're seeing tremendous development for us in the prepaid space with the Cricket brand and adding significant customers there, a space that's still relatively new to us. We've been in it about two new years now in a significant way. It's what's helping drive margins. I'd say that has really improved the revenue growth, the profitability, and the customer accounts. And as we've talked about many times before, the cost of adding a prepaid subscriber is very, very low; no billing, no credit checks, no subsidies, and the ARPUs that we're getting out of it is very good. So all that's happening and that's what's adding to these great margins, that's what's building these great margins.","The one thing I would point to you though, that we're more excited about than just pure count is the fact that we added 700,000 smartphones during the quarter. So the devices that \u2013 so that while our \u2013 while our total net adds, our branded phone adds were certainly less than that 700,000, we are trading up to much higher quality customer, who has much more functionality with his phone, particularly in light of this transaction, much higher quality, capability to watch video and utilize the content that Time Warner brings, we feel very good in that position.","On a going forward basis, after we get through the 2G, certainly we should see some of the 2G \u2013 we will see the 2G pressures alleviate. But the focus for growth is what Randall really talked about in the sense of these platforms we've built, whether they'd be the connected cars, whether they'd be the Internet of Things, whether they'd be the various different capabilities we provide business and consumers in this Internet of Things environment, as well as the prepaid market, as we continue to take share and grow in that. So that's where we think this real opportunity is.","Certainly, we'll continue to grow our smartphone base. I don't mean to imply we own it all, but it is a more mature market. It's the opportunity to \u2013 if you will ship those feature phones to smartphones, and if that opportunity to play into a prepaid space and value customer space that hadn't been our focus for \u2013 our lead focus for years now has become a very strong focus for us, and then the Internet of Things, the connected devices, which provide a dramatic opportunity for us, both from a business and a consumer customer.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","So with that, we'll close. And I just \u2013 I want to reiterate. I think Jeff and I, we both have to say, we couldn't be more excited about what we're putting together here. We think this is really, really going to be a unique opportunity. We believe that premium content always wins. And we've said this that it always won in the theater, it now wins in the home, and it is now winning in the mobile device. People want to consume premium content and we have now partnered and are working to combine forces with, we believe, the top premium content developer, aggregator, and distributor in the world. And so we're really looking forward to putting these two companies together, defining the future of media and communications as they converge. We want to set the pace for this to happen. So thanks everybody for joining us and I appreciate your participation.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference for today.

So with that overview, I now turn the call over to AT&Ts Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens, John?","John Stephens ","","Thank you, Mike. And hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today and we always appreciate your interest in AT&T. Before we report out on our quarterly results, I\u2019d like to update you on Project VIP in the longer term view of our business transformation.","We\u2019ve been focused on building ultra fast, video centric networks and providing mobile connectivity to any device, anywhere our customers needed. I am pleased to say we have made great progress. It\u2019s been nearly two years since we first announced our VIP initiatives and our plans to transition to IP networks. Basically, we are doing everything we said we are going to do and more.","We reached our 4G LTE build target in the third quarter four months ahead of schedule. The nation\u2019s most reliable LTE network now covers more than 300 million people. We continue to improve our self identity and add capacity to help keep our network best-in-class. We are also on pace with our wireline network goals. Our high-speed IT broadband network now reaches 57 million customer locations. About two thirds of our U-verse video footprint now has access to 45 megabit per second speeds.","We also continue to make progress on expanding our U-verse video footprint and we committed to deploy ultra fast AT&T GigaPower service in 17 markets. Our fiber to the business expansion also is going strong. We now pass more than 600,000 new business customer locations with fiber, well on our way to our one million goal.","The transformation of our customer base also continued in the quarter. Two years ago when we first introduced Project VIP less than half of our broadband customers had high speed IP broadband. Now a significant part of that transition is complete with nearly three quarters of our base on high speed U-verse broadband. And our strategic business services are on track to be nearly 30% total wireline business revenues by the end of this year.","The transition in wireless is just as dramatic. There has been a steady shift of our subscribers to usage based plans; more than 80% of our smartphone base is now on usage-based plans. At the same time, mobile share value has helped move customers off the traditional subsidy model. We also have launched new business opportunities that will leverage our investment in a high speed networks.","The connected car is ready to take off. In the third quarter alone we added more than 500,000 connected cars as the 2015 model start to roll off the assembly lines. Digital Life, the first all-digital all-IP home security and automation platform has launched in 82 markets and has about a 140,000 subscribers. And AT&T has completed a Network On Demand trial in Austin that will enable companies to easily order, add or change services on their own in mere real time. A commercial roll out of Network On Demand enabled Ethernet services is expected in Austin by the end of this year.","Our financial strength allows us to invest while still returning substantial value to shareholders; in fact since 2012 we have returned more than $50 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Cash flows are strong and we have been aggressive in monetizing non-strategic assets. Including the sale of our Connecticut wireline property we have generated about 16 billion in cash proceeds from asset sales.","This has helped us average nearly $20 billion a year in free cash flow and asset sales over the last two years and we expect to do the same this year in 2014. At the same time we\u2019ve kept our financial house in order by funding a pension plan, making significant working capital improvements and taking advantage of historically low interest rates.","This is the heavy lifting our employees are doing everyday that you don\u2019t always notice in the quarterly numbers. We are just managing for the short term or managing and investing for the long term. Now with that view, let\u2019s take a look at third quarter results starting with our financial summary on slide four.","Consolidated revenue grew to $33 billion up $800 million or 2.5% year-over-year. This was driven by continued wireless growth as we repositioned our business model, solid consumer wireline growth, once again led by U-verse and continued growth in strategic business services.","Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.58. In the quarter we had $0.03 of cost associated with merger and integration related expenses. We also redeemed some debt early in the quarter to take advantage of low interest rates; both reductions in cost had a $0.02 impact on the quarter. When you exclude these items earnings per share were $0.63 compared to an adjusted $0.66 a year earlier.","Cash from operations continued at a strong rate and we also continue to find ways to monetize assets. Together, that has generated $32 billion in cash year-to-date. With year-to-date capital spending of $17 billion and about $7 billion paid in dividends so far this year. With all of that our cash position remains strong even as we continue to return substantial value to shareholders.","Now let\u2019s turn to our operational highlights on Slide five. The third quarter was another solid step forward in the transformation of our business. This includes strong subscriber metrics in both wireless and wireline and continued growth in strategic business services. In wireless, we saw good in fact great trends in a challenging environment including more than 2 million net adds that included adding twice as many postpaid subscribers as we did in the year ago third quarter. Record low third quarter post paid churn, solid wireless revenue growth and improving adjusted service margins even with record third quarter smartphone gross adds and upgrades.","We also saw the continued transition of our customer base to AT&T Next and Mobile Share Value plans while also realizing sequential ARPU phone growth. In wireline, U-verse hit some important subscriber milestones. We now have more than 12 million high speed broadband subscribers. The transition phase of moving our broadband base to IP is nearing completion with about 75% of our total broadband base on our higher speed service. And we also reached more than 6 million U-verse video subs that helped drive strong U-verse revenue growth and continued wire line consumer gains.","U-verse is now a $15 billion annualized revenue stream growing at nearly 24%. In wireline business, strategic services growth continued at a strong pace. It\u2019s now a $10 billion annualized revenue stream growing at more than 14%. With those highlights, let\u2019s now drill down and take a look at our operating results starting with wireless.","We had a great net add quarter. That\u2019s a trend we\u2019ve been seeing throughout the year. Overall we added more than 2 million total subscribers led by postpaid and connected devices. We added nearly 800,000 new postpaid subscribers that\u2019s twice as many as the year ago quarter, about 450,000 of those were tablets and computing devices with the remaining net adds, phone and some digital life.","And year-to-date we\u2019ve added more than 2.4 million postpaid subscribers which also doubled last year\u2019s pace. Another key point with our postpaid net adds is that we are adding these customers while maintaining high credit standards. These are rock solid high quality, new subscribers. These net adds exclude any migrations from our prepaid segment.","Connected devices also had a strong quarter as we started to see significant impact of the connected car with nearly 1.3 million connected devices were added in the quarter including more than half a million cars.","Churn turned in another strong quarter, in fact it was our best ever third quarter postpaid churn that follows our best ever churn in the second quarter and churn from Mobile Share Value and AT&T Next customers is even lower.","Total Churn for the quarter was up slightly to 1.3%, 1.36% reflecting a larger prepaid base with the March acquisition of Cricket. These are solid results in a challenging environment. We saw our competitive intensity pickup in an iPhone launch quarter with all major carriers now offering the iPhone and we expect that to continue as we move into the holiday sales period in the fourth quarter.","But we believe strongly in the quality of our network, our award winning customer service and the value proposition we offer customers. Our results so far this year show we are on the right track and we are looking to finish the year strong.","Now let\u2019s look at revenue and ARPU on slide seven. We continue to see a shift in wireless revenues as customers sign up for Mobile Share Value plans and away from the traditional subsidy model. Total wireless revenues for the quarter were up nearly 5%, service revenues were stable year-over-year and equivalent revenues were up more than 40%. A take rate for AT&T Next was about the same as last quarter, about half of gross adds and upgrades. We also saw an increasing number of subscribers bringing their own device to our network, about 460,000 or 7% of smartphone gross adds were bring your own device or BYOD. That\u2019s more than four times what we saw in the year ago third quarter and more than 1 million BYODs customers year-to-date.","We continue to have a large base of customers on discounted Mobile Share Value plans who have yet to migrate to Next. About 20% of our smartphone base is on Next, but about 52% of smartphone subscribers are on the non subsidy pricing. This means that there are about 20 million potential Next customers we expect to upgrade, that\u2019s up from 17 million at the end of the second quarter.","Next take rates continue to be strong in company-owned stores nearly all are more than 90% of our Mobile Share Value customers with pre Next pricing or choosing AT&T Next when they upgrade in company owned stores. They all come without a customer choice, customers can choose the plan that is best for them and that\u2019s great for us, and right now most customers are choosing to go off the subsidy mile when they upgrade or add a new line.","Also in the quarter, we continue to see customer\u2019s buy up larger data plans and more interested in device insurance. This is helping drive revenue. Now let\u2019s look at postpaid ARPUs. The expected trends we talked about last quarter are happening as more customers take AT&T Next. Phone-only service ARPU is down year-over-year but up sequentially. When you add a Next doings you get a better view of what an average customer pays us each month.","Phone-only ARPU with Next billings improved sequentially by 2%. The average monthly Next billings were about $29 per month driving our ARPU with Next higher. As the Next base grows, so does the impact on billings. We also continue to see strong growth in data billings, those details are on slide eight.","Wireless data billings increased by nearly 24% in the quarter. This was due to the increasing number of devices on the network and customers choosing 10 gigabit plans or larger. More than half of all Mobile Share accounts are on these plans. During the quarter, we added more than 2 million Mobile Share accounts giving us 16.7 million in total, that\u2019s three times as many as we had a year ago. And we averaged about three connections per Mobile Share accounts or nearly 47 million connections in total. That\u2019s roughly 60% of our overall postpaid base.","Smartphone sales continue to be strong; in fact, we had 6.9 million smartphone gross adds and upgrades. That\u2019s a third quarter record. And it would have been even higher without inventory constraints.","We added $1.2 million subscribers to our smartphone base including about including 500,000 smartphone net adds. Most our sales continue to be smartphones, about 91% of the flow share.","About two-thirds of our postpaid smartphone base use LTE phones. As you know, LTE devices provide the best customer experience, while also being the most efficient on our networks.","Let\u2019s now look at our wireline results, starting with consumer on slide nine. U-verse hit two subscriber milestones in a quarter. First, we now have more than 12 million high-speed broadband subscribers, after adding more than 600,000 in the quarter.","U-verse broadband is now 73% of our total broadband base and 75% in the consumer broadband base, that\u2019s up 70% in the last two years, that\u2019s help to drive total postpaid \u2013 that help drive total positive broadband net adds in the quarter.","We also continue to deploy our ultra high-speed GigaPower service. We now offer 1 gigabit speeds in Austin and have turned up the service in Dallas and Fort Worth. We\u2019ve also committed to deploy GigaPower in 14 additional markets including Houston, Miami and Atlanta.","We also passed the 6 million mark with U-verse TV subscribers and in 216,000 in the quarter, and bundles continue to play a big role in our growth. More than 97% or virtually all of our video customers have some kind of bundle with us, most often broadband and video. And nearly two-thirds of U-verse TV subscribers take three or four services with us.","ARPU for U-verse triple play customers continues to be more than $179 that helps drive revenue growth while reducing churn. In fact triple-play bundled customers have significantly lower churn than standalone customers. All this help drive 3% revenue growth in consumer, total U-verse revenues are now more than $15 billion annualized revenue stream and our continued growth at nearly 25% year-over-year. U-verse now represents 64% or nearly two-thirds of our consumer revenues. That compares to 54% just the year ago.","Now let me take you to our wireline business results on slide 10. We also reached another significant milestone in the wireline business. Strategic business services, those are growth services such as VPN, Ethernet, hosting and other advanced IP services are nearly a $10 billion annualized revenue stream for us now.","The services backup more than 28% of business wireline revenue and grew by more than 14% in the third quarter. At our current growth rate strategic business services should be about 39% of business wireline revenues by the end of the year. Overall business revenues decline by 2% in the quarter. Service revenues were also down 2% year-over-year.","The shift to IP data and away from legacy services, as well as the economy is the story in wireline business. But within the business there are some differences. Our retail service revenues actually grew year-over-year.","Those are service revenues from an enterprise and small business. Enterprise revenues were up 1.7%, that it\u2019s best performance in years and the six consecutive quarter of service revenue growth.","Small business trends also improve as even with a lack of new business formations. On the other hand, wholesale is again challenged by network grooming issue. We also make a strategic decision to refocus the wholesale business.","That reduce wholesale revenue is about $50 million in the quarter and we expect that amount to increase in the fourth and thereafter. The positive trends in retail service revenues are encouraging, and as is the transition IP services from legacy product.","But the economy and fewer business starts continue to make for a challenging environment and clearly call for the government to move toward actual form legislation. Now let\u2019s look at consolidated and wireline margins on slide 11. For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated margin was 17.2% compared to 18.5% a year ago quarter. Wireless margins were pressured by strong adoption of mobile share value plans, solid customer growth, promotional activities and the leap acquisition.","However, when compared to the year ago third quarter, adjusted wireless EBITDA service margins actually expanded to 4 to 3.1. As the solid performance given our strong postpaid and smartphones that adds, as well as record third quarter gross adds and upgrade.","Wireline margins were pressured by increasing content costs and transformation expenses, lower legacy revenues also contributed to the pressure. But this pressure was partially offset by growth in consumer revenues, gains and strategic business services and solid execution or in cost initiatives.","Now let\u2019s move to cash flow, our summaries on slide 12. In the first nine months of the year cash from operation totaled $25.6 billion and $8.7 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were 17 billion and $5.2 for the quarter.","And free cash flow before dividends is $8.6 billion and $3.5 billion for the quarter. We did monetize about $500 million of Next receivables in the quarter as there continues to be great interest from financial institutions and additional tranches in the future are possible.","Net dept to adjusted EBITDA was 1.7 and our credit rating continues to be among the best in the industry. In terms of uses of the cash, dividend payments year-to-date totaled $7.2 billion and we continue to be opportunistic with our share buyback program.","Our asset sales strengthened our balance sheet and cash position, when you will include the $1.9 billion in short term investments, we had $4.3 billion of cash at the end of the third quarter. We also to expect to close the sale of our wireline asset in Connecticut and the Frontier this Friday, which will enhance our cash position with $2 billion in proceeds.","Let me close with the quick summary of the quarter on slide 13. We continue to make progress with our business transformation in this quarter throughout this year. That includes the repositioning of our postpaid base of the subsidy model.","Total share counts continue to grow and of our 57% of our gross adds and upgrades to the quarter were either AT&T next or BYOD. At the same time we continue to see strong total and postpaid net adds with low postpaid churn in a very challenging environment.","We also continue to rationalize our business portfolio. This includes completing the sales of the Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil equity interest, closing Connecticut wirelines property transactions two months earlier than we had expected, and exiting select low margin wireline wholesale businesses.","This rationalization as well the impact of more BYOD devices than we had expected and fewer net AT&T net gross adds and upgrades will impact revenues. The company now expects full year consolidated revenue growth in the 3% to 4% range.","Even with this change we expect that Next rates will increase for the rest of the year and continued strong BYOD will help with margins even with traditional fourth quarter holiday pressure.","So overall we continue to have confidence in our strategy and our ability to compete in this challenging environment.","With that Tony, let\u2019s go at and take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) The first will come from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies","Hey, guys. Thanks. John, you have made a lot of protective moves this year, obviously, and we\u2019re seeing phone-only ARPU stabilizing, but EBITDA has gone ex-growth. I guess just trying to think into 4Q, I'm assuming that the expectation clearly without subsidies is to see a decent number in year-over-year growth and EBITDA.","And then just, as part of that, if you could identify what you\u2019re seeing out there with respect to recent data points from the iPhone with respect to sticker shock on this whole issue of people being concerned about layering EIP payments on top of the existing plan? Thanks.","John Stephens","Thanks Mike, I appreciate your question. Now first of all on the sticker shock issue itself, quite frankly with 90% plus of the people come into our stores, we\u2019re not seeing \u2013 I won\u2019t say we haven\u2019t seen one or two, but we\u2019re not seeing any strong number at all of sticker shock, and the reality of it is for a person to come in and go to a subsidized model, they\u2019ve got to come up with $240 plus whatever taxes they have to pay. And if they stay on the Next model, they not only get the cheaper service on a monthly basis but the upfront costs are really only about $50.","So, from a sticker shock it\u2019s much more positive to go on Next than it is to come up with that down payment for the subsidized phone. So we \u2013 and we\u2019re really aren\u2019t seeing that at all. On expectations for the fourth quarter, won\u2019t go into details, but as we\u2019ve said before we expect a significant improvement in margins, EBITDA service margins in the fourth quarter compared to prior years and we are still working towards achieving what we said in the past and that is all four quarters this year to be 40% EBITDA service margins or better.","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. Thanks John.","John Stephens","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","John Stephens","Hey, John.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","Hey. So my question is on the improvement on the ARPU side. John, could you just talk a little bit about what the drivers are of the sequential improvement we saw in phone ARPU and the improvement we saw in the postpaid ARPU?","And then, as it relates to the pre-Next program, it looks like you went from 17 to 20 in the quarter to real slowdown. Have you guys repositioned the basis as much as you think is necessary or are we going to see that reaccelerate in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","John Stephens","Great. So, on the ARPU story, I think the biggest issue with the improvement is really the people buying the bigger buckets and buying \u2013 upping plans, as we\u2019ve mentioned. We had over 50% of the customer base at the 10-gig or bigger plans. We believe that that is really helping on the ARPU side. We still have \u2013 we still expect more customers to migrate to the Mobile Share Value plans, so we may still see some more pressure from the existing customers on that ARPU side, but buying the bigger bucket is definitely helping.","Secondly, on the Next take rates, the two uniqueness of the quarter -- two items that are unique this quarter, were one, the significant BYOD and while those 400,000 plus BYOD devices really don\u2019t bring us much if anything in the revenue and caused an adjustment in our thoughts on revenue they don\u2019t bring any expense either. And so we\u2019ll take those every time we can get them. That seemed to have an impact on the Next take rate.","The other issue is where inventory was available in the launch month, which was September where customers have a much higher experience, better experience going to Next in a company owned stores. But in the launch cycle sometimes inventory was constrained, so people would go into different locations where our experience level in Next hasn\u2019t been as high, particularly in some of the new channels like some of the big-box stores or some of the manufacturer stores. So, we\u2019d expect that to get to those higher levels over time, so we do expect the rate to increase. It\u2019s just going to take a little longer time than we had expected.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","All right. Thanks ","John Stephens","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Joe Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks for taking my question. John, I just wanted to clarify the postpaid net add estimate did not include internal migrations from prepaid. And then, to what extent did you see prepaid migrations to postpaid may be coming from your peers and have you made any changes to your credit standards?","John Stephens","So a couple of things, we haven\u2019t made a changes to our credit standards in any way shape or performance that will be significant or any change, that would change any traffic. Secondly, we do not count any migrations from for example our Cricket product into our AT&T product. Those will be excluded not only for phones but for tablets, that\u2019s how we count or have ever counted that information.","I can\u2019t comment necessarily give you lot of significant information with regard to any change in the migration from the customers that are porting into us whether they were previously prepaid or postpaid customer of the other carriers. I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013 and what I mean to mean to say by that is, I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t want to indicate that there\u2019s any significant change in that. I am not aware of that, so I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Joe Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will from come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank a lot. Good evening. John, are you still committed to the $21 billion capital spending guidance? [You imply just] [ph] a $4 billion number for the fourth quarter. And how are we thinking about that for -- is $21 billion still a good number for 2015 under VIP? And then on wireline margins, you talked about some of the content costs, some of the transformation costs. When do we see those margins start to stabilize? Thanks.","John Stephens","Simon, we are still committed to the $21 billion [range] [ph] for 2014 which is the guidance we\u2019ve been giving, so that gives us some room possibly 21.5 down and $20.5 somewhere in that, so that\u2019s I would suggest is a range, but yes we\u2019re still committed to that. Yes, we expect that to be further step down to capital spending in the fourth quarter that was planned. If people are wondering how that might accomplished, I will tell you that if you look at what the network team has accomplished with regard to getting 300 million POPs with LTE coverage and getting 600 million business locations passed with fiber, getting 57 million customer locations passed with IP broadband capabilities. We are ahead of the game so to speak in what we laid out and so there\u2019s a real opportunity to manage capital in that way and still continue to meet our target. It\u2019s a benefit of being ahead of the game on some of the build.","With regard to 2015, I won\u2019t give any additional guidance. I will specifically give - additional guidance we\u2019ll give that in January and update our guidance like we normally do. I will suggest you this though, we still expect tax extenders to get passed in the post-election session of Congress and those to get signed.","If that doesn\u2019t get signed, I would suggest you the companies, all companies, will have to take into account that change in their ability to invest because it\u2019s a financial change in their balance sheet and their cash flow statement. And that would be for us it would definitely be taken into account and what we decide on our investments next year.","But quite frankly, I think many companies it would have an immediate impact if it\u2019s not passed on their March or their first quarter tax return payments for this year and that might add a little more immediate impact on capital spending by other parties.","My point here is I think tax reforms, specifically tax extenders, needs to be completed. With regard to wireless margins, two pieces to that story and there certainly is the content piece and we\u2019ve got a strategic resolution or opportunity to make improvements on that.","But secondly on our transformation piece, as you heard in our presentation, 75% of our DSL customers have converted to high-speed broadband products and we\u2019ve converted significant number of feature phones to smartphones, all of this conversion going on.","In the wireline space that conversions had a lot of costs. Those costs are getting behind us now. When you have 75% of the base on high-speed, you\u2019ve incurred those costs. So that gives us an opportunity to improve margins going forward.","And we\u2019ll tell you there is second transformation going on and that\u2019s how we serve our customers. How we take orders. How we provision and \u2013 how we validate those orders. How we provision them. How we activate service.","We are actively working on mechanizing that ordering process, mechanizing that validation, that provisioning planning process. Those network is not yet completed. We\u2019ve made a lot of great traction, but that will certainly continue on into next year. And once we have that complete those two pieces of our transition cost will be behind us and that will give us the opportunity to really grow margins. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking forward to.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","John Stephens","Thank you, Simon.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs",". Thanks a lot. Just a follow-up here. You talk about an expectation that your Next take rate is likely to increase into the fourth quarter, after kind of stabilizing in 3Q. I just want to clarify, is that because you are putting more emphasis on that in the channel or are you seeing something else that\u2019s driving it? And then just in terms of other sort of margin drivers into the fourth quarter, can you give us some thoughts on where you think we're going to see the upgrade rate come out?","John Stephens","Yes. Brett, let me give you the simplest answer I can with regard to the Next rate improving. Our stores in September had some shortages on inventory where customers went -- our customers went and bought inventory from channels. Our stores our company-owned stores have the highest performance of Next take rate.","So now that those inventory constraints we\u2019re expecting to get behind us. They\u2019re not quite there yet, but we expect them to get behind us, we\u2019ll back to more normal sharing of that. That\u2019s the first reason. Second reason is, as we rolled up in Next program in the manufacturer stores and in the national retailer stores, there\u2019s learning curve and we are going through that and as we go through the learning curve the Next take rate of those operation has been improving. Those are the two reasons why we think that the overall take rate can improve.","Any time we have a launch of a new device in a month, it challenges a lot of pieces of your operations. In this case it challenged our Next take rates. With regard to margin activities, we\u2019re going to have the -- we continue to have the focus on expense management across the enterprise, but I think you probably know that with regard to percentages on upgrade rates we\u2019re not going to give any guidance on that and I wouldn\u2019t suggest there would be any differences one way or the other they need to have in a fourth quarter holiday season with a new product launch out there.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","John Stephens","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan","Hey, guys, thanks. I guess a couple of housekeeping things. One, can you reiterate or not the $11 billion in free cash flow and your EPS guidance that you'd given earlier in the year?","And then, second, just following up on Brett's question on the Next mix, given the -- what I think is a tougher credit requirement and the limits on distribution, how big of a mix on gross adds could this be, do you think? Is there an upper limit around 75 or 80 that this doesn't go above? Thanks","John Stephens","So, Phil, we\u2019re not changing guidance with regard to EPS or free cash flow. We\u2019re still in that $1 billion range. We\u2019re still \u2013 I think what I said before is the low end of the mid single-digit EPS range. The only caveat I give to that is if we continue to have quarters where we add 2 million customer, we\u2019re not going to turn down the opportunity of 2 million postpaid customers or the kind of wireline growth we\u2019ve had in a strategic services, we\u2019re not going to turn that down just to make a goal that the finance guys may have set. We\u2019re going to do what\u2019s right for the business, but sticking by what we said before.","With regard to the Next take rates, I think you hit on the right point in the sense of there is always going to be credit scoring impact on the availability or the qualification of our customers. So there always be some customers who would be better suited of our other arrangements or another products.","We welcome them. We love to have them. But we\u2019re not likely to go with the Next program for them. Secondly and I think as importantly is customers just want to have choice and so we will look to make sure that they have a choice if they want to use the Next program. That\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll another opportunity for them.","With that being said, we certainly expect that with this Mobile Share Value pricing going to two-thirds of our base by the end of the year that there is significantly step up in the number of Next customers compared to what we have today.","Whether that all occurs in the fourth quarter or some of that occurs in 2015, we\u2019ll have to wait and see, but either way it still a good long-term investment for us and we believe a good long-term situation for our customers.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan","Got it. Thanks, John.","John Stephens","Thank you, Phil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo","Thank you for taking the question. John, I just wanted to explore the SMB. You realized some significant bucking of what I would think would be a different trend, just because all our checks show that the cable guys have been nothing short of aggressive. Can you talk a little bit of what you are seeing or what you're doing differently there to -- or is it just macro? Are you leading on wireless, et cetera?","John Stephens","Kind of all the above Jennifer, I am glad to the call. A couple of things, one, we\u2019re putting a lot of fiber and a fiber whether you think about U-verse fiber and then U-verse fiber where many people think is consumer also can be available for business, but also the fiber that\u2019s passing those business locations.","We are finding that that fiber is enabling us to really go in and not only reinforce our customer position with existing customers but be very competitive in offering services to new customers.","Talking about your strategic services piece in the small business is growing healthfully. It\u2019s not a big base as of today, but it is growing well and the customer seems to like those services and are willing to take them.","So the investments we\u2019ve made in the IP are starting to pay off. Lastly, you hit the nail on the head and this is what we\u2019ve done on an organization perspective. It works for small business as well large business, but the ability to be agnostic with regard to the services of whether it\u2019s wired or wireless or more important the ability to combine wired and wireless services for you customers through one organization has proven to be really powerful even in small business.","And so that\u2019s how we think we\u2019re bucking the trend of no business starts but we got a long way to go and we need to keep the team\u2019s performing well but we need to keep it up and keep it moving forward, we are not making any declarations now but we do have a better feel for the situation than we did few quarters ago.","Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","David Barden - Bank of America","Hey thanks guys. I appreciate letting me ask some questions. So the first question would be on the enterprise side. Your biggest competitor talked about what sounded like were some structural things going on in the industry on private line pricing, core connectivity pricing, and it doesn't seem to have been an issue for you guys in the quarter. So I was wondering if you guys could give us a sense as to your comfort level on the enterprise positive trajectory.","Then the second was obviously the payoff from the forward pricing initiative has been the lower churn that you have been posting up. Are you comfortable letting people look at kind of a 10 to 15 basis point year-over-year churn improvement be the new run rate baseline expectation on a go-forward basis? Thanks ","John Stephens","","Well thanks, David. A couple of things, one, I go to tell you the performance enterprise has to do with our people, has to do with our enterprise sales team, both on a wire and the wireless side and the performance are now what provides our largest customers. I have the opportunity of meeting with about ten of our largest customers a few weeks ago in New York and I can tell you that they are satisfied with the kind of service, the quality, the security offerings those strategic services.","So we are hard at work to continue the good progress we\u2019ve made and I have decided that it is a tough environment -- very hard to continue in and our advantage is our wired network and capabilities as well as the ability to bind with wireless.","On the payoff in lower churn we\u2019ve certainly seen that payoff in lower churn we are not ready to establish a standard for that mainly to get through a full year because of this process before we even start formulating those numbers, but if you will two quarters in a row of best ever churn and year-to-date best ever churn. And those churn numbers of the postpaid side all below all the two digit range, range is very encouraging, but we got to be careful to continue to work hard and move this company forward. It\u2019s a long process of transformation that we\u2019re going through and we are nearing completion but we want to make sure we finish it very strong. So I\u2019ll leave out the predictions on rates.","David Barden - Bank of America","Okay. Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays","Thank you very much and good afternoon folks.","John Stephens","Hi Amir, how are you?","Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays","Doing well, John. Seems to be some interesting buzz among the supplier community around the supplier Domain 2.0 initiative. Wanted to see if there was any updates from you folks on this front in terms of developments. And also, timing to some of your earlier commentary on CapEx trajectory. In other words, what you have seen so far, does that solidify some of your thoughts on the ability to drive down CapEx intensity in terms of your expenditures in some of the out years, John?","John Stephens","We continue to be optimistic on our software directed networks or network-on-demand trial in Austin, just this last few months has grown positive or excited about the opportunity to get a launch in Austin of a product on an Ethernet basis that is what we call network-on-demand. So those things are real. It may take time to implement and to do right and the team is striving to do it right, but we remain optimistic.","With regard to the software-directed networks and the ability to use that to manage and harnessing our capital cost. We continue to remain positive. We take that into account in our spending projections in our assets. I would suggest you though it is a not a short road, but a long road when you have a company that has $100 billion of net, property, equipment that you are managing and networks that have a significant history to them. It\u2019s going to take some time, but we remain positive and optimistic and yes, we are receiving savings or achieving value from those software directed networks and we hope to increase those amounts overtime.","Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays","Great. Thank you very much for the additional color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. John, two quick ones, if I may. So the bring your own device trend seems very positive. I'm just wondering, how do you deal with bring your own device customers coming over from CDMA? Do you give them a new handset or are all those coming from just T-Mobile?","Then, secondly, I didn't quite understand your comment on the impact of bring your own device customers on the Next take rate. I would have assumed all of those customers would take Next -- would take the Next pricing. That would be what would be most attractive to them. If that's not the case, then I'm not sure why it would have impacted your revenue growth for the year. Thanks.","John Stephens","Okay, quickly speaking on the BYOD device, these devices are coming not only from competitors who operate similar networks or whose devices will operate on their network which maybe more than one competitor whose devices may actually work in our networks. But they also come from devices that are previously one end of the door and we are less at home and then these are handed down either to family or friends, neighbors or whatever the case maybe, people they buy them over eBay and bring them and have already paid from.","So they come from a variety of sources, they could be reusing devices that had previously formed through our networks. That\u2019s the first case. The second case is if those phones would have been sold by us, we would have had a \u2013 we are depending upon what the device cost a $500 of revenues and $500 of cost. It wouldn\u2019t have provided any margin, it wouldn\u2019t have provided any contribution but it would have provided revenue.","So we still are getting our customer adds and we are getting a efficiency with the re-use of devices, we\u2019re just not getting any revenue out of them and that is quite frankly a big piece when we are talking about over a million devices so far and choose your number on how much revenue we will get out of each one of those devices. You can understand the impact it could have even on a company of our size as revenue. So that\u2019s the point there. We would have assumed that those kinds of devices people would have come in and gotten Next. Secondly, I would tell you we are making a distinction here. These BYOD devices aren\u2019t getting the Mobile Share Value plans and generally speaking, they are getting the lower price service because they are bringing the device. They just are not getting Next because they don\u2019t have to pay for a phone.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research","","Got it. Okay thanks John I appreciate it.","John Stephens","No problem. Thank you.","Michael Viola","Hey Tony, this will be our last question.","Operator","Okay, thank you sir. And that will come from Michael Rollinswtih with Citi. Please go ahead.","Mike Rollins - Citi Investment and Research","Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. First, as we think about your move to consumption-based pricing and we also think about some of the changes in the sizes of the buckets for data, can you give us a sense of what's happening as you increase the data buckets, you try to encourage customers to spend more on data? Are you getting more in data revenue relative to those that might have started at a higher plan and can use the same amount, but moved to a cheaper bucket?","Then the second question is if you just had an update on the regulatory process with the DIRECTV deal. I think the FCC put out an update on their clock today, and I am just curious if you could talk about the implications of that and any update from your perspective. Thanks","John Stephens","Sure on the data bucket I am referring back to the slide that we showed with regard to data billings and that they were up, of about 3.4% year-over-year. So what we\u2019re seeing in this opportunity is this that we are buying off particularly with the Mobile Shave Value plan or try to get the 10 meg buckets so there are 10 gig buckets excuse me with buying up anyway. And then you got to have some impact in some cases on average rates and so forth, but quite frankly about the customer experience comes out of having these bigger buckets also. Additionally, and probably it\u2019s supporting us anything, when they buy those data buckets they are adding things. They are going to add tablets, they are going to add variables, they are going to add other devices. Soon we have no adding connected cars and so what we \u2013 add other family phones or other members of the family tablets.","And so what you see is they buy up these buckets and then they start using, I mean getting more functionality and then they are more tied to us. If you look at our Mobile Share Value accounts, I think we have about 16.5 million almost 17 million and we have about 47 or 48 million devices or connections on them. So these data buckets and that\u2019s what happening its helping us get pretty sticky with the customers and that\u2019s how we feel.","The data billings increased almost over 20% is clearly what we point to you to say what\u2019s going on with the data side. With regard to the DIRECTV the FCC didn\u2019t make a decision today to stop the clock that decision has nothing to do with the merits of our deal or any information that we\u2019ve provided. The FCC is automated clear that there was concern about the confidentiality of the information that sometimes when companies provide the FCC and they are trying to deal with those issues.","We are confident in the FCC rigorous procedures for keeping the information confidential and we\u2019re ready to provide them with the information they have requested from us. While the FCC is stopping the clock on merger review is fairly common, that today\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t change our view that we\u2019ll be able to get the deal approved and closed by the first half, in the first half of 2015.","So Mike that\u2019s the color I would give you around that. We\u2019re still optimistic about the transaction. The stopping of the clock is not an uncommon or rare experience and it has something to do with other issues than the benefit of our deal or the merits of our deal. So we\u2019ll continue to support the process and look forward to getting the transaction closed within that originally announced one year kind of time frame.","Mike Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment and Research","Thank you.","John Stephens","Before we close, I want to thank all of you for being with us this afternoon. As you can tell we have continued to make significant progress in transforming our business not only in the third quarter but all year long that now includes repositioning our postpaid base of the subsidy rattle but we\u2019ve also did that while having strong net adds, strong postpaid gains and record levels of churn. We also had a strong performance in wireline with continued strong performance in new version strategic business services and our ability to combine our wired and wireless services for our customers benefit. We look to continue that solid momentum into the fourth quarter and finish the year strong.","Once again thank you for being on the call.

Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the first quarter conference call. Good to have everybody with us today. Joining me on the call is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John's going to cover our operational results first. Randall's going to follow that with an overall business strategy update, and then we'll get to the Q&A session. As always, our earnings material are available on our Investor Relations page. You can find that on att.com\/investor.relations.","I need to call your attention to two Safe Harbor statements before we begin. That's on slide 3 and slide 4. They say that some of these comments today may be forward-looking, and as such they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially, and additional information is available on AT&T's and Straight Path's SEC filing and on the Investor Relations page of each company's respective websites. And, finally, we still remain in the quiet period for the FCC spectrum auction.","And so with that I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, and thanks to all of you for being on the call. Before I turn it over to Randall, I'd like to provide you a brief overview of our first quarter results.","We opened the year on a very competitive note. The wireless market moved to unlimited, several over-the-top video players launched new services, and a major cable company announced plans to offer wireless service in an effort to duplicate the integrated experience we offer today. All this reinforced our belief that we are the best prepared for the new world, where capacity, networks, and entertainment intersect.","A year from now, we may look back on the return to unlimited plans as the moment when the battle for network reach and capacity began. In a world of unlimited plans and growing mobile video usage, you need a network and the capacity to handle the load and meet customer expectations for quality service. We have just that, and Randall will talk more about that in just a few minutes, but let's first look at the results for the quarter.","Consolidated revenues were pressured by record low postpaid upgrade rates in wireless and pressure in legacy wireline from grooming, but at the same time, we continue to operate efficiently and drive costs out of the business. Adjusted consolidated margins were up 80 basis points year over year to 20.7%. Credit for this goes to our entire management team but especially to our technology and network ops group and their work on automation, digitization, and network virtualization. We're well on our way to virtualizing 55% of the network functions by the end of the year, and we are seeing the cost and capital savings from those efforts.","We grew adjusted earnings. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.74, up about 3%. That includes about $0.02 of pressure from storm damage on the West Coast and legal settlements. Also during the quarter, we wrote down the book value of our legacy publishing investment. That was partially offset by gains from a spectrum swap with Verizon. Both of those items were adjusted for EPS purposes.","Cash flows continue to be strong. Cash from operations reached $9.2 billion. Free cash flow was $3.2 billion, the same as last year, even though we increased capital spending to $6 billion for the quarter. We had improved working capital and lower tax payments in the first quarter and chose to reinvest those efforts in the business. While this made first quarter capital spending levels higher year over year, our CapEx guidance remains unchanged.","This also was a key strategic quarter for AT&T. We made several significant moves that put us in a strong spectrum position for the future. We signed an agreement to acquire FiberTower, a holder of 39 gigahertz millimeter wave spectrum, and we were awarded the FirstNet contract to build and operate a national first responders network. And earlier this month we announced our intention to acquire Straight Path. We have now been informed by Straight Path that their board has received a superior proposal. Under our existing contract with Straight Path, we have the right to negotiate with the company over the next five business days to match or exceed the new bid. We will evaluate the situation and make a decision in that timeframe. And we also received the expected $1.4 billion refund of our deposit from the FCC broadcast auction last week. Randall will provide more insight into our overall strategy in a few minutes.","Now let's look at our operations, starting with wireless. Those details are on slide 6. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic Mobility operations are divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. Wireless operations.","The reintroduction of unlimited plans made an already competitive market even more so. We were disciplined with our response, which was to launch new Unlimited Plus plans that give customers a $25 credit for bundling DIRECTV or DIRECTV NOW with their mobile service. And earlier this month we announced a limited promotion for free HBO for our Unlimited Plus customers. The changes in the market did impact our postpaid net adds, especially in the first part of the quarter before we began offering our new Unlimited plans. Our moves to combine the value of mobile with video have had the desired positive effect. In fact, trends are now back to where things stood before Unlimited plans were reintroduced by our competitors back in February.","Revenues were also impacted by fewer phone sales. We had our lowest ever postpaid upgrade rate of 3.9% in the quarter, selling 1 million fewer phones than a year ago, while bring-your-own-device customers remained strong. This obviously impacted equipment revenues and to a lesser degree some service revenues. But, despite all the competitive noise in the quarter, we turned in our best-ever EBITDA margins. Our EBITDA margin was 41.8% with wireless service margins of 49.3%.","Postpaid phone-only churn was also a record first quarter low of 0.90%. But with the lower phone sales, we also had fewest postpaid tablet net adds in more than five years, adding about 100,000 new tablets. We did add more than 2 million subscribers, as record connected device net adds and a solid prepaid quarter helped to offset tougher postpaid and reseller results. We also continue to grow our branded smartphone base, adding nearly half a million smartphones in the quarter.","Our Entertainment group also saw competitive pressure. Revenue and margins were relatively stable. West Coast storms did drive up expenses by about $100 million in the quarter, with about two-thirds of that allocated to our Entertainment group and the rest to Business Solutions. But these costs, along with higher content costs and our investments in DIRECTV NOW, were largely offset by merger synergies and disciplined cost management. Linear TV subscriber gross adds were consistent with previous quarters, but with annual price increases due to content costs going up. Churn was up, particularly in markets where we don't have broadband to bundle with video. Competitive pressure from cable and the increasing number of over-the-top video alternatives resulted in our video subscribers declining in the quarter. We're taking steps to address the situation, including simplifying offers and bundling with unlimited wireless.","At the same time, DIRECTV NOW is an important part of our strategy and continues to add customers. We deliberately pulled back on marketing to give the platform time to mature and improve, and we're seeing just that. You should expect us to be more aggressive with DIRECTV NOW in the second half of the year, with additional features and content. Last week we added 14 FOX affiliates to DIRECTV NOW. You should expect we will be targeting those cities with additional marketing. We're still only five months since the DTV NOW launch, but we like what we see and feel very good about the service and where it's headed.","Broadband had a very strong quarter, with 115,000 subscribers added. Our moves to simplify pricing are paying off, and our fiber deployment is making inroads. AT&T fiber is now in 52 metro areas and marketed to 4.6 million customer locations. We expect to add 2 million fiber locations this year, to reach 6 million by the end of the year, and to meet our 12.5 million merger commitment goal by 2019.","Now let's look at Business Solutions on slide 7. In the business segment, we saw weaker demand than we expected. U.S. business investment as a percent of GDP continues to be low. Growth expectations in the economy have been rising, but we've yet to see that translate into economic gains or demand. We're still hopeful that growing consumer confidence and the possibly of tax reform will turn into increased business investment later this year, but the near-term view is cautious. We also continue to see the impact of technology shifts away from the traditional voice lines and other legacy services.","Customers are still buying our strategic business services, which were up more than $200 million in the quarter. And wireless service revenues grew in the quarter, but lower equipment sales pressured overall results. Like in other parts of our business, we stayed ahead with a relentless focus on cost efficiencies. You can see that in our margins. Margins actually expanded by 90 basis points and were the highest in four years, and that included improvements in both wireline and wireless margins. Our business team is doing a good job in a tough situation. Increasing profitability in a challenging revenue environment is not easy.","Meanwhile, our international businesses had a very good quarter. We grew revenues in both our Latin American and Mexican operations, improved margins and added customers. In fact, EBITDA has more than doubled year over year. We've made a lot of headway in building our network and our brand in Mexico. We now reach 85 million people with our LTE networks; we've rebranded, updated, and opened new stores and trained our people. We are now actively scaling our customer base to match those investments.","We added 3 million subscribers last year, and we had a good start to this year by adding more than 600,000 new customers in the first quarter. That brings our customer base to 12.6 million. Revenue grew and margins improved both sequentially and year over year. Latin America satellite operations also showed revenue growth and margin expansion. Revenues were up more than 10%, even when excluding the foreign exchange lift in the quarter. The bottom line for our video business in Latin America is that it's profitable and continues to generate positive free cash flow.","Now, before I turn this over to Randall, let me quickly review our outlook for the year. As we told you earlier in the year, when the FirstNet contract was officially awarded, we would update our 2017 guidance, and we'll update again following the close of the Time Warner acquisition. Because the FirstNet state opt-in process is expected to flow into the fourth quarter, FirstNet is now expected to have little impact on our 2017 P&L results. That being said, the FirstNet build efforts and reimbursement process might have a manageable impact on CapEx and cash flows, depending upon the timing of FirstNet reimbursement. So as it relates to guidance we're still expecting adjusted EPS growth in the mid-single digit range. We're expecting adjusted operating margin expansion even in the current competitive environment. Our capital spending guidance remains in the $22 billion range, but with FirstNet it could be at the higher end of that $22 billion range. And free cash flow is expected to be in the $18 billion range, and it may be a little bit on the low end of the range with the timing of the FirstNet reimbursements.","You'll notice that we have stopped providing revenue guidance. The reason is pretty simple: Upgrades rates are hitting record lows. Our revenue forecasts depend on how many phones we expect to sell during the year, and that's uncertain. And we don't know how much demand there will be for any of the new product offerings that come out. Changes in customer phone buying habits have minimal impact on our profitability, but it does make revenue forecasts more unpredictable.","With that, I would now like to hand this over to Randall Stephenson, who is going to provide a strategic update on our overall business. Randall?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks, John. Listen, I thought what we'd do before we get into the strategy update is just \u2013 I wanted to just give you my take on the quarter, and there's just a handful of things that stood out. And the first was that churn was up significantly on our standalone pay TV product, and that's where TV isn't bundled with our other services. And that's really what's behind the decline in TV subscribers for the quarter. And so you should expect us to make some adjustments in the market to address that as we move into the rest of the year.","The second thing I'd call out is the performance in cost management. And to grow EPS \u2013 and John pointed this out, but to grow EPS and cash flow and expand margins in this kind of competitive environment I think is noteworthy, and it doesn't happen without some really terrific execution in driving costs out. And it's that execution on the cost side that gives us a lot of confidence to reaffirm our profit outlook for the year, and that's a big deal.","My third observation is one that John talked at length about, and that's the return of unlimited plans. And obviously this has made an already competitive market even more so. And our response to the unlimited data plans was probably a little slow. And we lost some share in the quarter, but it was really important that our unlimited offers be unique and play to our strengths. And John talked about this as well a little bit. But we're combining our unlimited with some significant discounts on TV and free HBO, and as these offers are now in the market our subscriber metrics have returned to kind of the same levels they were before all these unlimited offers began.","And kind of the sum of it is it appears the industry has gone through a lot of activity during the quarter and has essentially landed back in the same place where it started. So what the return of unlimited really highlights, and that is the industry's position in terms of network capacity, because if the industry is going to stay with unlimited, we're prepared and can probably sustain it better than anyone else because of our spectrum position. And it is the best in the industry.","And this would probably be a good place to talk about the foundation that we've built for a world of intense video consumption in the world of mobility, and so let's go to slide 10. This network we've built, it was designed for video. And our LTE network covers more than 400 million people in Latin America, and this morning we announced that we're significantly increasing the network speeds in several major cities this year as part of our 5G evolution. And Austin is now live. Indianapolis will turn up this summer, and then at least 18 additional markets will be turned up later this year. And then we have the new Samsung Galaxy S8, which is the first device that's going to be able to take advantage of these higher speeds.","Obviously our satellite distribution is very well-equipped for a world with 4K video, and it covers the U.S. and most of Latin America. We have the largest fiber footprint in the country. We pass nearly 6 million business locations with fiber today, and we're in the process of deploying fiber to more than 12.5 million customer locations by 2019. Now, this fiber footprint is proving to be a huge competitive advantage as the industry is moving towards 5G. We're also leading the industry in software-defined networking, and this is the driving force behind our cost structure. And it's also changing how we deliver new services.","And then on spectrum, it became clear several years ago as we began to anticipate a world of premium mobile video that spectrum would be the difference maker. So we took a deliberate strategic approach to building up our position, and today we have the leading spectrum position in the U.S., and I'm going to discuss that more here in a moment.","All these investments are creating a very unique platform for what we think is a very unique customer base. It's 147 million mobile subscribers, 47 million pay TV subscribers, a fast-growing OTT video service, and 16 million broadband subscribers.","And if you look at slide 11, I now want to drill down on this spectrum position that we've spoken of a lot here on this call. We picked up 20 megahertz of nationwide mid-band spectrum with our WCS acquisition back in 2012. Recall this is where we picked up a lot of companies and the FCC helped us get these licenses for mobile broadband. Then we bought another 20 megahertz of mid-band spectrum in the 2015 spectrum auction, and that block covers virtually the entire country. Then after extensive assessment of the FirstNet RFP, we set winning the contract as a top priority for this company. We worked it hard, and our effort paid off last month. And along with winning FirstNet, we get another 20 megahertz of premium low-band spectrum to build this network. And then any surplus capacity can be used for our commercial customers. And then finally we shut down our analog 2G network last year, and we're redeploying that spectrum nationwide as well.","So you add it all up. We now have more than 60 megahertz of fallow spectrum that we're ready to light up, and we'll be deploying all the bands simultaneously starting this fall when states begin to opt in to the FirstNet. The efficiencies we'll gain from climbing the tower once to put up multiple bands of spectrum, those efficiencies are significant. And we're going to see those cost savings and the network performance materialize immediately and then throughout the life of this multiyear buildout.","And so with that, let's talk about 5G. As you know, it requires higher band spectrum that can transmit huge amounts of data over very short distances. So earlier this year we announced our first millimeter wave acquisition with FiberTower. And this gives us a very nice nationwide deep footprint in the higher bands. We filed for the license transfer, and we expect the FCC to approve this in late summer. Then a few weeks ago we announced our intent to acquire Straight Path and its nationwide millimeter licenses, and there's now a competing offer, as John pointed out, and we're going to be evaluating that over the next few days and decide how to respond. The bottom line: We've built the overall leading spectrum position that's going to allow us to fulfill our goal. And our goal is to put 1 gig speeds in our customers' hands no matter where they are on our network.","Before I get to your questions, I'd like to briefly address what's been going on in Washington, and there's an outline of that on slide 12. It's obviously been an amazing few months in our industry. And there's clearly a return to a lighter touch pro-growth regulatory philosophy, and that's not only in our industry but it's across all industries right now, and we think this is incredibly positive for our country and that it could catalyze the economic growth all of us have been looking for.","On the Time Warner deal approval, it's moving along as expected. The European Commission has approved it. The Department of Justice is now reviewing it, and we're working closely with them to answer any questions that they may have. On the FCC side, since there are no license transfers involved, we don't anticipate the FCC will review it at all. So bottom line, we continue to expect approval of the deal end of this year.","On regulation in general, the changes at the FCC have been quite positive. The controversial rules around business data services that had been proposed earlier have been abandoned, and they've been replaced by a logical, commonsense approach that preserves competition. The proposed set-top box regulations are now off the table.","On data privacy, the president has signed legislation that should give us a consistent set of rules that apply equally to all companies. And then Title II regulation is under review, and I want to be real clear about this. We do continue to support fundamental tenets of net neutrality, and we remain committed to open Internet rules that are fair and equal to all players. However, we do continue to think it's illogical to regulate the Internet using rules that were put in place 83 years ago for the rotary dial telephone. We're hopeful the FCC will follow through on that as well.","On corporate tax reform, we continue to believe that something does get done this year, but the timing and the magnitude of it are anybody's guess. But achieving competitive corporate tax rates, this is probably the biggest catalyst available for our public policymakers if they want to increase capital investment and job creation, so we think this is really important.","And so with that, Mike, I'm going to hand it back to you, and we can go to questions.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Okay. Kathy, we're ready for the Q&As, and we'll take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Go ahead, please.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys. Maybe first on the -","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Hey, John.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Hey. How you guys doing? First on the satellite business, or the linear TV, are you guys seeing cannibalization from the DIRECTV NOW product? And the churn you mentioned, is there a way you could ascribe it to maybe traditional competitors versus these over-the-top guys? And have you seen that accelerate since the launch of YouTube TV a few weeks ago? That's first.","And then maybe on the Straight Path and FiberTower deals, could you just comment on how quickly you think that gets deployed? And is the holdings of the millimeter wave spectrum that you would have if you were able to successfully complete the Straight Path transaction, is that sort of what you need to sort of fulfill your sort of 5G initiatives? Thanks.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","I'll start, John, and I'll let John Stephens clean up after me, okay? On the satellite question, there's obviously some cannibalization of DIRECTV NOW, but it's fairly nominal, to be quite honest with you. The satellite churn that I referenced, I mean, it is heavily concentrated, John, in those customers where we just have a standalone TV product. It's not bundled with broadband or it's not bundled with our wireless service. And so obviously it's a world where the integrated offers are what's winning in the marketplace. And so you can figure out who we're losing those subscribers to; it's traditional cable players.","And so this is where we're going to have to get aggressive in a number of areas, moving aggressively on bundling these satellite customers with our wireless offers and also doing some new things in the marketplace that we think can shore this up. But it's no secret where these are coming from; it's coming from integrated offers from other players in the market. And where we have multi-product bundles in the marketplace, those customers, the churn rates continue to be very strong. And in fact you saw our postpaid phone churn, 0.9%. You put TV or broadband with it, and those churn rates just get even better. So we continue to be big, big advocates of the integrated bundle and multiple service bundles. And so we don't see that changing. It's going to require us to get a little more aggressive in those single-play, standalone TV offers.","On Straight Path and FiberTower, so we've talked at length about when the standards are going to be out for 5G. I think we're now in 2018 time horizon.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","2018.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","And so having equipment and handsets, we're talking 2019 before we start deploying in 2020 when you probably have what I would call scaled offerings. If we get both Straight Path and FiberTower accomplished, it pretty much fills our spectrum requirements we need for a long period of time as it relates to 5G deployment, John. So right now this is all preparing for the future of 5G, and the standards are on track, and we hope to be deploying and putting this spectrum to work in the 2018-2019 timeframe, scaling in 2020.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","John, with regard to that on \u2013 as Randall said, the FiberTower itself gives us a base of 39 gigahertz nationwide to really build on and plan on. And so that in and of itself is a great starting point and gives our network team an opportunity to incorporate that planning into our project evolution and this next-generation network. When you look at Straight Path, it really has two holdings, the 39 gigahertz, which would complement FiberTower's and give us that depth that we would prefer, and so that would be great, but it also adds a strong 28 gigahertz piece, which we could incorporate into our network and use that way, or we could, as we've done in the past, use as an opportunity for spectrum swaps to take advantage of other opportunities.","I can give you a perfect example; this last quarter I mentioned that we had about a $100 million gain on the spectrum swap with Verizon, where we traded some PCS and AWS \u2013 three licenses to get both of ourselves in a better position to serve our customers. So that's where I'd leave us. The 39 gigahertz would be a great depth of position, and quite frankly with FiberTower an opportunity to really plan on that build as we go into project evolution.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, John. You mentioned project evolution. Can we talk about the timing of the FirstNet process and evolution? My impression is you have a lot of pressure to get that deployed, and given the timing of the state build process it could take a while. What are the things we should be watching to see this ramp up, and what happens in states where you don't get the state to come along on your FirstNet effort? And then, Randall, can you just talk quickly about \u2013 how do you see \u2013 I guess this is also for John, though. Any big issues in the corporate tax discussion that you might see out there, that we should be sort of cognizant of? Thank you.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","So, hey, Phil, good afternoon. First of all, in the FirstNet process, we'll post the state plans here in June, open up the opportunity for the states to opt in. We'll actively work with the states, try to answer any questions, concerns they have, stay and (30:06) work with them and with the FirstNet organization, who have been really good to work with, and convincing the states that opting in is the right answer. So we'll go through that process through the summer and hope to get the states to move as quickly as possible with the, if you will, encouragement, that we are ready to go, and the first ones that opt in are going to get that first investment in their state, that build in their state, that job creation in their state. So we think that's a good strategy.","Secondly, with regard to your question about opting out, there's a couple of things that make it challenging, I think, for a state to go down that route. One is, there is a collection of funding that's related to the contract winner, ourselves, with regard to setting some national standards, setting up portals and other abilities to communicate with FirstNet responders, to communicate with states, to set national standards of interoperability, and so forth. Those monies are committed to the award winner and not to the states. Secondly, if the states choose to go it alone, they take the risk of any project cost overruns. And third, they generally don't have \u2013 and quite frankly one of our largest competitors doesn't have any owned network in the states to rely on, so they have a huge catch-up to do with a company like ours.","So we feel really good about the process and think that we are going to \u2013 we'll be very cooperative, we'll be very encouraging with the states to work with them, to make sure they feel comfortable. But our target is all 56 \u2013 50 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia. We want to win them all, and that's our goal, so that's how we'll go about it.","Randy, you want to take corporate tax?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","I'll talk corporate tax. We can tag-team this one, too, because John is actively involved with folks in Congress on this. But, look, there appears to be significant motivation and significant interest by all parties to get our corporate tax rate to a more competitive level, and you can't find anybody in Washington \u2013 you might be able to find one or two, but it's rare to find even somebody in Washington who would argue that our tax rates are uncompetitive on corporations. So there is a definite interest in seeing this move.","From a business standpoint, what we're all advocating is really simple: It's got to be a competitive rate, and it needs to be a territorial system for taxing profits overseas. And if it was just a matter of trying to get to a competitive rate, that is probably achievable in short order. If you said what's a competitive rate, 25%, 26%, 27%, that's probably inherently achievable, and that would be very advantageous to the U.S. But I think there are some who aspire to try to do better than that, and you heard the president just this week articulate a desire and in fact challenged his team in the White House to get to a 15% rate.","Now, we would obviously stand up and cheer; we'd be huge advocates of that. But I think the practical reality of getting to 15% is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation. So can you get some fashion of dynamic scorekeeping to justify it? The second is to get to a 15% rate without just blowing out the budget, you probably have to consider things like either VATs or border adjustment taxes, and we know the emotion that those are met with across the country. Now, we would probably be supportive, candidly, AT&T, if we could get a tax rate to 15%, we would be supportive of those kind of vehicles to make it happen, but we as a business may be in a minority in terms of entities receptive to those kind of vehicles to help get the tax rate down.","So there's going to be a lot of thrashing on this in Congress and with the White House in terms of really what is the objective and if the president is committed to a 15% tax, it's going to have to \u2013 it's going to take some kind of really serious changes in how we tax corporations to get there. Which we happen to think would be quite positive to economic growth and capital investment in this country. What would you add, John?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, with that economic growth, capital investment drives revenue for us, and that's really as important as the tax savings that driving those revenues would really be significant. And we would be able to invest with the cash flow benefit on a more rapid pace than even we are now.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","What's interesting is \u2013 you remember the Dave Camp proposal. You can get to a 25% to 28% rate just by getting rid of all the loopholes and exclusions, and that would be nice, that would be really helpful, but \u2013 and I think it would stimulate some growth. It's just not game-changer, if you will.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","So let me make one other comment about FirstNet to make sure (35:22). We'll make some investments here starting right away with regard to the portals, with regard to the interoperability standard, that kind of equipment, that kind of investment, and that could affect our operating expenses and our CapEx. But we'll get reimbursements from the FirstNet fund, and we're expecting those to kind of generally offset in this year. Secondly, the reason for the not-significant impact on our financial results in 2017 from the overall is that \u2013 two things. One, the states opting in probably in the fourth quarter timeframe, at least in large numbers. And two, the spectrum being put to use generally being up and running in probably 2018 and at the earliest late 2017, but probably more like 2018.","In the accounting world, those two things will drive the accounting activity, and so the accounting for the spectrum costs and other things that are involved in this really don't start until you place that spectrum into service or until you've got completion of the state opt-in process. That's why we're saying, while there may be some impact, it's not going to be material. But I will add, if we were convinced that a state was opting in, if they had elected so and we had appropriate approvals from the state and the FirstNet authorities, we would be willing to start that investment process right away. We are anxious to get going, and we have the vendors lined up and the opportunity lined up to get it done.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. John, maybe just a quick comment on the wireless share loss, where you're seeing that. Is it more family share plans, or is it single lines and feature phones? And then on ARPU, what should we think about going forward as far as stabilization?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Mike. Let me say on the share loss, the feature phone continued to lose, but quite frankly with the unlimited plans being announced, we did see an uptick in the family plan losses and the attention on that. As we've come back with these unlimited plans and specifically with the offers to give the (37:43) $25 credit on DTV or DTV NOW and the opportunity for the HBO feature. We have seen the plans come back down, and we believe that part of the reason that's coming back to, if you will, normal or to pre-unlimited offer rates is because it's holding onto the families. We still need to go through that. It's been just a couple, three weeks, so it's early. But, yes, we did see some impact on both the standalone, if you will, feature phone type that we've seen in the past and the family plan.","With regard to ARPU, I would suggest to you we still have a little bit to go with regard to ARPU because we have really smart customer base, and they go through this process of figuring out which is the best plan for them and going to it, and that'll continue on. Secondly, we still have some customers on plans that have overage. And, as I said, if they're smart customers, they will migrate over to these unlimited plans and work through that.","But we are \u2013 I will tell you, if you look at our service revenues for the quarter, about 1% of the decline was really related to a decision we made last year to get out of the resale business in one of our specific large resale contracts, or to reduce that business, because the prices just weren't appropriate, and capacity was going to be important to us for our quality customers. And so we've seen some of the service revenue declines based on our decisions to back off of that reseller market, and I think you saw that in our customer counts. You saw it in our customer counts this quarter, but you saw it in our customer counts at the end of last year in the reseller market. And that was just a solid business decision we made based on realization \u2013 ARPU and per meg realization.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead, please.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first one would be, John, for you. If we kind of look at the mid-single digit earnings per share growth target, it kind of implies that we've got to maintain this $0.74 level of earnings for most of the rest of the year, and coming off the kind of all-time low handset upgrade rate, it's more likely than not it's going to be a headwind as we go into the Galaxy and then the iPhone later this year. Can you kind of walk us through the geography of the income statement, where we offset those headwinds and generate the kind of positive mid-single digit earnings growth? And then the second question, if I could, would be maybe either for you or maybe Randall, just on this SD-WAN. It's a big emerging topic, a big conversation about whether it's a threat or an opportunity, especially for an incumbent like yourselves. And finally how real it is as a technology in the world. That would be super helpful. Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure. Let me try the EPS question first, Dave. Let me go to this. If I harken back to a comment I made in a presentation that we had about a penny \u2013 $0.02 of pressure in the quarter, a penny from some legal settlements, some IP, and other issues; and quite frankly a penny from some storm costs. And we did not adjust for them. But if you look at our results, taking those out, you see the quarter of $0.76, and you can understand then that the growth rate goes up to just under 6%, and you can understand how we would feel that that quarter supports an ongoing activity.","You're right; we could have a step up in equipment sales and upgrade rates. We're just admitting that we can't predict that at this time. But generally speaking, if that happens, we have significant offsets, whether it be the next accounting, whether it be the revenue recognition, or quite frankly if it's just the benefits of having customer additions and the additional service revenues and so forth. So that's something that does not scare us, so to speak. We can manage through that.","The third thing is, as we mentioned, the entire team here has been really focused on costs. But as we go quarter by quarter, we continue to increase the network function virtualization percentages, and we're on this march from 34% at the end of last year to 55% at the end of this year. So that's just going to continue on in generating savings, and we're getting to that point where the mass or the base of savings that we have, getting it to 40% and 50%, starts overcoming the reinvestment dollars that are required to grow it. So all that put together, that's why we feel comfortable about staying in the hunt for that guidance and keeping things moving forward.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","On the SD-WAN, yeah, it's real. It tends to be real down-market, David, and you should assume that we're developing capability ourselves, because it's a viable offer down-market. We're seeing some effect from it. It's not material yet, but we think it's a legitimate capability. We need to be there; we need to have it. And so up-market, the traditional VPN capability is always, we think, is going to be the enduring capability. But down-market, we're going to have to be prepared to compete with this kind of offering.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","David, Mike just reminded me \u2013 one other thing I'll mention to you is that if you noticed that improvement we had in the first quarter in Mexico and the fact that that customer base is now close to 13 million \u2013 I think we're at 12.6 million. And it was an investment cycle all of last year, and it's starting to turn. The team down there is doing well. But I'd suggest to you that's another support for our business proposition for the year. We need to keep working at it, and we need to keep that market strengthening, but we feel good about the fact that that provides us another opportunity.","Secondly, I will tell you that the DIRECTV Latin America properties are just really \u2013 it's a lot of elbow grease. It's a lot of hard work, but they're doing well for us in what is challenging environments. But they are producing, and that's helping, too. So they may not be the focus of most of our discussions, but they sure are helping with our efforts this year.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you both.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to go back and talk a little bit about some of the elevated churn you signaled where you have an unbundled video product. I think it's easy to envision some of the corrective measures you could take within your traditional landline region, especially in light of all the fiber that you're deploying. So I was hoping we could maybe just spend a little bit more time talking about how you think about fortifying the bundle that you can offer outside that traditional region. You talked a little bit about some of the millimeter wave licenses, but is there really a broader set of options you think you have to go into the market to make sure your bundle remains differentiated nationwide?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Yeah, there's a few things, Brett. In the short run, obviously it's bundling DIRECTV standalone with wireless outside of our traditional footprint where we don't have a broadband product. So bundling with wireless is really, really important. That is a part of the customer base, the standalone that has been also somewhat sheltered \u2013 is that the right word? \u2013 by virtue of being rural in nature. And so being rural in nature, it's harder to find an opportunity to bundle. Well, we have CAF II funding. We are turning up right now, wireless local loop is the term we use, but basically it's a wireless fixed broadband solution. 400,000 that we're turning up. We have an opportunity to turn up a lot of these. As we build FirstNet, by the way, we have to turn up significant improvements to our entire rural footprint, and so having a wireless opportunity to provide a broadband bundle into rural America really can shore up this customer base.","And so traditional wireless \u2013 go immediately with bundling traditional wireless. Obviously there are some things we could do just on price, and we'll do some promotional things. But then getting our fiber local loop product that is being rolled out right now, being introduced as we speak, getting it targeted to these customers, can also shore this up. So it's a multi-pronged effort.","And then longer term, you mentioned it. Longer term, 5G. This is the nationwide broadband opportunity. As we turn up 5G, we can now have a very high speed, competitive-with-cable broadband offering in all the major metropolitan countries where we don't have traditional fixed line footprint. So it's about to be a new competitive game as we get into the world of 5G, and we're getting very, very enthusiastic about it. And just what I would call fixed type configurations of 5G will come out before mobile configurations. So 2018, we'll be doing some fixed line deployments of 5G, and you'll be seeing some of that. And even the offerings, the speed increases we're doing right now in Austin that we just announced, we're talking competitive to cable speeds on our wireless network in Austin, soon to be Indianapolis and 18 other markets this year.","So the competitive landscape is changing, and I think \u2013 we are convinced it's going to change faster than a lot of people believe it will, that we're going to have some truly substitutable capabilities in the wireless infrastructure with some of our fixed line competitors. So we're optimistic, and we still think the bundle offering is going to be very, very important in the long term.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure, Brett.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Go ahead, please.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much, and good afternoon, folks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Hi, Amir.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Hey, Amir.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understanding that fluctuations in handset sales are the primary driver for your shift in your top line guidance policy, I was wondering if you could provide some color on how you think about the cash flow trajectory of the business? John, I know you mentioned there are some fluctuations depending on the timing of FirstNet reimbursements this year, but how should we think about the long-term ability to grow cash flow organically against this evolving competitive landscape, and potentially inclusive of Time Warner?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","That's a good question, Amir. I mean, I feel really good about our opportunities to carry cash flow. And the best way I can explain it is what we saw on margins. The margins improvement was up and down from this cost initiatives, whether we talk about network function virtualization, whether we talk about digitization, whether we talk about automation, whether we \u2013 even as we have some challenges with regard to our legacy revenues, we have opportunities then to shed legacy costs.","So I'm comfortable with where we're at on cash flows for the year. I will also tell you, the oddity of it is, handsets slow down, we have the outlay for handsets on an up-front basis, and then receive monthly payments for the \u2013 payments over time. So, as that happens, even with our next financing with the banks, it actually can relieve some of the pressure off of the companies because the next outlay for, if you will, the equipment outlay for handsets, actually slows.","You guys know the background on the Time Warner and its capability to generate cash, and its much different capital intensity structure, as well as its great margin business, so we're very excited on being able to combine the two, about being able to farm out some growth initiatives and some cost savings, and so we look forward to that. We are still on a track to grow cash flows that we believe is so important, to not just \u2013 and not at all \u2013 I mean, it's very important to sustain and continue to grow the dividend. But not just that, but to create real wealth and opportunities and flexibility for the company on a going-forward basis.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then just one follow up, if I may. Seems like we're beginning to see demonstrable shifts in the regulatory landscape. For example, as you mentioned, Randall, we saw recent developments in BDS legislation, and it also seems like we may see some updated thoughts on the future of net neutrality in the coming days. How do you feel about the prospects of your integrated service provider offering against this shifting regulatory backdrop? In other words, are there new opportunities for monetizing your portfolio of assets in ways that previously may not have been available?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Yeah, it's an interesting question. I would tell you the area that we are most focused on, and we're obviously very cautious about ensuring that we get our customers' consent to use data. But as we bring Time Warner into the family at AT&T, we are convinced that we can really enhance Time Warner's advertising revenue streams by virtue of some of the customer data, the viewership data, that we have on the distribution side of the house.","And, as an example, we have a little advertising business on the AT&T side today. It's about a $1.5 billion business, and it's growing at double digits. And what we're doing with customer consent where appropriate, we're doing addressable advertising, and getting very localized on the advertising that's delivered to our customers. And we're getting revenues per impression that are 3x and 4x what you would consider traditional revenue per impression in this industry.","Well, to what extent can we have that same type of impact on the Time Warner, the Turner Network advertising revenues, which are much more substantial than the AT&T revenue streams? And so there are some opportunities there. As the rules are clarified as it relates to the utilization of data, and then we have our own policies in terms of getting customer consent and working hard to get our customer consent to do this. But this provides new opportunities for new revenue streams and just improving yield on existing revenue streams.","And then obviously there was a lot of consternation at the end of last year with the former FCC surrounding things like sponsored data and set-top box and so forth. Well, all of those issues and those concerns are now gone, and so the ability to do some unique pricing on sponsored data and so forth are now in front of us and available to us, and in a world of unlimited it changes how that looks and so forth. But as we have the need to use flexibility to differentiate our offers, it gives us some new opportunities to do those things. So we're actually very positive.","The thing I'm most encouraged about, though, with the new tone in the FCC, is it probably, Amir, doesn't offer a whole lot of new opportunity for new services, but it takes a decision point out of the investment philosophy. If you want to invest in a new capability, if you want to invest in fixed wireless local loop, if you want to invest in 5G, you don't have this stop, pause, how is this going to be regulated? We have a pretty good idea now that it's going to be regulated with somewhat of a light touch as long as there's competitive alternatives in the marketplace, and that just changes the whole investment philosophy, and I think it's going to free up investment as we move forward. And you combine that with tax reform, I think even this industry that has been the top investor in the country for the last five years, this industry can actually go higher in investment if you get these kind of changes.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much for the incremental color.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","You bet.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about fiber. With Verizon's announcement last week, it's kind of a game-changer, as you alluded to, in terms of out-of-network footprint. And as you expand fiber, I assume it's easier to do so in your own ILEC footprint. What are your thoughts on outside that ILEC footprint? Will you pursue a similar path? And does that require further fiber investment or possible acquisitions? Thank you.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","So, Jennifer, let me take a stab at it, and I'll ask Randall to comment on it. But first and foremost, I think we need to get some clarity with regard to how we measure fiber and whether you measure it by miles of fiber covered or by strands within the payer, within the fiber itself. That gives a differentiating aspect to the magnitude of the dollars being talked about in the marketplace. But you're right, we're on a significant investment in fiber with the 12.5 million fiber-to-the-prem, but quite frankly, because of our legacy of our business, both the local exchange business which we've held onto in that historic Bell operating company business which gives us a tremendous footprint, but also the legacy Long Lines business, which had fiber throughout the country. And so we do have more fiber than anyone else as it exists today.","What we look at, though \u2013 and we're open. We make evaluations on build or buy all the time with regard to backhaul for towers and that kind of fiber initiatives. What we will do is we will look at all the opportunities out there and decide whether it's going to be cheaper to buy or build. But we are open to it. We believe we have a big lead because of what we've been doing over the last five years in our VIP investments. We believe we have a big lead because we have the largest, if you will, legacy consumer business and the footprint associated with the Bell operating companies, and we also have a big lead with regard to the extensive fiber that was part of the AT&T Long Lines business. So when you put all of that together, we feel very good about it. We continue to invest, I would suggest, at \u2013 as much as, if not more than anybody's investing right now in fiber. It's very significant.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","I mean, we've talked about this for many years, Jennifer, and obviously, we gave some thought and consideration to would we create value if we separated our fixed line and our wireless business a few years ago. And I've got to tell you, the thing that caused you the greatest pause as you thought about doing those things was this wireless business is going to need the fiber access. It's going to need that last mile fixed line access. And so having a big footprint of fixed line access was always going to be critical.","And as we now move into the world of 5G, as we're deploying fiber to 12.5 million homes, it's just \u2013 you're looking for the capillaries. If you deploy to a home, what capillaries does that make available for deploying small cells? What capillaries are now being run to businesses? And so it's just \u2013 it begins to feed on itself and the incremental costs of that next kind of layer of fiber goes down. And then, as John said, we make literally daily decisions outside our traditional footprint on lease versus buy, and there's plenty of fiber available. Dark fiber is available in virtually all metropolitan areas, and so our ability to buy access to fiber for 5G is readily available. And where the cost or the availability isn't there, we will run fiber. So I think the U.S. is going to see a lot of fiber being deployed over the next few years as a byproduct of 5G, and I like where we stand in that race. I think we start with a head start.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Jennifer, one other thing I'd add is, and this could be repeated kind of on every question we've had, but the FirstNet contract award and the requirements that it provides to build out a nationwide first responder network and the funding that it provides to do that, gives us a great opportunity to incorporate \u2013 and the team has done this \u2013 incorporate fiber builds and fiber requirements both \u2013 not only for FirstNet in and of itself but anything they can leverage off of that. And we do this with building \u2013 as we've talked about before with the one tower climb and putting the AWS-3, the WCS spectrum to use at the same time we're doing the 700 MHz, but in all aspects of the FirstNet contract, it's providing us a real opportunity to leverage off the existing fiber and then to further add to what we consider to be the lead in that market that we have.","Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much for the color.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","And, Kathy, this is Mike. We're going to only be able to take one more call. I apologize to the folks that are in the queue. We won't be able to get all the calls in tonight. But we'll take one more.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","John and Randall are taking too much time answering questions, aren't we?","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Then our final question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. Many thanks. So, John, I understand the uncertainty around the phone sales. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about what exactly are you hearing from the field? Is this the natural impact of EIP? Is this people \u2013 just no form factor change? Do you expect this to come back? The Galaxy's obviously been delayed. Any more color around should we be thinking about there's something that has changed dramatically or this is just a pause and we'll get back to some more normal rates? And then, Randall, just continuing on the fiber, you've talked about the 12 million. What's the strategy for the copper getting the speeds up to have a competitive broadband product there where you may not be planning to roll fiber right now? What can you do with those lines to stay competitive? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Let me take the phone sales first, Simon. And quite frankly, you made a lot of the right points. The first thing is we are seeing a change with regard to next, if you will, and the impact that customers have \u2013 are understanding the costs of a phone differently; they're reacting differently. We're saying that not only in the slower (1:00:44), but we continue to have in this kind of 400,000 or 500,000 a quarter BYOD devices. So not only are they \u2013 when they do buy another phone, they are holding onto the other one and handing it down, giving it to someone else to use. And so we're seeing that. That is an impact of it.","There has been a lot of discussion that most of the changes in the phone's capabilities are software enabled. We talk about it wanting to do it from our network perspective. We're seeing a little bit of it in the handset business, where the upgrades to the capabilities are software focused as opposed to form factors. So that's it. We are actually seeing, so to speak, a slowness in overall consumer activity. It seems like while the consumers \u2013 the economics and the consumer world may be improving, it seems like they're being very careful, and so that's a third thing.","We have studied it, everything from the amount of tax refund dollars that impacts and when that comes in to all those things we've looked at. I would suggest to you I think it is a more permanent change in the environment because of the change in who pays for it. I don't believe \u2013 I'm not trying to suggest it's going to stay at this 30.9% rate. I would expect that it will come back, not only for new phones coming out but quite frankly, for example, as we, if you will, get our network even hotwired more than it is as the Austin-type situation, where you can get multiple hundred meg speeds on your phones, you'll see people want to get those devices, so I think that'll help. But I clearly believe it is a permanent change from where we were in the subsidy model, and I believe that the upgrade rates will be down on a permanent basis.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","And the copper plant, Simon, it's real simple. It's wireless. It's 5G and that's, I mean, we'll continue to push the envelope with fiber deeper and deeper, but you get to a place on the fixed line side where it doesn't make sense to keep running fiber and economically. And our default architecture long-term, default architecture, is a wireless architecture, and so the world of 5G, that's when the copper gets replaced with a high-speed wireless offering to the home.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","How close does the fiber have to get to the home for that vision?","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","It obviously depends on what speeds you want, right? But if you think about where we have copper today, you don't have a ton of situations where you need a gig of bandwidth. But, as we said, our objective is to get a gig of bandwidth to everybody we touch. And so in a world of 5G, you should think of a 200-meter propagation, all right, so that takes a lot, but you don't need in suburban and rural America those kind of bandwidths to be competitive. And so you can go to your traditional cell structure, use more traditional spectrum positions, and get very competitive speeds in those areas with wireless, even with an LTE arrangement.","So think about the configuration in Austin. You're going to get some serious, serious bandwidth there. You have the potential for 500 or 600 meg. Now, obviously on a loaded network you're going to get about a tenth of that, but 50, 60 meg? That's a competitive offer, and we think we have a lot of legs with that and that over time just keep pushing the small cell structure deeper and deeper.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","We haven't mentioned, and I think you all know this, but with the move towards carrier aggregation and four-way, which the Galaxy S8 has the capability of doing that, with regard to MIMO and the ability to have the on- and off-ramps operate much quickly and move into that QAM 256, all three of those things are now available for us, and we're working this true (1:04:49) our Austin, and we're seeing tremendous, tremendous results there. So that's what's so encouraging about us, particularly about this continuation of wireless and this opportunity to support an overall broadband solution, as well as coordinate it with a FirstNet build that is consistent with the government's requirements.","Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Simon, I appreciate the question. With that, I want to thank everybody for being on the call and just a couple closing comments. It was a competitive quarter, both in wireless and video for us, and we took some steps and made some adjustments in the market to try and address this, and we'll continue to do that. But at the same time, we were able to grow adjusted earnings and adjusted margins in this environment as we drove cost out of the business, kept going hard on software-defined networking, and a year from now I think we're going to look back on the return to unlimited plans as the moment when the battle for network reach and capacity really began. And we're prepared for the fight, we're ready to go. And so, thanks again for being on the call, and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And, ladies and gentleman, that does conclude our conference for today.

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. It's really great to have you with us this morning. As John mentioned, this is Brooks McCorcle, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T, and on the call joining me this morning are Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. Randall will provide opening comments, then John will cover our results, and then we'll follow with Qs & As.","Let me remind you that our earnings material is available in the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. As a reminder, that is www.att.com\/investor.relations.","I also need to reference our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3, and that says that this presentation and comments may contain forward-looking statements. They're subject to risks, and details are in our SEC filings and on AT&T's website.","With that, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Randall Stephenson. Randall?","Randall L. Stephenson","Thanks, Brooks. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with just a couple of brief comments on 2011, then what I want to do is just move into our plans and outlook for 2012. And 2011 was obviously an eventful year not only for us but the entire industry, and what I hope didn't get lost in all the news cycles on mergers and iPhones is what AT&T accomplished during the course of the year and really how that positioned us for 2012.","We came out of 2011 with each of our key growth platforms, mobile broadband, strategic business services and U-verse, all growing at strong double digits. That means better than 3\/4 of our total revenues now come from wireless data and managed services and those have a combined growth rate above 7%. We had really strong mobile sales throughout the year. In fact, we had a blowout holiday season. And in the fourth quarter, we sold 9.4 million smartphones, that's 50% above our previous record.","In the year, when our competitors began selling the iPhone, we outsold them in every single quarter. We also led all competitors in total wireless subs added, 7.7 million for the year. And we're #1 in just about every key mobile broadband growth metric: smartphones, emerging devices, postpaid data ARPU and customers on tiered pricing plans.","And when you look at the network side of the equation, this was, for us, an unprecedented year. We challenged our network team to push call retainability on our 3G network above 99% by year end, and we've now hit or beat that 3 months running. We closed the year with 80% of our total mobile data traffic on Ethernet backhaul. That's well ahead of our original plan. And we're pleased to have that deployment behind us because we believe we now have the most robust backhaul infrastructure in the industry. And this is a backhaul infrastructure that is built for data.","On top of this infrastructure and on our HSPA+ platform, we're now deploying 4G LTE. And today, we have the best data speeds in the country. The iPhone 4S on our network has download speeds that are 3x our peers.","In wireline, our U-verse build is now largely complete, so we have in place an IP video and broadband platform that reaches 30 million customer locations, which gives us significant headroom now to drive penetration.","On the business side of the equation, despite the economy, we've executed a very steady climb in revenue trends. We're now 2 straight quarters of sequential increases and we have line of sight to year-over-year growth this year. And we continue to be very, very strong in terms of cash generation capabilities on operations, better than $34 billion for the year.","So with these data points, I'd like to -- I like how we're set up for 2012. And as we sit here in January, I'd tell you, we probably have the best visibility going forward than we've had in quite some time. John is going to cover the outlook in detail, but at a very high level, here is what you ought to expect from us as we go into 2012.","We're going to continue to be very aggressive in growing our mobile broadband franchise. We'll return to revenue growth in our business segments. We'll expand wireless and consolidated margins. We'll achieve mid-single-digit EPS growth or better. Cash generation continues to look very strong again next year. And given the operational momentum we have in the business, all of this appears very achievable and probably at the conservative end of our expectations.","I'd add that this outlook is not dependent on any kind of boost from the economy. Holiday sales suggest there's a possibility for some light tailwinds and we're hopeful for that, but all the core fundamentals suggest we're looking at continued slow U.S. economic growth and then higher unemployment so we built our plans around a fairly low growth scenario.","As we look ahead, the issue that gives me the most concern, quite frankly, isn't our ability to execute. The #1 issue for us as we move forward, and for the industry, I believe, it continues to be spectrum. This industry continues to see just explosive mobile broadband growth and is providing one of the few bright spots in the U.S. economy, but I think we all understand this growth cannot continue without more spectrum being cleared and brought to market. And despite all the speeches from the FCC, we're all still waiting.","The last significant spectrum auction was nearly 5 years ago now. And this FCC has made it abundantly clear that they'll not allow significant M&A to help bridge their delays in freeing up new spectrum. So in the absence of auctions, our company and others in the industry have taken the logical step of entering into smaller transactions to acquire the spectrum we need to meet this demand. But even here, we need the FCC's action and leadership, and unfortunately, even the smallest and most routine spectrum deals are receiving intense scrutiny from this FCC, oftentimes taking up to a year and sometimes longer before these are approved.","Now I hope I'm wrong, but it appears the FCC is intent on picking winners and losers rather than letting these markets work. A lot of recent comments and speeches about certain members of this FCC suggest that they and not Congress should decide how spectrum auctions are conducted, including who can participate and what the conditions should be for participating. Meanwhile, we pile more and more regulatory uncertainty on top of an industry that is a foundation for a lot of today's innovation, making it difficult for all of us to allocate and commit capital. And in this industry, we all know capital investment equals jobs. So the end result of this is we have a industry that is just really stuck in terms of creating real capacity.","We will certainly do our part, as we move forward, to provide leadership on these issues, but it's also clearly time for Congress and the FCC to step up. And in the interim, this environment has a lot of clear implications for our business and these are in 3 different areas. First, while our current overall spectrum position is competitive, we've led the way in mobile data. Therefore, our utilization rates are running very hot and demand continues to accelerate so we'll continue to do a number of things. In a capacity-constrained environment, usage-based data plans, increased pricing, managing the speeds of the highest volume users, these are all logical and necessary steps to manage utilization.","LTE deployment is also going to play a role. We ended 2011 with 74 million LTE POPs covered and we'll accelerate that pace considerably in 2012. This setting us up to complete our deployment to 80% of the U.S. population in 2013. And LTE does give us a 30% to 40% lift in network efficiency, but at current growth rates, that equates to only about a year's increase in traffic, so while LTE is important, it's not the silver bullet in terms of capacity planning. What that means is, to meet customer demand, we have to continue our push to add spectrum in the open market. You'll see us being active there and we'll continue to advocate for more open auctions as soon as possible.","And then second, in this environment, we'll accelerate our efforts to improve our overall growth profile. We'll do that by looking at opportunities to either divest or restructure low-performing and nonstrategic assets. You've seen us do this in the last year or two with our Sterling Commerce sale and the restructure of our Telmex holdings. And you'll see more of these actions over the next 24 months.","And third, given the economic and regulatory situation, it makes sense for us to begin to resume our share repurchase plan. We currently have a 300 million share authorization, that's about 5% of our shares outstanding, and we'll begin to execute on that immediately. And as we go through the year, our Board will likely evaluate further actions.","So our cash flow's strong, the balance sheet is rock solid. We reduced total debt by $6.5 billion in the fourth quarter alone and this gives us a lot of flexibility and a lot of capacity to return value to our owners.","And so with that, I'm going to turn it over to John to cover results and I'll stick around for Q&A. So, John?","John Joseph Stephens","Thank you, Randall, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 6.","2011 was a story of record mobile broadband sales and solid revenue gains. Revenues were up 2% for the year and 3.6% in the fourth quarter alone. Stronger-than-expected smartphone sales also impacted earnings and margins.","In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of a negative $1.12. Excluding $1.54 of mainly noncash onetime items, earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.42. Onetime items included $0.65 of noncash pressure from the year-end mark-to-market change for our benefit plans. The actuarial loss on benefit plans was driven by a reduction in the discount rate from 5.8% to 5.3%. While our investment returns were better than the overall market, they were less than our expectations but that was largely offset by better-than-expected force retention and medical cost management. $0.48 of the noncash pressure is due to asset impairments in our yellow page and directory operations. This was part of an annual review in tangible assets, comparing them to fair market values of similarly situated companies. $0.44 of pressure is due to the previously-announced termination of the T-Mobile USA transaction, and we have $0.03 of help from a tax settlement.","Cash flow continues to be strong: $2 billion in the quarter and $14.4 billion for the year. And when you adjust out the onetime contract termination payment, it was outstanding. Looking ahead to 2012, we expect earnings to grow in the mid-single digits or better for the year.","Now let's look at revenue growth and how our growth drivers are transforming our revenue mix. Details are on Slide 7.","Fourth quarter consolidated revenues totaled $32.5 billion, up 3.6%. For the year, consolidated revenues grew by almost $2.5 billion. The growth drivers were strong mobile broadband results, very good U-verse gains and continued strength in strategic business services. In 2011, 76% of our revenues came from wireless and wireline data and managed services. That's up from 68% or more than $10 billion from just 2 years ago. And revenues from these areas grew about $7 billion last year or more than 7% for 2011. We're confident this mix shift will continue. In fact, in 2012 we expect consolidated revenues to continue to grow, thanks to strength in these growth drivers with little expected lift from the economy.","Now let's take a look at wireless on Slide 8. Our mobility sales channel did an outstanding job, delivering not only the best sales quarter in our history but the best smartphone sales quarter in the history of the industry. We added more than 2.5 million subscribers. This includes gains in every customer category. Postpaid net adds were terrific, with our best performance in 5 quarters, adding 717,000 subscribers. Tablets drove prepaid net adds. Reseller sales continued to be strong, and we had another million-plus quarter with connected devices. We did see churn increase slightly, only 6 basis points for the postpaid side during what we view as the most competitive quarter of the year.","Strong smartphone sales also drove impressive revenue growth. Total wireless revenues were up $1.5 billion or 10% and wireless service revenues increased by $0.5 billion. We grew postpaid ARPU, as we have done for every quarter for the last 3 years. We also grew it from a much higher base than anyone else. Our postpaid ARPU is $6 higher than our closest competitor. And in 2012, we expect postpaid ARPU to continue to grow and to grow 2% for the year, thanks in part to new pricing plans that we announced last week.","We also continue to bring more subscribers onto our network with tiered data plans, more than 22 million at the end of the quarter, with most choosing the higher-priced plan. As more of our base moves to tiered plans and as data use increases, we expect our compelling ARPU growth story to continue.","Our wireless data results are on Slide 9. If our mobility chief Ralph de la Vega was on the call today, he would say something like, we had a blockbuster smartphone sales. Well, I'm not Ralph, but I've got to tell you, I share his enthusiasm. Our mobile broadband sales were nothing short of incredible.","Our wireless team sold 9.4 million smartphones or more than 100,000 devices a day for every single day of the quarter. That's nearly twice as many as we had in the third quarter and 50% higher than our previous record. Smartphone subscribers now make up about 57% of our postpaid subscriber base. That accounted for 82% of postpaid sales during the quarter. Much of this growth was driven by the launch of the iPhone 4S and record iPhone sales. But we also had record Android device sales, doubling sales from the year-earlier quarter.","Branded computing sales also had a best-ever performance. We added 571,000, thanks to strong tablet and tethering plan sales. We now have more than 5 million branded computing devices on the network.","Strong mobile broadband sales helped drive data growth. Data revenues were $22 billion in 2011, growing at 21% for the year. ARPU for smartphones continues to be strong, nearly twice that of our other devices. And about 87% of smartphone subscribers are on family or business plans. These customers are an excellent investment because they have lower churn.","I can't say enough about how well our mobility crew did in the fourth quarter. We not only held our own in a very competitive quarter but we set a new industry sales standard as well. But you don't have these results without having a terrific network. We are committed to creating not only the world's most advanced network but also the network most open to innovation. And we made tremendous progress towards this goal. Highlights are on Slide 10.","First, we had a great LTE launch last year, making AT&T the only U.S. carrier to provide 4G speeds through both LTE and HSPA+ technologies. This means we deliver the best possible blended speed which enables a better mobile experience for our customers. This pays off big for iPhone 4S customers with download speeds up to 3x faster than on any other carrier's network. You can also see the impacts of our CapEx investments in network upgrades and in expanded mobile broadband coverage. These investments are having a positive impact on our wireless quality metrics. As Randall mentioned, our average national 3G call retention has exceeded 99% since mid-September.","In 2012, we expect to double our LTE coverage with continued improvements in capacity and enhanced backhaul. We're very proud of what we have accomplished and full credit goes to our hardworking network team for an incredible effort.","Now let's look at wireless margins, details are on Slide 11. As you know, the investments we made to drive record smartphone sales and record upgrades have impacted wireless margins, but you also know long-term value of these subscribers: lower churn, higher ARPUs and strong data growth. Our strategy has been to grow this space, which we continue to do, while keeping existing smartphone subscribers in our network, which we did at record-breaking levels in the fourth quarter. Handset upgrades were about 12%.","Looking ahead, we expect service margins to improve in 2012. In fact, I expect we'll get service EBITDA margins back to 40%. Driving this will be continued strong but stabilizing smartphone sales during the year, helped in part by the full impact of the upgrade policy that was introduced last year. Additional revenues are expected from the new data pricing plans that we announced last week and greater efficiencies both in operations and billing. This really speaks to our long-term goal of building a strong smartphone base while working to improve margins.","Now let's take a look at the wireline business, starting with consumer, on Slide 12. U-verse continues to drive consumer growth: 6 straight quarters of year-over-year revenue increases. U-verse was a $6.7 billion revenue stream in 2011. That's almost triple the revenue from just 2 years earlier. And in the fourth quarter, revenues grew about 44% year-over-year. And as we scale, U-verse margins continue to improve, contributing to profitability.","During the quarter, we added 208,000 U-verse subscribers to reach 3.8 million customers in service. Meanwhile, our U-verse broadband net adds accelerated 3x our TV additions, which includes new U-verse small business subscribers. Faster broadband speeds plus mobility is a combination small business customers are looking for and AT&T's strength in both areas is a competitive advantage.","We're also seeing broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rates remain solid. With our U-verse build largely complete, we now passed more than 30 million living units, but penetration continues to expand. We now have 25% penetration in areas marketed to for 36 months or more and we believe there is a lot of room for growth. Our video service is recognized as the best in the business and we are growing faster than any other pay TV provider. In 2012, we expect continued U-verse subscriber growth, helping keep consumer revenue stable.","Now let's look at wireline business, which you can see on Slide 13. We have been watching revenue trends slowly get better in business even without the benefit of an improving economy. For the second quarter in a row, we had sequential revenue growth, thanks to growth in our strategic business services. That's things such as Ethernet, VPNs and application services, which were up 18.4% for the year, and it's now nearly a $6 billion business.","We are seeing positive trends in almost every part of the business. Our global enterprise business had its second straight quarter of year-over-year data growth. Wholesale had its third straight quarter of sequential revenue growth and revenue trends in small business continue to improve with another quarter of broadband growth. We now have 80% of our target central offices ready for IP DSLAM broadband sales and we'll soon begin selling into those central offices. This success helped wireline business margins improve year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter.","We expect these positive wireline business trends to continue in 2012 and that the wireline business will return to revenue growth this year, thanks to growth in network sourcing, mobility applications and virtualized services. And as we said, we expect this growth with little lift from the macroeconomy.","Now let's look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated comparisons are on Slide 14. Record-breaking smartphone sales and postpaid net adds considerably higher than initial estimates, had an impact on our consolidated margins. For the year, our adjusted consolidated operating margin was 17.8%. That compares to 18.5% in 2010. Our wireline operating margins were relatively stable from 2010. We were able to offset declines in legacy services in a sluggish economy, thanks to improving revenue trends, scaling IP data and solid execution with our One AT&T initiatives. Across the business, total force was down more than 10,000 in 2011.","In 2012, we expect to expand consolidated operating margins, driven primarily by wireless expansion with stable wireline margins.","Our cash flow story continues to be outstanding. Our cash summary is on Slide 15.","Cash from operations totaled $34.6 billion. Capital expenditures were $20.3 billion. Free cash flow before dividends was $14.4 billion, a very strong performance especially when you consider these things: We increased capital spending during the year; we made a $1 billion contribution to the pension fund in the fourth quarter; and a $3 billion payment as part of the T-Mobile transaction in the fourth quarter. Dividends totaled $10.2 billion for the year.","In terms of uses of cash, total debt is down almost $6.5 billion from the third quarter of 2011 levels with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38% and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.5. And as Randall mentioned, we also plan to begin aggressively buying back stock from our previously authorized share buyback.","Looking ahead in 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be about $20 billion with continued investment in our growth drivers. And we expect free cash flow in the $15 billion to $16 billion range for the year. Our balance sheet is sound, our debt metric's solid. Our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest or to retire debt while returning substantial value to shareholders.","Let me close with a quick recap of 2011 on Slide 16. We executed very well this year, with good momentum across our business. We grew revenues and had incredible cash flows. We set industry records for mobile broadband. Strength in strategic business services has business wireline poised for growth, and U-verse drove growth in consumer wireline. We also continue to invest in the future, almost $100 billion over the last 5 years. And we've done all of that while continuing to return value to our shareholders.","Let me also do a recap of 2012 guidance that we have provided throughout this call, that's on Slide 17. Looking at 2012, we have a solid strategic plan in place that will help us grow revenues, expand margins, increase earnings while continuing to have a very strong cash flows. In wireless, we expect to expand margins while growing postpaid ARPU by 2% for the year. We expect to return wireline business to revenue growth and keep wireline consumer revenues stable while also keeping wireline margins stable. We are targeting capital expenditures at the same level as 2011, approximately $20 billion. We expect free cash flow in the $15 billion to $16 billion range, and we will begin share buybacks.","This is a growth-focused outlook and also reflects our ability to execute on the cost side. We expect little help from the economy but are certainly prepared to take advantage of any opportunities that exist. This is a time of unprecedented growth for an incredibly dynamic industry. We have a great position and a solid track record of creating value for our owners and we expect to improve on that record in 2012.","Brooks, that concludes our prepared remarks. We are ready for Q&A.","Brooks McCorcle","Okay, great. Thank you, John. Okay, John, I think we're ready to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Randall, I think one of the things you were hoping to get from T-Mobile was a better prepaid platform. Prepaid's about 2\/3, 70% of the new subscribers coming on. Can you talk about how prepaid will fit into your strategy, given what Verizon and some others have done here recently for 2012? And perhaps, you could expound a little bit more on your comments about looking at underperforming assets. Might we see spinoffs of rural lines and sales of directories, is that the sort of thing we should be thinking about?","Randall L. Stephenson","On the prepaid platform, we've been rather transparent about the prepaid area in terms of when you're spectrum-constrained, you get really focused on the markets you want to pursue. And we have obviously been very, very focused on the high end of the market. And the beauty of T-Mobile was it not only came with spectrum, which would allow for some efficiencies, but then a prepaid platform that allowed you to move down market. As we're getting more and more of a better performance out of our network and as we move to LTE and begin to free up some of the 3G spectrum, this is probably an area that we'll look to for growth, Simon. In fact, we have a lot of work going on in this right now. I wouldn't expect or I wouldn't have you expect to see that in the next 6 months, but when you look at the next 12 to 24 months, prepaid will obviously become a focus for us especially when you think in terms of mobile data because, mobile data, that's probably an underserved area where that segment of the market does not have a robust data offering in a prepaid environment. So that will be a focus as we begin to mine out some capacity as we move to LTE. In terms of the underperforming assets, you hit a couple of areas. Obviously, we just took a rather large charge in our directory operations to reflect a lot of the current comparable pricing in the market for those types of assets. That's one area that we're going to obviously take a very hard look at. And while I don't want to give any indication of M&A activity, it's one of these areas where we're going to have to decide: Do we keep it, or do we restructure it as we move forward? So the other being rural access lines, we have been apprehensive on moving, doing anything on rural access lines because the issue here is, do you have a broadband product for rural America? And we've all been trying to find a broadband solution that was economically viable to get out to rural America and we're not finding one to be quite candid. The best opportunity we have is LTE and we were obviously rather excited about the opportunity to use LTE to get it to rural America with the T-Mobile transaction. That having been set aside, now we're looking at rural America and asking, what's the broadband solution? We don't have one right now. So you'll see some activity and some structuring changes over the next couple of months that will provide some idea in terms of where we're headed. We're going to have to either completely restructure those businesses. The cost structure has to change, not only the wage and benefit cost structure but just the cost structure associated with the technology, legacy TDM infrastructure out there. And leaving them as they are, they'll continue to be underperforming assets so we're going to have to make some fundamental changes, and there's more to come on that. But as I said, the next 12 to 24 months will bring more clarity to that, but these are areas that we as a company have to address in short order.","Operator","Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Randall, maybe picking up on the spectrum issue, maybe a little bit more detail, if you could, on your spectrum needs. I mean, obviously, you have some runway with the new 4G network, but you said you'd be more aggressive in that area or then, say, in 2012. I mean, what kind of opportunities are out there? I mean, is it more private companies like Aloha or even potentially other larger companies out there that are operating businesses that have spectrum that you guys could look at? If you could just characterize the sort of environment for new spectrum that already exists. And then maybe talk a little bit about, from a frequency standpoint, I mean, obviously, for you guys, the lower the better, but where would you look at spectrum? Basically trying to get a sense for how badly and how soon you're going to need new spectrum.","Randall L. Stephenson","Yes, okay, John, what I'd tell you is the immediate time frame. In terms of through our LTE deployment through 2013, I feel really good about where we are. We've got sufficient spectrum to get us through LTE deployment. And then, as you to begin to transition off your 3G networks to LTE, it'll buy you some more time in using data [ph] solutions and Wi-Fi solutions. But when you kind of look out and span the horizon or scan the horizon, there are no secrets. Everybody knows where the spectrum resides and who is holding it. Our biggest issue isn't identifying it and pursuing it. Our biggest issue is understanding what we're allowed to do. And we're literally sitting here in a situation where we don't know how much spectrum we're allowed to hold, who we're allowed to do business with and so forth. That was the basis of my comments in the opening session. We've just gone through a process where we tried to get a transaction approved and the FCC came out with a report and said that we exceeded the spectrum caps in over 200 markets. You can imagine how surprised we were to read that until you've read deeper into the report and realized they had changed the spectrum screens. It might have been nice to have known they were going to change those spectrum screens ahead of time, but that is what it is. Then literally, a couple of weeks later, they approve our acquisition of the Qualcomm spectrum, and in reading the report, they evaluated it using the old spectrum caps. So we're literally sitting here in a situation where we don't know what spectrum caps are going to apply from one transaction to the next. So our first issue is not identifying which spectrum we go after but identifying what the rules are. How will these transactions be evaluated? Who are we allowed to do business with and who are we not allowed to do business with? In terms of the frequencies that we're interested in, it's no surprise. We tend to favor the lower band, the 700-megahertz spectrum. We have a very, very good position in that particular location so we obviously have a lot of interest in the spectrum that resides down there. We've done a number of transactions in that particular area since the auctions occurred in 2007, so that's obviously an important area for us. AWS is obviously a good area for us to operate. We've launched our LTE network in the Chicago area on the AWS spectrum, that frequency, and it's performing quite nicely. So those would obviously be the priorities, but again, that's, the who and the what is not the question. It's what can we do and what are we allowed to do, it's the real question for us right now.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First on the wireless side, you've talked about the improvements in network quality but also that the network is running hot. Can you talk about the opportunities that you have to continue to manage the high quality of service to the broad base of HSPA+ customers and what the implications are for CapEx? And then secondly, a little bit more on the business side. If you could just give maybe an expansion of comments in terms of what you're seeing on strategic revenue growth and what's been driving the strong growth there. And also maybe what you're seeing on the legacy service guide, maybe some slowing in the rate of revenue erosion there?","Randall L. Stephenson","Sure, Michael. On the network quality side, wireless network quality, with T-Mobile behind us, we're back to blocking and tackling, if you will, and that means reinitiating significant sales splits. So we had a sales split strategy that was on hold till we got to the T-Mobile transition. So we're back to doing sales splits. We continue to go very, very aggressively on distributing the antenna system solutions and so going inside of buildings and lighting up buildings from the inside, Wi-Fi solutions, all of these, we just continue. And there's no new science here per se. Obviously, additional spectrum, where we can pick it up, is another part of the equation so you'll continue to see us be aggressive there. We have, I think we had some transactions approved by the FCC last week, but before last week, we had 8 transactions sitting in front of the FCC waiting for approval so we can begin investing. So you'll just continue to see us do a lot of the typical blocking and tackling. And you'll also see us, in markets where we've launched LTE, be very aggressive in migrating customers to the LTE platform. And if you're buying today an Android smartphone by -- from AT&T, you're probably buying an LTE-equipped handset, so as we turn up LTE in any of these markets, you're just inherently on the LTE network. So that obviously facilitates getting us the capacity relief that we need, as well. So it's going to be a number of initiatives. In terms of the business services side, what's driving it, again, there's no big secrecy here. VPNs are a huge part of this. Our business customers are moving aggressively to VPN solutions and we continue to run mid-teen type growth rates on VPN. The other is Ethernet, and native Ethernet solutions, whether to businesses, or a really big business opportunity for us right now is deploying this to cellular companies. Wireless companies are buying Ethernet to the sales side aggressively, as we told you. We now have 80% of our mobile broadband traffic on native Ethernet. All mobile companies are trying to get there as fast as they can. We think we're way ahead of the game in this regard. The benefits from it are dramatic in terms of the throughput increases you see by getting that backhaul infrastructure in place on Ethernet. So we're seeing big opportunities there and then lots of opportunities in terms of new application services that are riding on top. Once you put the VPN in place, customers are buying more and more applications and services that ride on top of that whether it be videoconferencing, telepresence and so forth, so we're having a lot of success there. So you put it all together, we continue to get 17%-type growth from these strategic businesses and service. That's helping offset the migration that we're seeing from a lot of the legacy products, as you said. So traditional voice continues to be in decline, as you would guess. Traditional data services, and really, they are somewhat flat, but data is growing in spite of flat legacy data services. So all in, we're feeling really good about the business side of the house. What I would remind you is that these strategic services are growing at this 17% clip and what we're seeing is still a very sluggish economy. I mean, this is not a high-growth economy. These businesses tend to invest in telecom as they hire people. These businesses have not been hiring but our spend from these companies and these services are growing. What we're hopeful for, and we're seeing some signs, just very kind of faint signs, but we're seeing some signs that maybe there's some economic tailwinds here. If we get those, then we think there's some serious upside to our business side of the house and business revenue growth.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike McCormack with Nomura Securities.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Randall, I guess, just thinking back about the introduction of the iPhone. And obviously, a lot has happened since then, but clearly, there was an expectation for an improvement and the approving of an NPV positive story. But maybe just help us with what the headwinds have been there because, if you look back over the past couple of years on churn metrics, ARPU growth rates and margins we're just, it just doesn't seem like we're getting the benefits of either iPhone or smartphone penetration. Can you just walk us -- I think voice is obviously an issue there, but any other headwinds that you think that you can address as we go forward? And then John, just thinking about the EPS guide, have you included a thought process on iPhone refresh?","Randall L. Stephenson","I guess what I would suggest is, while we've had margin pressures as we've gone deeper and deeper into the smartphone category, they continue to be high-NPV product categories. And in fact, the ARPUs are significantly higher than traditional mobile-phone-type capabilities. And to think that we're getting to 57% penetration of our smartphone base -- or of our postpaid base, excuse me, with smartphones and keeping margins in that 40% range, to penetrate that deeply and keep margins at this 40% range, I actually think is better than I might have hoped for. I -- it was a while before we had expectations that 80% of our sales would be in smartphone categories. But to sell 80% of all of your sales being smartphones and keep margins in this 40% range for the year, I, actually I'm not too disappointed with that. And I think it's going to prove to be a terrific platform for us because here's what we're seeing, Mike, and that is, you get a customer on smartphone and then you get a customer with FamilyTalk plans or family plans on smartphones and the smartphone becomes the platform for the new services that we're now selling. Somebody buys a tablet and puts their tablet on a 3G or 4G network. That customer puts that device on the same network as their smartphone. So we think it's going to prove to be a very important platform as we move forward. That's why we're not shying away from continuing to pursue this market. We have done some things where we've tightened up the upgrade policy to try to begin to manage the cost of the upgrades in this particular base. But all things considered, I'm pleased with the smartphone category and we'll continue to do things to tighten up margins as we go forward. We also took some actions during the course of this year that had an effect on our ARPU, and we believe it's going to prove to be a temporary effect on our ARPU, and that is, with 2011 being the year when we first had competition for the iPhone, we made some strategic moves. We introduced unlimited mobile-to-mobile calling if you had an unlimited text plan. That proved to be a very sticky move from a pricing standpoint, but it's had a negative effect on ARPU over a couple of quarters. We're seeing that stabilize now. We don't expect to continue to see that dilution on ARPU as we move forward, but that did have an effect this year that we think is largely behind us, and as we move to 2012, it should not continue to suppress ARPUs. But all in, it continue to be a bull, a big-time bull in the smartphone category and iPhones in general.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And just a, I'm sorry, Randall, just as a quick follow-up on that. You identified part of the voice pressure there, but are you seeing, obviously, upgrades are running pretty high across the entire industry, but are you seeing the people coming to the store for the upgrade to the smartphone, making decisions on how many voice minutes they want? Because it seems like, and I mean, I got a couple of younger kids, but they just don't talk on the phone anymore. So are we seeing sort of the pricing down to these lower buckets?","Randall L. Stephenson","Without a doubt. And well, you're seeing it from the phenomenon you just described, and that is, young people, it's almost uncool to talk on a phone, right? I mean texting and messaging are keys. But, and so that has had its effect. But also, when we did go to mobile-to-mobile calling, this will tell you how efficient these markets are, but people began to immediately, particularly in small business, small businesses immediately rightsized their plans to reflect the mobile-to-mobile calling feature. And so we did see a step-down very quickly, but as I mentioned, we're beginning to see that mitigate.","John Joseph Stephens","Mike, with regard to your question with regard to the 2012 expectations, 2 points on smartphone sales with an iPhone refresh: We do have smartphone sales flat compared to '11 in our expectations and that is in a 25-million-unit level, which is a record for us. So we did assume that we would have that same level again, and that's after we've fully implemented during this year our new handset upgrade policy so that also takes into account some growth opportunities.","Operator","Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First is just a follow-up on what you just said, John. So that's a flat from the fourth quarter smartphone run rate, right?","John Joseph Stephens","I'm sorry. We're going to -- we -- the annual run rate for the smartphones in 2011 was $25 million and we have plans that assume we're going to stay at that level for the year in 2012. It just may be mixed differently by quarter. That, in my opinion, is a significant number particularly since we'll have the new upgrade policy fully implemented this year.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. So you would expect the upgrades to moderate somewhat in '12?","John Joseph Stephens","Yes.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So a bigger question: Can you talk about the wireline business a little bit? It just sounds like you said it'll turn positive in 2012. Does that mean sort of positive for the year, or at some point, maybe during the back half, it switches to positive? And then talk about margins there. So flat year-over-year, is there any potential for additional cost cuts? Or is that really sort of mix shift still and there's not much to be done with that level?","John Joseph Stephens","So I directly expect revenue to grow for the entire year, for the overall. Whether it occurs fully in the first quarter or it occurs later, it will occur for the full year. We expect revenues to grow. Secondly, there are additional cost opportunities and savings opportunities. We've gone a tremendous distance in getting our One AT&T initiatives and other cost efficiencies in place, but there's always, as one of my peers would say, there's always more, and we're going to continue to work for that more. We do have a headwind of continued legacy product challenges, and so those cost savings may go to offset that. And finally, as we've mentioned here previously, we're not assuming a significant lift, a measurable lift at all from the economy. And as such, if we had that lift, there would be an opportunity to perform better than what we've expected.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Chaplin with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jonathan Chaplin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of quick questions for John. So firstly, on the share repurchase, is there any impact of share repurchase that's included in your EPS guidance, and if so, how much does that contribute? And I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit about how you sort of manage between wanting to take as many shares out as quickly as possible early in the year versus maintaining that 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Can you go significantly above that and maybe implement something like an accelerated share repurchase program early in the year and then trend back down to that over the course of the year? And then, sorry, one final question: On the impact of the upgrade policy change, can you just run through when you think that impact will start showing up? And how much you think the upgrade rate could come down in 2012 over 2011?","John Joseph Stephens","So Jonathan, let me to try to take them in short order. First of all, with regard to the assumptions we made in the plan with regard to share repurchase, I would suggest to you, my guidance, our guidance for the year wouldn't be any different based on moving that share repurchase assumptions around. It wouldn't have changed -- it did not change the guidance we're giving you, so if we had no share repurchase, we'd stay with that mid-single-digits EPS growth. That's the first question, I hope that's responsive. The second question, with regard to our debt ratios, I think you need to understand, and I know you do, Jonathan, but I think you need to step back and look at our balance sheet today, with over $3 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Look at the cash flows that we are expecting to generate, over -- close to $6 billion over our dividend requirements. That total of $9 billion gives you a good insight into how much shares we can repurchase or can give you one insight into how much shares we can repurchase without affecting debt metrics. And so we'll be prudent. We are sticking to our standards with regard to the 1.5x and in the debt-to-equity kind of guidelines we've given. But we have cash generation. A company like ours has significant flexibility in the timing of those kinds of activities. The upgrade policy, I would expect it to go in full force at the end of the second quarter. We've put it in place in the first quarter of a year ago and it takes about a 1.5 years to be fully implemented. You probably won't see the full effects of it until the second half of this year. That's our expectations. I will tell you that, in this first year, we are expecting to see some improvement, but we have not given, and I don't believe we are giving guidance on the specific impact on upgrades. Anything else?","Operator","And next, we'll go to Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Randall, maybe just a quick follow-up on the regulatory environment. What, in your mind, is the path to more clarity out of D.C.? What would you need to see from them? Or are we just to assume that you effectively need a complete reset at the FCC to contemplate anything else of size that you'd take to them? And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the upgrade percentage. Obviously, such a big swing factor for wireless margins. The industry seems to go through waves of tightening and loosening upgrade policies. Your latest move, obviously very constructive and tightening, but maybe you can talk bigger picture and longer term, can we as an industry get into a sustained period of tightening that would really reflect sort of a greater degree of discipline?","Randall L. Stephenson","Okay. In terms of the regulatory environment, Jason, I would tell you there is one thing that could be done in very, very short order that would kind of lift the veil or cloud of uncertainty surrounding a lot of this, and that is, Congress passes legislation initiating the auctions and it's very prescriptive to the FCC in terms of what the FCC's role is in the auctions. And the House has a bill that is, has been drafted and it accomplishes exactly that. The FCC is obviously contesting that language. I think the chairman made a speech the week after the holidays, the chairman of the FCC, where he said he needed the rules to be fluid. My interpretation is these rules are so fluid you can drink out of them with a straw right now. So what we need from Congress is prescriptive legislation on how these auctions should be performed. And the language is presently in the current House bill. If that bill were to get passed, I think it starts to lift the veil of uncertainty surrounding the industry. In terms of upgrade policy, Jason, what you're articulating and discussing is the indication of an incredibly competitive environment in the mobility world. And I think what you're beginning to see is the smartphone market is maturing a bit, and as it matures, I think you'll begin to see different behavior among all the players. I probably can't go much further than that, but our -- as I've said at the very beginning, I feel like we have about as much visibility into the future as we have had in quite some time, so that intimates a certain degree of predictability that has not been there before. And we'll see. We've built our plans and our margin expectations around selling a comparable number of smartphones as we did in 2011, so 25 million. Will there be some new iconic device that nobody anticipated come out during the course of the year? Perhaps. But I do think 25 million sales is probably a reasonable expectation for us. And if we can get, if we do a 25 million sales level, then a 40% margin is probably an achievable level.","John Joseph Stephens","Jason, one thing, if I could add, Jason, one point I'd make is, as we go through this transition in our network and the ability to provide LTE, one aspect of this refresh process, as Randall mentioned, that doesn't get loss on is we really don't necessarily have to give much in the way of  financial incentives to get our customers, as this was clearly shown in the fourth quarter, to get them to go to the latest technology. So we have an opportunity to shift dramatic levels of traffic to LTE. Also, as the industry all begins to fall into a similar situation with us with regard to wireline, wireless handset subsidies and cost and structure, we would hopefully expect that everyone would act rationally in the process.","Operator","Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, just first, John, when you mentioned that you thought that wireless margins could be as high as 40% in 2012, were you meaning that you expect it to be able to maybe touch 40% at some point in time, or is that kind of more of a full year look? And then on the consumer revenues, for the last couple of quarters, it looks like they've been coming down sequentially. I know you've talked about some of the headwinds that you're facing with the legacy businesses and trying to restructure those, but is there a risk that consumer revenues might dip back down into negative territory and then get offset by some of the advances in business, as we look in the 2012 mix?","John Joseph Stephens","First of all, on the wireless margins, the expectations I mentioned, 40% were for the full year. We'll see how the different quarters go because of volumes and new handset issuances and so forth, but the comment was intended for the year. With regard to the consumer revenues, a couple of things I think I'd point out to you. We've got the U-verse build complete or essentially complete. And we'll continue to do a little bit more here and there, but we've passed 30 million homes so now we have a full 30-million-home capability to sell into so we have opportunities to continue that growth. I think we mentioned that there was 16% penetration in our eligible living units, and in those that are longer than 36 months, we're more like 25%. The other piece of that is we're having tremendous results with our high-speed U-verse-type broadband, not only in consumer but in small business. And so those opportunity to sell into more U-verse markets and that continued push on high-speed Internet and attach rates for VoIP give me optimism over continuing to have a good performance in consumer. With that being said, we are expecting even better performance in business. And they've proven it, they've shown it. The strategic services give us factual support for that thought process.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I could just follow up real quick, Randall, just one quick one for you. If we could just get your kind of take on the Verizon agreement with the cable companies, their cross-marketing agreement now kind of anticipating potential Verizon selling of cable products in your territory. How do you look at that transaction? Are you, would you support it at the FCC? How do you think about it competitively? What does it make you want to do to respond? That'd be very helpful.","Randall L. Stephenson","Yes, as it relates to them selling cable products, it's interesting. It was obviously, their footprints don't overlap so much and so I don't know. I think it'll be interesting to see how the FCC deals with it. It appears to me to be a logical transaction. I obviously will be watching very closely because, again, it's, hopefully it's one more data point on what the spectrum screens really are, which if it does nothing, it should give us some clarity on what we're able to do as we move forward. So we won't be a participant in terms of comments or anything on this, just watching as a very interested bystander, hopefully getting some indication on what it means for us in terms of what we're able to do.","Brooks McCorcle","Okay, John, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that will be from the line of Craig Moffett with Sanford Bernstein.","Craig Moffett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wonder if you can just help me, Randall, with the growth outlook. If I'm doing the math right, it looks like service revenue growth in the wireless business, excluding the hardware sales, has now actually dropped to about 4%, and as you said, the smartphone penetration is now at about 57%. How do I think about kind of re-accelerating growth in that business? Where does it come from since the incremental data penetration rates and the growth rates are starting to subside a bit?","Randall L. Stephenson","Yes, so 57% smartphone penetration. As we said, sales, smartphones represented 80% of our sales. So every time we peg what the penetration rate will get to, it seems like the percentage of sales moves up another notch. And so we think we still have quite a ways to run in terms of smartphone penetration and you continue, we'll continue to see ARPU lift as we penetrate smartphones more and more into the base. Also, I believe that what you're seeing right now, 1.4% postpaid ARPU growth, I believe you'll see that accelerate next year as we work through some of our unlimited mobile-to-mobile calling price changes. So we think we'll see some ARPU lift in terms of the growth rate, going into next year, so that will be very important. And then again, as I mentioned, I'm absolutely convinced the smartphone is a platform. And the customer that you hold with the smartphone is the customer that you will sell the tablet, is the customer that you will sell connected devices, is the customer you will sell home monitoring capabilities. We -- I just really believe that it's becoming more and more a factor in terms of, or a platform in terms of further penetration in mobile data and that's why we're going so aggressively on LTE. And then we haven't really begun to broach business mobility and business mobility in terms of applications. I think we're very early in the cycle in terms of businesses mobilizing all aspects of what they do, whether it be sales force automation or imaging, and there's just so many applications that businesses are just starting to get their hands around that will become a significant driver of growth. So I'm feeling pretty good that we have a long way to run in terms of growth in the mobile broadband infrastructure. You're seeing us invest heavily. We'll continue to invest, again, getting to LTE 80% coverage by 2013 and we just think it's going to be a terrific opportunity.","So with that, I, we're going to close. And I want to thank everybody for taking part. As I said, 2012, we've probably got the best visibility we've had in quite some time. Our growth engines are on track. It is being led, as you heard by our comments and your questions on this call, by mobile broadband. The key for us is spectrum. We need the FCC and Congress to get us, to open up and get us to a point of open auctions, and that needs to be done as soon as possible.","We're committed to making sure that AT&T is structured for growth. We're going to look at low-growth and nonstrategic assets and make some decisions over the next few months. And given this environment, we'll begin significant share repurchases and we'll do that immediately. So we're looking forward to a good 2012.","Thank you, again, for joining us, and we'll talk you later. Thank you.","Brooks McCorcle","Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

Please go ahead.","Susan Johnson","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. It\u2019s great to have you with us today. I\u2019m Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Stephens, AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Randall will provide opening comments and then close with 2013 guidance and John will cover our results, and then we\u2019ll follow with Qs & As.","Let me remind you our earnings materials are available on the Investor relations page of the AT&T website that\u2019s www.att.com\/investor.relations.","Of course I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3. This presentation and comments may contain forward-looking statements. They\u2019re subject to risks. Results may differ materially. Details are in our SEC filings and on AT&T\u2019s website.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to AT&T\u2019s Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson. Randall?","Randall Stephenson","Thanks Susan and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m just going to make a couple comments before we let John take you through the results. But many of you were on the call a year ago and you probably recall me talking candidly with you about what we had to get done in 2012 and our number one priority was spectrum. And I also said, we needed to accelerate our shift into our growth businesses. And I also made it clear that we\u2019re going to be very aggressive in returning value to our owners and this where we focused our efforts during a year.","And on the spectrum front, we have signed nearly 50 deals and those include introducing WCS spectrum into the mobile ecosystem for the very first time, and actually just kind of fresh off the wire today we formerly closed the NextWave acquisition, which was the property that included the largest block of that spectrum. So that transaction has closed today.","You put all these deals together and they increase our average national spectrum by a third. And while everybody in the industry is always going to be looking for more spectrum, at this stage I like our position.","The spectrum was obviously an important piece of the puzzle for Project VIP and we outlined Project VIP for you in the November. And this is without a doubt the most comprehensive organic growth initiative for us in several decades. And it includes expansion in both wireless and wireline.","And most of you are familiar with the plan, it includes LTE covering 300 million people by year end 2014 with an extensive network specification aspect to it, IP broadband to 75% of our wireline customer locations, fiber into a million additional business locations and we plan to execute a full transition of our network to wireless plus IP.","Then once the Project VIP is complete, nearly all of our customers will have access to high-speed broadband through wireless, wired or some combination of both. So this going to give us a much larger platform for new services, it will improve our revenue mix and it\u2019s going to improve our cost structure for many years to come.","Most important, it will let a layer on services that we believe we are going change every aspect of our customers lives. How they buy things. How they manage and secure their homes. How they access entertainment. Their experience behind the car wheel is going to change. There is going to be a whole healthcare ecosystem change. And I can go on, but it\u2019s clear that the industry is moving beyond the device and into a new era of solutions and services.","We also delivered solid financial results. For the year, we had on an apples-to-apples basis revenue growth of 2.4% and adjusted EPS up 8.5%. Our cash from operations came in over $39 billion. We invested $20.5 billion in capital of spectrum.","We paid out $10 billion in dividends and increased our dividend for the 29 consecutive year. We bought back 6% of our shares, which will reduce dividends by about $700 million per year. And if you combine the buybacks and dividends we returned $23 billion to our owners last year. And we do this with a very small increase in debt and we refinanced $12 billion of our debt to take advantage of the low rates.","And then on top of that, we began the process to solidify our pension plan and we are contributing a preferred equity interest in AT&T mobility, which is our best asset into the plan, and we are working with the Department of Labor to complete that this year. All this give us a really good starting point for 2013. And here is what you would expect from us.","An aggressive rollout of Project VIP, you\u2019ll see us scale several new businesses this year, including Digital Life, our mobile wallet JV, connected cars and a number of others. And over the next few years these represent billions of dollars of new revenue opportunity for us.","In a quarter you should expect us to maintain a strong balance sheet and continue returning value to our owners. So I think we are executing well, I like how we are set up for 2013.","And so, with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to John Stephens to take you through the quarter, and then I\u2019ll be back to walk you through more details on our 2013 outlook. So John?","John Stephens","","Thanks, Randall, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by providing a consolidated financial summary, which is on slide six. When you look at 2012, our adjusted financial results were strong across the Board, revenues, margins and earnings per share. When you exclude our divested Ad Solutions business and adjust for the Superstorm Sandy impacts revenues were up 2.4% for the year and 2.8% in the fourth quarter.","Operating income increased 4.8%. Consolidated margins improved even with record smartphone sales and as a result, we grew adjusted earnings per share 8.5% for the year. And we had our strongest ever annual cash flows. ","Cash from operating activities totaled $39.2 billion in 2012 and free cash flows were $19.4 billion. That strong free cash flow allowed us to be aggressive with our share buybacks. We repurchased more than 370 million shares during the year. ","Looking at the fourth quarter, we have reported earnings per share of a negative $0.68 but excluding $1.12 adjustments, earnings per share was $0.44, a 10% year over year increase. These adjustments included $1.10 of non-cash pressure from the year end mark-to-market change for our benefit plans. This actuarial loss from the benefit plans was solely by the reduction in the discount rate from 5.3% at the end of last year to 4.3% at the end of this year and $0.02 of pressure due to storm impacts from super storm Sandy. ","Now let\u2019s look at revenue growth and revenue mix. Details are on slide seven. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues totaled $32.6 billion, that\u2019s up 2.8% year-over-year when you exclude Ad Solutions and the storm impacts. Driving this growth was strong mobile Internet results, excellent U-verse gain and continued strength in strategic business services. ","On the left side of the slide you can see how our growth drivers, wireless, wireline data and mainline services have become a larger and larger part of our business. In the fourth quarter 81% of our revenues came from these areas. That\u2019s up from 69% just three years ago. And revenues from these areas were up $1.4 billion in in the quarter, our almost a 6% growth rate. We expect this mix shift to continue and by 2016 we expect these growth drivers to represent close to 90% of our total revenue. ","Now let\u2019s move to our operations results starting with wireless, revenue and ARPU on slide eight. Wireless data continues to drive solid revenue results. Data revenues were up more than 14% in the quarter that helped drive 4.2% service revenue growth and total wireless revenues were up over 5.5% in the quarter. Data revenues were impacted somewhat by the growth of mobile share plans with unlimited messaging and voice are standard for those plans and we booked messaging revenues in our wireless voice category while mobile share data revenues go to data. ","You can also see the impact of data growth when you look at ARPU. Postpaid data ARPU grew at nearly 12% and total postpaid ARPU which includes postpaid devices such as tablets was up 1.9%. And phone-only ARPU was up 2.5% growing off a much higher ARPU base than anyone else. Postpaid ARPU was impacted somewhat by super storm Sandy. In an effort to help those in the storm\u2019s path we waived all over dues (ph) both voice and data. Without that revenue loss total postpaid ARPU growth for the quarter would have been about 2.1%. ","One of the highlights of the quarter was our strong postpaid growth where we had our largest gains in 3 years, details are on slide 9. We added almost 800,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter with strong gains in smartphones, tablets and mobile premise solutions. Overall we added 1.1 million new subscribers with additional gains in connected devices and reseller. ","Prepaid net adds were impacted by declines in both session based tablets and go phone. Branded computing subscribers are up 26% year-over-year driven by strong tablet sales. Postpaid churn also had another strong quarter, down from the year ago fourth quarter and smartphone churn was even lower. The growing number of subscribers on family, business or Mobile Share plans also help reduce churn. Subscribers on these plans tend to be stickier with lower churn.","Let\u2019s now move to smartphone sales in our usage-based data plans on slide 10. Mobile Share growth was dramatic especially when you consider that we give customers a choice with taking those plans or keeping what they already have.","These plans were first introduced late in the third quarter of 2012. By the end of the fourth quarter, 6.6 million subscribers were on Mobile Share plans or about 10% of our postpaid base. And these subscribers were on 2.2 million accounts, which gives us an average of about three devices per account.","Take rates on the higher data plans continue to run above expectations. More than a quarter of Mobile Share accounts have 10 gigs or larger plans. And we continue to see a steady movement of subscribers on unlimited plans taking advantage of Mobile Share. More than 15% of our subscribers are moving from unlimited plans to Mobile Share.","Overall more than two thirds of our smartphone base has moved to usage-based plan in the last two and one-half years, and we expect that trend to continue. We also had another record quarter for smartphone sales. Our wireless team sold 10.2 million smart phones, the most smartphones ever sold by any U.S. carrier.","Those sales accounted for 86% of all postpaid sales and 89% of postpaid phone sales in the quarter. Smartphone subscribers now account for almost 70% of our postpaid phone base.","When looking at the full year, our smartphone base grew by almost 8 million. These are the premium subscribers in our business. ARPU was twice that of non-smartphone subscribers and they have much lower churn.","We also saw our best ever Android and Apple device sales in the quarter. More customers continue to choose the iPhone on AT&T's network. We activated 8.6 million iPhones in the fourth quarter with about 16% new to AT&T from about the same percentage of new subscribers as last year.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at margins and operating income growth on slide 11. As you know, the investments we've made to drive record smartphone sales impacted margins. While we continue to make progress in improving our margins, we also are more than willing to invest in smartphones because of the benefits they bring. Those include higher ARPU, lower churn, strong data growth and with that growing operating income, which was up more than 6% for the year.","In the fourth quarter, wireless EBITDA service margin was 29.1% about the same as last year's fourth quarter. And it was nearly 30% taking into account the impact of Superstorm Sandy.","For the full year, our EBITDA service margin was 39.6% and was 39.9% while adjusting for storm impacts. So even though we sold 1.5 million more smartphones in 2012 than we did in 2011, our wireless EBITDA service margins for the year improved almost 100 basis points and improved even more when you account for the storms.","And the number of upgrades was down for the year about 5% which provided further margin support. We are making progress with margins and we expect that progress to continue going forward.","Now, let's look at our wireline operations starting with consumer, which you can see on slide 12. A quick look at our U-verse results helps explain our confidence as we expand these services to 75% of our wireline base through project VIP. We continue to see strong subscriber growth, both video and high-speed broadband. This in turn has accelerated customer revenue growth to 3% in the fourth quarter, our best performance in more than four years. We continue to hit new and higher benchmarks with U-verse, including 8 million total U-verse subscribers, 4.5 million U-verse video customers with 192,000 net adds in the quarter and 7.7 million high-speed IP broadband subscribers. That's nearly a 50% increase for the year with more than 600,000 added in the fourth quarter and for the first time, our consumer high-speed IP broadband subscribers outnumber our legacy broadband customers. ","And while overall broadband subscribers remained steady in the quarter, total broadband ARPU was up more than 10% year-over-year. U-verse is now a $10 billion annualized revenue stream growing at 38% for the full year. And IP data revenues driven by U-verse now represent 61% of consumer revenues, up from 53% just a year ago. But we believe the best is yet to come. We think there is a lot of room for growth here, penetration rates are just starting to climb so the runway is long. And with our project VIP expansion that opportunity will only grow as we bring U-verse video and high-speed IP wired broadband to million more customer locations. ","Now let\u2019s move to business which you can see on slide 13. The story in the fourth quarter is similar to what we've seen all through 2012. Customers delayed combined decisions due to concerns with the economy. The fiscal cliff uncertainty lasted the entire quarter and small business starts continued to lag last year's level. But the silver lining in the fourth quarter was some small signs of revenues stability. ","On a sequential basis, revenues were up due to growth in enterprise. Service revenues were up slightly versus the third quarter and wholesale revenues also showed signs of stability. Overall business and the wireline revenue was down 2.1% in the fourth quarter, slightly better than the 2.6% drop in the third quarter. So it\u2019s been another challenging year but through and all we have been able to continue to hold margin steady while transitioning legacy products to IP data services. ","Our strategic business services also continued to grow, that includes products such as Ethernet, VPNs and application services, which were up 10.5% for the quarter and up 13.5% for the full year, and data revenues continued to grow even in this challenging environment with IP data revenues up 2.4% year-over-year and still a weak market, but we are cautiously optimistic that this business is showing some signs of stability. And we are hopeful that an improving accounting will get this part of the company growing again. ","Now let\u2019s look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on slide 14. Even with strong postpaid net adds and record breaking smartphone sales, consolidated margins improved. For the year our adjusted consolidated margin was 18.2%. That compares to 17.8% in 2011. Wireline operating income margin also expanded during the year as wireline continued its transformation from voice to IP data. This helped to offset declines in legacy services and a sluggish economy thanks to improving revenue trends in consumer, scaling IP and solid execution of One AT&T cost initiatives. We continue to keep a sharp eye on cost efficiencies, and we see more opportunity to reduce expenses as we move ahead.","Now let\u2019s move to cash flow which continues to be outstanding. Our summary is on slide 15. Cash from operations was a record $39.2 billion, and we had record free cash flow as well. Free cash flow before dividends was $19.4 billion, up more than 34% from a year ago. Strong cash flows give us the flexibility to invest in the business and return value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We were able to do all of these in 2012.","Capital expenditures were $19.7 billion with more than half of that invested in our wireless business. Dividend payments for the year totaled $10.2 billion and we repurchased more than 370 million shares or about 6% of outstanding shares worth about $13 billion.","We completed our initial 300 million share buyback authorization in the fourth quarter and began buying back shares under our second 300 million share authorization. When you look at both dividends and buybacks, we returned $23 billion to our shareholders during the year.","In terms of uses of cash, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio increased only slightly to 1.58, and net debt edged up as we took advantage of historically low interest rates, with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 43%.","As we begin our Project VIP investments, our balance sheet is sound, our debt metric solid, our strong cash flows give us the flexibility to invest in growth, while returning value to shareholders.","Now, before I hand it back to Randall for our 2013 outlook, let\u2019s take a quick look on how we delivered on 2012 guidance. I\u2019ll ask you to look at slide 16.","On an adjusted basis we expected consolidated revenue, margin and EPS growth, and that's what we delivered, that include hitting on the high-end of our EPS range. We also expected the mobile Internet to drive wireless growth and we saw subscriber gains, postpaid ARPU growth and expanding wireless service margins during the year.","We over deliver on wireline margins and consumer wireline growth, thanks to the increasing strength of our U-verse services, we bumped up our free cash flow estimates during the year, but finished the year even stronger than expected, and CapEx ended the year in the range we expected.","We also were aggressive on the share buybacks, adding a second 300 million repurchase authorization during the year, and as Randall said earlier we knocked that out of park in executing our strategies in 2012.","Altogether, an excellent performance in a challenging economy and a performance that gives us confidence as we head into 2013.","With more details on that let me hand it back over to Randall. Randall?","Randall Stephenson","Okay. Thanks, John. I\u2019m going to be real quick because we want to get the questions here. But just a couple of comments on what you can expect from us in 2013. And what you\u2019re going to see is a very aggressive execution of Project VIP and we\u2019re actually off to a very strong start there. And as part of that, we expect to take our LTE build to 250 million or more POPS by year end.","We going to see us launch several of our new growth businesses I discussed those earlier and we\u2019re looking at CapEx in 2013 in the $21 billion range, and obviously, there will be an emphasis on wireless and Project VIP.","In terms of financials, we expect to delivery EPS growth in the upper single digits or higher. Consolidated revenue growth should exceed 2%. Consolidated operating margin should be stable and wireless margins should expand.","We expect cash generation to be strong in fact free cash flow after CapEx will exceed $14 billion. This gives us room for continuing share repurchases and actually we expect to complete our current buyback authorization as early as midyear.","So I characterize this as a very achievable outlook, I mean, you know our history, we tend to be conservative, and this assumes no lift from the economy.","So, to close, I like how we are executing. We have a really strong financial position, which gives us the opportunity to invest aggressively and continue returning value to our owners. And I like the moves we are making to expand our growth platforms.","And so, Susan, with that, I think, we\u2019ll get ready for questions.","Susan Johnson","Thank you, Randall. Tony, I think, we are now ready to open it up for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) Your first question in queue will come from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JP Morgan","I guess two quick ones, first, Randall in your quarter recently as I don\u2019t know if this is right or not but saying that international or European acquisitions may be inevitable to continued growth. Can you address that for us? And then second, for John, going through this buyback by midyear, that's great. What do you think about the potential to reauthorize and how does the board think about that so far?","Randall Stephenson","Yeah sure Phil. As it relates to international I was asked about consolidation, not just some level of consolidation was inevitable. And obviously we don\u2019t comment on M&A rumors. But here is what I\u2019d ask you to think about. As you consider what's happened in the last five years in the U.S. it\u2019s been impressive what transpired in the mobile Internet revolution and the U.S. has been outpacing the rest of the globe fairly considerably. And I think most people expect the rest of the world will catch-up and so the question you have to ask is are there opportunities for us to participate in that growth outside the U.S. And we look at this from a lot of different ways as more and more people around the world begin to deploy LTE. There are probably some opportunities to create some unique roaming arrangements, roaming each other\u2019s networks at different cost structures, which may change that dynamic somewhat the opportunities to partner, like you\u2019ve seen this partnering in China, China Telecom deal that we did. And you will probably see those kind of deals more and more in the mobility side, do you invest at the infrastructure level is a big question. ","And there\u2019s really another aspect to it and that is can you participate in this growth outside the U.S. at the application level? And this year is going to be very instructive in that regard to us because services like digital life, which is really \u2013 I mean that\u2019s over the top application for home security and monitoring and so forth, and is it possible to carry those platforms outside the U.S.? We are already licensing that platform to companies in Europe. And so Kindle\u2019s platforms we extended and over the top model outside the U.S. So as we kind of look at this we do believe that U.S. experience will replicated outside the U.S. and we\u2019re just trying to decide how is that we would participate in that, there are lot of avenues for that. ","Phil Cusick \u2013 JP Morgan","That sounds like acquiring something is less on your mind than other opportunities.","Randall Stephenson","There is just a lot of different ways to think about it and that\u2019s all I am trying to characterize here, Phil. There are lot of options. ","John Stephens","Phil, with regard to your question, first and foremost it\u2019s a board decision on the authorization, so we\u2019re going to work within authorizations we have currently. Secondly, in evaluating and providing information with regard to share buyback, first and foremost it's a question of valuation of shares compared to the market price that is out there and we look at what analysts say. We look at our own internal valuations of share price and we look at what the market is trading the stock at. But before you get to a further authorization you need to make sure that one, your cash flows from your business which \u2013 we have really very solid cash flow performance, you have to make sure you can continue to reinvest first, you can continue to pay your dividends first. And you have to have enough cash flow leftover to be able to take advantage of opportunities like Randall mentioned today, an opportunity to give some more spectrum in the Nextwave transaction that we closed today.","And if you're comfortable with that, then you go into the decision of what you\u2019d do with that extra capital. That\u2019s a process we go through on a regular basis and we will continue to do that. This is a unique time from a market perspective in that the cash costs of our equity are high compared to traditional interest rate and borrowing capacity that\u2019s out there. And that's the reason why we incurred slightly more debt than we usually carry. ","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley ","I wanted if you could talk about the CapEx side of the equation and you talk about 21 million just a mid-single-digit increase year-over-year. How should we think about that in the context of the analyst meeting and up to sort of $22 billion. What\u2019s the delta there and are we still looking at 22 possibly over the couple of years or do you think you\u2019re going to be more efficient in achieving some of the goals. And could you be, be more specific about what you\u2019re going to see with project VIP in \u201813, you\u2019ve talked about the LTE rollout but perhaps on the wireline side, should we be sort of hitting a third of the three-year targets over the next 12 months or any other color on that would be great? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","So let me try and answer couple of your questions. First and foremost, the $22 billion we gave in November was -- that information went into a three-year plan. Since that time, we\u2019ve really been able to put pencil to paper from an engineering perspective and really work specific business cases in a more detail level. That\u2019s providing some of our opportunities.","Quite frankly, we had more efficiency in our capital program last year and -- for example, we mentioned that today we have about 174 million POPs covered with LTE. Our commitment for the year had been 150. So we\u2019re ahead of our achievement and spend some money officially, we\u2019re taking that into account.","And then lastly, we\u2019ve been able to identify some, if you will, shared savings where the overlap between our wired and wireless projects in VIP are going to allow for some more efficiency. All of those pieces go into the guidance that\u2019s $21 billion and we are comfortable with that $21 billion range.","Specifically, with regard to achievements, we are expecting to get $250 million POPs covered with LTE by the end of this year. We will also make -- we're not disclosing specific levels of fiber building or expansion of U-verse footprint this time but you can think about it as kind of ratable builds to schedule as we go forward.","And we are moving forward today with some of the fiber building efforts and moving forward, immediately hit 13 on very many of those velocity projects. It\u2019s not a question of moving capital or cost into later years. With our financial flexibility, we will do as much as we can as early as possible.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley ","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik - UBS","Hey, thanks. Maybe a question on the wireless side. During the year, you guys changed eligibility requirements in the institute of these. Do you think that there is still some other levers you can pull that it could be used to enhance profitability. And then Randall, maybe as you look out over the year, there has been some significant changes in the wireless industry. Do you expect to see any change in the level of comparison as we move through the year? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","Good question, John. Certainly, we do believe that there are additional opportunities for us to focus on our cost structure, improve profitability and specifically in wireless. If you look at the changes to our upgrade cycle policies, they reduced our upgrades by about 5% this year. If you guys do the math, you will find itself in the 1 million phone reduction, 1 million upgrade reduction range. So it did have a significant impact in some of the other steps we took generated benefits for us.","We\u2019re going through a continual process of evaluating those on that side as well as evaluating cost structure opportunities and one AT&T type opportunities for additional efficiency. So those are ongoing optimistic that those exist and that is part and parcel of our guidance when we say that we expect wireless margins to continue to expand in \u201813.","John Stephens","In terms of, John, the industry dynamics, it should be an interesting year. There is a lot of talk and lot of press on the different industry players. And it\u2019s kind of hard to estimate what\u2019s going to happen. I think the way we\u2019re considering it internally is, probably, a little bit of open field running this year as T-Mobile and Metro PCS come together. I don\u2019t know what the timing is on that.","I don\u2019t expect that to be a significant impact on 2013. But when they get that transaction close, we expect there to be some dynamics in the marketplace that -- as we\u2019ll have to respond to some of it, we find interesting like the handset financing that they\u2019re doing.","That\u2019s something we\u2019ve looked at on several occasions. I kind of like the idea, commend them for trying it. It will be something we\u2019re going to watching, how it is received in the market place. And in terms of other players, it\u2019s just -- it's hard to say what the dynamic will be. But I think it will be just a little bit of open field running this year.","John Hodulik - UBS","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Michael Rollins with Citi.","Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research","","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the enterprise and the business environment, your exiting last year and early this year, are you seeing any changes in the sale cycle or the competitive intensity and can you talk about what\u2019s built into the plan for this year in terms of \u2013 are you expecting it to get a little bit better, stay the same as the back half of \u201912, just some added color would be helpful. Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","I will start and let John chime in with some details but we are seeing little glimmer of hope on the enterprise side. It's really hard to predict this segment right now when you have continuing resolutions and you have fiscal cliffs, and you have debt ceilings, and you have sequesters and people are a little bit stuck right now. And it's been this way for about six months. But when you look at the mid-level market and above we actually saw positive growth in the first quarter. We have not seen that in quite some time. The pressure on the enterprise segment is coming from small business and particularly state and federal governments and there the spending cycle is really slow. And obviously the spending is down considerably. And so if we get through a lot of the budget situation perhaps you can expect to see some lift but our current expectation Michael is we build the plan around economic growth that\u2019s sub 2% right now. In fact, it's a very low assumption. Business fixed investment, we\u2019re not anticipating any great lift from fixed investment increases or hiring. ","And so we\u2019ve built our expectations in this guidance we gave you around some rather slow economic indicators and our hope is at this mid-level enterprise business and above that they will continue investing in productivity efforts because productivity efforts tend to require the types of solutions that we bring to bear particularly in mobility. But it\u2019s a little uncertain right now.","John Stephens","Mike, the only thing I would add to that is that we are continuing to see some investment in strategic business, services and people willing to invest in growth. It is slow. And secondly, with our project VIP investment we hope to self-generate some changes in the small business by providing some additional broadband services and capabilities as we do with some of our fiber to the building, some of our expansion of our U-verse footprint and give us some opportunities on a self action \u2013 self-led action to help increase our performance in small business but it\u2019s just as Randall said, we did not bake into our expectations for \u201813 any form of significant economic lift or significant recovery. ","Randall Stephenson","But what\u2019s kind of interesting Michael and it gets a little bit obscured in how industry reports numbers. But we talk about enterprise being in decline on the fixed line side, when you look at the spend on the wireless side though, enterprise spending in total is actually rather healthy but it\u2019s just the spend is really being directed towards mobility and the world of tablets and the world of smartphones is really driving significant spend in enterprise business. So in total it is growing, the fixed line side is little pressured for the reasons we talked about. ","Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research","And just a follow up briefly, is there a way investors should think about how much of your sales on enterprise are now tied to wireless, is there a metric that you want us to keep in mind in terms of the demand from your customers to bundle the build together and work with you on a combination too?","Randall Stephenson","Yeah, Mike, the best indication of what is going on there is what we\u2019re seeing in some of the VPN and cloud hosting services which are really part and parcel generated by a lot of the employee mobility issues that the large corporations are facing. But we don\u2019t have a direct breakout either on the mobility or on the wireline side that tie those two back and forth and we\u2019ve chosen not to do that for clarity of information as opposed to we think we could draw some challenges, we'll rethink that, and continue to reaffirm right now. I think the way we get information is the clearest picture for you.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Mike McCormack with Nomura Securities.","Mike McCormack \u2013 Nomura Securities","Thanks. John, just looking at the wireless margins as we progress into 2013 and I think John\u2019s comment -- John Hodulik's comments sort of hit on it as well, thinking about the impact on subsidies, well, we can change there. But I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re going to have a decent snapback as we go into Q1, any color on that?","And then secondly, also regard to smartphones, is there going to be an issue eventually where we have smartphone penetration reaching heights that, when we start talking about record activations of smartphones are becoming sort of a bad word, meaning we are seeing more smart-to-smart and is there still ARPU opportunity to gain from the subsidy from that?","And then lastly, again, John, thinking about the targeted leverage and the dividend payout, when you think about, how many shares you think about repurchasing over period of time, are you targeting an absolute reduction in dividend payment itself?","John Stephens","So let me kind of go through, I guess, lot of questions here Mike, let me go through those. First and foremost, certainly the dividend reduction that results on the buybacks and as Randall mentioned, I think, this year we are going to stay close to $700 million in that because of the share buyback process is an important piece of it.","But quite frankly, it's not the controlling piece, certainly taking into consideration, but that\u2019s not we\u2019re targeting. It has more to do with the balancing the capital structure in today's environment with some certainty for longer term while protecting our ability to invest, pay dividend and keep flexibility for things like we mentioned, whether it would be NextWave or the Atlantic Tele-Network acquisition that we recently announced.","That\u2019s the balance that we have to have, the cash cost of debt today is much lower than the cash cost of our equity and so that give us that opportunity. We\u2019re just trying to do balance while retaining flexibility protecting the dividend. That\u2019s it.","Secondly, with regard to smarthphone, once again, whether we are talking about percentage of sales of -- smartphones as a percentage of phones sold, which was up 89% this quarter or smartphones as a percentage of total postpaid devices, which was about 86%, either one of those is well above our smartphone penetration of about two-thirds today.","So we have a natural -- with the existing base we have a natural growth opportunity, just by converting those to smartphones and we've been growing that percentage of our postpaid base smartphones 2% to 3% a quarter, so that\u2019s going to continue for some time.","Two, as we are saying we added 400,000 tablets or nearly 400,000 tablets this quarter. So we are seeing the data-only devices, data centric devices like tablets draw generating lot of growth, we believe that will continue.","Our LTE rollout, 74 million POPS and moving to 250 million POPS is going to generate speed, which we think will generate usage, which we think give us the opportunity because of our new usage in tier data plans and the movement of our customer base to that will allow us to grow revenues.","So, we are optimistic about our position and then when you add on Digital Life, when you add on connected cars, when you add on the healthcare infrastructure that analysts talk about, when you add on the mobile premise solution or the home-based mobile phone.","All of those opportunities along with our mobile wallet are going to give us real chances to continue to grow revenue and at a scale base, when you are a player of our size. So we are optimistic about that.","With regard to the wireless margins and consistent with what John was asking earlier, we are just looking at every aspect of our arrangements with our customers of our service, trying to make our service effortless but very efficient, and so we are looking at all of those and believe there is still opportunities to improve margins through making things easier on our customers while we are reducing costs on ourselves, so.","Mike McCormack - Nomura Securities","Yeah. That\u2019s good. And just on the margin side, you\u2019re obviously anticipating improvement in \u201913 versus \u201912, I\u2019m assuming, you don\u2019t want to try to put any parameters on that?","John Stephens","No. No. We are just going to -- we are going to stick with very simply put, we are going to represent to you like we did in 2012, what we can achieve and we are going to take that same approach this year.","And I\u2019m sorry, Mike, I -- we are -- that we are going to -- we are going to have improvement in margins. We are not going to disclose quarterly margin analysis and yes, as you well know, there is going to be seasonality with regard to it, based on a whole number of items that we go through. So, but I think you\u2019re well aware of those items.","Mike McCormack - Nomura Securities","Great. Appreciate it guys.","John Stephens","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","A couple questions, I guess first for Randall, realizing you obviously just did WCS and QUALCOMM, when do you envision the next opportunity to look for meaningful additions to your stock and portfolio, and if you look at the SEC and the current attempt to sort of better define the rules for you around spectrum ownership and potential caps, how does that influence your view on timing? And then second question just for John, at the analyst day you guys obviously had pretty extensive detail and commitment on potential decommissioning of copper plant. As you start to get into those efforts from an engineering perspective and really gauge your response from regulators on the feasibility, how quickly do you think those efforts can progress and really translate into changes to the cost structure?","Randall Stephenson","Hi Jason, on the spectrum you'll see in all likelihood some additional purchases of spectrum this year filling in some holes. And so you will see us continue to do some of that during the course of 2013. But in terms of when the next meaningful block of spectrum will come on the market, that\u2019s obviously the government\u2019s next auction and they\u2019ve talked about a 2014 date. I hope that, that's accurate. I would be impressed and surprised if it were. Our expectation is that hopefully they can get into the market in the 2015, 2016 timeframe. And when you think about spectrum caps, Jason, it\u2019s interesting what\u2019s happened over the last year is the industry dynamic has kind of I think made the spectrum caps issue I think far more interesting. It looks like Sprint is about to secure a significant amount of spectrum, T-Mobile combining with Metro PCS obviously their spectrum depth and position is radically different.","And so our view and our expectation is as we get closer to a government auction that the need to do a lot of evaluation on spectrum caps seems less and less relevant and it seems like there is going to have to play into this -- an equation of how much spectrum does an entity hold versus how much spectrum are they using and we continue to reinforce that spectrum caps is the wrong way to think about this. The right way to think about this is ensuring that spectrum markets are fluid and liquid and that there are aggressive build requirements on spectrum. You put those two Things in place and you ensure kind of a market-based economic allocation of spectrum. And so that\u2019s what we continue to push forward. We\u2019re actually not anticipating any significant spectrum caps being placed that would inhibit any of the players from engaging in an auction in the future. ","And when you consider the situation that the federal government has right now in terms of the fiscal problems that we\u2019re facing I would expect that Congress would be most interested in having an auction that would yield the greatest benefits and the greatest benefits and spectrum caps do not go hand in hand. ","John Stephens","Jason, with regard to the decommissioning capital plan issue, we continue to work that issue not only on a network engineering and our IT guys with regard to products and services and all the issues really the \u2013 transitioning to an all IP service based providers but we are also working it from an external affairs on the regulatory side. I will tell you from a cost savings perspective that there are no significant cost-savings expected in this guidance that we gave for 2013. And I would suggest you that is a \u2013 it is a number of years out. It's not that it will not be achieved but it\u2019s a number of years out in the sense of \u2013 this is a longer process to work with all the interested parties and make sure we do it right, do it effectively and do it successfully. Working it, lot of activity on it but I wouldn\u2019t suggest you that there is a significant improvement in cost structure in \u201913 because of it. ","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of David Barden with Bank of America.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America","I guess two. First, John, could you, on the guidance change, the increase in earnings per share growth expectations from mid-single digits at the analyst day to now high single digits, could you clarify if that's more about the timing and pacing of buybacks, or is there something fundamental that's improved relative to your view that you gave I guess in October, and if you could kind of elaborate a little bit on what that is? ","And then, I guess, second, I don\u2019t know, Ralph is on the call, but maybe Randall, just as you look at your wireless business, I think that you\u2019ve got a lot of advantages relative to as you mentioned some of the interesting events that are going to take place this year. But as you look at yourself relative to Verizon, they are taking three times the net ads that you took in the quarter, including tablets maybe four times, if you exclude tablets, they are guiding to 10% higher margins in 2013 versus what AT&T got in 2012. LTE is about a year ahead?","I mean, how do you think about trying to close the distance with respect to Verizon? Do you care and what do you prepared to do in terms of margin market share promotions to really address that gap that\u2019s emerged? Thanks.","John Stephens","Okay. Let me take the increase in EPS first, first, I think the -- at the Analyst Conference, we were talking about a three-year cycle or three-year term. And so, that was the information we provided there and I think as we told you that we\u2019d update specific guidance in 2013 on this call. So that\u2019s -- there are different timeframes, different patterns just from the get go.","I will tell you, we have taken the account some of the really solid results that we had in the fourth quarters, specifically with regard to tremendous wireless sales and postpaid net adds, great performance on broadband and our consumer U-verse business, great performance on TV. So, and quite frankly, some really good news from our enterprise business sides.","So, we update that, we take that into account and of course, we take into account our recent share repurchase, but really the answer your question, I think is more about we were talking about two different sets of time period. One was the three-year general information, today is a commitment on guidance that we expect meet or exceed.","David Barden - Bank of America","Got it.","Randall Stephenson","In terms of the comparison versus our competitors I think you asked the question do we care or think about it, you probably know us better than to ask that question, and of course, we care, we think about it a lot and we focus on it and our objective is to not lose share throughout the course of this year and to -- actually get to a point where we gaining share vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors.","So we focus on it. We\u2019re doing a lot of work in terms of just margin expansion and as we commented early on our guidance, we expect to expend our margin again this year, and so objective is to get our margins comparable to our competitors and also equalize share, so it\u2019s a competitive dynamic, a competitive marketplace, and so, that\u2019s the front part of this industry.","David Barden - Bank of America","Thanks Randall.","Operator","Thank you. Our next in queue will come from the line of Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","Thanks guys. And two for Randall while I have you. With the re-elected Obama administration, Randall maybe just some thoughts on what you think they might focus on. Are you optimistic or concerned about any issues they might focus on? So one thing I have really scene is they seem to want to have much faster broadband speeds. Do you think there's anything they can do to really help the deployment?","And secondly, Randall, while we have you, I mean, Apple is still a very large percentage of your iPhone sales and it doesn't seem like the subsidies have really declined in that for the last six years. With Android catching up in terms of quality, it would allow more global consolidation, do you see a point where those subsidies start to decline and if so, when? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","Sure. In terms of the administration\u2019s view on our industry and what we might expect, the current chairman has expressed obviously an interest in having broader broadband deployment. We're actually very supportive. We would like to see the administration come out with a position that is very, very supportive of broad-based broadband deployment.","And in our VIP announcement, it fits perfectly in line with that and in fact, the administration has expressed appreciation for our commitment to investment in extending the broadband. So I don\u2019t see any big issues coming out of the administration that they\u2019re going to change our plans or change how we view the industry right now.","I think the biggest issues that could impact our industry and our company tend to be more macro policies in nature, tax policy for example. Do we get a big budget deal done and if we do get a big budget deal done, is there an appetite and an interest in doing tax reform? And we would obviously be very, very significant supporters of tax reform, we would really love to see the effective rate on profits come down and understanding that means some of the preferences like bonus depreciation may have to be compromised but we think that's a good thing. It\u2019s good for industry and we think it\u2019s healthy for the U.S. economy. So those are the issues that are probably most impacting to us.","I think other policy issues that are kind of unknown, they could affect the industry or us specifically the Affordable Care Act as those regulations were published what kind of impact will that have because that\u2019s just a big uncertainty that we\u2019re all waiting, trying to understand exactly how that\u2019s going to affect all others.","And so the macro will be probably more important, Tim, and more relevant to us in 2013 than industry specific issues. As you think about subsidies, we are very encouraged by the new device line that we\u2019re seeing come into the marketplace. And we had a record quarter in terms of selling Android devices. I\u2019m very enthusiastic about the Windows 8 devices that are coming into the market place.","And in 2013, we\u2019re going to see more and more of those. We think a good, vibrant, healthy set of options for our customers and the whole ecosystem is really, really good for our customers. And it\u2019s a good healthy environment for competition among all the players which from our standpoint would probably be good for us as well.","So we\u2019re optimistic about what we\u2019ve seen coming into the line-up in 2013 and a good healthy competitive set of handsets across different OS\u2019 actually very optimistic about Blackberry 10. Hope that it proves to be as good as it appears to be, so.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","Anyway, thank you.","Susan Johnson","Tony, this is Susan. I think we\u2019ve got time for just one more question.","Operator","Thank you. The final question will come from Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank","Thanks for getting me in. During the quarter, I believe, you were running a promo on your tablets. I think it was a $100 rebate, which sort of looks like an experiment with subsidies on tablet. I\u2019m just curious what was your experience with that? Did you find that it ended up having a meaningfully positive effect on people buying tablets and attach them to their data plans or are you finding that the tethering option is accomplishing that without the cost?","Randall Stephenson","Great question, Brett. I\u2019ll answer the question this way. If you looked at our results, you will see that we added just under 4000 tablets for the quarter, which is a significant number for us in the postpaid space. And we do believe that the $100 promotion was part of that and was part of the success.","When we looked at what those customers bought and what they added to in their mobile share or on their separate plans, we were pleased with the ARPUs that we got out of it and so we viewed it as a positive and think of it as a tool that could be really beneficial to help us grow the business from a data centric device.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank","So do you think you may get a little more of permanent feature in the way you priced tablets or just use it as a one-off motional from time-to-time?","Randall Stephenson","I think we\u2019re going to look at that on a regular basis and decide it as we go forward with it. In the fourth quarter, the results were positive, not only on the sales activities but on the revenue commitments that we got out of it from a monthly basis. So the ARPU aspects of it will also more than satisfactory to us. So we felt like it was a very successful strategy.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank","Thanks for taking my question.","John Stephens","Thank you. With that, I want to thank all of you being on the call with us this afternoon. We\u2019ve closed the year with another strong quarter and delivered on the expectations that we laid out for you at the beginning of 2012. And as Randall mentioned, we are positioned well for 2013. We are focused on growth and have a solid achievable plan that will help us get there. Thanks again for being on the call and as always thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T\u2019s Executive Teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Michael Viola, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.","Michael Viola","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; John Stankey, Chief Operating Officer for AT&T; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer.","Randall will begin the call with a brief overview of the 2019 accomplishments and a look at our three-year plans. John Stephens will then discuss fourth quarter results and then John Stankey will walk you through key areas of our 2020 operating plan. John Stephens will then close the presentation with an update on our capital allocation plan and 2020 financial guidance. Then we'll take your questions.","Before I begin, I want to call your attention to our safe harbor statement, which says that, some of our comments today may be forward-looking and as such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. I also want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum Auction 103, so we cannot address any questions about that today. As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That includes our news release, investor briefing, 8-K and other associated schedules.","And so, with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Randall Stephenson. Randall?","Randall Stephenson","Thanks, Mike. I want to start on slide three to close out 2019. And coming into 2019, we laid out a detailed plan for the year and that plan was the series of specific steps necessary to exit 2019 on a path of sustained growth. A simple summary on slide three is that we met or exceeded every single one of those objectives and the road map is set for the next three years.","I told you that our top priority for 2019 was to reduce our debt and exit the year at around 2.5 times debt to EBITDA, done. We have now reduced net debt by about $30 billion since we closed Time Warner. And at the end of 2019, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was about 2.5 times.","We gave you the formula for exactly what it would take to get to this debt level. First, we would need to generate $26 billion of free cash flow, done. We exceeded that handily, generating a record $29 billion for the year. Second, we would need to monetize non-strategic assets and generate $6 billion to $8 billion of cash, done. We actually generated nearly $18 billion, more than double our target. And we've already announced an additional $2 billion, which will close in 2020.","On adjusted EPS, we came in right on plan, low single-digit growth. At WarnerMedia, we achieved the 2019 merger synergies and we're preparing to launch HBO Max in May. Growing wireless service revenues was critical and those revenues were up nearly 2% for the full year.","We stabilized Entertainment Group EBITDA and brought in our capital investment right on plan. And after sustained investment in our network, AT&T exited 2019 with the best and fastest wireless network in the United States. Our 5G network covers 50 million people today and we expect to have nationwide 5G coverage in the second quarter. As we look forward, our 2019 performance positions us well for the next three years.","Our plan is very straightforward and we've laid it out for you on slide four. We see revenue growth every year and expect a 1% to 2% three-year CAGR through 2022. By 2022, adjusted EBITDA margins expand by 200 basis points, adjusted EBITDA grows by about $6 billion, free cash flow is between $30 billion and $32 billion and adjusted EPS grows to between $4.50 and $4.80.","This is a plan that generates a lot of cash over the next three years. And the Board has developed a very thoughtful capital allocation approach that will maintain a solid balance sheet and drive shareholder value. First, we'll continue to invest aggressively and at top-tier levels into our core businesses. We expect to invest $20 billion in 2020.","Leading in 5G is critical for AT&T and we're not slowing down. We're more than 75% complete on our FirstNet build and that will continue. And we're continuing to deploy fiber. In terms of our capital structure, over the last 18 months we've retired the lion's share of the debt we issued to acquire Time Warner. And we'll continue to pay down debt, but at a much slower pace. Our cash will be focused over the next three years on retiring the shares we issued to acquire Time Warner. By the end of 2022, we will have retired 100% of the debt and 70% of the shares from our Time Warner transaction. In fact, we retired 56 million of these shares in 2019.","We also plan to retire about 100 million more in the first quarter of this year to a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. By 2022, our leverage target is a very comfortable net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.0 to 2.25 times. You can also expect us to continue streamlining our portfolio as we monetize additional assets of $5 billion to $10 billion this year. And as I said earlier, we've already executed agreements that will generate $2 billion this year.","John Stephens will cover the specific steps in the plan later. But first, he's going to cover our fourth quarter results. So I'll turn it over to you now John.","John Stephens","Thanks, Randall. Let me begin with the financial summary on slide 6. As Randall mentioned, we hit or exceeded all our 2019 targets. Let's take a closer look. We grew earnings. Adjusted EPS was $0.89, up 3.5% for the quarter and up 1.4% for the full year. Cash from operations came in strong at $11.9 billion for the quarter and $48.7 billion for the year. Free cash flow was a record $29 billion for the full-year, up 30%.","The addition of WarnerMedia made an impact as did adding their receivables to our securitization efforts. Our ability to generate cash continues to provide a strong foundation for our capital allocation plan. We continue to aggressively invest. CapEx was nearly $20 billion for the full year and total gross capital investment was $23.7 billion, when you include our investments in FirstNet and other vendor payments.","And without the impact of foreign exchange and forgone licensing revenue in advance of our HBO Max launch, fourth quarter and full year revenues would have been $48 billion and about $184 billion, representing growth in both the quarter and the year. Even with these items, operating income margins were stable in the quarter and up 70 basis points for the year. All in all, a very good year as we hit our 2019 targets.","Let's now look at our segment operating results starting with our Communications segment on slide 7. In our Communications segment, mobility continues to build momentum and deliver solid results. Service revenue grew by about 2% in the quarter and for the year. EBITDA grew both in the quarter and for the year. And EBITDA margins expanded by 40 basis points for the year, while service margins were stable even with a heavily promotional fourth quarter.","Postpaid phone growth was solid adding 229,000 in the quarter. For the year, we had about one million phone net adds both postpaid and prepaid. This strong performance was driven by our industry-leading network and came even while postpaid phone churn was up as competitors ramped up promotional efforts. You should note total churn postpaid and prepaid combined improved year-over-year by 12 basis points.","As Randall mentioned, our Entertainment Group hit its full year target of EBITDA stability. Long-term customer value continues to be our focus as we head into 2020. That focus has helped drive growth in video and IP broadband ARPUs. AT&T Fiber continues to grow adding nearly 200,000 customers. That brings us to nearly four million AT&T Fiber customers and we have lots of room left to grow.","Premium video net losses improved sequentially by more than 200,000 subscribers, but video losses continue to impact our broadband numbers, especially our bundled customers. Our new simplified video offerings position us for the long term and our subscriber trends are improving.","Let's turn to Business Wireline. The trends in Business Wireline continued to improve. Revenues grew sequentially and were down just 1.7% year-over-year. And when you include wireless, Business Solutions grew 1.1%. EBITDA was relatively steady in the quarter and EBITDA margins were up 40 basis points.","Let's move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results, which are on slide 8. WarnerMedia had a great quarter when you consider the decision to forego content licensing revenue. Subscriber revenue growth at both Turner and HBO combined with lower film and television production cost at Warner Bros. helped to offset that pressure.","We made the strategic decision to give HBO Max exclusive streaming rights for top programs including Friends, Big Bang Theory and other popular shows. In the past, we would have sold these externally.","Looking at the impact on the fourth quarter, WarnerMedia revenues would have grown by about 10% if these shows would have been sold. In fact that 10% organic growth would represent WarnerMedia's best growth rate in three years. And EBITDA would have increased by about $300 million or about 11%. Obviously this has an upfront cost for us, but we see this as an investment that makes HBO Max even stronger and will pay off over the long-term.","The big news in our Latin American operations is Mexico turning EBITDA positive in the quarter. The team has done an excellent job of reducing costs and growing revenue in a challenging environment.","Fourth quarter Mexico EBITDA improved nearly $200 million year-over-year and improved by more than $300 million for the full year. We continue to press for further gains.","A new wholesale agreement with Telef\u00f3nica will add to both revenues and EBITDA. Going forward we expect continued improvement. Vrio continues to work against economic and foreign exchange headwinds. But even in this environment, it continues to be profitable and generate positive cash flows.","Now, let me turn it over to John Stankey to cover our 2020 operating plan and then I'll come back and discuss a capital allocation update. John?","John Stankey","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 10. These are the four key areas of our 2020 operating plan where we'll be focused in executing to drive our performance.","I'll go into some detail on each of these over the next few minutes but I'll give you the headlines first. Number one is continuing our momentum in mobility because we expect mobility will continue to be the biggest driver of revenue growth and profitability and be a key factor in meeting our 2020 goals.","Second, a successful launch of HBO Max is critical to our plans in each of the next three years. Many of you are with us for the Analyst Day in October and have seen firsthand why we're so excited about HBO Max and the opportunities it gives us. We're right on track to launch it in May.","Third, is growing our broadband revenues by increasing our fiber penetration. Key to this will be bundling our fiber broadband offer with AT&T TV, which is delivered over our software based video architecture.","And finally, we're laser focused on improving both the effectiveness and the efficiency of our overall operations and as a result, driving additional costs out of the business.","Let me dive into each of these four drivers beginning with mobility on slide 11. Last year our wireless network was recognized as the nation's best and also fastest thanks in part to our FirstNet build. In fact, we did a few of our own spot test in December to see how our existing nationwide 5G evolution network compared to the 5G network one of our competitors rolled out last month.","In three out of the four test cities, our network had faster speeds and lower latency on average. The point is our strong spectrum position gives us a leg up and allows us to execute a different 5G deployment strategy than our competitors. We have the low and mid-band spectrum to deploy 5G nationwide. We cover 50 million people today and expect to be nationwide in the second quarter.","We also have the millimeter wave spectrum we need to deploy 5G+ and its gigabit speeds and super low latency to more densely populated cities. We're in 35 cities today and we're adding more this year. There's an important point to be made here once we have 5G nationwide. As you know smartphone upgrades across the industry have been down for a while now. In fact, we're coming off a record low upgrade rate for any fourth quarter in our history.","But fast forward to the back half of this year when popular 5G smartphones and devices should be more available at scale, you can expect higher upgrade rates and equipment revenue growth.","The timing for this upgrade cycle couldn't be more perfect when you consider that we'll be offering HBO Max on our highest ARPU wireless plans with features tuned for premium media consumption and at a time when people are coming into our stores to upgrade.","It's a natural opportunity to further the distribution of HBO Max, while adding new mobility subscribers and improving our wireless ARPUs. HBO Max's content has something for everyone in the family and that makes it a natural fit for our nearly 25 million postpaid accounts that average more than three lines per account.","As a result, we expect our wireless service revenue growth rate to be higher in 2020. And after adding nearly 1 million phone net adds in 2019, both postpaid and prepaid, we expect 2020 will be an even better year for net adds.","FirstNet plays an important role here. We now serve more than 10,000 first responder agencies and more than 1 million connections with FirstNet. We expect those numbers will grow nicely as our FirstNet deployment reaches 80% in new devices and capabilities come to market in the coming months.","We also expect a higher adoption of our unlimited plans. We're at a little more than 50% penetration today, but we expect the 5G device upgrade cycle will bring into our stores lots of customers not on unlimited plans today.","Increasing the adoption of our best unlimited plans is obviously an ARPU growth opportunity for us. And when you add into the mix the customers on select unlimited plans will get HBO Max for free, it's a great opportunity to also improve our overall churn which we've seen happen from giving HBO to current unlimited customers.","A reduction of one basis point of wireless churn across the base is worth about $100 million to us annually. Sum it up; we're expecting growth of more than 2% in mobility service revenues this year.","Let's go to Slide 12 and the headlines for why we believe HBO Max will be a game-changer for our customers and for AT&T. I expect many of you were at the HBO Max Analyst Day in October and you heard me talk about the three pillars required for success in streaming; premier content; the technology platform; and marketing and distribution. Only AT&T has a space with a solid footing in all three.","My excitement and confidence in the HBO Max opportunity have only grown since then. The team has made tremendous progress in every area and we're on track to launch in May with a unique offering. Quite simply, we believe HBO Max will be the highest quality premium SVOD in the market with a great experience, better curation, and higher percentage of culturally relevant offerings than competing products.","We're excited to launch HBO Max coming off the tail end of one of our strongest awards seasons ever with new and exciting breakthrough offerings leading the way. We captured an industry-leading 34 Emmys and six Golden Globe awards. Joker had more Academy Award nominations than any other film, highlighting our deep and diverse theatrical content.","The awards are only the latest indicator that we continue to create high-quality culturally relevant content that appeals to a broad consumer base. And our additional investment in great content is only going to expand the appeal of the service. With HBO Max, we'll offer consumers more than twice the amount of programming for the same price as HBO today.","We're making great progress on the HBO product platform as well. Our controlled nonpublic beta is getting solid reviews and we're gaining invaluable feedback on important but subtle issues like user navigation and screen layout. This work is no less important than award-winning content.","Finally, we continue to fine-tune our go-to-market plans consistent with the unique position with which we enter the market, leveraging our extensive AT&T distribution and embedded base of more than 30 million domestic HBO subscribers. We're in active discussions across our potential distribution partners both digital platforms and MVPDs. We're making progress and we expect we'll have deals to announce prior to launch.","Our focus continues to be on providing a compelling value proposition for our HBO distribution partners and our mutual customers. Our more than 10 million HBO subscribers on AT&T distribution platforms will be offered immediate access to HBO Max at launch, so we'll get off to a fast start.","To drive incremental growth, we have unique advantages when combining media and distribution including our 170 million direct customer relationships across mobile, pay TV and broadband. Plus, we have 5500 retail stores who will be focused on driving incremental HBO Max adoption by bundling it with premium-tiered wireless, broadband or pay TV offers.","And we'll use AT&T customer insights for WarnerMedia advertising analytics and curation. We have very high expectations for HBO Max. And at the same time we're thrilled about the possibilities of increasing the adoption of higher ARPU services and strengthening the long-term value proposition of our highest quality and highest ARPU customers. We fully expect HBO Max will have a positive and immediate impact on the stickiness of our wireless and pay TV and broadband offerings.","Now let's look at Entertainment Group. Those details are on Slide 13. Our EG team delivered our target of stable EBITDA last year. In 2020 you're going to see us apply the same high-value customer-centric focus, while increasing our fiber customer base and launching AT&T TV. We'll see higher amortization cost in the video business in the first quarter which creates some tough year-over-year comparisons for EG EBITDA but on a cash from operations basis we expect EG to be stable in 2020 versus last year.","We believe the greatest opportunity within EG is to significantly grow our AT&T Fiber customer base and broadband revenues. We have 4 million fiber customers today and our recent fiber expansion gives us 14 million locations to sell into. Based on our fiber sales experience we expect to exit 2022 with about 3 million more fiber customers than we have today or a total of about 7 million. This will be a significant lift in market share compared to our traditional performance in our legacy hybrid fiber copper-based footprint.","It represents an organic market share growth opportunity on an existing product that I've never experienced in my career. Where we offer competitive broadband speeds you can expect that we'll lean into video acquisition given the better economics of our improved product portfolio including AT&T TV and HBO Max all software-based products with low acquisition costs.","Within our broadband footprint expected as we exit the year our premium video subscriber declines will be more in line with overall video industry trends. Looking at our total premium video customer base, we expect year-over-year improvements in the subscriber losses.","Now let's turn to Slide 14 to talk about our efficiency and cost initiatives. New work to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our operations has progressed over the past few months. We previously shared with you that we're targeting an additional 4% reduction in labor-related costs including benefits and contract employees in 2020 alone.","That work will ramp quickly and we plan for it to deliver $1.5 billion in additional cost savings. In fact we've already identified and implemented about half of those savings. Another significant opportunity for us is product information technology rationalization. We feel comfortable that we can generate another $2 billion of annual run rate efficiencies exiting 2022. This will come from thinning our product portfolio, simplifying our market offers, rationalizing call centers, modernizing our information technology and enhancing the level of customer self support.","In addition, streamlining will have the added benefit of enhancing our market agility and ultimately lead to improved market effectiveness. Our assessment work continues and I expect in the next 90 days we'll have additional efficiency initiatives underway for some of our network, corporate, sales and procurement functions.","I'll turn it back to John now for his look at capital allocation 2020 financial guidance.","John Stephens","Thanks, John. Strengthen our balance sheet was our top priority last year and our teams did an excellent job of reducing debt and monetizing our asset portfolio. This allowed us to begin retiring shares at the end of last year while still meeting our net debt ratio goals.","In 2020, you can expect that momentum to continue. It all starts with strong free cash flows. We had record free cash flow last year and expect to be in a similar range this year. We achieved this even with some voluntary funding for retiree medical costs and higher tax payments in the fourth quarter.","We also overachieved on asset monetizations. We expect to do another $5 billion to $10 billion net monetizations this year with significant efforts already underway. At the same time, we continue to evolve our capital structure. We added more preferred to our capital stack last year when we monetized more than $6 billion of our long-term tower purchase options. And we also issued $1.2 billion of traditional preferred stock.","The publicly traded preferred stock is new to us but there is a market for it and it provides investors another alternative to invest with AT&T. In fact, these shares are currently trading at a premium to par. Investors are looking for secured dependable returns, which is exactly what this offers. And dividend rates at less than our common stock dividend yield make it attractive for us.","The tower preferreds also allow us to use very long-term assets to generate cash in a tax-efficient manner. We also continue to be focused on our three-year debt reduction targets. Depending on the timing of share retirements and asset monetizations, you will see our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios fluctuate throughout the year but we expect to continue reducing debt for the full year and intend to target leverage in the two to 2.25 range by the end of 2022.","Our share retirement has begun in earnest. We told you we wanted to buy shares as early in the year as possible and that is what you're seeing. Thanks to our $4 billion ASR, we've already bought back about 85 million shares in January and expect to see another 20 million in the remainder of the first quarter.","You can expect us to continue to buy back shares during the remainder of the year and meet or exceed our 250 million share retirement target for 2020. That's on top of the 56 million shares we bought back in 2019. We have a lot of levers we can pull to optimize our capital structure. We're focused on managing debt and have a wealth of opportunities with our balance sheet as we showed last year. You can expect us to continue to manage it in a prudent way including issuing additional preferred shares.","Now let me revisit our 2020 guidance on Slide 17. Our guidance remains consistent with what we told you in October. This year more so than most, our results will be more weighted to the second half of the year. For example, in the first part of the year, we expect pressure from heavy HBO Max investment, which you saw begin in the fourth quarter.","And in EG, higher content and noncash amortization costs as well as continued pressure on video subs. But in the second half of the year you will see our momentum build. For example, share retirements have been aggressive and will continue and the EPS benefits will flow increasingly throughout the year.","HBO Max will have launched leading to strong subscriber growth. The run rate benefits of our cost reduction plans will be clearly visible. And 5G combined with HBO Max will drive more upgrades and stronger wireless revenue growth later in the year. Again, all of this has been factored into our full year guidance.","With that in mind, here's what we've committed to: 1% to 2% revenue growth; adjusted EPS of $3.60 to $3.70 a share; stable adjusted EBITDA margins; free cash flow in the $28 billion range, with our dividend payout ratio in the low 50s; gross capital investment in the $20 billion range and this doesn't include our investments in content; continued debt reduction with share retirement of 250 million or more common shares in 2020; and our net asset monetizations between $5 billion and $10 billion.","Mike, that concludes our presentation. We're now ready for Q&A.","Michael Viola","Operator, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik. Please, go ahead.","John Hodulik","Great. Thank you. Maybe a couple of questions for John Stankey. Yes. Thanks for the commentary on the entertainment sub trends, but maybe a little bit more clarity. I mean, first of all, you saw a slowdown in fiber adds in the quarter. What was driving that? And, I guess, in conjunction with the guidance for sort of more improvement in the back end of the year, do you expect that trend to reverse?","Or when -- how do you expect those adds to sort of play out over the course of the year? And what drives the acceleration? And then, in terms of the HBO Max guidance, the $500 million in incremental expense we saw in 2019, does that impact your guidance for the $2 billion in 2020? Thanks.","John Stankey","Hi, John. Happy New Year. So, first of all, fourth quarter of 2019, fourth quarter is seasonally a slower quarter. December is a pretty slow month in general for home-based services, given the dynamics of the holiday and the like, so that's part of the contribution to the issue of the slowdown.","The second is, our gross add performance on video wasn't strong. You see the subscriber trends. As we've shared with you, as we move through this year and we start shifting to AT&T TV, our gross add performance starts to get much stronger. And naturally, when you're able to put AT&T TV, a software-based product with fiber, it's a much more natural combination than a satellite dish and fiber. And so, as we start to roll out AT&T TV now in markets and we move in, we're going to see much stronger performance on the fiber side.","I'll tell you, as I look at where we are right now in current customer trends, I feel pretty good that that's, in fact, the case and we're going to be where we need to be on that. Frankly, it's not a hard sell. It's a great product. It's a product that customers like. I think, we could do very well with it and I don't expect that we're going to see that continue through. So, that's what I would tell you. You're going to see recovery in 2020.","On the Max side, we gave you a range on what to expect in 2020 in terms of dilution, that we're not changing any of that range. The range is a range for a reason. There's a lot of moving parts on Max introduction. It's a combination of both, going to market with subscribers and it's a product that's going to continue to grow over the coming years.","And we're going to be looking in the market for opportunities for other content acquisition and the like. And it's entirely possible, we may be opportunistic, or look at something and we want the management team to have that flexibility to be able to balance those things out. We have subscriber growth coming and things are working well with our strategies. We make it a little heavier on trying to build up subscribers and what we expected.","I think, that's the nature of building a new and subscription-oriented business. And so, that range is important that we have the flexibility for the management team to do what they want to do. We feel very strongly we're going to get back that investment as we build this new distribution platform over the coming years, that's why we're doing this. We like the dynamic of ultimately having some control of those customers and being in a position where we can manage that life cycle going forward. And we think it's a good smart long-term investment.","John Hodulik","Okay. Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick. Please go ahead.","Philip Cusick","Hi, guys. Thanks. John, can you update us on the WarnerMedia strategy from here away from Max? We see video industry bundled units declining pretty quickly even away from you as you decelerate. How does that change your thoughts on Turner over time and the strategic value there?","And then can you also give us an update on the low-value video subs that are remaining in the base and how those should come out over the next few quarters? Thanks very much.","John Stankey","Sure. Happy to do that Phil. So, if you step back and think about the position we sit in the -- what I would call the traditional pay TV universe, I mean everybody knows it's in transition. And it's a mature product that's kind of working its way through the back end of a life cycle. But I like where we stand in that and that our total percentage of cost of goods sold in that space relative to the size of the bundle that the customer buys is not huge.","Our network portfolio is a fairly concentrated network portfolio. If you think about it the bulk of our profitability comes from three primary networks, its TNT, TBS, and CNN. And I think if you look at trends, we all know that general entertainment content and the bundle is not performing as well and the nice part about our two general entertainment networks TNT and TBS, these are really hybrids. They're a combination of general entertainment and sports. And so they historically perform at the upper end of desirability from a ratings perspective and attractiveness from an advertisers' perspective because of that mix of content that we have. So, one having more contained portfolio; and two, having that mix of content I think is important to basically ride through this transition and have some resiliency.","And my view of what's been happening in most carriage agreement negotiations, as we go back out in the market and renew things is our distributors see that and understand that those are important networks to carry forward. And we're continuing to see that people place value on those things even in a more skinny down or a smaller pay TV universe moving forward and feel pretty good about that.","Now, let's be clear, the reason we're doing Max is we also know that new distribution platforms need to be out there that are the growth platforms and that match general entertainment content how consumers want to see them. And that pivot between what we're doing with linear networks and what we're doing with Max is a key part of the WarnerMedia strategy. It's an important dance and choreography that we have to do to get that right. And we feel we're positioned very well and make that happen. We spent a lot of time in the Investor Day explaining why we think it's a natural place to go.","To keep the networks relevant what you should expect us to do, we will continue to invest that -- in them. We'll continue to make sure that they're viable for our distributors, but you'll see the content shift start to occur a little bit. What we see with subscribers is that obviously they like news and sports. They also like content that's socially relevant. And so probably a mix of starting to see a little bit more unscripted content come in, things that cause people go into the office and talk about it around the water cooler. And that will probably start to supplant hours. It might have been more general entertainment-oriented content that you are going to see showing up on SVOD platforms like HBO Max moving forward.","And we think that mix in conjunction with what we're doing with Max will allow us to ensure that the content we're producing in our great studios across our different brands will have a place to market that we can monetize with end user either through distributors in the traditional fashion or through direct-to-consumer constructs where maybe we have a direct relationship with the customer.","On the subscriber pay TV low-value construct, look we're mostly through that. I would tell you we've got a little bit more work to do on some promotional roll-offs in the first quarter that is going to continue to show up. And when we shared -- as I shared earlier, what's going to happen on subscriber trends that I think will be more at the rate of decline by the time we exit this year, you should expect you're going to see continuing improvement in our subscriber trends each quarter as we move through.","But I will tell you, you just can't flip a switch and get there overnight. And that's why I'm kind of suggesting you should think that we're on a glide path to get back to that ratable decline with subscriber base decline in the aggregate pay TV industry by the time we exit the year.","We're going to see probably our heaviest losses in first quarter. When I look at what's happening from an operational performance perspective and what the team is doing on gross add improvements, what we're seeing in churn improvements, the rollout of AT&T TV that really hits its stride in the second quarter in terms of its availability across the customer base, we'll start to see those subscriber trends incrementally improve as those capabilities start to roll into the base. And we'll get to what I just indicated by the time we exit the year.","Philip Cusick","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, John.","John Stankey","Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","Take the next question Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Great, good morning. Thank you. Randall, we put out a lot of targets here for 2020 and beyond. Perhaps you could just share about how the executive incentives are being set up for the year, what the KPIs and metrics are. I know last year deleveraging was I think 25% of the short -- or 20% of the short-term comp. So any color you could give around what the two or three key focuses are for the year?","And then one for John Stankey, you talked about the investment in the network, the capacity there. I think in the past you've talked about the opportunities in the wholesale market. Perhaps you could just give us an update on how things are going there and the opportunity perhaps to sign up some cable companies. Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","Hi, Simon this is Randall. Yeah, as you articulated and for those who aren't familiar, coming into 2019 I told all of you that our number one priority for 2019 was to reduce our debt and get our leverage ratios down to 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. And it was going to require strong cash flow generation, selling some non-core assets. All that was instrumental in getting there. And to really drive at home and get the focus for the management team as you said, we set that debt-to-EBITDA target as a significant amount of executive compensation and mission accomplished.","I think the team executed at an amazing level in terms of identifying asset opportunities to dispose, getting those things driven through the process, negotiated actually getting good prices for all of those assets and then driving just strong cash flows and some impressive working capital opportunities we're taking advantage of and these working capital initiatives that are put in place are not one and done. What we're most excited about are these are working capital initiatives that are repeatable. And so I feel really good about our ability to generate in 2020 even with the HBO Max investments another $28 billion of free cash flow.","Coming into this year, the debt objective of 2.5 times isn't what we're working towards. What we're working towards is making sure we're continuing to generate the cash flow to execute the broader capital allocation strategy, meaning more specifically retiring the shares we issued for Time Warner. And as both John Stephens and I articulated in our opening comments that is a focus, and our objective is to retire at least 250 million additional shares this year. We'll get about 100 million of those knocked out in the first quarter. And there's at least 150 million more to be coming in the back part of the year that will generate nice EPS accretion as we move throughout the course of the year.","And so all that said, the management team is going to be focused on hitting these earnings objectives that we've laid out for you and the cash flow targets. And that's what compensation will be really focused on. And I think it's going to be effective in generating the cash we need to execute the share buyback programs and the overall capital allocation strategy.","John Stankey","Simon thanks for asking the question, because I think it highlights a really important aspect of how we're going to grow wireless revenues next year, because we already have that strength as you indicated the network performance and that perception.","As we do research out the market is now starting to grow amongst the customer base. I think we have some plans to even fine-tune our brand positioning messages as we move into this year a little bit more. And we know that as we move that perception, which is happening right now, we see momentum in subscriber growth.","And so we've got just pure subscriber economics that are going to help us there, make some shifts in distribution. We've got the tailwinds of FirstNet behind us, which are starting to help us dramatically. And I think the coverage improvements that occur as we get into the second phase of FirstNet will allow us to move through that. And then we talked about just a few minutes ago what we're doing on the upgrade cycles and the Max launch. There's a lot of good things moving our direction what I would call the core organic part of the wireless business to grow revenues.","And frankly over the last several years, our wholesale business had been a bit of a headwind in our wireless business, because we didn't have the flash capacity that we've now been able to turn up with these key investments over the last 1.5 years. ","We're now in a much different position than we've historically been and where we've had to be very guarded about our wholesale position largely because we needed capacity to support our retail base.","And we're now, I think in a position in the industry when I look at what has to happen with people either in a deal or no-deal situation in spectrum and their spectrum holdings that we are probably more flashed than others in the industry. And we can in fact play in a different way in the wholesale space.","We're not just focused on cable. I think we want to do as I've indicated previously the right deal, a deal that's constructive for the industry in general. Certainly if there was an opportunity to do something in that space, we might do it. But there's a lot of other wholesale options out there that we expect to lean into and I expect we can step up to in the most accretive fashion possible.","And what I would indicate to you that I think whether you believe a T-Mobile, Sprint deal occurs or doesn't occur either way they are going to need to be partners in the industry that need to round out networks and do some things differently. And we would also try to understand whether or not we have other partners in the industry or merging partners in the industry that we can help with on the wholesale side.","So, there are plenty of options for us to go and start pulling that wholesale lever and driving it up. And I think that will be an incremental difference for us than what we've seen over the last couple of years that we've been managing that number down.","John Stephens","Simon to add to what John said, this is the first year that we've had stable reseller revenues throughout the year. And in fact sequentially, we grew reseller revenues and in year-over-year and the fourth quarter. So what John is talking about, we are not only well positioned for, but it's starting in a small way right now but with the opportunity to make much bigger. It's already occurring and it's contributing to that service revenue growth that we've had both in the quarter and the year.","Simon Flannery","Thanks.","John Stankey","Thanks Simon. We\u2019ll take the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Barden.","David Barden","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess two, first John Stankey your -- it sounds like you guys really have bought into this idea of 5G smartphone super cycle. And I feel like that is not a consensus view. I know that there's a lot of debate about it internally here between our tech guys and our chipset guys and our phone guys.","And so if you could kind of give us some perspective on where that conviction comes from that that we're going to get enough of a boost in demand for products that, I don't know that the consumers really understand it's a lot different than what they're already buying that would be super helpful?","And then John Stephens, could you walk us through the science behind this kind of new embrace of the preferred securities? Because it seems a little odd to be buying back stock, but then at the same time issuing preferred stock and debt has deductible interest and preferreds don't. And so I think that there's some confusion as to kind of what the net benefit to the equity holder is of kind of looking at preferreds and capital stack? Thank you.","John Stankey","Dave so I don't know that I would use the term super cycle. I don't look at the plan and say, we're expecting a super cycle. But we are expecting an increase or a step-up in what's occurring. And look I think that the foundation of that assumption is based on we've done a couple of different area interface changes. We did the UMTS air interface change. We did the LTE air interface change. And I think there were similar discussions going on at that point in time.","Well will somebody really need the increased LTE speed over UMTS? It works perfectly fine. And I would tell you we do see this step-up occur because naturally speaking people have a tendency to sit around and run speed test on their devices. And when somebody next to them is getting better performance, it raises awareness amongst the subscriber base.","And I expect that there's going to be a certain number of folks who look at that and just say because that device performs better because these new devices have access to a much broader swath of bands it's going to perform better. And we are going to see a degree of uptick simply because the subscriber base is going to notice that there is a degree of performance etcetera as a result of that.","Secondly as I said we're going to be driving some of this ourselves. We're going to be out there with some pretty aggressive promotion on HBO Max and we're going to be tying these to our better plans. And when you look at what we're assuming in our business plan for the year, our increases in the number of customers moving into unlimited aren't crazy silly step function changes. They're more of the trend and taking advantage of the fact that we are going to put more advertising dollars into the market to support Max and support 5G.","And we'll get some nominal uptick in what those migrations into our higher-value unlimited plans are. So we want to stimulate some of that. We're coming off of historic lows of upgrades. And we think the market is set up to basically go through renewal cycle given, how we're promoting. It's coming at the end of the year in the holiday season. There's going to be better networks out there. We do expect there's going to be an uptick in the upgrade cycle. Super cycle maybe a little bit too strong a word than an uptick yes.","David Barden","Got it.","John Stephens","And just to add to what John said, we have had three years here of very low upgrade rates. Just to some extent people are going to need new phones. And so this is just also this aging of the phone base has been occurring over multiple years. Secondly, this is the first time we're going to have a 5G network up and running and available before the devices are out, the next-generation networks in there. And as John made very clear, the HBO Max and other products we have they would really meld well. The convergence of all three of those things is going to be really attractive for us.","With regard to the science of a preferred it's simply this. The market is open to it. Investors want it. They like this certainty. At today's rates, our preferred that's out there is actually trading below 5% yield about a 4.7%, 4.8%. I am seeing it today about a 4.8% yield. So that's lower cash cost than our common dividend, so that saves us money there. Secondly, as you know they don't share in the common profits of it. Third, it's a diversification for us. And so it gives us an opportunity to go into a different investor base. So just like we had done over the last 10 years have really diversified our debt base. This gives us an opportunity to diversify our shareholder base. And we believe that that's good for everybody and also allows us to bring in the volume or the quantum of common shares that are out there.","Additionally, when you look at the preferred partnership interest that we've done and the preferred interest, we've done there, that has a very efficient \u2013 those dividend costs are much lower, because they're very tax efficient. So those costs get well below 4%. And once again, they allow us to give recognition to assets that people may not have realized. For example, our tower receivables and over $6 billion worth of real option cash that we have a high likelihood of getting, I don't know that anybody was paying much attention to that. Now it gives us the opportunity to put that spotlight that we really already achieved that value. So \u2013 but the clear science of the preferred is; one, the dividend costs are lower than our common; second, they're stable and our common is going to continue to grow; third, it gets us to another market segment, another investor base which is helpful; and fourth, that allows us to reduce the reliance on the common share base that's out there. For that perspective, we feel very good about. I feel like it's a really \u2013 it's a good move for all of our shareholders.","Michael Viola","Thanks, Dave. Greg, we will take the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins. Please go ahead.","Michael Rollins","Thanks and good morning. If you fast forward to the end of your financial plan in 2022 given the CapEx that you've articulated, can you frame what the network capabilities are going to look like for 5G mobile, fixed wireless broadband coverage, and fiber-to-the-home coverage? And then secondly, can you just unpack a little more of what you see driving the strength in industry wireless postpaid phone net add? And as you look at your own customer trend are you seeing any meaningful differences in customers and markets that have 5G evolution versus those that haven't received it yet? Thanks.","John Stankey","Sure. So, Mike, let me see, if I can hit a combination of things you laid out. So first of all, I think one of the significant shifts you'll see in 2022 by the time we get to that point and a lot of this is being driven by work on FirstNet is I think we'll be in a much better position on macro coverage and not only from a number of square miles, but I think you're going to see the improvement in core interior performance given how we densify things to support our FirstNet subscribers and the agencies we have there. And as I said, this is really \u2013 where last year was a year of us getting coverage \u2013 macro coverage in place kind of getting the umbrella, the footprint turned up this year is where we do a lot of the \u2013 make the network better stuff. So we've been doing all the site acquisition, all the fill-in. And we start turning up sites and just going to make the network better. It's going to make the network better on the inside of a building that's going to make the network better in terms of the square miles that are covered.","And when you add that to the great spectrum position that you're already seeing and the wonderful reviews of speed and performance that we're getting back on test today, that only makes things stronger.","Secondly we are as you know in filling with millimeter wave and we've already turned up over 30 markets with millimeter wave. We're continuing to increase that footprint. And we're going to be very opportunistic of where we can do that. We're in a unique position especially in the places where we offer wireline businesses that we can densify on a fiber infrastructure in a way that's really economic and is advantageous to our cost structure as we move forward.","That millimeter wave fill-in is where you're going to get unique performance characteristics. It will be obviously, probably more pronounced in the urban areas of large cities. Our plan right now is we're not as optimistic as maybe some are on what I would call the fixed wireless replacement construct. We obviously believe there'll be some part of the subscriber base that might decide that they don't need a fixed broadband connection.","I think that's going to take a couple of years to start to emerge when you get the density a little bit more robust, I think as we see more mid-band spectrum coming in place to support the millimeter wave and make the performance a little bit more consistent.","So I wouldn't tell you any of our financial plans and our business plans. We're out there expecting wonderful revenue increases from a push in the fixed wireless space. On what we do in the fixed space, you should expect that we're going to continue to add to the wireless \u2013 excuse me, the fiber footprint.","Right now as we've shared with you our goal is to get a little better return out of what we've deployed because between consumer and business we have about 20 million locations, we can be aggressively working penetration in. And we think that we need to ensure we've got the right business practices and marketing practices to get the return on that footprint that's there.","And as soon as I get indications that the team is actually executing on that well and we have the right formula on it, we'll probably release the ticket on some additional bill. You should expect just by natural growth of the population, you'll probably see somewhere between 350,000 to 0.5 million new fiber locations coming into the portfolio. Right now that is just kind of what I would call the natural growth rate that's going to happen.","If we step that up a little bit, it will be because we feel good about how we're executing on the embedded footprint we have in place. And we know exactly where the next incremental place as we go and build. And I think it's entirely possible that this operating team could build another 1 million to 2 million a year, if we felt like we had the operating momentum to do that.","On the postpaid trends, look there's \u2013 the difference between prepaid and postpaid is changing. It's getting \u2013 they're getting closer together. We've been in a situation where we frankly as we shared with you our prepaid base looks a lot more like a postpaid base in what may be the broader industry prepaid base looks like.","Once we get these folks on prepaid, once we get them on smartphones, we start seeing churn characteristics with multiline accounts that are very similar to what we have in postpaid. And so, I think as the economy has improved as the differences between the two products have gotten a little less as smartphones have worked their way into the prepaid base because of the cycle of maybe previous generation phones being available, we see customers now starting to opt into a postpaid construct.","Does that reverse itself, if we see some economic headwinds and maybe people become a little bit more careful about what they do? That's possible. But the net of it is when you look at whether a customer goes with our prepaid offer or a postpaid offer, we have a lot of similar characteristics between the two. It's \u2013 we can hit them in both places. But we feel very comfortable that we can catch the transition if there's more of a move to postpaid which is what I think is occurring, largely driven by economy and the way the networks are performing and the differences between the two products.","Michael Viola","Thanks Mike. Great. We'll take one more question.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar. Please go ahead.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you. A couple if I could. Firstly, I mean, when you think about the decline rates of video at DIRECTV, although it will moderate over the course of 2020 based on your guidance. If at some point, DIRECTV becomes smaller than say Comcast and because of the video losses and those lines cross, is there any kind of an impact on your programming cost because of the most stable nation clauses and others that you get on account of your scale? And how does that impact margins if it does?","And secondly, when you think about the attach rates for broadband in video homes, could you give us a sense of what that is? And within the base of homes that you've lost as a result of the promotional loss last year, is it in line with the average? Or is it higher or lower? That will help us get a sense of where trends are. Thanks.","John Stankey","So, the short answer to your first question Kannan is, no. We -- first of all, as you're aware, we went through a fairly significant renegotiation cycle over the last 12 months, so those are all baked in the bag through the next three to five years depending on the nature of the particular content and I don't see any exposure in any of those agreements. I would suggest we're not going to continue to pay at the best part of the rate card given the size and the scale of our business as we move forward.","I think frankly, what's more likely to happen in pay TV moving forward is what I talked about earlier, where I think there'll be some pruning and trimming of offers in the market. As folks move forward to manage their cost of goods sold on programming costs, it will be dropping or shifting away from less traffic networks. I think that's going to be a bigger driver of cost structure than renegotiation or anything around that. But we're pretty well baked in that regard.","As you know, one of the things we're working through is, we have a step-up in our content cost as a result of that significant renegotiation work we did last year. We're going to have to work through that in 2020. And then in the subsequent years '21, '22, you'll see us on what I would call more industry traditional step-ups year-over-year in programming costs. But we're in the bag on those things and I think we're in pretty good shape.","On the broadband attach rates, the attach rates in footprint where we offer broadband are extremely high and they haven't changed. We would expect to see a modest step-up as we move away from satellite combined with broadband and get into our software product distributed over broadband. Those sales rates, I think will help us on gross not necessarily a significant change in attach rates. When we are successful selling, we typically attach both.","The reality is, is we want more gross. We don't necessarily want to change the attach rate. We get more gross by the fact that for example in footprint, solid 10% of those subscribers have line of sight related issues on satellite. They won't have that on the software-driven product. That helps us on gross intake and that's one of those things that help us -- helps us as we move through this year change those subscriber trends.","Randall Stephenson","Okay. This is Randall. First of all, I just want to thank everybody for joining us again this morning for the call and your interest in AT&T. We're coming from off of 2019 where we told you exactly what we're going to do. And in terms of debt repayment, operational performance et cetera, capital allocation, we checked every box. We've now given you our playbook for 2020 through 2022. It's a playbook that we feel very confident that we can achieve. We're now gaining momentum in our wireless business, which we feel very good about that. We have a capital allocation plan that we have a high degree of confidence and we'll be able to execute over the next three years. And we have a media business that's performing at a very high level even in an industry that's in transition.","And with HBO Max coming and the investment we're making there, we're confident that it's just another growth vehicle for this business over the next three years. So, bottom line, we have a plan that we think stacks up very nicely. We're confident in our ability to execute. We love the management team and look forward to 2020. Again, thank you for joining us this morning.","John Stephens","Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded.","At this time, we will turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for AT&T, Ms. Susan Johnson. Please go ahead.","Susan Johnson","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. It's great to have you with us today. I am Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer and Ralph de La Vega, AT&T's President and CEO for Mobility. John will cover our consolidated wireline results and Ralph will give us an update on our wireless business and then we will follow-up with questions-and-answers.","Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T website. That's www.att.com\/investor.relations. I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide three of the presentation. This presentation and comments may contain forward-looking statements. They are subject to risks. Results may differ materially. Details are on our SEC filings and on AT&T's website.","With that, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?","John Stephens","Thank you, Susan, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for being with us today. And thank you for your interest in AT&T. Let me start with our consolidated financial summary, which is on slide four.","Consolidated revenue was a solid $32.1 billion, up $500 million or 1.6% on a reported basis and is up an impressive $800 million or 2.6% when you exclude the divested advertising solutions business. We were able to do this with no lift from the economy. These gains were due to solid revenue growth in wireless, strong gains in U-verse services and with improving revenue from our wireline business.","Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.71. That's up almost 8% over last year's second quarter. OUR results this quarter include about $0.04 lift from the sale of some of our Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil shares. You may recall that Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil shares. You may recall that Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil has a share buyback program underway and we were selling shares to maintain our ownership closer to our historic level of about 9%. When you exclude this help earnings per share were $0.67, our adjusted EPS is up about 5% for the year and up nearly 2% in the second quarter.","Consolidated margins were down year-over-year, primarily due to success based initiatives in both, wireless and wireline. Cash flow continues to be strong. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled $9.5 billion, which allowed us to have strong capital investment in Project VIP and still have free cash flow of $4 billion. And in the second quarter, we bought back about 90 million shares or $3.3 billion. And with our strong dividend, we returned more than $5.7 billion to shareholders.","Now let me give you the highlights for the quarter on slide 5. As you can see, we continue to execute at a high level. Our network performance is nothing short of terrific. We have posted impressive metrics across our key growth drivers. And as a result, we have improved momentum heading into the second half of the year. And as I said, we see this across our most important growth areas. That includes about 20% growth in mobile data, strong postpaid net adds and record-setting smartphone sales.","Total U-verse subs reached 9.4 million, while video subs topped 5 million customers for the first time. Total U-verse revenues grew better than 30%, and U-verse now represents more than 50% of consumer revenues. And even with little help from the economy, business wireline showed sequential revenue improvement and strategic business services grew by more than 15%. All this resulted in improved revenue growth, continued EPS gains and strong free cash flow even while investing more in our customers and in our Project VIP.","I now would like to turn the call over to Ralph de la Vega, who is going to update us on all the work going on in wireless. Ralph?","Ralph de la Vega","Thank you, John, and hello everyone. It's great to be with you today. Before we get to the wireless highlights for the quarter, I would like to take a moment to give you a quick update on our 4G LTE wireless network, which is now the nation's fastest and most reliable 4G LTE network. Details are on slide 6.","Our network team has done an incredible job with our LTE deployment. All LTE networks are not built the same. They all don't use the same network architecture, not all have the same network reliability and density and they all don't have the fastest speeds. Our goal was to build the best LTE experience from the very first market we deployed.","You can see by the high praise and recognition our network received that the results speak for themselves. PC Magazine called our 4G LTE network, the nation's fastest. PCWorld say we have the fastest average download and upload speeds of any competitor in its test for the second year in a row. And according to independent third-party data, we now have the most reliable 4G LTE network as well.","We already cover more than 225 million people with our 4G LTE network today and we are on track to reach nearly 270 million pops by year end covering 400 markets, and we continue to move fast with our 4G LTE deployment. We now expect to substantially complete our 4G LTE network by the next summer.","Customers love our LTE experience. We already have more than 35% of our smartphone subscribers on LTE, and that number is accelerating quickly. Thanks to our impressive line of LTE devices. The recognition is great to see, but this network also provides a solid foundation for wireless growth platforms and those details are on slide seven.","Having the nation's fastest, the most reliable network gives us an advantage when it comes to growth and the growth story is very powerful. Smartphone data usage is up 50% year-over-year and more than 70% of those devices are on usage-based plans with most taking larger data plans. This growth plus an increasing number of smartphone subscribers and new data devices being added to the network drives a strong 20% mobile data growth that we are seeing.","We also rolled out our first Digital Life market in the second quarter. We are now up and running in 33 markets and expect to be in 50 by year-end. I already have Digital Life in my home and let me tell you, it's really amazing what it can do. We believe, home security and automation is a large untapped opportunity for us.","An other opportunity is the Connected Car You already know our GM agreement to begin wireless connectivity for all GM vehicles in the U.S. market beginning in 2014. We have also announced an agreement with Sirius\/XM satellite radio to provide mobile connectivity supporting a suite of security and services for Nissan Automobiles in North America and yesterday we announced an agreement with Audiovox to provide network connectivity to Audiovox's telematics and location-based service systems.","You also know of our recent moves in the prepaid space. We recently introduced a new prepaid service and the proposed Leap Wireless deal will accelerate our expansion in this segment. We believe we have the right strategies in place to make a stronger impact in the prepaid segment and think there is a strong growth opportunity there as well.","Finally, last week we announced AT&T Next, a program where customers can get a new smartphone or tablet every year with no down payment, no activation fee, no upgrade fee and no financing fees. This is a great program that provides great value and more choice for our customers. Many customers don't want to wait for the latest and greatest device and with AT&T Next, they don't have to.","Now, let's move on to our second quarter results starting with a look at postpaid net adds on slide eight. Led by solid gains in tablets, we added more than 550,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter and that's a 72% increase from the year ago quarter and our best second-quarter postpaid net add quarter in four years. We added about 400,000 postpaid tablets, which we expect to be the largest gain of any carrier in the second quarter.","In addition, prepaid net add increase as a result of solid GoPhone sales. Total prepaid sales continued to be impacted by the migration of session-based tablets to postpaid plans which is a transition that we are happy to see. Gains in connected devices more than offset losses in the reseller segment where we saw subscriber losses primarily in low revenue accounts. However, reseller revenue increased by almost 30% year-over-year. Postpaid churn was up slightly year-over-year, but down from the first quarter and smartphone churn was even better, less than 1%.","Strong postpaid net adds helped drive solid revenue growth and those details are on slide nine. Revenues continue to be led by data growth. We saw nearly 20% growth in data revenues in the quarter and that helped to drive a 4.1% service revenue growth. Total wireless revenues were up nearly 6%. The growth of smartphones, tablets and other data devices is fueling this data growth. Mobile data is down nearly $22 billion annualized revenue stream for us.","This growth can also be seen in our expanding postpaid ARPUs. Total postpaid ARPU which includes tablets was up nearly 2% in the quarter but phone only ARPPU was up 3%. Our phone only ARPU includes smartphones but also includes our lower ARPU feature phones and wireless home phones as well which makes this growth even more impressive. Postpaid data ARPU grew at nearly 18%.","Smartphone sales were also strong this quarter and those details are on slide 10. A second quarter record 88% of our postpaid phone sales were smartphones. Smartphone subscribers now make up 73% of our postpaid phone base and that's an increase of more than 1.2 million new smartphone subscribers in the quarter. These are the premium subscribers in our business.","They have twice the ARPU of non-smartphone subscribers and much lower churn. We also set another second quarter smartphone sales record of 6.8 million, an excellent performance in a very competitive environment. This helped drive record Android smart smartphone sales, both in total number of phones sold and in the highest percentage of total sales.","Now we did this while also selling more iPhones than we did a year ago. Several promotions and our new low cost trading program helped to fuel these strong sales brining in new customers while also keeping existing ones on two-year contracts and it also increased the number of LTE devices on the network. More than 35% of smartphones now our LTE, the moved to usage-based data plans also continued in the second quarter.","Overall more than 70% of our smartphone base has moved to usage-based plans and data use on the smartphones is growing by about 50% year-over-year, so we have more smartphones on usage-based plans, data growth is strong and growing number of subscribers are taking bigger buckets of data from us. About 80% already take the larger data plans and we are seeing more than a quarter of mobile share accounts on data plans of 10 gigabytes or higher.","And speaking of mobile share, we now about 4.3 million mobile share accounts and those accounts include more than 13 million subscribers on devices such as smartphones and tablets and we continue to see a steady movement of subscribers on limited plans to mobile share. More than 15% of subscribers to-date moved over from unlimited plans, and remember that our customers have a choice. They can keep the plan they have or move to mobile share whatever plan that works best for them.","Strong postpaid net adds, smartphone sales and upgrades impacted margins and those details are on slide 11. Our wireless EBITDA service margin was slightly below our first quarter levels at 42.4%, but we sold 800,000 more smartphones in the second quarter than we did in the first. We made a strong effort to get people into our stores or on our website through promotions that allowed customers to trade in their phones and sign new contracts with us and that strategy worked extremely well.","Upgrades were much stronger than a year ago and the first quarter, and we had a higher percentage of customers on contract at the end of the second quarter than we did at the end of the first quarter. The long-term value they bring is impressive, higher ARPU, lower churn, strong data growth and greater network efficiencies from our new LTE devices.","The trade-in program also gave customers a chance to upgrade their phones before upgrade period moved to 24 months. At the same time, our new AT&T Next program gives customers the best choice if they want a new device every year. So, as you can tell, we were very busy this quarter introducing new programs and delivering a strong second quarter performance and you will continue to see us drive strategies to grow our business as we move throughout the year,","John, those were the highlights in wireless. And with that, I will turn it back to you to discuss wireline results.","John Stephens","Thanks, Ralph. I appreciate it. Now, let's look at our wireline operations starting with consumer, which you can see on slide 12. As I mentioned at the outset, we passed a crucial threshold with U-verse. It now accounts for more than half of all consumer revenues. Two years ago, U-verse was less than a third of consumer. Now it's more than half and growing very fast. That's a remarkable benchmark as we transform our business. We now have 9.4 million total U-verse subscribers. That's more than double the number we had just two years ago. We added more than 640,000 U-verse high-speed broadband subs in the quarter and 233,000 new U-verse T.V. subscribers, topping 5 million video subscribers for the very first time.","U-verse broadband now makes up more than 50% of our total broadband base with total broadband ARPU growing at more than 9% year-over-year. These gains helped drive overall consumer revenue growth of 2.4%, with total U-verse revenues up nearly 30% in the quarter. U-verse is now a nearly $12 billion annualized revenue stream. Not bad for a business that was just started seven years ago and it also shows clearly that we know how to build and scale new businesses as we move forward with Project VIP.","Now let's move to wireline business, which you can see on slide 13. The economy continues to be challenging, and it's not providing any assistance to our efforts here. But on the bright side, we do see some signs of improvement from the first quarter. Business revenue was down 2.2% year-over-year, but increased sequentially with both enterprise and small business showing sequential revenue growth.","Small business also showed growing customer momentum with U-verse broadband net adds. Part of the business continue to do very well. Growth continued to be strong in strategic business services. That's products such as VPN, Ethernet, hosting and other advanced IP services which were up more than 15% in the quarter. These services represent more than $8 billion annualized revenue stream and are approaching 25% of total business wireline revenues.","We continue to do well with wireless in the business space. We had our best ever wireless business adds in the quarter. More and more businesses want solutions that include wireless. For example, earlier today we announced an agreement with Disney Parks that makes AT&T, the official wireless provider for Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort.","We have talked often about the transformation of wireline from legacy products to advanced IP services but we are also seeing businesses transform to mobility. AT&T is well positioned to deliver these types of solutions to the business market. Our full ownership of our global IP network and our leading 4G LTE wireless network are a powerful combination when it comes to meeting business customers' needs.","Before we get to cash flow, let me give you a quick update on some of our Project VIP initiatives. Details are on slide 14. Ralph told you about the incredible progress, both quality and coverage that we are making in wireless, but we are also breaking ground on several wireline projects as well. Our network upgrades are on track and we expect to boost top U-verse speeds up to 45 megs per second in the next few months. We are moving towards speeds of 75 megs and 100 megs in the near future.","We have increased our U-verse video consumer locations by about 500,000 year-to-date. Those locations also include U-verse broadband. We have also added 1.3 million U-verse broadband only customer locations so far this year. When you add those together that's nearly 2 million new U-verse broadband locations to serve customers. This gives us more than 50 million U-verse broadband customer locations across our wireline footprint. We are on track to hit our goal of reaching approximately 75% of our customer locations within our wireline footprint with wired high-speed broadband by the end of 2015.","Our fiber builds to multitenant buildings is also underway. We expect to reach approximately 250,000 of our 1 million customer locations targets by the end of 2013, or just six months into our plan. But as you can see, we are making progress and we are very excited about the growth potential of Project VIP brings to AT&T.","Even with our progress on Project VIP plus success based initiatives, margins continue to be solid. Details are on slide 15. For the second quarter our consolidated operating margin was 19.1%, an increase from the first quarter but down year-over-year due largely to stronger actually record smartphone sales and higher costs associated with U-verse adds.","Wireline margins saw pressure from success based initiatives in consumer and Project VIP investment costs. Wireline pressure was partially offset by growth in consumer revenues, operational improvements in the network, sales and support functions and solid execution of cost initiatives. As Project VIP moves ahead, we will continue to look for more opportunity to reduce expenses.","Now, let us move to cash flow which continues to be a solid story for us even as we increase investment in our Project VIP. Our summary is on slide 16. In the first-ever year, cash from operations totaled $17.7 billion, which is up from last year's level. Capital expenditures were $9.8 billion as Project VIP investing starts to ramp and free cash flow before dividends was $7.9 billion.","In terms of uses of cash, net debt was stable in the second quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 46.6% and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.6%, well below our guidance of net debt in the 1.8 range and actually slightly lower than our ratio of 1.68 in the first quarter.","We are [a second] 300 million share repurchase authorization and began buying shares back from the third authorization. However, the pace of buybacks slowed when compared to recent quarters. We repurchased about 89 million shares for $3.3 billion. With our dividend, this makes our total return to shareholders in the second quarter almost $6 billion. Even with our progress on Project VIP, plus success based initiatives, margins continue to be solid.","During the quarter, we also took several steps to strengthen our balance sheet. We continue working with the Department of Labor on our plan that would contribute to preferred equity interest in AT&T mobility to fund our pension plan. We are optimistic on the strategy and expect approval of this proposal later this year.","During the quarter, we monetized some of our shares of Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil soft while keeping our ownership levels roughly the same, about 9%. We continue to keep our focus on a strong financial foundation, our balance sheet is sound, our debt metrics are solid, our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives and make strategic investments such as Leap Wireless while returning substantial value to shareholders through our strong dividend.","Before we take questions, let me close with a quick recap of the quarter on slide 17. The second quarter was a story of growing revenues and growing momentum. Our revenue gains were strong, our cash flows were solid and we continue to grow EPS. The mobile internet drove strong wireless results, including strong mobile data revenue growth, growing postpaid ARPUs and our best second quarter postpaid growth in three years, plus our 4G LTE network has been winning praise and recognition for being the nation's fastest and most reliable.","During the quarter, U-verse hit an important milestone when it exceeded more than half of consumer revenues. And with project VIP, we feel the best is yet to come. Our strong execution this quarter puts us on track to meet our full-year guidance, including revenue growth, EPS, free cash flow and margins, so a solid quarter with strong momentum heading into the back half of the year.","With that, Susan, let's go ahead and take some questions.","Susan Johnson","Thank you, John. Tony, we will turn it back over to you to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) Your first question in queue will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Ralph, I guess, if we could start with start with the net add number, can you just help us break it down a little bit 500 and something thousand, nearly 400,000 tablets. If you take out the on home phone sort of fixed devices and Digital Life, was there growth in mobile voice postpaid? Thanks.","Ralph de la Vega","Phil, thanks for the question. We had a really strong quarter in all aspects. And in fact, we ended up in June with significant gains in the smartphone only growth, not just wireless phones, so we feel this is one of the best quarters we could have turn in especially considering the fact that one of our competitors got the iPhone in the same quarter to churn in the performance that we did.","When you consider all the factors it was a remarkable accomplishments and we are very pleased with the overall phone growth, not just on smartphones but feature phones and wireless home phones and we have shown in the ARPUs that we have given you the fact that that even when you include all of those feature phones and wireless home phones, the ARPU is up in every nice way and the good thing about wireless home phones by the way is that soon there will be wireless homes phones and internet access.","In the next few days, you will see us announce that we will be adding data capability which will add substantial ARPU to wireless home phones and we think that's going to drive significant ARPU growth to the phone only category in the future.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Okay, and then known, I guess, a second if I may, can you just help us a little bit on Digital Life. Just sort of round numbers for that. Was that single digit, double-digit, thousands in the quarter and how should we expect that to ramp through the rest of the year?","Ralph de La Vega","No, we are not providing that detailed information yet, Phil, but I can tell you that the early responses by customers has been very positive. The ARPU is higher than we had planned. They are adding a lot of video cameras to the services. With every video camera there is an additional charge. Customers love the product and net promoter scores are one of the highest that we have ever seen for any product that we have launched.","We announced recently that we added six new markets. That brings the total to 33, going to 50 by year-end. The platform is brand-new but its stable. It is taking all the load that we can give it. So, right now, we are cracking up the sales as we turn up market-by-market. I am very confident that our company-owned retail employees are going to do a bang-up job selling this product. So far what we have seen is a very nice lift and we are going to continue to increase our advertising spend to promote the product and continue to see it, I think, executed very well in the company-owned retail stores.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Mike McCormack with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack - Nomura Securities","Ralph, or John maybe. Just some thoughts what's your tolerances for wireless margin pain? We have seen a lot of announcements from competitors recently. I am just trying to get a sense because if you look at the current guidance, you guys are talking of wireless margin expansion for the full year. Year-to-date, it stands at about 110 basis points. Maybe the change in upgrade policy could help the fourth quarter but just trying to think towards the back half of the year. How do you still thinking about the puts and takes? Thanks.","Ralph de La Vega","Thanks, Mike. Let me give it a shot and ask Ralph to join in. I will only give you a couple of push points here, reference points to start with. First of all, the change of the upgrade policy will certainly help in the second half of the year. Second, if you will AT&T Next, our new offering for our customers upgrade every year will also help. Third, its something we need to point out is that, as Ralph mentioned, our phone ARPU grew 3% this quarter. Actually more than 3%. We actually converted, we had actually 1.2 million smartphones this quarter.","Many of those conversions from feature phones which bring higher ARPUs. So we have got a lot of revenue momentum going on in the business. When you add that to the growth we are getting out of Digital Life, Connecting Cars and other things like that, one other thing that I will tell you, it is really strong and Ralph mentioned in his remarks, data usage is growing on a per device basis. Over 50%.","So as data usage goes up, we are seeing customers buy bigger buckets. Big tiers of data. So all of those things added together give us comfort that we will be able to meet the guidance we gave in January. I think those are the points, if you will, Mike, to look through this to say, how do we get from where we are at to where we expect to be by the end of the year.","John Stephens","Mike, there is one other point that I wanted to add because I think it is important to understand and I mentioned the advances that we have made with our LTE network deployment. What we are finding out is that the more we deploy LTE, the lower it costs us to produce a megabyte of data. So the cost structure in the future is something that I think as we produce more data it will be cheaper to produce it. We have over 90% of our backbone now being enhanced backbone, which means we typically have Ethernet to cell site.","So its Fiber Ethernet to the cell site with LTE with the radio head on the top of the tower. It's a very, very good architecture. When we executed like we are executing and it had the tendency to make it more efficient in terms of how you run the network up to 50% more efficient on the spectral efficiency as well, and so we feel really good about the infrastructure cost.","In addition to that, you have heard us mention that we started the process of turning down the subscribers onto our 2G network in order that we can turn off that network completely by one 117, and so a lot of work going on in the infrastructure, some of it being short-term, but also long-term as we turn down our 2G network that will be another source of margin improvement.","Mike McCormack - Nomura Securities","John, so you mentioned briefly regarding the third quarter initiative to increase U-verse broadband speeds. Is that something you are seeing? I mean, we are hearing a lot about Wi-Fi household in the home are you seeing and the huge explosion of usage in the home right now to drive sort of a need to accelerate that program?","John Stephens","The plan to implement that was really part of Project VIP and really was just to give a higher quality continuing to group quality of service to our customers. We are seeing continued demand for our U-verse product. And, as we mentioned, the 640,000 sales in what has traditionally been very slow quarter for us, seasonally slow quarter and we are over 1.3 million broadband U-verse net adds for the year, so we are continuing to see the demand. It just gets in with that program and with the overall project VIP strategy.","Mike McCormack - Nomura Securities","Okay. Makes sense. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik - UBS","Okay. Thanks. Two questions. First for John. The 1.67 leverage ratio, plus the Leap, you are getting up close to that 1.8 times target. Could you talk about whether that's setting store or if that could potentially change going forward. Then maybe update us on the possibilities for asset sales going forward and then I got a question for Ralph.","John Stephens","Sure. We are not changing our guidance. We feel really comfortable with the net debt to EBITDA and the 1.8 range and we are sticking with that. We believe that the cash flows we are generated from the business are going to be able to allow us to successfully manage to that, so we feel good about that.","I won't comment on any particular or specific asset sales, but I will tell you we do have a great collection of assets with the company, and we think it's our responsibility to manage those assets and manage the balance sheet. We believe that that management includes putting focus on working capital which we have done, lower our borrowing costs which we have done and monetizing assets as appropriate when we can do that.","I think you saw us do that in the second quarter with the cash proceeds we received for Yellow Pages and from Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil shares. And in both cases, we effectively retain the same ownership we had before, we generated that cash. So, we are going to continue that focus. But with that and with the balance sheet that we have and cash flows we have, we feel real good about sticking with our net debt to EBITDA in the 1.8 range.","John Hodulik - UBS","And then, Ralph, if you could talk a little bit about the Leap transaction, maybe the main drivers behind the transaction. And then if you could clarify the sort of prepaid strategy. It looks like you have two brands going forward. How aggressive should we expect you to be in that market and what the go-forward strategy is there?","Ralph de la Vega","John, the rationale behind the Leap transaction is basically to accelerate our entry into the prepaid segment much more so than we would have been able to do by ourselves. We plan to keep that Cricket brand and the distribution and I think that will ignite our growth into all aspects of the prepaid segment that I think has some really nice growth opportunities for us. So, that is our strategy. We will keep the prepaid brand at Leap brands with Cricket. I think it's a good brand and will leverage our distribution and that will fuel our entry in nationwide prepaid offerings.","John Stephens","John, I will tell you, let me add to it. What Ralph says is that I think what you will see is we are going to bring more competition and we are going to bring more choices to customers. And, the combination of Leap and our resources will bring an acceleration and a further deployment of that offering into that segment than either one of us could have done on the standalone basis. So I think this will be very good for the competition in the prepaid segment and we are really excited about the opportunity it provides us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","A couple of questions. Ralph, the first, the 50% usage per smartphone device, it's pretty impressive. Can you decompose that into the change from people going to 3G, to 4G? Is that a big part of the growth? Then what kind, the 3G-on-3G, or the 4G-on-4G growth is?","Then, as you see more Androids in the mix, are you seeing a lower per device subsidy cost or a lower purchasing price for AT&T either now or is there some hope that you will be able to either subsidies or device purchase prices down going forward and lowering your equipment subsidy? Thanks.","Ralph de La Vega","Yes, Simon, I was really pleased to see the Android sales and they do carry a lower subsidy than some of the other phones we carry. We are seeing some nice opportunities as well coming up in the Windows Phone line with the Lumia 1020. That's a great device that, I think, is going to help to drive lot sales of Windows Phone. So we are really, really pleased with the diversity of the portfolio. That's increasingly more diverse up almost every quarter that goes by.","Now the thing about the usage, I think this is really a great highlight and I want to make sure everybody gets what we are seeing when we move customers from HSPA network to LTE, we see a significant increase in the usage of data. We also see them buy larger buckets of data. So more usage, buying bigger buckets and guess what, the net promoter scores on our LTE network are much higher.","So happy customers are buying more of our product and are buying in bigger quantities. I think that is what I see driving it and we are just getting started. What I love about the LTE network that we have built is it's getting great service but at the same time that that network is performing as good as any network, I think, on the planet right now, the more customers and usage that we move to the LTE network the better the HPA network performs.","So as a result, we are waiting in market after market where we deploy LTE. We are winning not just the fastest and most reliable 4G LTE network, we are winning on voice reliability, text reliability and better reliability. So I feel really good that we have prospects to continue to grow usage and to get customers to buy bigger buckets in the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","David Barden - Bank of America","So two questions, if I could. Just the first one, strategic services had one of the strongest quarters it had in a really long time. I think you guys added maybe annualized $500 million of revenues this quarter in that segment. Could you talk about some of the drivers and whether those are going to continue and whether we can look for that growth out of that segment for the rest of the year?","Then, the second question would be, obviously you have talked a little bit already on the call about the changing nature of competition as we look in the back half of the year. Verizon, for its part, is suggesting that they think they can not just keep share but take share as the increase postpaid subscribers in the second half of the year. Obviously Sprint and T-Mobile have their ambitions. Could you kind out map out what is AT&T's position on balancing market share margin? What should we be expecting from AT&T as an objective function for the business? You don't have to tell us the strategy but what do mean managing this business to in the second half of the year would be helpful. Thanks.","John Stephens","That is great, thanks. Let me take a shot at it and I will ask Ralph to join in. First and foremost on strategic services. We are just saying that there is an acceptance across business for VPN, Ethernet, hosting and those high quality IP services. We are specifically seeing an improvement in our small business high-speed broadband.","I think we have noted in our presentations there were 81,000. That's a quarterly record for us in our small business customers. So even in a difficult economic situation and a challenged economic segment, we are seeing customers willing to upgrade to higher quality speeds.","With that, we also have a focus from our sales team and our sales effort on strategic services. They are really performing well and last year, I will tell you that with Project VIP, we are really now beginning to address the opportunities buildings which we are now taking fiber to and selling into those customer locations as we start the build process and we start making progress.","So its all of those things, David, but in summary, it's a real focus and it's an acceptance by customers of the value of those strategic services, even in some of the challenged spaces of the business segment.","Specifically with regard to wireless, as we have shown this quarter, we are going to compete. We are generating good margins. We going to improve those margins in the second half of this year. But we are going to be able to compete. I will give you one just simple point. In this quarter where a new competitor got the iPhone on a sequential basis, our churn is down. So I think we need to put it in that focus","So, I think we need to put it in that focus, our churn is down even in this quarter where a new competitor comes in. And even with all the new offerings that we are putting forward, so we will be ready to compete, we are going to be smart about it, we are going to be customers-focused about it and quite frankly we believe that our network superiority is going to lead us to be able to perform very well in the second half of the year and quite frankly for years to come.","Ralph de la Vega","Dave, I would like to add a couple of views here. First, let me speak about the postpaid segment. I don't think we have ever been better positioned in the postpaid segment than we are today and that's basically driven by the network performance that is the best than has ever been, winning awards right and left, just providing outstanding performance and as the LTE networks gets all those awards, as we move customers there, the HSPA network gets better. So, from a network perspective, which is a key driver of churn, I don't think we have ever been better positioned.","Our network team has done a great job and you can see dramatic improvements in drop calls and it's just a great, great story. In addition to that, we continue to find ways to differentiate on devices. We just are about to rollout the Nokia Lumia 1020, which I think is an exceptional device. We also launched earlier this year, the Samsung Active, which we call Whatever-Proof pone, and so great network, great devices and great service differentiates us at the postpaid segment.","In the prepaid segment, I mentioned that our GoPhone sales were on the rise and that as a result of an upgrade in the platform that now finally allowances to sell LTE devices on the GoPhone platform and those sales are doing very well as we populate the GoPhone family with state-of-the-art devices that prior to this we couldn't turn on GoPhone platform.","So, GoPhone sales were doing very well, our prepaid services that we recently launched is doing well and now with Leap and the Leap acquisition, I don't think we have ever been better positioned on the prepaid segment, so I like our position positioning for the second half of this year better than almost any second that I have faced in recent history.","In addition to all of this, as we move our data growth into LTE, it's improving our cost structure and we feel good about that. So I think as you look at, we are really in the best shape that we have been heading into a second half that I have seen for a while.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs","A Couple of questions. Maybe first on handset trade-ins which are obviously said to be a little bit bigger part of the model going forward. I think, John, you talked about Next helping wireless margins. Maybe if you can offer some more context around it? Maybe a framework for volumes you would expect here and what you can make on a resale or refurbed device from a margin perspective?","Then second question, Verizon, I think talked about promotions at third party distribution channels negatively impacting wireless margins in the quarter. I am just wondering if you saw something similar to this that you would call out? Thanks.","John Stephens","Well let me try the Next question and I ask Ralph to join in. The way I view it is simply this. In the marketplace for the last few years there have been high quality used phones that neither the customer nor the provider, the transport provider have taken advantage of their value. So when someone comes in for a new phone they often ignored and maybe head it out, but they don't necessarily capture the value.","What Next allows the customer to do is by bringing that phone and a high quality phone that still has some value, giving it to us, it lowers their cost to getting a new phone every 12 months. So they get value for it and then we have a network of capabilities whether using our refurbishing and our insurance business, whether we resell to a wholesaler or whether we resell it in our stores.","So we are able to capture that value. Up to this program, it hasn't been a captured value, and as you all know, those phones, many of the phones could have a $200 or $250 value. That's what makes this project work. That makes this offer work for both the customers and for us.","Ralph de la Vega","Jason, there was a news once that we did that really drove the volume of trade-ins something like 500% to 600% compared to the prior period. The key was for customers to realize that they didn't have to worry about what they were going to get for the handset. If they brought us a handset that was within three years old and good working condition then we would give him a $100 off. All of a sudden they didn't have to worry about going in checking what it was worth. We would guarantee them that price.","We actually took the risk in what the value of that trading would be. As it turns out, when they actually start to trading them in, the value of the phone that they were trading in was much higher than what we had anticipated we were going to get. So it was good for the customer. It assured them that they could had a get a certain amount for it and for us, it turned out to be a good strategy.","In addition to that, Jason, when we lead out our AT&T Next program, we knew that in order for that program to work well, we had have to have a very good trade-in program. So the trade-in program preceded AT&T Next and appropriately so, so we can get customers educated on the value of the trade-in, so we could get our reps to process it and now it's part of the AT&T Next program and I think it's going to hit with all cylinders firing as we have really educated the customers and our reps on how to process and do trade-ins.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs","Great, and then the third-party?","Ralph de la Vega","I am sorry. On the third-party distribution, yes, we did see some upgrade activity through our third party distribution that's usually a little bit more expensive. But I would say that that wasn't the big driver for us. It was essentially the volume of upgrades that were done in the quarter that drove the pressure and the margins that you saw.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays","Ralph, I just wanted to follow-up on some of the discussions around your recent promotion plans. While I recognize it's still early stages, how successful have these plans been in helping to manage equipment cost and ultimately fuel your belief in hitting your margin expansion target for the back half of the year? I am thinking about the extension of the upgrade cycle here. I guess we are just trying to understand the different drivers here given your comfort and sort of your guidance.","Ralph de la Vega","Well, before we introduced AT&T Next, we did a lot of customer research and there was overwhelming support for program just like the one that we have launched. We actually launched the program early in a couple of markets and their response has been good.","We are feeling real positive about the impact that this could have both, on customers and our financials, so we are full speed ahead, but I think the key with the program as we heard from customers is they essentially wanted to upgrade their phones in a yearly cycle, which is typically when they get refreshed and they wanted to do it with minimal outlay. And the fact that we can do that now for our zero down, no upgrade, no activation fees and no finance fees, means that you can actually walk out the door with a Lumia 1020 device with a 41 megapixel camera the best of the best in camera technology with zero money down and a very reasonable payment.","So, I think that is what gets me excited knowing that we can put that kind of technology in the hands of people and that they will enjoy it, but part of the process there was to get a trade-in program that was workable and we have done that already as a result of the promotions that we have launched. And by the way, because of our large base of iPhones, we stand to gain the most, because the value of those smartphones is the highest.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays","That's very helpful. Thank you. Then John, just had a question on your capital deployment strategy. You mentioned that your plan is to be opportunistic on your buying back going forward. Clearly, you are focused on finishing the Leap deal. Where can we see other areas of capital deployment in sort of near-to-midterm, perhaps I guess the way to look at it is, what are your strategic priorities for capital deployment here?","John Stephens","Clearly, our strategic priorities, two things in the short-term here is finishing off our Project VIP for us this year, which includes our LTE and additionally U-verse and fiber to building built all those aspects of VIP. Then secondly being prepared to close the deals we have in place before the SEC with regard to some of the spectrum deals, whether it'd be tuck-in or whether it'd be spectrum deals. Then third to be have all of that done where we still can very easily which is something we are very confident we can accomplish close the Leap deal whenever that becomes available, so those are our priorities, if you will.","I have said this before and I will say on this call. Our dividend is clearly a sacred matter for us, we clearly understand as managers of AT&T, the importance of our dividends to our shareholders. That's never a question, and so what we do after we have taken those responsibilities satisfying those responsibilities, but those are the order of things. And, with our strong cash flows, we will continue to have opportunities to buy back shares. We will just be opportunistic as we go through that.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays","Great. Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","Thanks, guys. I have two questions. Well, first, John, it seems like the underlying strength in the quarter was really somewhat driven by the improvements in the networks both, wireless and here on wireline.","Would you maybe think about accelerating velocity or extending out a little further to maybe upgrade the networks a little bit more given what we are seeing is really great in the quarter in terms of acceleration growth and volumes? And then a follow-up for Ralph.","John Stephens","Sure. Tim, I agree with you. The performance by network team in both, wireless and wireline has been exceptional and finding good quality service to our customers is always key to success. With that being said, we are in a position from our balance sheet to fund things on an opportunistic basis and as we can get them done efficiently. I think that's what you saw in the second quarter with our CapEx stepping up to near $5.5 billion range, but $900 million higher than last year and higher than the first quarter. We spent that money at this time, because the network team could get more done and efficiently get it done and so we want to make sure we fund that and we will stick to that philosophy.","With that being said, I still believe we are going to be in the $21 million dollar range for our CapEx for this year. I think the network team has continued to outperform all aspects of their LTE build. We had originally targeted 150 million for last year we finished near 175 million. I think Ralph mentioned today that were 225. So I feel very comfortable that we going to be near 270 by the end of this year.","We are expecting to substantially complete the whole build by the middle of next year. So we are doing exactly what you are suggesting in the wireless space. In the wireline space, we are going through the same process. So we are not afraid to go faster. We are just going to do it prudently and we are going to do it efficiently. So let me ask for your next question for Ralph.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Ralph, just only two small ones. Have you seen a slowdown at all in the iPhone impact that T-Mobile has had on you? It usually lasts about a quarter or so? When do you expect that to hit? And then secondly, I guess on wireless data, are customers starting to bump up against our caps in a way that with the pricing lead to maybe some elasticity? Are you worried about that at all or seeing that at all? Thanks.","Ralph de la Vega","Okay. First, on the iPhone impact. We have seen what, in terms of T-Mobile and then getting the iPhone, the same impact that we saw when Sprint got the iPhone and when Verizon got the iPhone. There is usually a spike in the timeframe that they get the iPhone. Then it comes back down. Quite frankly, the spike that we have seen from the T Mobile getting the iPhone is significantly less than the spike that we saw with Sprint and the spikes that we saw with Verizon. My expectation is that they will continue to come down overtime. So that's kind of where we stand today.","In terms of wireless data and people hitting the caps or bumping against them. We are not seeing a lot of that. What we are seeing, which is part of our strategy all along, Tim, is we know that there is an explosion going on with tablets. Our firm believe, all the time, was we needed to get mobile share out in the market place, so customers could easily add a tablet and at the time they add the tablet, then the increase to size of the data bucket. That's exactly what is happening.","So as customers add tablets, they are being smart enough to add or to increase the size of the data bucket and so we are not seeing anything at this point that gets me concerned, especially from a customer satisfaction point of view in terms of usage. Customers are being smart. They can monitor their usage now more than ever before. They are being cautious to make sure they don't have overages.","So I really think that this is huge for us and that's why you saw the emphasis that we have on getting tablets. Those tablets are getting added to the network. Data use is just going up. The size of data buckets is on the rise as well.","John Stephens","As Ralph had mentioned, 80% of the customers we have on tiered data programs, 80% of them are picking the higher tiered buckets of data. So they are buying up and we are pleased with our mobile share where over 25% are buying the 10 gig bucket. So it is working out just as Ralph mentioned where these customers are buying those bigger buckets and generating that revenue which is generating our service revenue growth and it continues to have great ARPU growth on our phones.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research","Just a couple of clarifications, and then maybe one higher level question. First, is it possible to break out the dilution that you are seeing from VIP from an operating perspective, both for the second quarter and for the full year '13? The second clarification is, last quarter you talked a lot about the impact of U.S. debt on the revenue. I was wondering if you can give us an update. Was that also a headwind in the quarter or was there any help from the U.S. debt? Just maybe directionally how that changed from the first quarter to the second quarter? Thank you.","John Stephens","Yes, Mike, this is John. Let me take the second question first and that is, the out of balance situation with U.S. separate those rates being different from last year to this year. The same situation occurred in the second quarter at about the same level or about the same amounts in the same relationship as it did in the first quarter. So our numbers that we reported to you are overcoming in that pressure, both on the wireless side and the wireless ARPUs and also in the wireline side for both, business and consumer. So, there is no change in that situation. We have overcome and these numbers that have been reported.","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research","Then on VIP?","John Stephens","On the breakout, we don't do that, Mike, but let me say it to you this way. If you look at our CapEx spend on a year-over-year basis for the quarter and on the sequential basis for the quarter, it's about $900 million in both cases increased. We don't give a trailing expense impact on our capital, but I will tell you that even our construction project have some level of trailing expense. Then quite frankly, our software projects have a much higher level of trailing expense.","The pressure for the quarter really relates to what I would view it is that $900 million increase times whatever percentage you would apply to it. I would suggest you that numbers could vary in anywhere from 10% to 20% to 25%. We are not going to get into what ours are specifically, but I don't think in the industry those kinds of percentages will be unusual. I will leave it to you guys to determine your own.","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research","Then just one higher level question on the wireline business and also the sort of prior to the enterprise business, so you have talked about in the second quarter that you stepped over that line where you had sequential growth, albeit, still down year-over-year. And I feel like, if you go back historically, we have crossed that line into positive sequential before, but we have been brought back to that negative territory for a variety of factors from time-to-time, whether it was USF, whether it was the legacy parts of the business.","In addition to your comments on the strategic services, are there aspects of what you are seeing in the legacy or other aspects of your portfolio that make you believe that the step over to positive sequential growth could be more sustainable on a one or two year basis?","John Stephens","Yes. Let me give you two different perspectives on that. One on our consumer business, that now greater than 50% U-verse, that was growing nearly on the consumer U-verse pace nearly just below 30%. I think the math will show you that when you have got now more than half of the business growing somewhere between 25% and 30%, is a more sustainable situation than it was a year ago or two years ago when that was percentage of the business 40% or maybe a third, so the math is different with regard to consumer, because that base is so much bigger and so much bigger piece.","On the business side, I agree with you. The economy has given us challenges. We are pleased that we have gotten our strategic business services up to nearly 25% of our business revenues, but the economy is still uncertain. Such that we are not in that same point and that is why we mentioned that we were slightly positive on a sequential basis and we will have to see how this plays out the rest of the year.","The one encouraging piece there is what we mentioned in small business and how well our team has done in beginning to put U-verse or high speed broadband into our small business space and the 80,000 high speed broadband net adds they had this quarter and we are optimistic about what we can do with that going forward. Particularly, when you look at our trend that's a highest quarter we have had on record and significantly better than the first quarter or the fourth quarter of last year.","Susan Johnson","Tony, I think we have got time for just one more quick question.","Operator","Thank you. And that question will come from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research","Thanks very much. Two quick questions if I may. First of all, you may have mentioned this earlier, but I didn't hear it, give us a number of iPhone sales in the quarter? Secondly.","John Stephens","Jonathan, I would just say no we are not disclosing that number, but I think we disclosed the total number in our slide presentation. Our smartphone sales of 6.8 million and I think we have disclosed that we had a record Android sales, but we are not giving the specific iPhone number.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research","Got it. Okay. Then could you give us a little bit more detail, John, just around the synergies that you expect from the Leap deal and how quickly you expect to be able to realize those?","John Stephens","Well, let me say this. We will get into synergies and realizations and all of the normal impacts that we discuss as we get the deal closed. So we are not going to be in the position to talk about those now. We are confident. We are expecting that the transaction is going to get closed after the government carries out its responsibilities and there is a fair review.","I will tell you, we are looking forward to getting this done. We believe that Leap is going to provide us the opportunity to expand services to customers and a segment of the mobility market that is now under served. So we are excited about it. We believe it's going to be a positive but we are going to wait and let the DoJ and the SEC go through their normal review process.","Ralph de la Vega","Thank you. Let me close down. I want to thank you for being with us this afternoon. We have delivered a solid quarter with strong subscriber gains, growing revenues and improving networks. At this time we are going to continue to invest in our business with our Project VIP and we believe it is on pace to provide us even more opportunity going forward.","With that being said, we think this gives us a strong momentum as we head into the second half of this year and into the years to come. So we are very excited about where we are at in our business. We believe our plans are playing out well and we look forward to talking to you in the future.","Thank you very much for being on the call and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T.

Instructions will be given at that time.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Okay, thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. Like Justin said, this is Mike Viola. I'm Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John's going to cover our results and provide business updates, which will include progress on FirstNet, and then we'll follow that up with a Q&A session.","As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That includes our news release, investor briefing, 8-K and a variety of associated schedules. Before we begin, I want to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. That says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties, and those results may differ materially. And additional information is always available on the Investor Relations website.","Also, I want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC CAF-II auction and so we can't address any questions about that today. And so now, I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, and thanks for joining us on the call today. Let me begin with our financial summary, which is on slide 3.","As we mentioned last quarter and noted it in 8-K filed last month, AT&T was required to adopt several new accounting standards this year. These new accounting standards deal with reporting issues around revenue recognition, pension costs, financial instruments, and cash receipts on installment receivables. These changes have some impact on our income statements and our cash flows.","And in connection with adopting the new standard on revenue recognition, the company will now record Universal Service and other regulatory fees on a net basis, consistent with how we have traditionally reported other pass-through items like sales taxes. This specific change will reduce both revenues and expenses by a little more than $900 million this quarter, but will not \u2013 they will not impact operating income or net income for the quarter.","In addition to GAAP, we're providing comparable historical results to help you better understand the impact on financials from revenue recognition. We will be referring to these historical results in our comparisons during this call.","Tax reform gave us the opportunity to invest and grow our customer base. These investments drove a significant year-over-year improvement in postpaid phone net adds, the second-highest broadband quarter in 3 years and solid growth in video, as we transition our TV business.","Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.85, up about $0.15 with benefits from tax reform and revenue recognition, offsetting the costs of investing in our growing customer base and a small amount of pressure from the new financial instrument reporting rules.","Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the quarter were up year over year on a reported basis, but down on a comparable basis. Our increased sales activities this quarter drove much of the pressure we saw, as did continued transition of video from linear to over-the-top services. But at the same time, we did see margin improvements in business wireline and international.","Next, let's cover revenue, which was $38.9 billion, down from a year ago. Higher wireless equipment and strategic service revenues partially offset declines in legacy services, the ongoing impact of the video transition and our decision to no longer pursue some low-margin businesses. Cash flow statements have been recast to show the impact of the new accounting standard with installment receivables, so year-over-year cash flow results are comparable.","The first quarter is traditionally our lowest free cash flow quarter and this year is no different. Several items impacted free cash flow, including our annual employee bonus program, a larger than usual handset payment from the very strong gross add and upgrade performance during the light holiday season in the fourth quarter and continuing into the first quarter.","We also had unreimbursed FirstNet expenditures in this quarter. Offsetting some of this pressure was a tax refund we received in the first quarter, which was generated by the passage of the tax reform act in late December of last year.","We're still on plans to meet the free cash flow guidance we gave you in January. That guidance of free cash flow in the $21 billion range included the pressure from the receivables accounting change. Capital spending was $6.1 billion in the quarter.","Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with Mobility, where the team turned in solid customer growth. Those details are on slide 4. AT&T's domestic Mobility operations, as you know, are divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, we're providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations.","Strong sales activity in a usually quiet quarter helped drive a turnaround in postpaid phone net adds. Postpaid phone net adds showed a more than 300,000 phone improvement compared to the year ago first quarter, which is now more than 700,000 year-over-year improvement in the last two quarters.","Prepaid phones also came in strong, with about 190,000 new subscribers, and that's helped our Cricket customer base grow. And today, its total is 9 million customers. Congrats to our management team that runs Cricket. And we increased our branded smartphone base by nearly 500,000, topping 73 million by the end of the quarter.","Churn keeps improving. We had another record low first quarter postpaid phone churn of 0.84%, improving both year over year and sequentially. Altogether, we had more than 2.6 million new subscribers, that's domestic subscribers, with gains in postpaid, prepaid and connected devices, more than offsetting our continued losses in resellers.","Revenues were up more than 3% in the quarter, thanks to our strong smartphone sales, while service revenues were essentially flat sequentially. We're confident that service revenues will improve throughout the year and still expect that we'll be positive for the full year on a comparable basis. There are several reasons for that.","First, we're now through the toughest year-over-year compare as we lap the introduction of unlimited plans that came out in the first quarter a year ago. We're adding postpaid, prepaid and connected devices, subscribers at rapid rates, and the pressure from reseller is stabilizing. Recent new product offerings will also help. Our strong sales activity also had an impact on margins. Postpaid smartphone gross adds and upgrades increased by about 500,000 year over year.","That's an upgrade rate of 4. 3%, which was higher than last year, still service margins came in at 48.1% on a comparable basis. Our long-term strategy to build our branded phone base and improve churn with bundled services continues to pay off. Postpaid smartphones have increased by almost 2 million in the last two years. Prepaid smartphones have also increased at a solid clip, growing by 3.4 million in the same timeframe. That's more than five million growth in overall domestic smartphone base.","At the same time, a growing number of our existing Mobility customers are bundling their wireless with our video and our broadband services. These are the most valuable customers with churn significantly lower than single-service customers. These results are very encouraging and gives us the confidence to continue to carefully invest in our customer base.","Now let's take a look at our Entertainment Group results on slide 5. The positive impact of TV and broadband promotions and our ability to bundle services can be seen in our Entertainment Group results. Total video customers, broadband connections and bundles all grew. DIRECTV NOW continued its solid run of subscriber growth. More than 300,000 DTV NOW subs were added in the first quarter, giving us nearly 1.5 million customers in service.","This over-the-top video growth has helped us manage the industry-wide transition of linear TV subscribers to over-the-top services. Looking at total video subs, we actually have more subscribers today than we did two years ago because of the success of DIRECTV NOW. This is especially important at a time when the industry is seeing increasing pressure from customers cutting the cord.","Transitions such as this are never easy, but we have shown that we're able to do this time and time again, whether it'd be with our voice or broadband or wireless services. We don't expect video to be any different. We do expect revenue and margin pressure as we manage through this, especially this year, but we're excited about DIRECTV NOW's product improvement and our new user interface that we're beta testing right now and expect to roll out soon. This has cloud-based DVR capabilities and supports an additional video stream per account. Later this year, we expect a more robust VOD experience and new pay-per-view options to be released.","These new services will add new revenue streams and help counter some of the revenue and margin pressure we are dealing with. The over-the-top model also is low touch, with significantly lower subscriber acquisition cost and less capital investment.","As we manage the over-the-top transition, we are completing our broadband transition from DSL to IP broadband. About 800,000 of our residential broadband customers are still on legacy DSL. That compares very favorably to about 4.5 million legacy DSL customers just four years ago, so we are managing through this transition. This has helped drive growing broadband momentum for us. We had 154,000 high-speed broadband net adds in the quarter and 82,000 total broadband net adds.","Our fiber build now passes more than 8 million customer locations, nearly all consumer, and you see its impact on our broadband numbers. Customer response has been terrific. In areas where they have marketed fiber for the last two years, our penetration rate is nearly 50%. That's quite a bit higher than in our non-fiber markets and leaves us a lot of room to run over the next couple years.","Now let's look at Business Solutions results on slide 6. As a reminder, wireless subscribers and specifically individual wireless subscribers who buy off a company plan have been moved from Business Solutions to Consumer Mobility. Historical financials have been recast to reflect that change. Business Solutions revenues were down slightly, as gains in wireless and strategic business services helped offset declines in legacy services.","Wireless revenues were up nearly 4%. Equipment revenues were up with increased sales, while service revenues were essentially flat. Wireline revenues were down about 3% year over year, an improvement over recent quarters and similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. This improving trend in wireline is encouraging, and this comes before any expected bump from business activity that we might see with tax reform.","Another positive is the significant improvement in business wireline margins, where EBITDA grew year over year and margins were up 190 basis points on a comparative basis. The team continues to do a great job in driving cost management initiatives.","We're also beginning to see operating expense savings from our move to a virtualized software-defined network. More than 55% of our network functions were virtualized at the end of 2017, and we expect to have 65% virtualized by the end of this year, well on our way to meet or exceed our goal of 75% virtualized by 2020.","Our international business also turned in another strong quarter, thanks to solid revenue gains in Mexico. These results are at the bottom of slide 6. Revenues were up more than 7%. EBITDA was up significantly, thanks to strength in Latin America and improvements in Mexico. Subscriber growth continues to be strong in Mexico. We added more than 500,000 new subscribers in the quarter and more than 3 million in the past year and now have 15.6 million customers in total.","Reported service revenues were down slightly due to our first quarter decision to shut down a wholesale business that we inherited from Nextel. Without that roughly $90 million reduction in revenues, reported service revenues were up year over year. And our Latin America satellite operations continue to be profitable and generate positive free cash flow.","Over the last few quarters, we explored the possibility of issuing an IPO for our DIRECTV Latin America video properties, but ended up withdrawing our offer. We just didn't believe it was the right time to transact. Current market conditions obviously played a role, and trade, interest rates, market volatility and foreign exchange all played their part.","DIRECTV Latin America has been a steady performer for us, contributing both profitability and free cash flow. We'll continue to look for ways to unlock the value of those properties for investors while increasing our optionality.","Now, I'd like to provide you updates on our Time Warner acquisition and our goal to build the world's premier gigabit network. Those details are on slide 7. I'm not sure I need to update anyone on the status of our bid to merge with Time Warner, but here's the latest.","Both sides are wrapping up their cases and are now preparing for closing arguments on April 30. After that, we'll wait for the court's ruling. Based on the court's determination, we stand ready to close. Funding is in place, even after we settle the special mandatory redemption bonds. There's not much more we can add at this point.","I'd also like to update you on our ongoing efforts to improve our networks. FirstNet continues its strong start. We launched the first and only nationwide FirstNet dedicated network core last month. This network core acts like the brains and nervous system of FirstNet and is on physically separate hardware. Only FirstNet traffic will move through this core. This will serve as a springboard for ongoing innovation and advanced functionality, delivering value-added capabilities and benefits that commercial cores can't match. This includes always-on access to priority and ruthless pre-emption.","The FirstNet network also is open for FirstNet-ready and FirstNet-capable devices. These devices support all AT&T commercial LTE bands and the FirstNet Band 14 and meet band priority selection technical requirements. So far, nearly 650 agencies across 48 states and territories are already subscribing to FirstNet services. We see this as a real growth opportunity.","We've also started the heavy lifting of putting Band 14 on our towers. Over the next 5 years, we'll be putting Band 14 on tens of thousands of new and existing sites nationwide. We plan to touch about a third of our cell sites this year alone. Our new Crown Castle agreement will help us speed this process. The agreement simplifies and expands our long-term leasing deal for wireless network infrastructure. This will give us more flexibility as we deploy FirstNet as well as 5G technologies.","We're working hard to build something great for first responders. With the introduction of the FirstNet core, first responders finally have the network that they have been asking for and that they deserve.","In addition to our efforts with FirstNet, 5G and 5G Evolution work continues its accelerated development in several different areas that will pave the way to the next generation of higher speeds and quality for customers. 5G Evolution is made up of carrier aggregation, 4X4 MIMO and 256-QAM technologies, along with LTE-Local Assist Access (sic) [LTE-Licence Assisted Access] or LTE-LAA. These are building blocks towards the transition to 5G and will deliver speeds substantially faster than LTE. 5G Evolution has now expanded to 141 markets, and we expect to reach more than 500 markets by the end of the year.","Our fixed 5G trials also are providing valuable real-world millimeter-wave spectrum experiences both to businesses and residential customers. We're seeing gigabit-plus speeds under line-of-sight conditions to distances up to 900 feet and with extremely low latency rates, some as low as 9 milliseconds. These trials as shown in millimeter-wave is able to penetrate foliage, glass and even walls better than anticipated with no discernible signal performance impacts due to rain, snow or other weather issues.","Granted, these are early results in trial conditions, but we are excited about what we have seen so far. The backbone for 5G or any wireless network is fiber and our fiber network is extensive and growing.","We're on track to surpass our commitment as part of the DIRECTV deal to build fiber to 12.5 million customer locations. We now reached more than 8 million locations with fiber and plan to hit 10 million by the end of this year. This is in addition to the 8 million business locations that we pass today within 1,000 feet with fiber. These 16 million locations and the more than 1 million route miles of fiber in our overall network are the backbone of our network and our move to 5G.","With FirstNet 5G and fiber build, our network development has never moved at a faster pace. We're excited about the progress we're making and even more excited about where our network will be in a very short time.","That's it for my presentation. Mike, I'll turn it back over to you for Q&A.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Justin, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Thank you. First, we have the line of John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys. Maybe first starting on Entertainment Group really on slide 5, John, I just want to make sure I'm reading this correctly in terms of the exhibit you put here. That everything left of that vertical line is historical accounting method. And if that's true the way I'm reading it, can you just confirm that? Yeah.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Yeah. So the historical accounting method is effectively publishing first quarter 2018 results under the old rules, so you've got comparability with last year's first quarter.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And I guess, just doing that, it would seem that the Entertainment EBITDA is down in the range of about 19%, if you could confirm that, and then on an apples-to-apples basis.","And then, if so, can you just talk about what's driving that pressure? You talked about DIRECTV satellite subs declining and some of the expenditures you're going through to stand up DIRECTV NOW and the marketing and maybe then move to the new platform. How should we expect those drivers to evolve over the course of the year? The satellite losses are like they're picking up on a year-over-year basis. Should we expect that to continue and put further pressure, I guess, on those margins from that new 22.8% level?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Yes. So a couple of things, John. First of all, I think on a year-over-year basis, our linear video losses are actually less. As you can see on the chart in the middle there, they're actually going down, so that's improving. We've seen some improvement in our churn rate. And as for (24:21)","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","I was just looking at the \u2013 I was thinking of the satellite-over-satellite number. Like the \u2013 I think it was 188,000 versus I think zero you did a year ago. I guess, the outlook is \u2013 I guess, your traditional's got a little better, but how do you see the satellite stuff evolving over the next 12 months?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","I think we're going to continue to see challenges in the satellite in the linear pay-TV model as we've talked about. We'll continue to see real opportunities to shift to the over-the-top and continue to grow DTV NOW. And then, what we will see is, as we come out with our new platform along that's in beta and then, quite frankly, some updates that we would hope to have by the end of this year, where you'll start seeing things like cloud DVR revenues, pay-per-view revenues, both sports and movies, some of the opportunities for additional streams and then eventually, revenues for advertising and data insights. We'll see a replacement of the margins and a growth in those margins on an extremely low capital expenditure basis. So we'll transition through that. That's what our expectations on that. Am I answering your question, John? That's what I'm trying to do.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Yes.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","That's the process we're going through. It'll be challenging. It's hard work. It'll take us some time, not expect it to be completed this year. But we are optimistic about total video counts growing over 100,000 and the significant year-over-year improvement in total video, almost 300,000 improvement.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","All right. I guess, John, what I'm trying to get at is the margin trajectory from here on new accounting methodology, 22.8%. Should we expect a similar trajectory from this new level as we look out to the year? Or would you expect it to stabilize as we move through the year, just given all the puts and takes?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Yes. I think we'll see some pressure throughout the year, but starting to stabilize at the end of the year.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","I do believe we'll see some ongoing pressure through the year.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Take our next question, Justin.","Operator","Sure. We have the line of Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. And afternoon, John and Mike.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Hi, Amir.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Wanted to touch base on the Mobility segment. If we think about the competitive landscape and your approach to the competitive landscape at this point, how should we think about the trade-off of subscriber acquisition versus margins? To John's prior question, if we look at it on a like-for-like basis for Mobility, we did see some pressure on a year-over-year basis against the historical margin structure. And just trying to think about the prospects for improving that going forward or how we should think about the puts and takes there.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Yes, Amir, it's a good question. What we're thinking about is we're making the investments in the customer base from, if you will, initial basis. So things like BOGOs or offers on equipment. Getting that and getting the customers in and then having that ability to retain them for what is now 120 months as opposed to moving towards a recruiting tool that would be based on service revenues that would occur every month. So we're taking that investment on an upfront basis where we can identify it, taking that pressure through margin certainly, but then knowing that we have this improving churn and this reliability and the ability then to add other services, whether it be broadband, whether it be video, whether it be wireless.","That's how we're viewing it. So we've got kind of an ability to turn on and off our investment opportunity and our customer growth. We've, so to speak, had it turned on in fourth quarter last year and then first quarter this year, but I think you've seen that over 700,000 smartphone improvement in the last two quarters over the prior year's two quarters.","So if this \u2013 take responsibility for that investment today and get it over with and then get the benefits not only over the 10 years we own the \u2013 that the customer stays with us, but quite frankly, start getting the benefits from it in the very next quarter or the very next month as you have that investment behind you. That's how we're thinking about it and that's how we go about it.","I will tell you, we're trying different data-informed offers and we're exchanging them when we see things work or not work appropriately, and we'll continue to do that. But the best we can, we've focused on these investments to the customer base that revolve around getting everything upfront, knowing what the total cost is going to be and then moving forward.","From a competitive environment, we've seen some moderating of the competitive environment over the last few months. There continues to be some changes in that and some offers that we see that we're never sure if they are temporary or permanent, but overall, we had seen some moderation in the environment. And we have, as you can see, performed really pretty well with our really, really low postpaid churn growth in prepaid and really, really improved growth in the postpaid phone trends.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful, John. And then, to your point on churn, we continue to see a decline on a year-over-year basis. What is your expectation through the course of the year? As you mentioned, we are seeing some changes in the competitive landscape. Is the expectation that you're able to continue to drive churn lower through the course of the year?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","We haven't given specific guidance to churn, but let me say this. We're striving to continue to improve churn on a year-over-year basis. Our strategy though really get to what we've seen is when we're able to bundle it with another service, a broadband, a video, wireless, any two or three of those together, we see better churn. And so we also have that and that's a differentiating viewpoint or differentiating capability that we have uniquely that others don't. And so when we can do that, we do have some optimism about the ability not only to maintain these great churn levels but even see some further improvement likely we did this quarter, both sequentially and year over year.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for the incremental color.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Good afternoon, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Hey, Simon.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","On the video programming, I think Randall had \u2013 was reportedly made their comment around introducing a AT&T watch offering for $15 bundled with wireless. Maybe you could just give us a little bit more color about that and what timing we have around that?","And then coming back to wireless, I noted the upgrade rate ticked up to 4.3% from 3.9%. And I think you'd, in the past, talked about going through this period of very low upgrade rate and then it would start to normalize over time. So it'd be great just to understand was the 4.3% do you think you're getting back to a more normal rate right now and any other color around how long people are keeping handsets or renewing them. Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Simon. Good questions. So, first of all, our upgrade rate and quite frankly, both the upgrade and the gross adds number, so we had about 0.5 million more devices in the first quarter in the upgrade rates and the gross adds. So we had a big step up. I think that was due to a lot of enthusiasm due to our great offers that the team put out. I think there was some pent-up demand for new innovative devices. And there may have been some change in the fact that devices have gotten another quarter older and people wanted to upgrade. But I think the biggest driver was really our offers. That's one thing.","Two, that's caused some pressure with regard to expenses on this comparable basis. If you use the comparable basis, then a lot of those expenses, particularly with regard to BOGO-type offers, may have fallen to the bottom line and caused some pressure there. So that's a reality. On those, we're more than willing to pay that, if you will, make that investment to get the long-term and, quite frankly, immediate short-term additional revenues.","I don't know that the upgrade rate itself because the age of devices has changed that much. I do believe our offers drove the increase in the upgrade rate. And the new iPhones may have driven some of it because of the limitation and the lateness that they came in, in the fourth quarter, and some of our customers using BOGOs to buy those in the first.","So that's how I view that. We'll continue to watch it. I don't believe we're going to go back to the historic upgrade rates. I think those are clearly a matter of history. And even though the fact that we're talking about 4.3% being a big increase in the upgrade rate gives you the sense of we used to talk about normal upgrade rates being a lot higher percentages.","With regard to the video programming, let me just say this. As we move forward through this year and are able to continue to innovate, we'll have a lot of offers in wireless and broadband and in video. One of those would be the one that you're referring to that Randall mentioned, a DTV watch-type program. We'll leave it to my marketing and sales team to come out with the details on that. I know they're going to do a lot better job than I could. But I think the more important message is that we are willing to innovate. We are willing to try some different things to grow the customer base in the right way and continue to be able to grow the overall business on a bundled basis.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Fair, thank you.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Mike McCormack of Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. John, maybe just circling back on the Entertainment Group and some of the pressures there, I was just thinking about \u2013 I think Randall recently was quoted as comparing it to the legacy wireline voice business of old. And I don't think there's much argument that linear is under tremendous pressure. But as you look at that unit or that segment, how much of the cost is variable? And as you think about the piece parts within that, which parts of it can you reduce with the sub counts versus more structural fixed costs?","And then on the content cost side, which I presume is mostly variable, what benefits you guys are getting as far as cost goes or negotiating power goes with the programmers for the DIRECTV NOW product?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Again, Mike, good question, a couple things. I guess I'd view the cost of this, sorry, on the video entertainment piece of it, on the video side, that content is variable with regard to the packages we sell. But I also think there's some opportunity going forward to be variable with regard to within the packages. And I think we've made reference to possibly some offers, possibly getting to a point where we have differentiated offers and different packages. We have some today continuing to do that. So I think there is some, not only just based on the volume of customers but also based on what the customers want to buy, and we'll continue to look for that.","On the high-speed Internet side or the broadband side, I would suggest to you what we've been building into that 8 million fiber, quite frankly, is something we still have a lot of selling to do into. And so that capital has been spent and that capacity to serve is already out there. We're just in this process of growing this IP broadband base and serving it. So I would suggest to you that could be a change or provide new direction, particularly as we've gotten through the legacy DSL conversions, which has really been absorbing us for the last few years.","On the legacy voice and data, those challenges continue to be there. Those costs either have been managed out or continue to be managed out. So that's how we think about this. But on the video side, the real growth here is going to be in these alternative services, whether it's cloud DVRs, pay-per-views, data insights, advertising, doing those kinds of things while growing broadband at a high-speed level and continuing the success we've had.","And then as you look at that Entertainment Group, bundling the two of those together, but also bundling all that with wireless, and so that's the real strength in it. That's what makes it worth all the efforts that we're going through to transition it. So it's not just one individual piece, but it's the collection of those pieces that make this very attractive.","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. The first one is just a quick housekeeping question. The new USF accounting, you noted that it's neutral to operating income. Can you clarify? Is it also neutral to EBITDA? I think that might help some comparability.","And then just coming back to the Entertainment segment, the U-verse video base has been remarkably flat. Particularly, I think you added a customer \u2013 a couple customers this quarter. I was hoping maybe you could provide a little more insight as to why that is. And is that more directly tied to the adoption of your residential fiber product than perhaps what we're seeing in the satellite trends? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","A couple of things. One, yes, on EBITDA, the USF revenue and expenses are both in the EBITDA calculations, so they will net to zero. It won't have any change to EBITDA. I will tell you, though, Brett, to be clear, in prior years that USF revenue was in service revenues. And so it impacted service EBITDA margins, not EBITDA itself as a number, but the margins. We believe this will give a better picture of what we actually collect from customers on our behalf versus what we collect on the government's behalf, much like sales taxes, which we had never previously counted as service revenues. So you're right. It does not affect EBITDA, operating income, or EBITDA. The starting point, though, would be, would it have an impact on service revenues.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","U-verse, I think essentially a couple different things. One, the fiber build and the fiber capabilities, the broadband capabilities make that natural bundle very good. Two, U-verse is in our historic legacy telephone company footprint, where we generally have very good wireless capabilities, distribution, and have had actually better results in bundling when we have all aspects to that. So that's another point.","Brett, I would tell you the need to migrate U-verse in the satellite to take advantage of differentiating content costs is ebbing or is greatly reduced than possibly it was when we first merged with DIRECTV. All of those things are part of the process. And quite frankly, customer satisfaction with the U-verse product is probably the most important consideration. The people are happy. So those are all things that contribute to that aspect.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just a quick follow-up question. I think you had previously indicated that when the DIRECTV satellite product was being sold in your landline region, you were seeing better results there because you could bundle with broadband. Is that still playing out? Or are you finding that the U-verse video product is still a much more natural bundle with your broadband offer?","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","I won't say in comparison to the two U-verse compared to satellite, but I will tell you that we do believe that we do better and have better churn stats when we can bundle video, both satellite and U-verse. U-verse cannot by definition, but satellite, we have better churn results and better customer experiences when we can bundle with our IP broadband. And to that point, just another reason for the fiber build and the opportunity that it presents as well as what FirstNet will provide to, quite frankly, all our satellite customer with regard to the potential for much better quality wireless service. So all of that kind of plays together.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the questions.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi guys. Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Hi, Phil.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, John. First, a follow-up. You were fairly aggressive in the first quarter in the wireless compared to previous first quarters, but a lot of these promotions fell away in April. Should we think about this as a new level of aggression for the full year or are you just changing up the seasonality? And then, a bigger question, John, the online and addressable advertising business seems to be under fire on a lot of fronts and there's some increased investor preference lately for online subscription businesses. How do the headlines impact your thinking around AT&T strategy of accruing content and the OTT transition and the trade you seem to be making of giving up subscription revenue to drive subscribers in an effort to build the targeted advertising opportunity? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","So, Phil, with regard to aggressiveness, I would suggest you we have the capabilities to be aggressive in the first quarter. We did that. We tried different things. As you can tell, we did that in the fourth quarter, too. As you pointed out, we changed them as we've gone through to make sure what we were doing was working and was getting the results, not only just results but the results we wanted. And we're continuing to focus on data-informed decisions in that light.","What I'd suggest you is we should continue to see us something like the three offers that we've, I guess, recently put out in the marketplace. In New York, where we're using video as an opportunity to attract customers; in Chicago, where we're using our capabilities with regard to broadband to attract customers; or in Los Angeles, where we're using wireless. We're trying to be market-directed, market-informed and trying to put offers out that'll, if you will, make a difference. You can expect to continue to see us change some things, try some things. We might do a BOGO and then we might do a second one is a 50% fee as opposed to a full BOGO. I think we recently did that with wireless offering.","So you'll see us make changes on a regular basis. We're trying to, if you will, make sure we're willing to invest this opportunity in the customer base to grow the business and the opportunities for the long-term. I don't want to suggest that our, if you will, investment levels will continue to be at the same level they were in the first quarter. We'll go through that process as we go through the year and make the right decisions for the short-term and the long-term for the business. But I do expect we'll continue to look at things on a regular basis as we've been doing even here in April.","With regard to \u2013 the recent issues with regard to, I'll call it, customer datas and customer, if you will, rights with regard to that data, we continue to respect our customers. We've been the guys that have been in the business of, if you will, simply put unlisted numbers for 100 years. We understand the customers' data and privacy and how to deal with that. We're the ones who have pushed for a consumer Bill of Rights and pushed that legislative earlier this year, long before this became a headline story of the recent month. So we continue to believe, and, if you will, respecting your customers' privacy and treating them the right way will provide the long-term results.","With that being said, we continue to believe in the processes and practices we have in place as being appropriate. And we continue to believe that there is a space for us as a trusted adviser and a trusted player in the data insights and data privacy space for our customers and for the advertisers who are clearly looking for a trusted partner in that space.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have the line of David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, John. Thanks for taking the questions.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Sure.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So first question would be, if you could kind of maybe elaborate a little bit more on where we are kind of on the FirstNet go-to-market process? Have you stood up a sales force, if you have, what exactly are they selling and to who? And when can we think about the market share opportunity that you have there starting to feather into your kind of gross add market share and net add share in the market?","And then the second is, a year ago, first quarter, the postpaid phone net add market was a couple hundred thousand phones. If we look at what you and Verizon and Comcast have done and make a few educated guesses about T-Mobile and Sprint, year over year, that's going to be 3x to 4x this quarter. And if I look at last quarter, it was actually up 50% year over year. What do you think is kind of driving this phenomenon where the postpaid phone net add market just seems kind of growing out of thin air? Is it the economy? Is it prepaid to postpaid migration? Is it BYOD? I'd love your thought \u2013 your theories here to kind of explain it. And then, whether we can maybe assume it's going to continue for the rest of the year or whether this is kind of transitory effect? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","So I think it depends, David. I don't doubt. Let me say it this way. For us, we're both growing that improved postpaid phone, improved 300,000, while we still had almost 200,000 \u2013 I think it was about 192,000, but almost 200,000 prepaid net adds. So, for us, we're seeing continued good \u2013 really good performance in prepaid, but really good performance in the smartphone. So we're seeing a total growth in those phones. That's what we're seeing. I think others are seeing some conversion from prepaid to postpaid. I wouldn't \u2013 that may be at the customers' decision just based on pricing opportunities or, if you will, plans that are out there.","But we are seeing continued growth in both for us. I do understand your question. And we'll wait and see about what happens with the total marketplace. I don't have a total view of that marketplace because I don't think anybody does because some of the company haven't announced and so forth.","But in our, if you will, piece of the marketplace, you saw us now two quarters in a row over the last two quarters a 700,000 improvement in postpaid smartphones and continuing good performance, solid performance in prepaid. So we believe that we're doing very well in the share part of the game.","I would also tell you there's other aspects of things in the postpaid net adds, as you all know, whether tablets are going, whether and how people count watches and other devices. I'll leave that to you all to decide and to evaluate. But on the phones, we feel pretty good about getting good value for the investment plans we put out there and a great opportunity to generate value, short-term, the month after, with regard to the revenues these guys are going to generate and over the long-term because of our churn being so low.","With regard to FirstNet, FirstNet's something that we're really excited about. We're very excited about getting that, the only exclusive authorized FirstNet core up and running last month. We really do believe that that's critical to be able to provide the services and to provide that quality of service that those first responders deserve and need.","We had set up a FirstNet team last year. An individual by the name of Chris Sambar runs that for us. We added marketing and staff and sales people. We've spent money, if you will, and time over the \u2013 at least over the last nine months, if not longer, almost a year, I guess, getting to know our potential clients, getting into the industry, making a bigger effort to be a known player.","With regard to that, as I mentioned earlier, we've actually had about 600 or so, if you will, departments sign up with us. And those 600 departments came from over 48 states because they can use \u2013 we can provide the FirstNet quality services on our existing LTE network once we've established this core, which we did last month. So they can get relentless or ruthless pre-emption, and they can get priority services. And that can all work now. We can provide that.","Now, some of those folks that we signed up could have been our customers before they just want to migrate to FirstNet and that'll be part of the process. But quite frankly, I think we've been very pleased about the reception we've been given to at least talk to people that previously weren't our customers.","On a per person basis, if you will, some of your first line, first responder, you're thinking about two or three or potentially four connected points, whether it be a body camera, whether it be a phone, whether it be a tablet for their car, whether it would be some drone or some other device they'd use. But you also look at it from the ability to contact with the smart cities, their employer, so to speak, and whether we can sell other services there. We're also looking for the in-house personnel, the dispatch people that work at the police station or other personnel whether we can have an opportunity to sell there. And of course, there's always the friends and family approach.","So we're very pleased. First of all, we've got a FirstNet team already set up. They're very active. They've already gotten a number of contracts done in over 40 states. And we continue to be very excited about it. We will get a significant amount of the Band 14 up this year, and we are expecting to, at a minimum, meet and hopefully exceed all the milestone requirements that FirstNet has given us. So if I sound pretty positive about it, I am.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Amy Yong of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Maybe if you could talk a little bit more about the advertising opportunity and size up the near-term market opportunity for us. How quickly do you think you can wrap this up and then maybe some growth trends that we should be looking at for this year and next? And then just very quickly on the 5G fixed wireless trials, how big is the residential broadband marketing opportunity, as we think about 2019 and beyond? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","So on the advertising, let me start. I'd point out, this quarter we were up 9% in revenues. We have a base of about $350 million a quarter, in that range. I don't have the specific number at my fingertips here. And we grew at about 9%. So the team is actually proving that this works already with our existing, if you will, inventory of ads that we get as the distributor from the content folks.","So we're making it work. We're getting higher CPMs and getting higher revenue streams and making it more effective. We feel really good about that. As we go through this year, we hope to add a lot more inventory from underneath our umbrella of ownership companies to that, and we'd like to develop that.","If you think about the overall digital market, I don't know the exact numbers, but I think last year, the overall digital advertising market in the U.S. was north of $60 billion, and some estimates will get it in the $80 billion range. We're not what I would call in that piece a significant player. We believe that we can be. We have the capabilities to be. And we've made the investments not only in the personnel and the team that Brian Lesser has established, but we're also making investments in data capabilities and our big data engines inside our company today. So we feel really good about that opportunity.","If you think about linear TV and the opportunity to grow that revenue stream, if you think about digital and the opportunity to grow that, and anything about the opportunity to take all of our digital insights and data insights and help advertisers make sure their advertising is working effectively and efficiently, we believe that there's a real opportunity there. So all of that being done within the appropriate rules and data protection activities. So we feel really good about that.","With regard to the fixed 5G wireless, if you will, our tests have shown it can be done. We can do it. The opportunity there is something that we have to prove out. We're not as excited about the business case. It's not as compelling yet for us as it may be for some. The reason we don't see that, if you will. The question is to get that fixed wireless through to residential, you still have to have backhaul from where the \u2013 the 1,000 feet away, the 1,500 feet away, and you still have to have that backhaul infrastructure. So that could be depending upon your ability to successfully pick who's going to buy and how much we're going to need is going to be a very tricky business case.","For us, with this extensive fiber network, we will be able to have that backhaul. With this extensive FirstNet network, we'll be able to have that backhaul. But quite frankly, if we've got FirstNet and we've got fiber there, it may be just as effective and maybe even a better quality product to give those customers fiber-to-the-home.","So we're continuing to work at it. I just don't want to hold it out as \u2013 right now, we are more excited, as you can tell, from things I've made about our FirstNet opportunity, about the fiber capabilities that we're building and selling into that, and quite frankly, about the overall 5G Evolution and 5G capabilities in our overall mobility network serving much of the mobile broadband demands that are out there or requirements that are out there.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great, thank you.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you, Amy.","Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.","Justin, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Last, we have the line of Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thank you. Give us a little bit more color on maybe the free cash flow aspects in your Entertainment business as you're switching more to the DIRECTV NOW product. That would be great. And then on 5G, some of the devices being available late 2018, can you give us a little bit more color on exactly what devices you're waiting for before the launch? Thanks.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Okay. With regard to the 5G, let me make this point. On the 5G Evolution, those devices are not only available now, many of our customers already have them. And so the speeds we get with 5G Evolution by putting up all our spectrum with regard to FirstNet, using 4-way carrier aggregation, which allows us to band the spectrum that we put up now all together, and having 4-way MIMO, which is, if you will, an efficient and quick way to let customers access the network and exit the network, those speeds are working today. And in our test in San Francisco, we got 750-meg speeds on our network. On a full network, that might be 10% to 20% of that level. But we believe we can get 100-meg speeds on our 5G Evolution network with handsets that are already out there today in people's hands, and they're coming through the rest of the handset manufacturer base over time.","So I just want to point that out. That's one of the reasons why the FirstNet with the technology developments of carrier agg and 4-way MIMO and 256-QAM and all these other things combined as well as the new spectrum, Band 14, gives us real excitement about the ability to serve customers really, really well.","On the 5G, I think by the end of this year, we'll have 5G networks up. The device that will be out will probably be pucks and the ability to connect to a puck. And then we'd expect to see what I'll call handset devices or tablets or those types of what I would \u2013 I think many of us would normally think of as devices. Those would be out in 2019. And as I think Simon referenced earlier in the call, we've got, if you will, upgrade cycles that are sub-5% a quarter. So there may be some time to getting those 5G handsets up and running, so to speak. So we'll see how that goes, whether that changes the upgrade cycles or not. But all of that for us points to this 5G Evolution can be a really beneficial thing for us because that's available in many, many handsets today.","On the free cash flow side, if you will, Frank, I guess I'll say it this way. Moving to the DTV NOW platform or moving to a thin client platform eventually for the home is really going to change the free cash flow aspects because of the upfront of truck roll cost, the upfront, if you will, climb the roof costs, all of that can change as well as some of the things with regard to billing and administrative costs, the fact that it's an automatic bill or it's a credit card bill, all of those things will change.","But that's one of the attractiveness is about the DTV NOW is the economics about not having that upfront investment. That will turn into savings from an upfront investment from a cash flow perspective. So that's why this thing we strongly believe it will work long term.","With regard to our first quarter free cash flow \u2013 and we want to make one point. First of all, first quarter is always low for us because of bonuses and other things. We had a huge handset sales in the first \u2013 in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. 500,000 up year over year in the first quarter. 700,000 up year over year in the fourth quarter. And many of those sales in the fourth quarter, we actually paid for the phones this quarter because they were late in the quarter last year when they were sold.","So we had a lot of cash flow pressure from handsets that will reverse itself that'll wash itself out. I just want to point that out. So we feel good about our free cash flow and keeping it in that $21 billion range is the guidance we've given as well as keeping all of our guidance intact.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","Thank you, Frank.","John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.","With that, I want to thank everybody for being on the call today. We're off to a fast start in 2018, both in growing our customer base and in building the world's premier gigabit network. We continue to add new subscribers in wireless, broadband and video, and we are on track to turn wireless service revenues towards growth this year.","The FirstNet build is kicking in the gear, and we launched the nationwide FirstNet dedicated network core last month. We're working hard to build something great for first responders and early response from our sales activity has been very positive. We're also moving full speed on our 5G evolution and expect to be the first U.S. carrier to introduce Mobile 5G later this year.","Behind all of this is our expanding fiber network, which is the backbone for all our networks, both wireless and wired. And of course, we optimistically await conclusion of our Time Warner court case as a court's decision. One last thought, as you make your way home tonight, please remember, no text is worth a life. It can wait. Please be safe. Thanks again for being on the call and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter Conference Call. It's great to have you with us. I'm Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. With me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer; and Ralph de la Vega, AT&T's President and CEO for Mobility. John will cover our consolidated and wireline results and Ralph will give us an update on our wireless business. And then we'll follow up with Qs and As. ","Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website at www.att.com\/investor.relations. I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3. This presentation and comments may contain forward-looking statements. They're subject to risks. Results may differ materially. Details are on our SEC filings and on AT&T's website. ","Before I turn the call over to John, let me quickly call your attention to Slide 4, which provides a financial summary. EPS for the quarter was $0.60, a 5.3% increase over last year's first quarter EPS. Consolidated revenues were up once again, thanks to strong revenue growth in wireless, gains in U-verse services and continued improving trends in wireline business. Margins were up, both in consolidated and wireless, even with continued smartphone sales. And cash flow continues to be solid. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled $7.8 billion and free cash flow of $3.5 billion. We also began our share repurchase program in the first quarter. John will go into more detail. But for the quarter, we bought back more than $2 billion in shares. And with that overview, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?","John Joseph Stephens","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for being with us today. During our last earnings call, our Chairman, Randall Stephenson, laid out a few strategic focus areas for 2012. I would like to start this morning by giving you an update on what we've done so far. The highlights are on Slide 5. ","First, we had a terrific start to the year. In January, we talked about our ability to execute and grow the business and laid out clear objectives for the year. At the end of the first quarter, we remain confident in our business operations and our ability to achieve guidance in every area. Second, we told you that we would begin buying back shares as part of our 300 million share authorization. We've done just that and we have done so aggressively, buying back more than 67 million shares in the first quarter. ","Third, we remain focused on improving our overall growth profile by looking at opportunities to divest or restructure low-performing and nonstrategic assets. You saw us take a step in this direction with the announced sale of Advertising Solutions to Cerberus Capital Management. We expect that transaction to close in mid-year. And we continue to look for other ways to improve the growth profile of our business. And fourth, we also spoke of the importance of spectrum, not just to us but to the entire wireless industry. We've taken action by acquiring additional spectrum through smaller transactions: 10 separate transactions closed in the first quarter alone and we have 4 more deals currently in process at the FCC. We also continue to maximize our network capacity and quality with existing spectrum through network management and tiered data pricing. Our LTE rollout is growing strong. So as you can see, we are off to a very strong start in executing the plans we have laid out. And we remain confident in our ability to execute and grow the business. ","Let's now take a look at first quarter operational highlights on Slide 6. No matter which financial metric you focus on, you see solid results. We grew revenue thanks to a strong wireless quarter and the best revenue growth in wireline consumer in years. Operating income margins were up across-the-board, consolidated, wireless and wireline. And we grew earnings in the mid-single-digit range. We also continue to see impressive strength in all our growth drivers. Data growth, driven by the mobile Internet, leads the way. Ralph will give you the highlights in a moment, but let me give you a few of the headlines. ","We continue to set the pace in smartphone sales. We actually sold slightly more smartphones this quarter than a year ago, but our service margins were up significantly. We also had another record first quarter with branded computing sales, thanks to tablets and tethering plans. All this helped drive strong mobile data growth of almost 20%, or more than $1 billion higher than the first quarter a year ago. Throw in our lowest postpaid churn in 7 quarters, and you can see the strength of this business and of our mobile Internet strategy. We also continue to be pleased with the extensive transformation of our wireline business. U-verse continues to make impressive gains. Not only did we hit 4 million TV subscribers, but we also had strong U-verse broadband sales. Year-over-year, business wireline revenue trends also continue to improve, thanks to another strong quarter from strategic business services. So you're seeing strong execution in every part of the business and a very solid start to the year. ","With that as a background, now let's look at detailed results starting with consolidated revenues on Slide 7. First quarter consolidated revenues totaled $31.8 billion, up 1.8% from a year ago. Our growth drivers continue to transform our revenue mix, including strong mobile data results, solid U-verse gains and improving trends in our wireline business. In the first quarter, 78% of our revenue came from wireless and wireline data and managed services. That's up from 74% a year ago and 70% just 2 years ago. And revenues from these areas grew almost $1.4 billion, or more than 6% in the first quarter. ","As I mentioned, we announced earlier this month that we have agreed to sell our Advertising Solutions and Interactive business units to Cerberus. In return, we will receive $750 million in cash, a $200 million note and a minority interest in the new entity. If you want to take a look at what this quarter would look like without Ad Solutions, our consolidated revenue growth would've been 2.3% and our wireless and wireline growth drivers would contribute close to 80% of our total revenue. We'll continue to sharpen our focus on our growth drivers and expect this mix transition to continue. I now would like to turn the call over to Ralph de la Vega, who will give us a wireless update. Ralph?","Ralph de la Vega","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate being on the call once again. Let me start with a wireless overview on Slide 8. As John said, we delivered a great set of wireless metrics in the first quarter. Our smartphone sales were slightly better than last year, which makes for a record first quarter. And we did this while facing more iPhone competition than ever before. Strong smartphone sales drive strong data sales and data drives this business. This quarter, data revenue was up more than $1 billion. That's almost 20% growth off of a large base. In fact, mobile data is a $24 billion annualized revenue stream for us. I'm also really proud that even though our smartphone sales topped last year's record, our service margins increased significantly to 41.6%. And to top it off, we also delivered our best postpaid churn in 7 quarters. ","Let me give you more details on this quarter's result with a look at revenue and ARPU on Slide 9. Our leadership in mobile data continues to drive solid revenue results. Total wireless revenues were up 5.4% in the quarter and wireless service revenues increased 4.3% versus the first quarter a year ago. Postpaid ARPU also continues to perform well. Postpaid ARPU growth was 1.7%. And when you look at phone-only ARPU, it was up more than 2%. This growth has not only been consistent 13 consecutive quarters in a row, but we also continue to do this from a much higher ARPU base than anyone else. Helping drive that growth is our growing postpaid smartphone base. We now have more than 41 million smartphones on our network. That's up nearly 10 million smartphones in just 1 year and ARPU for smartphones is 90% higher than our non-smartphone subscribers. We also continue to bring in more subscribers onto our network with tiered data plans. Just over 25 million or almost 61% of our postpaid smartphone base is on tiered plans, with more than 70% choosing the higher-priced plans. That is a remarkable transformation of our subscriber base in less than 2 years and a key factor in helping us continue to invest and build our networks while returning value to shareholders. ","Another positive metric for us this quarter is postpaid churn. Let's look at that and subscriber gains on Slide 10. Postpaid churn delivered its lowest level in 7 quarters. This lower churn is tied directly to the quality of our network and the investments we've made to deliver the best customer experience. So at a time when there's more competition than ever, our customers continue to be loyal to AT&T. In fact, iPhone churn hit its lowest level in 5 quarters. ","One reason for lower churn is the large number of customers on family or business plans. About 88% of smartphone subscribers are on these plans, and these customers tend to be sticky, with churn below our average. Total churn was up in the first quarter versus a year ago due mainly to churn in consumer-connected devices and in our reseller channel. But despite that increase in total churn, we added subscribers in every customer category and we've done that for 7 consecutive quarters in a row. As a result of great sales and lower postpaid churn, we added more than 700,000 subscribers in the first quarter. Postpaid net adds were 187,000, which gives us almost 70 million total postpaid subscribers. Prepaid net adds were up 125,000. Reseller net adds came in at 184,000 and we had 230,000 connected device net adds. That's lower than in past quarters for 2 reasons. In the first quarter, we saw more sales of WiFi-only computing devices and the ongoing adjustments we make for inactive devices. ","Now I would like to take a look at mobile data revenue growth and smartphone sales. The details are on Slide 11. Data revenues were $6.1 billion, up more than $1 billion from the first quarter a year ago. As I just mentioned, data revenues are now a $24 billion annualized revenue stream, growing at nearly 20% a year. Data drives this business, and I firmly believe we're still in the early stages of mobile data growth, driven by the mobile Internet. We sold 5.5 million smartphones in the quarter or slightly higher than a year ago, when we set a first quarter record. Smartphone subscribers now make up almost 60% of our postpaid subscriber base and accounted for 78% of postpaid sales during the quarter. These results reflect another strong quarter for iPhone activations, with about 4.3 million activated during the quarter and about 21% of those iPhone subscribers were new to AT&T. These customers are choosing AT&T for a reason. We provide the best mobile Internet experience on the nation's largest 4G network, which lets iPhone 4S users download 3 times faster than our competitors. We also had a solid performance in branded computing devices. We added 460,000 in the first quarter, more than 1\/2 of those came from tablets. We now have almost 5.8 million branded computing devices on the network, and that's up nearly 70% in the past year. ","Now let's take a look at wireless margins. The details are on Slide 12. Strong smartphone sales usually impact margins. This quarter, the story is a little different. We actually sold more smartphones than we did a year ago, but our wireless service margin was significantly higher, about 260 basis points higher, delivering a service margin of 41.6% for the quarter. Some of this is due to the impact of the Alltel and Centennial mergers a year ago. But about 1\/2 of the increase is due to management focus on cost containment and prudent spending. ","We've taken other important steps that will have a positive impact on margins but aren't yet showing up in our results. First, the impact of new data pricing plans that we announced earlier this year was minimal this quarter. Second, there was also minimal impact this quarter with a higher upgrade fee that we announced in February. And third, we have yet to see the impact of the new upgrade policy that we introduced last year. We expect all of these to provide additional margin support going forward. ","We'll continue to invest in smartphone subscribers. You know the long-term value they bring: lower churn, higher ARPUs and strong data growth. Our strategy has been to grow this base, which we continue to do while keeping existing smartphone subscribers on our network. Handset upgrades were about 7% in the first quarter, which tracks nicely with our stable smartphone sales forecast for this year. We also saw a positive lift in our wireless operating income, which is up more than 11% this quarter. We feel that much of our success this quarter in sales and churn can be tied back to the quality, the speed and the reach of our network. ","And I would like to take a look at operational improvements we made in this area during the first quarter. Highlights are on Slide 13. In the first quarter, the nation's largest 4G network became even larger. We now cover 260 million POPs with our 4G network and we cover thousands more cities and towns than our closest 4G competitor. This means that we deliver the best mobile Internet experience to more of the country than ever. But you don't have to take my word for it. Last week, PCWorld released the results of our 4G speed test and declared that AT&T's 4G LTE network delivered faster download speeds than any other carrier tested in the 9 markets surveyed. And that is great news. But it gets better. See, they also said that AT&T's ace in the hole was pairing our LTE and HSPA+ networks. PCWorld called it, \"The fastest combination offered by any carrier.\" And I can't say anything better than that. It really puts an exclamation point behind our network strategy and our goal of providing the best mobile Internet experience for our subscribers. Customers know this and they love our 4G network. ","About 30% of our smartphone subscribers use a 4G-capable device, and that number continues to go higher as we introduce new and compelling LTE devices, such as the Nokia Lumia. At the same time, our LTE 4G rollout continues to go well, 35 markets so far, including St. Louis earlier this month. We're on track to double our LTE coverage this year. And our LTE build will be largely complete by year-end 2013. We continue to look for ways to make the network experience even better. Our enhanced backhaul build continues. 86% of our data traffic now travels on it. We're also making good use of WiFi and Distributed Antenna Systems. We have the largest WiFi network in the country, with nearly 30,000 hotspots and we have 3,000 Distributed Antenna Systems in high-traffic areas, such as arenas and stadiums. So we're off to a great start this year, and we are very excited about what lies ahead. With that, I want to turn it back to John to discuss wireline results. John?","John Joseph Stephens","Thank you, Ralph, and a great quarter. Now let's take a look at wireline, starting with business, which you can see on Slide 14. We continue to see improving business revenue trends. In fact, in many ways, we had our best quarter in years. Strategic business services continue to lead the way. That's products such as Ethernet, VPNs and application services, which were up 19% for the quarter and is now more than a $6 billion annualized revenue stream for us. That helped drive service revenues to its best growth rate in 4 years, down only 0.3% compared to a decline of 4.4% in the year-ago quarter. And total business revenues were down less than 1%. And again, the best comparable that we have had in years. ","A big factor of this success is accelerating data revenue growth. Its 4.2% growth was the best we have seen in years. Driving this are positive trends in almost every part of the business. Global enterprise had its fourth consecutive quarter of increasing data growth. Our wholesale business actually grew service revenues in the first quarter for the first time in 3 years. And revenue trends in small business continue to improve, with solid growth in bundles. This success helped our wireline business margins improve year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter. We are very pleased with these results. The progress has been slow but steady. And we still expect that wireline business will return to revenue growth this year, even without the benefit of a lift from the economy. ","Let's now turn to our wireline consumer results on Slide 15. We have done an outstanding job scaling U-verse in the last few years. This has helped drive wireline consumer revenue growth by 1%, strongest revenue growth in years. Total U-verse subscribers, both TV and High Speed Internet, reached 6.2 million in the first quarter. U-verse TV net adds continue to be solid, as we hit 4 million subscribers. TV penetration continues to expand, more than 27% in areas marketed to for 42 months or more. And consumer U-verse is now an $8 billion annualized revenue stream, growing at about 38% year-over-year. ","If U-verse was a standalone company with its annualized revenues, it would be in the Fortune 300. Not bad for a business that we started just over 5 years ago. Meanwhile, our U-verse broadband net adds continue to accelerate, more than 3x our TV additions, which includes new U-verse small business customers, where we grew subscribers this quarter. This helped drive overall broadband growth as customers moved from DSL to higher-speed U-verse services. Faster broadband speeds plus mobility is a combination small business customers are looking for, and AT&T's strength in both of these areas is a competitive advantage. So all in all, a very solid quarter in wireline, both in business and in consumer, with improving trends in both areas. ","Now let's look at margin and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on Slide 16. We said in January that we expected to deliver improved consolidated margins this year, with wireless margin expansion and stable wireline margins. Our first quarter results show that we are on track. Our consolidated operating margin was 19.2%. That's up from the first quarter a year ago and sequentially, thanks to growth in wireless and consumer wireline revenues and operational efficiencies. We saw improving wireline revenue trends impact our wireline operating margin, which was up year-over-year. Also helping to offset declines in legacy services were solid cost management, scale in U-verse and solid execution with our One AT&T cost initiative. ","Along with solid margins, we continue to have strong cash flow. Our cash summary is on Slide 17. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled $7.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.3 billion, with more than 1\/2 of that invested in the wireless business. Free cash flow before dividends was $3.5 billion and dividend payments totaled $2.6 billion. In terms of uses of cash, total debt is down $3.8 billion from 2 years ago, with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38% and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.48. We also began to aggressively pursue our authorized share buyback. In the first quarter, we purchased more than 67 million of our 300 million share authorization or about $2.1 billion worth of stock. We will continue to purchase shares under the authorization, which could include open market purchases, structured programs such as accelerated share repurchase and other programs, including 10b5-1 plans where appropriate. When you look at both dividends and the stock buyback, we returned $4.7 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter alone. We are very proud of our financial management. Our balance sheet is sound, our debt metrics solid and our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest, to retire debt, all the while returning substantial value to our shareholders. ","Now before we get to your questions, let me close with a quick recap on Slide 18. First, we are off to a very good start for the year. We are executing well against the strategy we laid out in January while delivering a strong financial performance. We also continue to be a pacesetter in the mobile Internet, the wireless industry's #1 growth driver. Data revenue growth is strong, postpaid churn is down and smartphone and branded computing device sales continue to grow. At the same time, wireline is transforming from legacy products to IP data and is poised for growth. And our balance sheet is second to none in our industry, while returning substantial value to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. So all in all, a solid start to the year, with growing confidence as we move ahead. Susan, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're ready for Q&A.","Susan Johnson","Okay, great. Thank you, John. I think we are ready to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ralph, impressive numbers on the churn. It's best in quite a few quarters. Can you talk about the outlook for churn? Is this sort of a good new base level? Or do you think there's opportunities here to drive this further as your smartphone loading continues to build? And then John, you got the directory sale through. Can you talk about where we stand in reviewing the rural access lines?","Ralph de la Vega","Simon, let me address the churn question. Yes, I think there's room for improvement. I think we're always focused on that metric, which is a key metric that allows our business to grow in every way. We think that the improvements that we're making in the network and in the customer experience are significant and that quite frankly, the best is yet to come. So I'm very bullish on keeping churn low and even performing better than what we have seen here in the first quarter. I'm very bullish on the LTE network that we're building. As you heard me say, the PCWorld article is a great article that really tested our network in 9 cities head-to-head against the best in the industry and we came out on top. And so I am very excited about the prospects that a great LTE network with HSPA technology bring to the marketplace. I mentioned this in my earlier messaging, but I want to repeat it, that I think we're on the verge of a tipping point with the mobile Internet. IDC released the figures that last year at the end of the year, for the first time ever, the shipments of smartphones topped the shipments of PCs. And then when you add on top of that tablets, which are mobile devices, it's estimated that we have reached the tipping point with the mobile Internet, that from here on out, you can expect to see more and more increases in people accessing the Internet through their mobile devices. And that plays to our strategy of building a great LTE network on top of our HSPA network, and then rolling out terrific new LTE devices like we just did with the Nokia Lumia. I think that combination of network, devices, applications, when you combine it with cloud computing and HTML5 capabilities, it says that customers are going to continue to access the mobile Internet in ways that we have not seen before. And that applies both to business and consumer customers. Our business team did a terrific job this quarter in adding subscribers and connecting them to the network. So we're very bullish on the outlook for the mobile Internet and churn. It goes a long way to say that customers love what we're doing in this area.","John Joseph Stephens","Simon, let me address your question with regard to our portfolio analysis processes on specifically rural access lines. As we've said before and as I think you're aware, the key here is that at this time, we don't have a broadband solution for rural America right now. So over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll spend -- we'll continue to spend time analyzing that situation and analyzing alternatives for it. I won't speculate about what conclusions we might reach or what impact that might have on our financial metrics. I will tell you that we are very aware and very proud of being known as a strong, consistent dividend payer. And our philosophy in that regard has not changed.","Operator","Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe Ralph, just a quick question on spectrum. The deals that you guys have done sound like they're helpful in addressing some of the spectrum needs you guys have. Could you maybe talk a little bit about it in, one, your potential interest in the B block that Verizon will be selling over the 700 megahertz spectrum they have, and maybe sort of needs going forward, especially as all this data traffic demand increases?","Ralph de la Vega","Yes. John, I don't think it's appropriate for us to speculate on what would happen with the Verizon spectrum. But we've said before, we prefer low-band spectrum. That is our preferred option. And we did get low-band spectrum with the Qualcomm purchase, which is something that we're looking to put into play with our LTE aggregation capability. And like John Stephens mentioned, we have been looking for small acquisitions, which we've done several in the first quarter already and we'll continue to look for more because we don't see this data growth slowing. I think I mentioned several times in the call that I think this mobile Internet is going to continue to drive data growth. And so we're going to continue to look for the FCC and others to bring spectrum to market so that we can address the longer-term needs that we have, and quite frankly, that the industry has.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. One quick follow-up. You guys did very well in terms of upgrade rates. It's 7% versus the 9% last year. And as you said on the call, you really even haven't even seen the benefits of the fee or the tighter upgrade standards. Is that 2 percentage point difference year-to-year, is that what we could expect going forward? Or do you think that delta can expand as these initiatives kick in?","John Joseph Stephens","All right. John, as the way we look at it is I think we gave guidance that we expected smartphone sales to be 25 million for the year. That's what's been out there. That's what our expectations are. We're not moving off of that. I clearly understand the reasons for your question and so forth, but right now, we're going to stay in that range. I will tell you the things you mentioned are one of the reasons we have growing confidence in meeting our guidance and continuing to perform total company and in the wireless margin area very well.","Operator","Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two things on wireline and, I guess, the economy overall. Can you give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of economic trends, both in terms of business and then in also consumer housing? And also how do you think about U-verse growth going forward? What we hear from some people is concern that video slows down now that your addressable markets are sort of fully covered. Should we think about this 200,000 video adds sort of continuing at a pace that it's been for the last year? Or should that slow down from here?","John Joseph Stephens","Thanks, Phil. From an economy standpoint, I would suggest to you that we -- as I mentioned before, we've not assumed any lift in the economy throughout this year. And quite frankly, to date, I don't believe we've seen it. I think you know very well about the current status of unemployment metrics, interest rates, business starts. But I will tell you that a couple of things have gone on in the sense of we continue to see large business willing to invest in strategic services and the efficiencies they bring. And the uptick in the strategic services revenue growth year-over-year at 19% gives us confidence that, that's going to continue. So businesses are willing to invest in those new next-generation products and services and efficiency. On the consumer side, specifically in the mobile area, I think our results speak for themselves in the sense of when you offer a good quality product, your consumer, customer's not only willing to you come to you but willing to stay with you. And we've had great results there. On the U-verse side, we continue to be optimistic about our growth for the video product. As we mentioned, for those markets we're in longer than 42 months, we're at a 27% and growing penetration rate, much closer to the 16% on an overall basis right now. So I think it's obvious that there's more opportunity. But in addition to that, we've been very pleased by the broadband additions that have been available through the U-verse platform, over 700,000 additions to U-verse broadband in the quarter. And those not only help our consumer business but also help our small business customers. So that's our approach and that's how we're looking to that transition and the securing of that customer base with high-speed broadband.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. For your 200,000 adds this quarter, would you say you're limited by sort of demand or by the ability of your installed base to go out and do the work?","John Joseph Stephens","I will tell you to get to the 200,000, our install team did a great job in coordinating with our sales team to not only get that level of installs completed but to do it in an efficient basis. And so I would suggest to you that it's a positive response for the quarter in the sense of the coordination and the achievement. And quite frankly, I expect that type of performance and that type of cooperation to continue. It proved to be very successful for us in the first quarter. And I know the teams involved believe that and are going to continue that. So I wouldn't look to any, if you will, governor or limiter on either side.","Operator","And next, we go to Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And just a follow-up on John Hodulik's question. John, maybe do you think the handset policies though are going to be impactful? I know you're sticking to your 25 million upgrade. But do you think they're meaningful and maybe the timing of that impact? And then maybe the same thing on the wireless pricing front. I know you've made some pricing moves here. Have you seen much impact yet in the quarter? Or when do you maybe [indiscernible] start to hit the revenue statement? And lastly, on the pricing moves, do you think you have any other pricing moves out there over the next 12 months? Or you're in a pretty good spot at this point?","John Joseph Stephens","Let me try to respond to it and I'll ask Ralph to add to it as he can so capably do. First of all, we won't talk about any pricing initiatives going forward. Those are things that we wouldn't discuss on this type of call or publicly at all. With regard to the pricing changes we've had, we had one that came in at the end of January with regard to our tiered data plans. And while that went into effect, it had a very minor impact in the first quarter and it will come in as people renew their plans. So the impacts of it will be spread over many quarters. That gives us optimism that we'll continue to see the benefits and growing benefits. But it won't give us an immediate -- and it did not give us an immediate benefit in the first quarter. Secondly, the change in the upgrade fees went into effect in March. And so we saw very little impact in the first quarter. We will see that throughout the year, but it is in place now. So we will see it for the full quarter in the second quarter and there forward. With regard to the handset policy, yes, I believe it will have a meaningful impact on us in managing those handset costs. But I think it's a very reasonable policy in comparison to the marketplace and will provide us the opportunity to continue to not only attract but to retain customers.","Ralph de la Vega","Yes. Tim, what I can add in terms of the pricing from a sales point of view is that we haven't seen any significant impact to any of the pricing moves that we've made. Our sales team continues to sell well. We have great traffic in our stores and we're very pleased with where that situation stands. In terms of the handset policy, I think John said it all. But I do want to clarify that we typically expect handset upgrade volumes to fluctuate when there are new devices in the marketplace. They go up and down and they'll be subject to that. That's no different than what we have seen in the past, but we feel really good about the forecast that we gave you for flat smartphone sales year-over-year at this point.","Operator","And we go to David Barden with Bank of America.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two, if I could. Just first, maybe, Ralph, as we think about the second half coming up here, in the second half of 2010, AT&T took a lot of actions to lock down a good portion of the subscriber base to ensure that there wasn't a big market share swing with the launch of the Verizon iPhone. We're going to be coming up on the second anniversary of that in the second half of this year. And as you think about kind of more expensive upgrade policies and more expensive tiered plans, what is your game plan for kind of tackling the risk of churn maybe in the second half of the year as those guys come up for renewal? And then the second question would be maybe for John, on the U-verse kind of overhaul, you guys talked about in the rural markets making a big push, especially in small business to upgrade from DSL to U-verse. We've seen big swings, 700,000-plus U-verse Internet minus 600,000 DSL. How far through this process are we? How is that going to kind of evolve over the rest of the year?","Ralph de la Vega","Yes. Dave, this is Ralph. Let me just try to address the first part of the question. I think what we're doing to address any concern in the second half of the year is what we normally do with the basics. And I really love where our basics are in this business in that our network is expanding with 4G capability. It keeps getting better. Other people are saying it, customers are noticing it. You see that in our churn numbers, both for total postpaid and iPhone. So I think all the fundamentals are moving in the right direction. And I know we're going to get better on the network side. I also can tell you that I said briefly that we're working on the customer experience. I'm very proud that our retail team in the last several quarters have been ranked #1 by Nielsen in terms of their willingness to recommend in our retail stores. Just an incredible progress being made there by Paul Roth and the retail team. And so a combination of those 2 things is the best that we can do to ensure continued success, continued low churn, that is to give customers great service, both from a network point of view and from a customer service point of view. And we're very proud of those -- the progress that we've made in both of those areas.","John Joseph Stephens","David, if I could add to what Ralph said. We had a significant growth in smartphones. We're up to 40 million -- over 40 million of our postpaid customers on smartphones. And I think the percentage is around 88% of those are on business or FamilyTalk plans. So while Ralph's got greater activity going on with regard to customer care, the customer rules approach and we have  great developments in the network, we also have great pricing packages that we think customers will choose to stay because they're getting great bargains, either in our FamilyTalk or our BusinessTalk plans. David, with regard to your question on U-verse, where we are seeing this is in maybe the urban markets where our U-verse is built out. We have made significant progress in the area. Our broadband U-verse base is about -- it's just under 6 million customers today. And as we mentioned, we grew over 700,000 in the quarter. So we're seeing a quick migration, which gives us confidence that we can compete with all broadband providers on speed and price and quality of service. We would expect that this transformation, which has accelerated over the last year, will continue. And so we are optimistic about continuing to shift our 16 million broadband customers from legacy DSL products and services to our next-generation U-verse high-speed broadband.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was just trying to consider the prospects for future postpaid ARPU growth. Can you discuss how ARPU's performing for customers who have had a smartphone for 1 year or 2 years? And also, are you seeing a significant difference in data usage and spending for those smartphone customers that are on a 4G-capable device versus a 3G-capable device?","Ralph de la Vega","Mike, let me give you some thoughts on the future of postpaid ARPU. I feel very good about the guidance that we've given you to look for the 2% range. And I think we mentioned on the call that when you look at phone-only ARPU, that's actually already north of 2%. And what I really like about what we see with customers these days, and I want to make sure everybody gets this, our research has demonstrated to us that whereas a couple of years ago, customers are actually afraid to use some of these smartphones because of the technology, they were not sure they could deal with them. Two years hence, the feedback that we're getting when we do customer research on these smartphones say that customers now feel that these devices make their lives easier. That's a huge, huge change in the attitude of customers. So they're accepting smartphones in numbers that we have never seen before. And the good thing about that, which is why I feel good about the trends for postpaid ARPU, is that smartphones have ARPU that is 90% higher than quick messaging devices or feature phones. So customers are loving these devices for their ease-of-use now. I think the ecosystem, the combination of the various OSs, the application developers and enabling networks that we're building are making it real easy, very low-latency networks, very great speeds are all leading to better usage. When you talk about better usage, then we see ARPU growth opportunities. And it's a little bit too early to tell you what we're seeing in the trends between 3G and 4G. But generally, when we make faster networks available, we see that customers' usage grows. And that's why I like so much our position on tiered data plans, that we have over 60% of our customers now on tiered data plans. So if they want to use more data, they can use more data, and we'll see ARPU and revenue growth as a result of that.","John Joseph Stephens","Well, if I could add, I want to make sure everyone's aware, the 60% on tiered data plans is a change from 12 million customers first quarter last year to almost 25 million customers today. So it's actually double that base. And what we're seeing is 70% of those customers are taking the higher tiered plans. So as Ralph eloquently laid out the increase in usage, his team has also structured the arrangements with the customers that there will be [indiscernible] associated with that increased growth. So we feel like we're very well positioned there.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up. Are you seeing a significant upgrade rate for those to take low tier and then eventually move to higher tier? Or is the 70% really just when they first pick their rate plans, 70% just choose the larger bucket upfront?","John Joseph Stephens","I think we are seeing some movement upfront, but we do see a fairly large take rate on the larger buckets on an upfront basis.","Ralph de la Vega","Yes, I think that the nature of these networks, Mike, because of their speed and their latency and the usage, I think customers will trend to use the higher-tiered plans as they go to the higher-speed networks.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Chaplin with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jonathan Chaplin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So 2 quick questions, if I may. First, sorry to hop on the upgrade rate, but it's a key driver of margins for you guys for this year. So 7% is a phenomenal rate to start off the year. Looking at the trends last year, the upgrade rate improved in 2Q and 3Q. Should we expect that same trend to continue this year? Or are we looking at an unusually low upgrade rate in 1Q after a very heavy upgrade rate in 4Q? And then the second question is just if you could give us a little bit more context around the split for CapEx between wireless and wireline for the year? It looked like wireless came in a little heavier than expected this quarter. Wireline was a little lighter. I'm wondering if there were any anomalies in there or whether that's going to be a trend for the whole year as well.","John Joseph Stephens","Thanks, John. And John, we're not going to give a breakdown by quarter of any expectations with regard to the upgrade rate. I think we'll stick with flat year-over-year of smartphone sales, the 25 million number. So hopefully, that's helpful to you. With regard to the CapEx side, there's the 3 buckets that we have. It's really the wireless, which took about 1\/2 of our total CapEx budget, that's the direct wireless spend. Our wireline bucket, which took slightly less than 1\/2. And then some of our shared services, or if you will, dual-use projects, where we have shared usage by both wireless and the wireline business. I will tell you on the 2 point -- about 1\/2 of the CapEx, you see we continue forward on a timely basis in line with our expectations on our LTE buildout. That's going well. We're optimistic about that, and quite frankly, on the continuing service quality and expansion of our capabilities to our overall network in wireless. I think those results are showing up in churn as very positive. And I think that's what Ralph was referring to before. But that's the basis for the spend.","Jonathan Chaplin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And so should we expect -- I think guidance is for CapEx being roughly flat overall. Should we expect roughly 1\/2 of that to be wireless for the full year? Or does wireless ramp through the course of the year?","John Joseph Stephens","I think it will be that level or slightly more as we continue to move forward with our LTE buildout and other capacity buildout, and quite frankly, as we've completed our U-verse basic build and initial passage of the 30 million homes.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike McCormack with Nomura Securities.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Ralph, can you just maybe comment on, you made a few comments about the ARPU story, but we've seen a reacceleration of growth quarter-on-quarter if we're looking at the data side, and that's before the price increase. And then secondly, on the voice side of the ARPU equation, still declining pretty rapidly, although the year-over-year rate of decline is the same as we saw last quarter, which is the first stabilization we've seen. Maybe just walk us through your thoughts on what's happening on the voice side? What, if any, you have, for plans on changing plan structure to deal with voice or text migration or just lowering those buckets? And then final question, Ralph, if you would, thinking about the lower upgrade percentage this quarter, is there some correlation between smartphone penetration? Meaning, you've got enough people with high-end phones, but they just don't upgrade? Is there something to be said that, that can provide a benefit going forward?","Ralph de la Vega","Okay. Mike, let me address the first one. I think that data is going to continue to drive our ARPU growth. And quite frankly, I think that it's hard for us to see a cap on that. I think that with the customer demand, the great applications, the great content that we see and the fantastic network capabilities that we're building to allow customers to consume that content, that's going to continue to drive growth for the foreseeable future. In terms of voice, what we're trying to do is stabilize voice. And we're beginning to see that we anticipate that voice will stabilize. We saw a little bit of an impact when we launched our free mobile to any mobile. But we anticipate that, that will stabilize. And then ARPU growth will continue to drive -- our overall ARPU growth data will drive our overall ARPU growth. And then in terms of the smartphone penetration, I don't have any additional insights that I can give you in terms of the higher end of the market. But typically, upgrades are triggered when there's a new device that people love in the market. And that's why I mentioned that it'll go up and down by quarters, depending on what the customer needs are. But we feel very good about where we are right now and we always give the customers the choice. We think we have a terrific lineup in every operating system, including the new Microsoft OS. And so we feel pretty comfortable that we've got a great capability to offer customers.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Ralph, I'm sorry, just on the voice commentary. I mean, is there a huge degradation for you guys if you just moved into an unlimited voice and text world? And I mean, clearly, the data part of that equation is much more costly from a spectrum and network utilization standpoint.","Ralph de la Vega","Well, we continue to look at those kind of options, Mike. We always try to look at that, and quite frankly, also continue to look at data, and how we can have data packages that address this changing trend that I mentioned with data usage. And we will address those. But I don't think it's appropriate to release those details on this call. But rest assured that we're looking at the things that you mentioned, as well as others, to address the changing trends in this industry.","Susan Johnson","Okay. I think we have time for just one more question.","Operator","And that'll be from Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe first, Ralph, you've talked a lot historically about the need to add spectrum. But when you look at Verizon potentially at this point having to commit to sell some spectrum in order to buy additional spectrum, what's your interpretation for AT&T as we go forward? Do you sense an increasing risk that you have to think about things the same way as you approach spectrum deals? And then John, obviously very strong buyback numbers in the quarter, which has pretty significant benefits to the EPS stream over the course of the year and the ability to grow that. Would you expect this accelerated level of buyback activity to continue from here?","Ralph de la Vega","Jason, in the spectrum area, I don't think that we need to abide by what somebody else may have to deal with because that's a very specific situation to a particular carrier. So no, I don't think we should feel like we have to do something similar should more spectrum become available.","John Joseph Stephens","Jason, with regard to the buyback question that you asked, first and foremost, we are pleased with the amount of buybacks we were able to achieve in the first quarter. We had good market conditions, we had good cash flows. We're ending the quarter in a good cash position with over $2 billion of cash in the balance sheet. And we were able to do that while retiring some more expensive debt during the quarter and calling some more expensive debt that we had. So all in all, we're pleased with what we've been able to do. We will continue buying back shares throughout the year. We are confident in where the company is going and our growth opportunities. The pace at which we'll buy back is going to depend on many things: market conditions, continuing strong cash flows, financial flexibility and maintaining strong financial flexibility and our debt ratios. All of those things are in very good shape right now as we speak today and at the end of the quarter. So we're very pleased with that. But those things will continue to be monitored as we go through the year and will guide our judgment on buybacks.","Before we close, I'd like to quickly summarize the highlights from this quarter. We're off to a really good start this year, which gives us confidence as we look ahead. We delivered strong financial metrics, strong mobile data growth and we continue to see encouraging trends and performance in wireline. One more item that I'd like to bring to your attention. Starting with our next quarter, we're going to be moving this call up 30 minutes. So we will be discussing our second quarter results starting at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time or 8:30 a.m. Central Time on July 24. That's it for us. I'd like to thank Ralph for joining us once again and especially for bringing such great mobile results to the call. And thank you for being on the call. And as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a great day.","Susan Johnson","Thanks, everyone. Have a great day. Thank you, John and Ralph.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T's Executive TeleConference Service.

For the conference, all the participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","With that being said, I'll turn the conference over to Susan Johnson. Please go ahead.","Susan Johnson","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. It's great to have you with us this morning. I\u2019m Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. John will provide an update with perspective on the quarter, then we\u2019ll take your questions.","Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, at www.att.com\/investor.relations. Okay, I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 2. This presentation and comments may contain forward-looking statements. They're subject to risks. Results may differ materially. Details are on our SEC filings, and on AT&T\u2019s website.","Before I turn the call over to John, let me quickly cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 3. As a reminder, we completed the sale of AT&T\u2019s Advertising Solutions, and AT&T Interactive business on May 8. Our reported results for this quarter and prior period still include Ad Solutions\u2019 results, which are not treated as discontinued operations, given our 47% continuing equity ownership in YP Holdings.","Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.66, a 10% increase both sequentially and year-over-year. The fundamental trends in our business continue to be solid. When you exclude the Advertising Solutions business, consolidated revenues were up 2% year-over-year. Thanks to strong mobile data growth, gains in U-verse, and advanced wireline business offering.","We had our best consolidated margin in four years, with operating income expansion in wireless and wireline, both sequentially and year-over-year, and cash flow continues to be strong. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled $9.7 billion. Free cash flow was $5.1 billion. And our share repurchase program continued in the second quarter. In the quarter, we bought back almost 76 million shares for $2.5 billion.","With that quick overview, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?","John J. Stephens","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. It's great to have you with us on this call. As you\u2019ve seen, we had a very good quarter, and it was very straight forward, all about executing our strategy and growing the business. In wireless, you can clearly see the benefits of our mobile Internet strategy. This has resulted in strong wireless data revenue growth, almost 19%, record high service margins with our EBITDA service margins hitting 45%, and our lowest churn ever, postpaid, prepaid in total.","In wireline, the transformation from legacy voice and data products to advanced data services continues at a solid pace. U-verse video and broadband continue to scale, while driving the strongest consumer revenue growth that we\u2019ve seen in years. And we kept margins steady and improved wireline operating income, both sequentially and year-over-year even with few signs of a business recovery. This performance drove solid financial results. We grew revenue, expanded margins and increased earnings, and cash flow was very strong.","We also took steps to make our balance sheet even stronger, recall debt and reduce future interest cost by refinancing at favorable rates. And as Susan mentioned, we continued our share buyback program, we\u2019ve returned more than $5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter, and close to $10 billion year-to-date. All in all, a very positive quarter, which puts us in a great position heading into the second half of the year.","With that as background, let\u2019s now take a look at detailed results starting with the consolidated revenues on Slide 5. As you know, the sale of our Advertising Solutions business was completed in early May, so this second quarter did not have a full impact of Ad Solutions revenues. And because we retained an equity interest in the business, we cannot restate past quarters. Even so, on a reported basis, consolidated revenues increased year-over-year, and if you exclude Ad Solutions from all periods, they were up $600 million or 2%.","The drivers are: Strong mobile Internet growth, U-verse revenue growth of more than 38% and continued growth in strategic business services. When excluding Ad Solutions, 80% of our revenue came from wireless, wireline data, and managed services in the second quarter. That's up from 77% a year ago, and 74% two years ago.","Revenues from these growth areas, these next-generation products and services were up about $1.3 billion or more than 5% in the quarter. We've made remarkable progress in transforming our business in the last few years, and we expect this mix shift to continue.","Now let's look at Wireless, starting on Slide 6. We have confidence in our mobile Internet strategy, our network and the ability of our team to execute and compete. After our second quarter performance, that confidence has only been reinforced. Margins were at record levels.","As you've seen, our service EBITDA margin for the quarter was 45%, and churn was at record lows, revenue growth was solid, thanks to gains in data revenues. This drove our 14th consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU growth, and phone-only ARPU was up more than 2% growing off a much higher ARPU base than anyone else.","We now have more than 43 million smartphone subscribers on our network, or about 62% of our postpaid base, and smartphone sales continue to be strong. We also continue to bring more subscribers on to our network with usage-based data plans. It's been two years since we introduced these tiered plans, and we now have 27 million or about two-thirds of all smartphone subscribers on these plans, with most choosing the higher price plans.","Let's talk more about churn and net adds; details are on Slide 7. Postpaid churn hit an all-time low, dropping below 1% for the first time ever. We also had our best ever total in prepaid churn. There are a number of reasons for this, the quality and depth of our network, and improved customer experience, our focus on customer-friendly plans, and the fact that we have 88% of our subscribers on FamilyTalk or business plans. For all these reasons, customers are choosing to stay with AT&T.","We also continue to add new customers, 1.3 million in the quarter that includes gains in every customer category. Postpaid net adds were 320,000, an increase from the first quarter; prepaid added 92,000 subscribers. A solid reseller quarter netted us 472,000 new subscribers, and we have 382,000 connected device net adds as well. These results are tied directly to the performance of our network, and the quality of the customer experience.","We now cover 275 million POPs with our 4G network, with more than a third of our postpaid smartphone subscribers using a 4G device, and almost 90% of our data traffic is on enhanced backhaul. This drives higher speeds for our customers and greater efficiency in our network.","Our 4G LTE build continues on track, and we now have LTE in 47 markets. Record low churn and strong sales tell the story of our wireless business. New customers are choosing AT&T and existing ones continue to stay with us in record numbers.","You can also see the strong performance in our wireless data results and in our smartphone and branded computing sales, which are on Slide 8. Data revenues were $6.4 billion, up $1 billion year-over-year. Data revenues are now at $25 billion annualized revenue stream, growing at almost 19%.","Smartphone sales were solid, and we continue to build our subscriber base with 5.1 million smartphones sold in the quarter. Smartphone subscribers now number 43 million, and make up 62% of our total postpaid base. But smartphones accounted for 77% of postpaid sales during the quarter, showing continuing opportunity for growth. And when you look at our total smartphone base, we've added 9 million high-value smartphone customers in just the last 12 months.","We also continue to activate more iPhones than any other carrier. We had 3.7 million this quarter with about 22% of those subscribers new to AT&T. These customers are choosing AT&T for a reason, we provide the best mobile Internet experience on the nation\u2019s largest 4G network.","Branded computing sales also drive data growth. Sales continue to be strong in the second quarter. We had 496,000 net adds in the quarter, we now have 6.3 million branded computing subscribers, tablets and tethering plans on the network. And that's up more than 50% in the past year.","Last week, we announced our new shared data plans. We believe this will drive even more branded computing subscribers onto our network. But perhaps the best story this quarter is our wireless margins, details are on slide 9.","We\u2019ve done a lot of work to improve our service margin and network is paying off. We\u2019ve had our best wireless EBITDA service margin ever, 45%, but to put that in context, two years ago our margins were about 200 basis points lower, and this quarter we sold 1.2 million more smartphones than we did that. That helps show the value of our smartphone base, who\u2019s ARPU was twice that of non-smartphone devices, plus smartphone subscribers have lower churn and strong data growth.","We\u2019ve also taken several other steps that have a positive impact on margins. This includes our new upgrade policy, it\u2019s been more than a year since we implemented the changes and we\u2019re now seeing the impact. Our new data pricing plans we announced earlier this year also help drive revenues while offering customers more data, and our continued focus on overall cost management.","All this helps explain the strong growth we saw this quarter with our operating income, almost 18% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. We are pleased with our wireless results this quarter. Our entire team had another outstanding wireless performance.","Now, let\u2019s move to wireline, starting with business, which you can see on slide 10. Business wireline revenue was down 1.5% this quarter that compares favorably to a decline of 4.1% in the year ago second quarter. This business continues to be a multi-fast in its story that\u2019s playing out in a cautious economic environment. Customers that can\u2019t continue to invest are doing so, but others are holding off positions because they are more hesitant to spend in uncertain economic times and small business formations continue to lag even below last year\u2019s numbers, you can see this in our results.","Large businesses or enterprise customers continue to invest in advanced data services. This has led to improving revenues even without any lift from the economy. In fact, we\u2019re in our first enterprise revenue growth in more than four years. The growth was small, but still a positive trend.","At the other end of the spectrum, our small business revenue growth was down slightly sequentially once again challenged by the lack of new business starts. And our wholesale and government sector saw revenue pressure as some customers reduced legacy data connections.","We continue to see strong growth in strategic business services, that\u2019s products such as Ethernet, VPNs, and application services, which were up 13.5% for the quarter. This would have been even higher without the impact of foreign exchange. And IP data revenues were up more than 5% year-over-year as well. This shows the businesses continue to invest in efficiency and in advanced data services even in this tough economic climate.","We also held business wireline margins steady by doing a good job of keeping expenses in check. A positive growth in enterprise revenues is an encouraging sign, but we are facing continuing economic headwinds. There is a great opportunity in this business, especially as we continue to transition to advanced data services. But based on the current business environment, the return to growth in revenues, they take longer than we originally anticipated.","You should also see the transformation to IT data in our consumer results, details on slide 11. We had another strong quarter with our U-verse services. So strong in fact, that we are seeing our best growth in consumer wireline revenues in more than four years, 1.7%. U-verse has transformed wireline consumer. We now have 6.8 million total U-verse subscribers at both video and high speed Internet. That includes 4.1 million video subscribers with a 155,000 added in the second quarter.","And we added more than a half a million U-verse broadband subs in the quarter as well. This includes new high speed broadband small business subscribers. And U-verse revenue growth has been amazing. It\u2019s now a $9 billion annualized revenue stream, growing at about 38% year-over-year and we believe there is a lot of room for further growth. Overall video penetration is at 17% and continues to grow.","Now let us look at margins on slide 12. For the second quarter, consolidated margins were up both sequentially and year-over-year on track with the expectations we set out in January. Our consolidated operating margin was 21.6%, that\u2019s up thanks to strong performance in wireless and consumer wireline revenues, our continued focus on improving the customer experience, that\u2019s everything from giving the customers more choices, more ways to interact with us and doing a business in a way that customer prefers.","Wireline operating income margins also expanded both sequentially and year-over-year at 13.8%, that\u2019s in line with our guidance of stable wireline margins for the year. Helping offset declines in legacy services were growth in U-verse and advanced data, solid cost management and execution of one AT&T initiatives. We continue to keep a sharp eye on cost efficiencies and see more opportunity as we move ahead.","Along with solid margins, we continue to have strong cash flows and we have taken several steps to improve our capital structure. Our summary is on slide 13. In the first half of the year, cash from operations totaled $17.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $8.9 billion with more than half of that invested in the wireless business.","Free cash flow before dividends was $8.6 billion and dividend payments totaled $5.2 billion. In terms of uses of cash, total debt is down $1.2 billion in the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.4% and a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.42%.","We have been very active in the debt market taking advantage of favorable interest rates and our strong cash flows. We have paid off some debt early. We have called $7 billion in debt so far this year. We now have no debt due for the remainder of this year and only $3.5 billion due in 2013. At the same time, we continue to pursue share buybacks. In the second quarter, we repurchased almost 76 million shares. So far, we have bought back more than 143 million shares or about half of our 300 million share authorization. That totaled $4.6 billion of stock.","When you look at both dividends and the stock buyback, we returned nearly $10 billion to our shareholders in the last six months. And as always, any shares we purchase could include open market purchases, structured programs such as accelerated share repurchase and other programs including 10b5-1 plans where appropriate.","The quarter\u2019s performance demonstrates the strength of our capital structure. Our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to both invest and retire debt. our balance sheet is sound, our debt metric is solid, and we continue to return value to shareholders.","Now, before we get to your questions, let me recap the quarter on slide 14. Our key growth drivers, wireless, data and managed services, now account for 80% of our revenue growing at a more than 5% rate year-over-year. Our mobile Internet strategy continue to click with strong smartphone sales, record low postpaid churn and the best service margins we have ever seen.","U-verse continues to power wireline consumer transforming the business with solid growth and record revenues. We also saw positive enterprise revenue growth even with no lift from the economy and we continue to strengthen our balance sheet while returning substantial value to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.","The transformation of our business took a major step in the quarter with the sale of our Advertising Solutions business and we continue to add to our wireless portfolio through spectrum acquisitions. Put it all together, we had a very strong quarter with continued confidence as we move into the second half of the year.","Susan, that concludes our prepared remarks, I think we are ready for Q&A.","Susan Johnson","","Thank you, John. John, I think we are ready to open it up for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And first, we'll go to line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John C. Hodulik \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Great, thanks. Two quick ones. First, John, just on your comments on the business market, you turned positive on the enterprise side, do you expect that to remain positive going forward and as the slight changes, some incremental weakness on the sort of low end SME side? And then on the buyback, I\u2019d say you guys have made a lot of progress there, do you expect to be substantially complete with the buyback by year-end? Thanks.","John J. Stephens","Morning, John. Thanks for joining the call. Let me take the second question first. With regard to the buyback, two things, we do expect to continue in the marketplace participating in buyback. That will be impacted by market conditions, continued strong cash flows, and the other factors that we spelled out. We have not guided towards when or how much we\u2019ll buyback in any of the future quarters. But I think, as we said at the beginning of the year and on the January call, we are in a position with the cash on the balance sheet with the beginning of the year, and strong cash flows this year that we have an ability to buyback a large part of the [authorized] share repurchase, and we'll continue to monitor that and continue to pursue those opportunities.","On the business side, we do have continued growth in strategic services, and that growth is encouraging to us, but we are seeing business has to be very careful, seems like whether they are hesitant about the elections, about tax law changes, about the federal deficit, they have abilities to spent or encouraged by that, but they are being very careful, we are seeing a lot of no decisions. So we're certainly hopeful to be able to continue our positive enterprise revenue story, but we'll have to prove that as well everybody else. We're still optimistic about our wireline business and believe particularly our business revenues are going to be positive going forward. It just may take as a little bit longer than we would have expressed to you in January.","John C. Hodulik \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Gotcha. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much. Good morning. John, I wonder if you could update us on the status of the review of the rural lines, and also churn investment this quarter, you went through some of the factors driving that. How should we think about churn going forward from here, you had a pretty substantial drop \u2013 is there more room for year-over-year improvements in that or if this is as good as you think you can get to? Thanks.","John J. Stephens","","Morning, Simon. Thank you. First, on question with regard to kind of our strategic initiatives, you\u2019ve seen in the directory sale and the completion of that, we've seen the continued movement on spectrum in 12 acquisitions of smaller acquisitions, why should we close a number of deals that are sitting before the SEC. And I think you\u2019ve seen on \u2013 from the strategy side, our filing was serious where we\u2019re jointly going there to clear up some and improve some usability for some of the WCS spectrum we owned. So, those are parts of the strategy.","We\u2019re continuing our review on the other pieces of our business. And as soon as we have something for sharing, we will, but we are going through that process and we will continue to go through that process. Just want to be careful to make sure we complete that analysis and have a full story for you when we\u2019re ready to share it, Simon.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, because there was some talk of (inaudible) and so forth, but that\u2019s still an option rather than a choice at this stage, is that right?","John J. Stephens","Everything quite frankly at this stage is an option and we are looking at our whole host of different opportunities or different alternatives as you might expect, our shareholders would expect from us.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. On the churn?","John J. Stephens","On the churn side, it was very encouraging. It was not only encouraging on the postpaid, but it was encouraging that it was across the board, we saw improved churn. We are optimistic about our ability to hold onto those kinds of levels and continue to improve it. We will see as we go through some of the seasonality in the business in the second half of the year, how that impacted.","But this is a process that\u2019s been going on for a long time making significant investments over a number of years and improving the quality of our network. And our wireless team, including our business wireless team has put a lot of effort to improving the customer experience. So, yes, our networks getting better but the customer experience is getting a whole lot better, and so we are optimistic that we will be able to move forward building from this positive base.","But as we go on to the second half of the year and a part of the wireless business here that is much more seasonal, we\u2019ll have to work through that and see if we can meet our goals.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Hi, guys, can you hear me?","John J. Stephens","Sure, can.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank John. So let\u2019s just talk about ARPU for a second. Can you tell us if you guys expect any change in trajectory given the new price environment in the third or fourth quarters? And then also do you anticipate change in the reporting methodology over time as tablets dilute revenue per device? Thanks.","John J. Stephens","","Thanks Phil. First and foremost, we think our guidance\u2019s out there, that we get 2% ARPU growth this year. We\u2019re sticking with that. We\u2019re encouraged by \u2013 where we are at on the 1.7% so far this year including all the impacts of high margin, high profit, but lower ARPU data in ten devices and tablets. As we mentioned in the call, our phone-only ARPU was 2% this quarter.","Why we\u2019re optimistic is because of the pricing changes we\u2019ve done with regard to our tier data plans. We\u2019re also encouraged because of what we\u2019ve done with regard to drawing the smartphone base by 9 million subscribers, converting those lower ARPU subscribers that we had last year to smartphones, and generally more ARPU. So we\u2019re encouraged by that. And we\u2019re also encouraged by the fact that there is a lot more usage going on in that structure of tier data customers. We get better additional revenue, people pay for what they use. So we\u2019re sticking with that.","With regard to any shared data plans, we need not expect those to be \u2013 we expect those to be accretive over time. We think the conversion of those is going to be measured over time, part of that is because we\u2019re doing like customer friendly, we believe in the old plans available to our customers and we are not forcing anyone off unlimited or any other plans. So we\u2019re expecting it to transition in, but over time we expect it to be accretive because it will allow, if you will our customers the more they share, the more they are going to save. And I think that will be good for both us and them.","With regard to our reporting activities, right now we're going to stick with our customer based ARPU. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate all of our customer matrix, and all of our financial reporting and we\u2019ll update that starting with next year as we always do. We are having a robust discussion about what\u2019s the best way to provide the information to analysts, to the readers of our financial statement, to our owners, and so that\u2019s ongoing. But at this time we do not expect to change, if we do, it likely will be with the New Year.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks John.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Chaplin of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Chaplin \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","","Thanks, couple of quick ones, if I could. So firstly, it looks like your smartphone sales this year are trending well below where they were at this point last year. I'm wondering if that means we are on track to do even less than the 25 million smartphone sales that you expected for the year or if you are just expecting a blockbuster fourth-quarter with the new iPhone launch?","And then I'm just wondering if you could give us some context around what to expect for EBITDA margins? Given that trend, it seems like we should see an even lower upgrade rate next quarter, so sort of a seasonally up quarter for upgrades and with the iPhone launch you should be even low next quarter, but expect margins to be even higher? And then I'm wondering what they could potentially be in the fourth quarter as well? Thank you.","John J. Stephens","","Okay, Jonathan, good to hear it from you. a couple of things, one on the smartphone upgrades and sales, a couple of things, one, we are seeing our policy kick in, change in our policy we told you about last year, we told you we\u2019re going to grandfather our customers in and that\u2019s now taking hold, and I think you\u2019re seeing some effects of that. Quite frankly, I think in the first six months, our outsourcing effects of what would be considered a very healthy upgrade cycle fourth quarter of last year, particularly when the old upgrade policy of the shorter timeframe was still in place.","So I think we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re getting some of the benefits of what was upgraded in the fourth quarter last year is \u2013 helping lower or slow some of the upgrades in the first and second quarter of this year. We're not going to give guidance on specific EBITDA margins or upgrade cycles for the second half of the year. we are going to \u2013 we are sticking with our upgrade cycles being flat year-over-year. I openly recognized the fact that the map of the upgrade process is that we are running at a rate, trend rate for the first two quarters below that. but as we get these devices and have the seasonality of the holiday selling season, we will see an uptick and we\u2019re comfortable with sticking with that guidance that\u2019s out there.","Jonathan Chaplin \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens","As far as EBITDA margins, team did great \u2013 feel we\u2019re good about where they are at and about all the items that the actions that the team took to get there and there I feel we\u2019re comfortable about the fact that their \u2013 on solid business focused, customer focused strategies, things that we can do at the end, but we\u2019re going to stick with our margin guidance that we\u2019re going to grow EBITDA service margins year-over-year and that we expect that to be greater than 40%, and I understand how the comparisons look today, but we\u2019re going to stick with the guidance we\u2019ve done out there.","Jonathan Chaplin \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","John, one point of clarification quickly, when you say sticking with guidance on smartphones, do you mean, you\u2019re still sticking to 25 million smartphone sales for the year. The upgrade rate has to be down year-over-year right?","John J. Stephens","Yeah, so John, you make a great point. I appreciate the clarification. I think it will be \u2013 the year would be flat year-over-year at 25 million.","Jonathan Chaplin \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Got it.","John J. Stephens","So your comment is correct.","Jonathan Chaplin \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Got it. Thank you so much.","John J. Stephens","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll go to Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great, thanks, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up, there is obviously you\u2019re getting a lot of questions on sort of the upgrade cycle out there, and John you just gave a lot of good data points. I think people probably still wrestle with, is this the result of policy changes versus is this just new handset availability or lack thereof, maybe another way of attacking this is, are you seeing notable changes in the percent of subscribers that are eligible for an upgrade at this point, but are postponing decisions? Maybe that would be helpful as sort of gauge to what to expect of the next several of quarters. And then just second quick question, the union deal you recently signed, I\u2019m just wondering if you talk us through benefits from that deal and how they may change the cost structure? Thanks.","John J. Stephens","So with regard to the new \u2013 the change in the trend for upgrades, let me deal with it this way. First of all, we\u2019re into one full quarter here with regard to \u2013 this is the first quarter where the upgrade policy change has really impacted us. And as I mentioned before, the fourth quarter last year was unusually high, so there is some impact I think on the first and second quarter from that. So it\u2019s early in this process, but clearly, we believe that the upgrade policy is impacting \u2013 the new upgrade policy is impacting upgrade cycles and it\u2019s helping us control that process and improve margins.","Secondly, there maybe some impact quite frankly of the change in upgrade fee. It was a small change, but we \u2013 it was an increase of $18. I can\u2019t suggest you that we can measure that.","Third, there maybe some impact from customers deciding to wait until the new device comes out. I can\u2019t speak to that, it\u2019s too early at this time. I assume we\u2019ll know that they will have some better insight in that after the device may come out. So I guess the key for us, (inaudible) walk away with this is, it appears our policy is working, it appears our plans are working, we need to continue down this path. But when you look at the upgrade numbers and then tie in the churn, I feel really good about the policies are [working] in a customer appreciative or a customer friendly way.","So with regard to our recently announced tentative agreement with both the Midwest and our legacy T employees, I\u2019d just suggest you that we\u2019re appreciative of their leaderships bargaining in good faith, we are appreciative of the efforts that both teams made in coming to a resolution. And quite frankly, I want to point out the resolution in these contracts is right about the same week that we resolved these contracts three year ago. So it\u2019s really good to have a quality working relationship with your employees and their representatives.","We will let the details come out from the union and we will let them go through the process of ratification with the employees, which we are very optimistic about. But needless to say, we think it\u2019s a fair deal for some valid employees, but we also think it continues to make a rational progress in not only the way it struck, but the benefit and the cost structure. So yeah, it\u2019s a good fair deal and it gets our employees interest and our shareholders interest aligned. More details to come out and hopefully we\u2019ll have an announcement and ratification coming soon we\u2019re hopeful for that.","One other thing I want to add to is, if we're fortunate to get these, which we expect, we\u2019re fortunate to get these contracts ratified between these two contracts and the IBEW extension we've signed a few weeks ago that would bring 25,000 or more than 25,000 of our employees that whose contract terms are coming due this year under new contracts. So we\u2019re really making good progress on that front.","And we look forward to working with the representatives from the West and the East, and quite frankly the Southeast in coming to resolutions on contracts with them. We're [pause] about this \u2013 we have a lot of good people here, and we're looking forward to keeping them working.","Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks John.","Operator","Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. John, maybe just a follow-up on the labor point. I was surprised to see that the headcount was down a little over 4% in the quarter that\u2019s one of the bigger headcount changes we've seen in a few years, and I guess, if you could elaborate a little bit about what the \u2013 where that \u2013 where that was going on, and what the game plan behind the headcount is, both this past quarter and maybe for the rest of the year.","And then just second, we\u2019ve talked a lot about \u2013 and potential have a benefit down the road for an AT&T. Are you guys able to share any statistics right now about for instance what percentage of the base would actually, could actually generate over hedge either now or in the near future, the next year or two. I guess one of the questions everyone has is, we hear about the averages being large, but a lot of those people are still on a limited plan. If your average customer is only using 300 megabits, 400 megabits or 500 megabits a month and that\u2019s growing 30%, 40% for the next few years, it could be many, many years before these tier plans kind of generate profits. Could you help kind of clear that issue up for us? Thanks.","John J. Stephens","Okay. First and foremost, on the employee count information if we could, we\u2019d like to make sure we\u2019re \u2013 if you will doing comparative numbers here. We did pull out the Ad Solutions employees from our employee base because of the transaction. And I think that maybe the biggest \u2013 if we\u2019re talking about a 4% change, it would have to be that, that explains the difference and that was probably \u2013 we\u2019re probably be close 3% of that 4% change.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay.","John J. Stephens","","So, I am not sure of which \u2013 if anybody think that really the impact of what we\u2019re talking about. With regard to tier data, understanding your question, I guess a couple of points. One, we\u2019ve gone from zero to 27 million in two years. So, we\u2019re pleased and it appears our customers are pleased with it. Two, customers are choosing the higher tier plans, whether that would be the 3 gig or the 5 gig plans with \u2013 and a clip of more than 70%. And so we\u2019re doing well and they are choosing to have that usage available to them without additional charges. That\u2019s all happening in this churn environment.","So once again, it appears that\u2019s all going well. We don\u2019t give usage base and we\u2019re not going to give breakage information out. But I can tell you, we\u2019re also comfortable with this because of our recent changes to the buckets where we increase the available amount of data to them with a slight increase in price. And the fact that that\u2019s been taken into account with low churn, is just another encouraging piece that we can serve customers well and still get ourselves set up for revenues that are going to be tied to usage, which will then be tied to our capital requirements and a really profitable situation.","On the unlimited, I really think the unlimited is a kind of issue that we\u2019ve really handled. And specifically, we\u2019ve handled it because of our bit rate management program. And so those extraordinary consumers have been addressed and the process is in place for more than a few months now. And quite frankly, once again, I look to churn as a indicator of how that\u2019s being accepted and how that\u2019s impacting our customer base, and we feel good about the progress we\u2019ve made there.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Okay. Thanks, John. Yeah, I think that that change in the employees was going to be the difference \u2013 the directory, so I appreciate your help. Thanks, John.","John J. Stephens","","No problem.","Operator","","And next, we\u2019ll go to line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Timothy Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","","Thanks. Good morning, guys. John, I seem to beat a dead horse here, but on smartphones the $25 million in sales maybe a touch more color on the outlook. Do you think, you can continue to control that over the next couple of years and at the same type of pace and I guess the latest of that with the upgrade fees and what you\u2019re seeing around churn? Do you think, you can possibly still raise prices there maybe up to around the $50 price point or so? And then lastly on the handsets, it does seem like the \u2013 all the subsidy is coming down I guess for the non-iPhone devices the average selling prices seem to be coming down for Android devices. I\u2019m wondering if you are seeing any benefit from that? Thanks.","John J. Stephens","Yeah. So Tim, I guess just probably more generally than you prefer, I mean the handset as the smartphones and the subsidy issue is day-in and day-out management issue, management intention and focus. So we\u2019re looking at all kinds of things.","I would suggest to you that we believe that this is just the first quarter of the upgrade policy change being fully in effect. and so we are optimistic about our ability to continue to manage it, to measure it, to provide customers, not only to enforce it but also to provide customers the opportunity to buyout, if they want to upgrade before their cycle times. and we are in place to do that. So we\u2019re optimistic about the ability to do that. now, we\u2019ll have to do that for ourselves, for our shareholders, for the analysts. But we believe we\u2019re on track to do that.","secondly, with regard to the environment as new handsets come out, as things get more competitive, we believe there will be more rationale pricing in those \u2013 in that market and we\u2019ll be able to either through our own disciplined actions of pricing [tags] or our own disciplined actions of seeking out more cost advantageous devices. We need to continue to focus on lowering the costs or managing the costs of those subsidies.","At the same time, we have some very good customers who are willing and who desire, who want handsets, and are willing to entering the contracts and work with us and provide us good monthly ARPUs that we\u2019re going to be more than happy to continue work with them and continue to hold on to that customer base.","So it\u2019s a day in, day out focus of management. But it\u2019s going to be one that we\u2019re going to play out in quarters to come, just to prove to you that we can continue this good progress we\u2019ve made this year, and specifically this quarter.","Timothy Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was curious if you could talk a bit more about, how do you think about the first half of free cash flow performance relative to the guidance of $15 billion to $16 billion for the year? And within that context maybe you could discuss directionally how you are seeing capital spending for wireline and wireless, the implications for cash taxes going into next year? And then last and not least is, just pension contributions and given the new laws, should we be thinking any differently about the way you\u2019re going to be approaching the pension? Thanks.","John J. Stephens","Thanks, Michael. We\u2019re going to stick with our $15 billion to $16 billion of free cash flow guidance or the run rate ahead of that, that\u2019s evident from our numbers, and we\u2019re pleased with the fact with where we are at. But as we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019re going to stick also with our CapEx guidance. And so we do expect trending up in CapEx to second half of the year. That\u2019s not a \u2013 that\u2019s only because in the first half of the year, our team and network team and others that use CapEx were real efficient and real careful.","And if you will, spent the money like it was their own to be careful in managing it, and so they\u2019ve spent a little bit less, but they still got their work done. And now that we\u2019ve got that efficiency, we\u2019re probably going to return more to a kind of normal spin, which will not only have a tick up in CapEx, but we\u2019ll have some \u2013 will also impact free cash flow.","Our cash tax situation isn\u2019t something we talk about on a quarter-by-quarter basis, I would suggest you, I think the situation for us is a little different over the long-term than others. First and foremost, most depreciation has gone away, but that impact will be spread over three years for us, because of the way to estimate favorables where.","Secondly, for this year, we\u2019ve got some kind of the unique benefits that we are going to get. The contract termination payments in the transfer spectrum we made and the pension funding we did in the fourth quarter of last year, we\u2019ll get the cash tax benefits of that this year.","Probably more importantly tough is, if you think back to our \u2013 an IRS settlement we entered into in September of 2010 for about $8 billion. If you\u2019re familiar with that, you\u2019ll realize that there is about $600 million a year of cash tax benefits that are coming out of that settlement and that will give you every year \u2013 through the year, I think 2022. So, that settlement, which provides cash balance into the future.","And then lastly, if you\u2019ve seen the spectrum purchases we made, going all way back to the auction process back in the \u201808 timeframe, and all the spectrum purchases since, we don\u2019t deduct or amortize those for book purposes, but they are deductible and amortizable for tax. So, we got a lot of things going on that are going to allow us to manage cash taxes and we put a lot of focus on that.","With regard to the pension funding in the highway bill\/pension funding, a lot changed. We don\u2019t have any inventory contributions to our pension plan this year, so for 2012 it doesn\u2019t affect us.","For 2013 going forward, certainly it could affect us, but it\u2019s too early to talk about that. We have to see how our return on assets do this year. We have to see how our liabilities work out. I will tell you, our focus on the pension play is really to make sure our employees know that it\u2019s secure, and that it\u2019s funded, and that we\u2019re efficient in doing it. And that is as much of focuses as the change in the highway bill pension loss.","Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Thanks John, it\u2019s really helpful.","John J. Stephens","Thanks Mike.","Operator","And next we go to Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brett Joseph Feldman \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow-up a little bit on CapEx, it does seem like we\u2019re going to see a step up in the second half. Could you provide a little color around, maybe where we\u2019re going to see that? It seems that it would likely be on the wireless side in light of your LTE build out plan, but there are some wireline investments you need to make, that will be helpful color.","And then just bigger picture, correct me if I am wrong, but I believe you\u2019re doing a fairly dense initial deployment of LTE, many are hitting quite a few sites or most of your sites with that build out. So how do we think about capital intensity in the wireless business after that initial deployment is complete. Could we see CapEx tick down or are you relatively comfortable with the level of investment in the business and you would redirect this dollars and to say capacity deployment?","John J. Stephens","Great, let me try to (inaudible) so one at a time, first of all we do a tick up in there, a step up in span of the second half of the year in CapEx, yes \u2013 we expect that fits with our \u2013 sticking with our guidance of about $20 billion.","Secondly, I think the \u2013 while we don\u2019t give specific predictions of the break down quarter-by-quarter, I think it\u2019s fair to assume that in the first half of the year we spent about 60% or so, close to 60% of our CapEx in wireless and you could expect that that will continue. I don\u2019t want to give any guidance that would move you from that.","I think the logical pieces there, things like the U-verse build and the fact that we really are, don\u2019t have any extensive new living units coming new that is in that area, the consumer is for success phased outs, it\u2019s not as much build, explains why some of the wireline maybe moderating, and the LTE build and accomplish that process. And the importance of that too is, it shows, may give you some insights of the why CapEx on the wireless side maybe increasing. We are doing a very dense bill, we think that\u2019s the way to give the best quality service to our LTE customers, and we think in the long-term that\u2019s going to really help in all aspects. So we believe that\u2019s the right strategy, we stuck with that, and we\u2019re going to stick with it, and I believe the customers are going to win, because that we decided to make that our strategy.","With regard to so to speak next year and future years, when you think about the fact that the LTE build is well on its way, I think we mentioned 90%, we\u2019re almost 90% of our data traffic is on enhanced backhaul already. As we roll it out, yes there is a logical thought that maybe you can lower CapEx and you just going forward. But we are sticking with our guidance of mid-teens as a percentage of revenue, and that\u2019s really because we\u2019ve got a lot of great opportunities in this business, we believe in the business, both in the wireline and the wireless business.","And so, we want to make sure, we guided that \u2013 we believe we\u2019ll find good opportunities for that investment, I already discussed this specifics, but I think we\u2019re going to stick with the guidance. I understand your reason, and I think it\u2019s logical that you would think there might be a step down, we\u2019re not guiding in that direction.","Susan Johnson","Thank you, Brad, and John I think we\u2019ve got time for just one more question.","Operator","And that would be from James Ratcliffe with Barclays. Please go ahead.","James Ratcliffe \u2013 Barclays Capital","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. If we just look at wireline for a second, and do you can help us unpack how much of a role international had in the result of this quarter, and what the [recurrency] was a drag year-on-year? Thanks.","John J. Stephens","Quite frankly James, I think you\u2019re probably well aware that our international exposure is really based on a U.S.-based companies going international, and it\u2019s really not significant, the biggest international exposure we have quite frankly, is in our equity income from our investments in Central and South America through our holdings and (inaudible) that probably is the biggest Forex impact. I will tell you on the business services revenue, there was an impact from foreign exchange, but I would suggest you that I don\u2019t think it changes the story for us, on that business services revenue. And I don\u2019t want to hold that out as the story changer. I think it\u2019s just much more about our businesses being careful and a little hesitant because of the uncertainties of budget deficits, tax laws and other things, and maybe that\u2019s our conjunction, that\u2019s what we believe. So it\u2019s more of that than necessarily a foreign exchange hitting our business services revenue line.","James Ratcliffe \u2013 Barclays Capital","All right. Thank you.","John J. Stephens","","Thanks, and let me close up here. First and foremost, I want to thank you all for being with us this morning. We delivered a strong financial quarter with record-setting performances in wireless and another strong showing with U-verse.

I should note with you that next quarter, we will report our results on October 21 \u2013 excuse me, on 24, October 24. Our earnings call that day will begin at 9 AM Eastern or 8 AM Central, little bit earlier.","Once again, thank you for being on the call. And as always, thank you very much for you interest in AT&T. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T\u2019s Executive TeleConference.

Welcome to the AT&T Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all of your participant phone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael Viola","Okay. Thanks, Lori, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the second quarter conference call. As Lori said, I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations here at AT&T. This is our first call - first earnings call after we closed our acquisition of Time Warner, and we're broadcasting this call from WarnerMedia headquarters in New York.","As we told you earlier, we're going to use this call not only to discuss the quarter, but we're also going to provide more details on our strategy. And to do that, we've brought together the CEO, CFO and four business leaders of our business units.","Today's agenda is going to begin with John Stephens, who will cover AT&T and Time Warner's second quarter financial results as well as update our outlook and guidance. Randall will provide a strategic perspective of the business. And then each of the business unit leaders will take -- will talk about their second quarter results and give a perspective of their businesses going forward. After that, the entire team will be available to participate in the Q&A session.","I'd like to mention one save the date item. We plan host a sell-side meeting on the evening of November 29 and followed by a buy-side meeting that next morning on the 30th. Both would be here in New York, and all the folks on this call will join us for those meetings. So please mark your calendars, and more details to come.","Now before I turn the call over to John, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of the comments today will be forward looking and as such is subject to risks, uncertainties. Results may differ materially. In addition, information is available on the Investor Relations website.","I also need to remind you that we're in the quiet period from the FCC CAF-II auction, so we can't address any questions about that today. As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That includes the news release, 8-K, investor briefing, other associated schedules, and available on our website are materials on Warner Media's full second quarter. It includes trending schedule and other important documents.","And so now I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens.","John Stephens","Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thanks for being on the call today. Let me begin with our financial summary, which is on Slide 5.","I think most of you know the FASB has been very, very busy this past year implementing a number of accounting standards, five of which have direct impact on AT&T. Those include standards that deal with revenue recognition, pension reporting, impacts on cash flow reporting.","These changes impact our income statements and cash flow. At the same time, the company made a policy decision to record universal service fees net as an offset to our regulatory fees.","We're working hard to help you understand these changes. So in addition to the GAAP financial information, we're providing comparable historical results to help you better understand the impact on the financials from revenue recognition and the policy decisions, as well as Time Warner's second quarter results on a historical basis. We will be referring to these historical results in our comparisons during the call.","Now let's start with EPS. We continue to show strong adjusted EPS growth, up more than 15% for both the quarter and year-to-date. Tax reform continues to have a positive impact on EPS as does the adoption of revenue recognition.","We also had about $0.02 of help from the 16 days we own Time Warner, which we have renamed WarnerMedia. The WarnerMedia earnings contribution was slightly more than what you might expect for such a short period. But as you know, financial results can be uneven, and we saw that in the second quarter.","Consolidated revenue came in at $39 billion, down slightly from a year ago, but that includes about $900 million of pressure from how we are now accounting for USF fees on a net basis.","When you look on a comparable basis, revenues were up slightly, thanks mostly due to the two weeks of Time Warner revenue but also helped by gains in wireless and AdWorks.","We continue to use our tax reform savings to invest in and grow our customer base. As John Donovan will discuss, these investments help drive post-paid phone growth and significant year-over-year improvement in prepaid phone net adds, continued growth in consumer broadband customers even in a seasonally challenging quarter and solid subscriber growth in total video customers.","Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the quarter were up year-over-year on a reported basis but down on a comparable one. Solid smartphone sales drove some of the pressure to margins, but the biggest factor continues to be customer transition to over-the-top video.","Let's now look at free cash flow. It was a strong $5.1 billion for the quarter, up substantially both year-over-year and sequentially. Year-to-date, our cash from operations and free cash flow is up about $1.5 billion, which makes us very comfortable with our free cash flow guidance for the full year.","Our cash flows also reflect the timing differences between spending for FirstNet and the reimbursements we received from the organization. This usually trail spending by several months. Year-to-date, that comes to more than $100 million of free cash flow pressure. Capital spending for the quarter was $5.1 billion or $5.4 billion before the $300 million of FirstNet reimbursements we did receive in the quarter.","Let's now cover financial results from operations beginning on Slide 6. AT&T's domestic mobility operations are divided between the Business Solutions and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, we're providing supplemental information for our total U.S. wireless operations.","Our wireless business turned in very good results. Year-over-year service revenue turned positive. Margins remained strong, and we had phone growth in both post-paid and pre-paid.","Total revenues were up year-over-year, thanks to gains in both service and equipment revenues. Also, service revenues were up almost 2% sequentially. Strong sales in BYOD supported that growth.","Our upgrade rate was down year-over-year, but our equipment revenues were up, reflecting customers' purchasing habits and their choice of more expensive devices. But even with these strong sales, margins were very good with service margins coming in over 50% on a comparable basis. Looking ahead, we expect positive service revenue growth for the full year on a comparable basis.","Turning to our Entertainment Group. We continue to see the impact of the video transition in our revenues and our margins. This would take a while to work through, and we expect it to continue the rest of the year. But we are seeing some sequential stability in both revenues and margins.","We're making changes to drive revenues and effectively manage the transition. We're going to introduce some promotional pricing that impacted revenues in the past, and we now have new features on our next-generation platform that will drive additional revenue opportunities such as cloud DVR, a more robust VOD experience with new pay-per-view options and an additional stream capability. John Donovan is going to walk you through those plans in a few minutes.","Also helping is AdWorks, which continues to grow at a double-digit rate and has now an annualized revenue stream of over $1.8 billion.","Moving to our Business Solutions group. Revenues were down as gains in wireless and strategic business services helped offset declines in legacy services. Business wireless with strong growth, up more than 4%. This is driven by both equipment and service revenues.","Wireline revenues were down more than 4% year-over-year. We still expect tax reform to produce a lift in communication spend, but we just haven't seen it yet. Wireline EBITDA margins were up slightly on a comparable basis. Cost efficiencies continue to offset pressure from legacy products and our investments in FirstNet.","In our International business, solid customer performance helped to offset currency pressures. Revenues were stable year-over-year, while margins were pressured by World Cup expenses as well as foreign exchange.","Now let's look at Time Warner's second quarter financials on Slide 7. Time Warner had strong growth at all operating conditions on a comparable basis. This includes strong subscription revenue growth on both Turner and HBO. Turner also showed solid advertising revenue growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, driven by increases at Warner and HBO.","Now for some housekeeping items. With recent FASB accounting rules, the Time Warner merger and purchase price accounting rules, there's going to be a lot of new information included in our results. We're going to do our best to make that easy for you to understand.","First, we'll file pro formas with the SEC in August. Second, we have posted the full second quarter results for Time Warner on our Investor Relations website. This includes the Time Warner historical results, trending schedules, all the information you're accustomed to seeing.","Finally, as you're updating your models, keep in mind the following: Results will continue to be reported at the divisional level, but there are certain things that will be eliminated in the Corporate and Other segment, including about $3 billion of annual inter-company content revenues and purchase accounting impacts on customer base and deferred production costs.","We're very excited that Time Warner is part of the AT&T family and the WarnerMedia as part of the AT&T family, and John Stankey is going to provide more insights and highlights in a few minutes.","Now let's look at our 2018 outlook with Time Warner included. We're raising adjusted earnings per share growth to the upper end of the $3.50 range with WarnerMedia included.","Year-to-date, we're already seeing 15% growth. Impact of tax reform, improving wireless service and advertising revenues as well as the addition of Time Warner support strong adjusted EPS growth even with the additional shares issued as part of the deal.","Looking at free cash flow. Our free cash flow guidance at the beginning of the year was standalone. We expect most of the benefit of the Time Warner free cash flow for the last half of the year, about $2 billion, will be absorbed by integration and deal costs, including severance costs, retention incentives, legal fees, bankers' costs and interest expense prior to close.","When you consider those items and slightly lower cash capital spending, we're raising expected free cash flow to the upper end of the $21 billion range with dividend coverage in the low 60% range, and that's even with the additional shares and dividend responsibility from the merger with Time Warner.","Now that we are halfway through the year, we also have a better view of CapEx. Capital investment is expected to be in the $25 billion range, but that will be $22 billion of CapEx on our cash flow statements after you net out our FirstNet reimbursements and some of the vendor financing opportunities that our team has pursued.","A primary focus for us this year and the next few years is deleveraging the business. We have a strong business that generates a ton of cash and EBITDA, and we are very confident in the deleveraging targets that we have given you. Let me recap them now.","Net debt to EBITDA is projected to be in the 2.9x range by the end of this year and a 2.5 range by the end of next year. To reach that target, we expect EBITDA growth. We'll use excess cash to pay down debt, and as always, we'll continue to look for ways to monetize non-strategic assets.","You've seen that recently with the data center deal and our pending sale of broadcast 600 spectrum. We expect to return to historic debt levels in the 1.8 times range by the end of 2022.","That's the financial summary. Now I'll turn it over to Randall. Randall?","Randall Stephenson","Okay. Thanks, John. And it was an exciting quarter. After 600 days of reviews and litigation, we did finally complete the acquisition of Time Warner. And then just a few days later, we announced our agreement to acquire AppNexus. And if you're not familiar with AppNexus, it's one of the top ad technology companies around.","And as John mentioned, we've renamed Time Warner to WarnerMedia, so we'll be referring to that as WarnerMedia from here forward. And as John Stankey will cover later, they had a really strong second quarter. We couldn't be pleased -- more pleased with the condition Jeff left the company with us.","We've now assembled the key elements of a modern media company, and it all begins with owning a wide array of premium content because we are absolutely convinced that there is nothing that drives customer engagement like high-quality premium content.","And whether it's Netflix, Amazon, Google, Disney or Comcast, everybody is now pursuing the same thing. How do you deliver great media and entertainment experiences to our customers? And I think the recent valuations of media companies is reinforcing this point.","But we couldn't be any happier with the range and quality of brands that we now own. For life programming, it doesn't get any better than CNN for news. And for sports, we have the NBA, March Madness, NFL SUNDAY TICKET, Major League Baseball and PGA. And for original premium subscription content, there is nobody better than HBO.","Our cable networks at Turner are among the best, and they're performing well. And for content creation, our production studio at Warner Bros. is the gold standard, and they possess one of the deepest IP libraries around.","And when you talk about digital content, we now own the cnn.com digital brands, and these are the most visited websites in the world. And add Bleacher Report and the Otter Media properties, and we have what we think are a terrific set of digital assets. Bottom line, we absolutely love this portfolio.","But just owning great content is no longer sufficient. The modern media company must develop extensive direct-to-consumer relationships, and we think pure wholesale business models for media companies will be really tough to sustain over time. And when you look across our wireless, pay TV and our broadband businesses, we now have more than 170 million direct-to-consumer relationships.","And these relationships are critical as we begin developing new media experiences for all kinds of different audiences. And then the 170 million relationships provide invaluable insights for new advertising models, and that's exactly what's behind our investment in ad technology.","Today, we use our data insights. We deliver ads on DIRECTV. And when we do this, our advertising yields improve by 3 to 5x. As you're going to hear from Brian Lesser shortly, that business grew 16% in the second quarter.","Now Turner has an ad inventory that's 3 times the size of our DIRECTV inventory, and as we apply the same data to that inventory, we expect a significant lift. At AppNexus, that acquisition is all about improving our capabilities and reducing our time to market here.","So you take these three elements, premium content, 170 million direct-to-consumer relationships and great ad technology and then you combine those with our high-speed networks, and we think all of this is a game changer.","Bringing these four elements together has changed the way we think about our customer value proposition. We spend our time now thinking about how to combine these elements to create unique customer experiences. How do we combine the best content wherever you are and make it easy to find and consume?","What are the new products that combine content and connectivity? How do we create personalized content experiences, including personalized ads that you find useful? So hopefully, you begin to see why we're so excited about putting all of these capabilities together.","Now we knew the WarnerMedia deal was not going to be like any other we had done. It's a vertical bolt on with a media business. And the media business obviously has very distinct culture, talent and business models. So last fall, in anticipation of the merger, we reorganized the company into 4 separate businesses, and you can see those on the next slide.","What we've done is pushed the core staff functions and the decision-making out into the business units, and we left behind a very small staff at corporate. And this is all about increasing speed and efficiency at each of these businesses. But at the same time, we need to foster cross-platform coordination to generate the synergies that John Stankey will be touching on next.","Today, we're going to change the earnings call around a little bit as John Stephens pointed out. We're going to give you a chance to hear from each of these business unit leaders. And then when they finish, we're going to stay on the phone and answer any questions that you have. And then John Stankey is going to lead us off. John is the Head of WarnerMedia.","And then you're going to next hear from John Donovan, who heads up AT&T Communications; and then Brian Lesser, he's the Head of our Advertising & Analytics business. And he's going to walk you through his plans. And then finally, you'll hear from Lori Lee, who heads up our Latin American businesses.","And she's going to take you through an update on, really, the great market momentum that we're experiencing in Mexico and also talk about the latest on our Latin American TV business.","So with that, I'm now going to hand it over to John Stankey. John?","John Stankey","Thanks, Randall. Good afternoon to all of you. I've been on the job now a little bit more than a month, but during the time, I've had the opportunity to meet with various leadership teams at WarnerMedia. And I don't think it's a surprise to any of you what I found is what I believe to be an unmatched dedication to producing unique and engaging content across film, television, sports and journalism.","Looking forward to my continued work with this team, and I think we have the great opportunities in front of us to further harness the exceptional content and capabilities at WarnerMedia.","John gave you the financial highlights of WarnerMedia's second quarter, but let me dig in deeper, and you'll see those results on Slide 13. Time Warner's last quarter as a stand-alone company had strong revenue gains in Turner, HBO and Warner Bros.","Turner saw solid growth with gains in both subscription and advertising revenues. Subscription revenues benefited from higher domestic rates and growth at Turner's international networks.","Subscriber counts have been stable thanks to growth in virtual MVPDs with 3 of the top 5 ad-supported cable networks among adults 18 to 49 in primetime. The Turner Networks are proving popular in every video bundle as evidenced by their inclusion in every major live OTT provider. Turner Sports properties helped drive strong advertising revenue growth in the second quarter led by the NBA on TNT broadcast.","HBO also delivered solid revenue growth in the quarter. Subscriber revenues were up 13% due to strong U.S. subscriber growth and gains in international markets. Higher television revenues helped drive strong revenue growth at Warner Bros., Warner Bros. TV looks to build on that success with more than 75 TV series in production for the 2018, '19 season. That is the studio's largest number of TV series in production at one time ever.","Here's another good indicator of what kind of quarter and year WarnerMedia has had. WarnerMedia companies, HBO, Turner, Warner Bros. received 166 Emmy nominations, which include 22 nominations for HBO's Game of Thrones alone, followed by 21 nominations for Westworld, which is produced for HBO by Warner Bros., a real trooper for us.","These nominations speak to the caliber of the talent and dedication to quality across the company. My congratulations go to the entire WarnerMedia team for their exceptional creative achievements.","During the roughly six weeks since we closed the deal on June 14, we've been working strategically to integrate the two companies. That includes applying the data analytics from AT&T's distribution to the Turner ad inventory. As you know, this is one of the benefits of combining our two businesses.","You've seen the success of the AdWorks group using targeted advertising for DIRECTV and U-verse. Now we have 3x the ad inventory to work with. We believe we can get meaningful CPM improvement in what Turner sees today. Brian Lesser will explain in a few minutes. We expect this is only the beginning of our success.","We've also moved quickly to position WarnerMedia content on AT&T distribution platforms. We intend to push the WarnerMedia consumer brands even further across all platforms. We've been busy with the basic blocking and tackling that comes with any merger, integrating corporate and staff functions, getting our infrastructure systems to work together and aligning corporate management.","We'll look to achieve synergies with our advertising spend and other procurement areas by getting better rates from vendors and suppliers. For example, AT&T was not the primary telecom supplier for Time Warner. Now we begin that transition for WarnerMedia. These types of efforts will help us to deliver on the $2.5 billion in merger synergies we promised.","While all this has been going on, we've been very deliberate in shaping some long-term initiatives that we think will add even greater value. We developed thoughtful plans on where we want to go next with WarnerMedia and have several goals that we want to accomplish.","First, we want to increase our investment in premium content. HBO's name is synonymous with quality entertainment. The creative talent at HBO is the best in the industry. My goal is to give the HBO team the resources to greenlight additional projects already in the development funnel.","We want to invest more in original content while still retaining the high quality and unique brand position of HBO. This will further strengthen the HBO brand, enhance the customer experience, improve churn and drive more engagement with some of our most valued customers.","Second, we plan to further develop and nurture our direct-to-consumer distribution, including HBO NOW. That will include enhancing existing platforms as well as delivering premium content to the more than 170 million direct-to-consumer relationships across AT&T's video, mobile and broadband platforms in the United States and Latin America. We also plan to add even greater value to these relationships by focusing, aggregating and incorporating more WarnerMedia intellectual property.","And third, we also are looking at our international markets and explore ways to maximize our content globally to create greater value. We believe there's a lot of opportunity that remains in this area.","Obviously, we're very early in the game when it comes to implementing our plans, but we're off to a good start and look to quicken the pace as we move past close.","Now I'd like to turn it over to John Donovan for details on AT&T's Communications second quarter results. John?","John Donovan","Thanks, John. I'm really excited about WarnerMedia coming into our portfolio because it strengthens our ability to innovate across our businesses like content and content -- I'm sorry, connectivity.","So if we discuss AT&T Communications operating results, we'll start on Slide 16. Our wireless business turned in an impressive quarter. John Stephens told you about the service revenue growth and strong margins, but we also had strong subscriber gains and continued our low post-paid culture. For the quarter, we added 46,000 post-paid phones. That makes nine consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement.","We had our best prepaid quarter in nine quarters with 453,000 prepaid net adds. This includes 356,000 phone net adds. We had a record connected device net add quarter as well, adding 3 million new devices.","Churn continues to run at near-record low levels. Post-paid phone churn was 0.82%, just three basis points higher than last year's all-time record, and we have a record low prepaid churn, thanks to our multi-line plan penetration and auto bill pay.","These customer gains and low churn are showing up in our service revenue, where we turned positive both sequentially and year-over-year on a comparative basis.","With the unlimited launch well behind us and targeted promotional activity, we saw service revenue improve each month in the quarter, and we're on track to grow service revenue for the full year on a comparable basis. And we maintained comparable service margins above 50% again this quarter.","Moving over to our Entertainment Group. We continue to see total video subscriber gains as we move through the transition of our video business. We had 80,000 total video net adds in the quarter with gains in DTV Now and U-verse more than offsetting losses in DIRECTV.","We also turned in solid broadband gains. Our Entertainment Group had 76,000 IP broadband net adds with 23,000 total broadband net adds. That's their seventh consecutive quarter of broadband growth.","About 95% of our consumer broadband base is now on our IP broadband as our transition from DSL is drawing to a close. Our fiber build continues at a fast clip, now passing more than 9 million customer locations, and we expect that this time next year to reach 14 million locations.","This gives us a long runway for broadband growth. We're doing very well in our fiber markets, including a 246,000 net increase in subs on our fiber network in the second quarter.","Now I'd like to update you on several key initiatives we have underway, so we'll turn to Slide 17. Evolving our video portfolio is top priority for us. We believe we're well positioned as our customers move toward a more personalized set of streaming products.","Our new platform was launched in May as the DIRECTV NOW user interface, and it's now live on all supported device operating systems and has been well received with strong engagement by customers.","It offers a new cloud-based DVR and more robust video-on-demand experience with new pay-per-view options. Over time, it will bring additional advertising and data insight opportunities.","This new video platform gives us flexibility to adapt to the market with new offerings and products. Late in the quarter, we added our third video offering called WatchTV, a small package of 30 live channels and 15,000 on-demand titles.","We include WatchTV in our unlimited, more wireless plans where you can purchase it for $15 a month, making it perfect for customers who want video but not at the cost of a large package.","This complements DIRECTV NOW where we continue to see success in attracting cord cutters and cord severs. And later this year, we will begin testing a premium product extension, which is a streaming product that will give the full DIRECTV experience over any broadband, ours or competitors'.","It will have additional benefits of an improved search and discovery feature and an enhanced user interface. We're excited that this will complement our top-end product for those who don't want or can't have a satellite dish.","Our open-video platform also dovetails nicely with our ongoing focus on driving the industry's leading cost structure. The new platform is low touch with lower acquisition costs as streaming services becomes a bigger part of our business.","Digital sales are a cost-efficient way of customer engagement, and we're seeing double-digit growth in our digital sales and service. We're also seeing operating expense savings from our move to a virtualized software-defined network.","More than 55% of our network functions were virtualized at the end of 2017, and we're well on our way to meet or exceed our goal of 75% virtualized by 2020. These and other cost management initiatives have helped drive 13 straight quarters of cost reductions in our technology and infrastructure group.","Finally, I'd like to give an update on our FirstNet build and other network investments. Our FirstNet network build is accelerating. We expect to have between 12,000 and 15,000 band 14 sites on air by the end of this year 2018, and we're ahead of our contractual commitment.","And don't forget, when we're putting in equipment for FirstNet, we're also deploying our AWS and WCS spectrum, utilizing the one touch, one tower approach. This approach allows all customers access to our improved network.","FirstNet also gives us an opportunity to sell to first responders. So far, more than 1,500 public safety agencies across 52 states and territories have joined FirstNet, nearly doubling the network's adoption since April.","In addition to our efforts with FirstNet, 5G and 5G Evolution work continues its development in several different areas that will pave the way to the next generation of higher speeds for our customers.","We now have 5G Evolution in more than 140 markets, covering nearly 100 million people with theoretical peak speeds of at least 400 megabits per second with plans to cover 400-plus markets by the end of this year.","Our millimeter wave mobile 5G trials are also going well, and we're on track to launch service in parts of 12 markets by the end of this year.","With that, I now turn it over to Brian Lesser to discuss our Advertising & Analytics business. Brian?","Brian Lesser","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As Randall mentioned, a critical component of the modern media company is a dynamic advertising business, one that can deliver on the promise of making advertising relevant, engaging and actually matter to consumers and make it work harder for advertisers and make it more valuable and optimized for publishers.","I think about this simply. The course of the ad industry has been set by a series of defining moments. The rise of broadcast networks, the proliferation of cable networks and the pay TV bundle, digital advertising and its ability to target audiences, we sit here again today at yet another point that will define advertising for years to come. The pain points are obvious.","Traditional advertising doesn't satisfy what both consumers and brands are looking for. Brands are frustrated with lack of access to data, lack of competence in targeting and measurement and non-transparent ad tech costs. The industry talked about video convergence, but no tangible examples yet have emerged to deliver a unified buy-side and sell-side platform.","So while the timing for disrupting the ad industry is right, you must have the assets to execute, and there is no doubt that AT&T is uniquely positioned to lead this disruption.","In our view, successful ad marketplaces must have two key assets: number one, its premium content. Sports, news, original programming, we love our position with Turner content along with the scaled portfolio of ad inventory.","Number two is distribution. Customers dictate how and where they consume content. Likewise, a relevant ad marketplace must be able to reach customers where they are, whether it's a 50-foot screen in a theater or a 3-inch screen in your pocket.","Number three is data. AT&T has access to expansive datasets on customer behavior and preferences. 170 million direct-to-consumer relationships across its wireless video and broadband businesses, 40 million set-top boxes, 20 million connected cars, and that's just for starters. But data needs to be activated to have value. We're building targeting and measurement capabilities that will bring greater value to consumers, advertisers and publishers.","And number four is technology. Content distribution and data must be integrated on a best-in-class ad technology platform. That's the rationale for our recent announcement to acquire AppNexus.","This is a best-in-class independent advertising marketplace supported by the best talent in the industry. We cannot wait to combine our teams and partner to make advertising matter to consumers.","It is important to note we are not starting from a standstill. Both AT&T Advertising & Analytics and Turner have executed fabulously by using data and technology to fuel growth.","AT&T Advertising & Analytics is consistently delivering double-digit revenue growth, including 16% growth in the second quarter. We will employ the same momentum and scale to deliver on our vision.","So in closing, our plan is nothing short of leading the industry and creating a premium advertising marketplace across both TV and digital by quickly integrating AT&T assets, including AppNexus. It's this unique moment in time, coupled with this unique set of assets, that gives me confidence in our path forward.","With that, I will hand it over to Lori Lee to talk about our Latin American operation.","Lori Lee","Thank you, Brian. The advertising opportunities that Brian laid out apply to Latin America as well. We have more than 30 million direct-to-consumer relationships, and we plan to run the same play with the LatAm business that we will be using in the United States. It won't happen overnight, but the opportunity is definitely there.","Let me discuss our second quarter results. Those details are on Slide 21. Starting with our Mexico Wireless operations, we turned in another strong subscriber quarter with more than 750,000 net adds. That totaled more than 3 million new customers in the past 12 months, doubling our subscriber base to a 16.4 million since entering Mexico just 3 years ago.","During that time, we've built a world-class LTE network and developed a marketing presence reflecting the AT&T brand. Our network build is in the final stages as we close in on covering 100 million people.","We have rebranded 3,000 stores and have approximately 6,000 total retail locations, expanding our marketing presence and distribution. And we've upgraded and integrated our different billing systems. All this puts us in a great position to add customers and revenues at a lower cost.","We're also making a lot of progress in improving our financials. Operationally, we're pushing on all fronts to exit the year EBITDA positive. In our Vrio pay-TV business, currency devaluations have impacted our financial results, but the strength of our subscriber base and our profitability remains consistent.","That continued to be true in the second quarter. The World Cup drove strong subscriber growth of 140,000 with particularly strong gains in prepaid. We finished the quarter with 13.7 million pay-TV subscribers, a number that has held fairly steady since we acquired the business. The World Cup did drive higher expenses in the quarter, but we continue to drive profitability and positive free cash flow year-to-date.","Now I'll turn it back to Mike for Q&A.","Michael Viola","Okay. Thanks, Lori. Lori - operator Lori, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question from John Hodulik with UBS.","John Hodulik","Thanks. And I think I'm going to bounce around a little bit. But maybe first for John Donovan, the wireless business, it looks like EBITDA was down about 0.7%, I think, on like-for-like basis. But obviously, you returned to growth in subscribers and some margin improvement. Should we be expecting that segment still your biggest [ph] to return to EBITDA growth as we look forward?","And then maybe one for Brian and then for John Stankey. Brian, we've heard a lot about addressable advertising, 3% growth this quarter on the advertising line. What are some of the milestones that we should expect and maybe the timing of when this addressable advertising opportunity starts to take hold within these numbers?","And then lastly, John Stankey, the - you obviously got some press recently in terms of interview you did about the new WarnerMedia. Could you talk a little bit about the size of that HBO spend? I think the HBO spends about $2 billion. You're competing with companies that spend $8 billion a year, much bigger numbers. I mean, how should we think of that in terms of the overall financial profile of the company?","And maybe if you could elaborate on other D-to-C efforts you may have. We've heard about DC -- DC Universe and the HBO NOW but if there's any other sort of initiatives we should be looking for? Thanks.","John Donovan","Hey, John, it's John Donovan. I'll start the question on wireless and EBITDA. We've had now three quarters in a row where our year-over-year compares on subscriber growth was very good. We crossed over that all-important date, where we got a lot of the reseller stuff behind us.","We crossed over that date for the unlimited plans. And you've seen a lot of momentum in prepaid, which has really become a really nice business for us right now. We're in a really good rhythm there firing on all cylinders.","And so what we're seeing right now in this quarter, John mentioned in his opening remarks that we were stronger each month of the quarter within the quarter. We're starting to see us roll over some of those earlier events, and now we're beginning to get strength in them.","And so because we - in the - each month of this quarter strengthened from subscriber counts, we also have some pricing moves, calibration of pricing, if you will, that made us consistent with our value proposition in the marketplace. So we expect that we'll have growth for the year and the EBITDA margins to improve.","Brian Lesser","John, I'll take the next part of your question. This is Brian Lesser. So you asked about milestones in the advertising business. I think it's important to know that we have posted a $2 billion advertising business outside of what we just acquired in Turner, and that advertising business was growing 16% in the second quarter. So we're already showing the value of data and technology on our advertising business.","I think in terms of going forward, you should look for some things that we've already mentioned here in this call, number one, our ability to increase the yield on the inventory that we have now within Turner and WarnerMedia more broadly and also increase value to the firm but also value to publishers, advertisers and the consumers.","You'll see us continue to develop the ad platform. AppNexus, once we close that deal, is an important milestone for us, but you'll see us lean in and develop additional technologies around that platform.","And then third is our ability to partner with other media companies outside of AT&T. In some ways, our success will depend on our ability to attract additional sources of inventory to reach critical mass for advertisers.","John Stankey","So John, let me just amplify the last piece that Brian gave. Data that we have had within the AT&T company applying to AdWorks has already been moved over into the Turner team to begin applying into existing inventory that we have using the same techniques we piloted in selling the two minutes of advertising that the AT&T team has across the broader inventory of Turner.","So that's near term. That's not a milestone issue. That's, today, we're starting to look at those business cases and how we would do that. Teams have already come up with a variety of different initiatives around that, including - we found out that Brian had a great opportunity to do addressable advertising in the pharmaceutical space, and some of the pharmaceutical companies wanted 90-second avails. And he didn't have 90 seconds of inventory.","So we're bridging Turner inventory with what used to be AT&T inventory so that we can have new addressable products to bring in. So that's - there's benefit to that data that's occurring now even without the broad mechanization and intelligence and platform work that Brian brought to the table that's just discussed.","So on direct to consumer, what I will tell you is what we know about this space is it requires scale. And you mentioned that there's a number of different initiatives underway within the WarnerMedia companies, and they're all good within their own right. But they all generate what I would consider to be relatively small scale audiences, company our size. We want to be generating audience. It's in the tens of millions, not in the single-digits millions.","And so the way I would think about our direct-to-consumer efforts over time is it's better together. So a lot of very strong brands in the family that generate interest among groups of audiences and on a stand-alone basis, they're not as powerful as they are when they're brought together. And you can assemble the genre of content and bring them together on one platform and one experience that aggregates and gets scale.","So over time, what you should think about how we're going to approach the discrete brands that we have is ultimately unify them in a more consistent and more focused experience. It starts to bring some scale in.","Still very important properties, they still need to be developed. We've got to get the formula right for them, but over time, we want to strengthen them to come together. In terms of your reference to the new cycles on HBO, it wasn't an interview.","I think it was an internal discussion that was right to act, but I would tell you, I don't believe in it effectively characterizing what we are about. What we are about, as I said, is we have a tremendous amount of great projects already in the funnel that as the HBO team and Richard would describe it, they have not been in a position to say yes to because of constraints on certain resources.","What we're attempting to do is open up those constraints on very high, top-quality projects that we think will balance out the schedule so that we have a more engaging experience with HBO throughout the course of the year. That will improve the fact that we can see, especially on the digital platforms, you have customers jumping in and out based on scheduling. And if we can smooth that schedule, we can drive churn down or improve retention and power additional subscriber growth.","So I'm not going to give you the exact investment number, but the way I would think about it is we will make decisions to reinvest some of the efficiencies that we pick up from combining these companies together and running them at a little different fashion.","We may get back a margin point or so in the near term as we grow the subscriber base as we reinvest in it. But it's going to be a very responsible investment and great projects we've already scoped out, we already have rights for, we want to get into the development funnel. And the team feels very, very comfortable that we can flex up on our development in a way that we think rounds out the schedule very nicely.","Randall Stephenson","John, this is Randall. It - well, this merger is different in terms it's a vertical merger. There are certain aspects of the playbook that you just heard John describe that they're going to be exactly the same in that it generates synergies and then reinvest significant portion of those synergies back in to your capabilities and your products.","Direct to consumer and deeper HBO content, it's just part and parcel to that. That's no different to what we've done in the past, and you should probably expect it's going to happen here as well. Thanks for your question. Lori, we\u2019ll take the next question.","Operator","And we go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thank you very much. For John Stephens, John, in the past, you'd given some guidance with DIRECTV on the medium term on EPS. Can you give us any color about the benefits of Time Warner or WarnerMedia in a full year '19? How should we be thinking about that given the upside to guidance this year?","And then on the balance sheet, what are you assuming in terms of getting 2.5 around additional divestitures and about things like spectrum acquisitions? Or is that just run rate with what you have right now? Thanks.","John Stephens","A couple of things, Simon. Thanks for the questions. First of all, beginning to - on the 2.5x by the end of next year, that's driven mainly by run rate with regard to cash flows, taking the cash flows above the dividend and paying down debt.","Secondly, it is important to achieve the synergies, particularly the EBITDA boosting synergies and the growth that we're seeing and some of the growth that we're seeing in wireless and customer additions so that we get a higher EBITDA number.","Well, we have normally planned for asset sales and constantly look at underutilized assets for monetization, for example, the data centers, the broadcast spectrum 600, which is a couple of billion dollars right there, we have under contract and waiting for approvals today.","We'll continue to do that. If you want to give a scope to it, as of today, we have about $500 billion in total assets. And so finding a few more opportunities to monetize assets seems to be very reasonable on top of the things that we've kind of commonly done with regard to real estate and other underutilized business in spectrum. So that batch [ph], I'm not giving you any specific number on asset sales, but as we've proven this year, we're going to continue to do that.","And with regard to EPS guidance specifically around the acquisition, I'll say it this way. First and foremost, the point is, is that WarnerMedia -- Time Warner, WarnerMedia, immediately accretive. Revenues, free cash flow, EPS, we've seen it already. So that guidance that we've given, we'd expect we're standing by that and continue to expect that and have started to prove that out already.","Secondly, we're not going to give a specific guidance with regard to Time Warner's impacts, but I'd suggest it this way. If you think about $3.50 EPS range, for us, that means $3.40 to $3.60. And we just said that we expect to be in the high end of that range. So that'll give you an indication of using your own estimates, other's estimates, where we were, what we expected to be for the rest of the year.","I will point out that the $0.02 we've got in the second quarter for two weeks was, as I said, uneven, and specifically because the NBA contract for playoffs, all that content was extended before we merged.","The Golden State Warriors won the championship in June 8, so that content expense was recognized before we got the deal. So we have some higher profitability in those 16 days you might otherwise expect.","But I'd expect profitability to continue no matter what. We'll give specific EPS guidance for '19 in the coming months. I would just suggest that we continue to expect this transaction to be accretive, revenue, free cash flow and EPS.","Randall Stephenson","Lori, we\u2019ll take the next question","Operator","We go to Phil Cusick, JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Phil Cusick","Hi, guys. Seems like we're going around in the same questions. But one for Brian. Can you talk about - clearly, what has to be done here to realize the addressable ad vision? And what's the timing of this coming through to accelerate the numbers and start to be really material on the company?","Can this impact 2019 or are we really talking about 2020? And how do you see the potential to reduce the ad load while you raise CPMs? Thanks.","Brian Lesser","In terms of - thanks for the question, Phil. In terms of timing, as John Stankey outlined, there are some things that we can do immediately and start to add value to Turner ad inventory, and that's already in motion. And so we think there's short-term value there in 2018.","I would say in terms of the overall addressable opportunity, that's a little bit further out. We have work to do in terms of building the technology platform, but the good news there is because of the amount of inventory that exists within DIRECTV, also within WarnerMedia, we can prove out the value of AT&T data and the investments that we're making in technology plus the evolution of our direct-to-consumer relationship that John Donovan talked about.","So I think we still keep our losses [ph] to really start to extract value from inside AT&T using our inventory across DIRECTV and WarnerMedia in 2018. And then in 2019, we're going to start to partner very effectively across other sources of inventory to bring value.","John Stephens","Phil, John Stephens, if I could add to that. I mean, want to point out Brian's humble here in that sense that he started getting 16% revenue growth on those ads, DIRECTV, U-verse footprint, possibility, those ads watched by the same people as the ones who watch the Turner ads. So we've got proof then this works.","Secondly, when the AppNexus deal closes, we'll have the ability to take our internal activity and put it on that supply-side platform that will be within our control. So we are optimistic about the opportunities to get value out of the AppNexus platform.","We've got DOJ approved forward. We're going to need to get [indiscernible] approved and hope to close it before the next time we speak certainly. But I'm optimistic about that, too, so probably a lot of things going and heading in the right direction.","Phil Cusick","And in terms of the ad load? Thank you.","Brian Lesser","In terms of the ad load, so our objective, Phil, is not just to improve advertising as it exists today but to also improve the experience for consumers. We're in a unique position to do that because of our vertical integration because we have content and we have that direct-to-consumer relationship over a traditional television, over a mobile phone, over other mobile devices.","We can start to do things in terms of innovating the ad experience. As an example, you'll see us start to introduce products across the rest of this year and obviously, the next year, where the consumer watching television has a better experience that is less interruptive.","Imagine a DIRECTV customer watching the big screen on their living room wall and instead of seeing a traditional ad break, they see an icon on a car in a movie that they're interested in or in a show that they're interested in.","And then we have the ability to create a seamless ad experience on their mobile device, which is on the coffee table or in their pocket, pause real-time content to interact with a better ad experience and therefore, deliver more relevant content to our customer and to the consumer more broadly.","That has the ability, number one, to be a better experience for our customers and consumers, a better business for us because those ad units will generate a higher CPM and a higher yield and a better experience for advertisers and the media company representing the content. So that's really our objective, is to start to innovate because of our access to data technology and the direct-to-customer relationship.","John Stankey","I would -- Phil, I would just comment that this notion of more innovative ad formats is critical. It's not just a lighter ad load. Well, that's important, and we'd like to achieve it. I think what we all understand is that viewing habits are moving away, in many instances, from the linear fee, and so my a goal working with distributors such as my partner here at the table who is a large distributor of my product is just also start to take these better software-driven platforms that they have and lay out more on-demand content for them that allows for what used to be linear content to be available and stacked and other formats and then attach to that the right kind of advertising that isn't loading that on-demand content with the same commercial loads but is also highly targeted and customized to the particular experience that the individual is going through.","We saw how mobilizing and moving to TV Everywhere raised consumption of the traditional linear affair. I think we have another opportunity to take a fairly mature pay-TV product and extend the runway even further by being more aggressive in trying to incent the distributors to carry more depth in a library.","Randall Stephenson","Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator","We go to John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis","Thank you. One for John Stankey. Maybe a follow-up on HBO. As you know, domestic subs have been in the 30 million to maybe 35 million or so range over the past few years.","And you talked about the content investment. But will there be a more aggressive direct-to-consumer push that perhaps would include maybe a Turner bundle or maybe a change to more wholesale deals with existing distributors?","And is there any consideration to reset the price, which has largely remained steady as many of your peers have been more promotional? Thank you.","John Stankey","So I would tell you that our wholesale distributors remain a really important part of our product, and we want to make the product better to improve its performance for their businesses as well as the HBO brand overall.","And as I indicated, we'd like to, for example, improve our term characteristics by getting a more complete annual schedule that has people fully incented to stay in the product and not jump in and out of it as various content comes and goes through the course of the year. We think we've got some good steps that we can take in that regard that will help our sub counts and continue to grow through our traditional distribution channel.","I do believe that as we invest in the platform itself, the direct-to-consumer platform and improve some of the technical capabilities associated with it that our features that can be brought to bear in a typical OTT SVOD environment, that we can also increase the distribution of the digital versions of the product that go direct on retail.","And so we want to run that play as well. I will tell you that I don't think that's a -- what I would call right now a step function change over the next couple of months, but we can incrementally get better on our current run rates by having some success in that regard.","In terms of what other content can be paired with HBO and maybe a more broad offer, I think we have a number of distributors out there that have some great ideas around how they might want to match HBO to their particular content offerings.","And as I said, I want to look at the depth of our WarnerMedia offerings that we have and get better together and understand how we can bring some of our WarnerMedia brands and our other curated options into a more focused direct-to-consumer strategy that I think, as we start to get our strategy together on that, move forward on it, you could see that step function increase in more retail oriented customers.","John Janedis","Thanks, John.","Randall Stephenson","Take the next question operator.","Operator","And we go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman","Thanks. One of the stronger trends we saw in this quarter was a nice improvement in postpaid phone ARPU, and actually, some of your peers, we've seen something similar so far this quarter.","Also, if we look at the market and we look at some of the pricing moves you've made and others have made, there's an introduction of higher price points. It's not really price increases, but it's really just if you pay more, you'll get more.","So I was hoping maybe you could just expand in terms of what your customers are asking for, why you've identified a cohort that has shown a willingness to pay more for more. And how durable do you think this trend might be?","John Donovan","Yes. Brett, you've been obviously watching our commercials. That whole idea and more. And so what we're trying to do is differentiate the product in ways that don't have to do with speeds, megabytes or rack rate pricing. And so what we're really focused on is product engagement. The value of any customer will be based on the combination of the price and the value that they use for.","And that's why I would say, from a consumer perspective, our strength in consumer has been heavily in the bundling of video with wireless. So we see increased engagement. We're finding that people find a lot of value for it, and then we're kind of spreading the offers to fit budgets and engagement. And so you've seen that in wireless.","And I would point out to you that, that pattern may look familiar in video, and we're trying to find various price points, engagements and content combinations that fit everybody's budget so that everybody views that they're getting value. And they do that not just by focusing on megabytes and pricing.","So I think that it's not an accidental trend that we stumbled onto. It's actually a strategy that's centered in the DIRECTV merger that we were pushing in, and that fits very well with this next step with WarnerMedia. And our sister over there provides us a lot of flexibility.","So I do think it's a trend. I do think that if we succeed - when we succeed, others will be -- will follow and make some of the moves in their own. And I think that right now we see the most important thing, which was engagement and customer delight for the product improving.","And that, to us, translates to value, and we're going to price the value. And so I think the industry will continue, hopefully, to take - to look at that and we - rationalism result to that. So we're going to continue down this path, more of it rather than less of it and expected to be successful.","Brett Feldman","A quick follow-up if you don't mind. Obviously, the plans that include a lot of content tend to be the higher prices, and you clearly see that helps ARPU. Are you seeing that they are also helping churn?","John Donovan","Yes. If you look at the churn, this year was again 3 bps up over. But I think that compared to the industry, we did really well. Compared to seasonality, we did really well, and the number that we're comparing to last year was our all-time low. So I do think that it's a strategy that's working for consumers and therefore, working for us.","And that is the currency that we're after there because you could start to trade some things that customers value higher than the ARPU differential. So we are carefully managing this portfolio, same strategy in wireless and in video.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the questions.","John Donovan","Sure.","Randall Stephenson","Lori, we\u2019ll go to next question please.","Operator","We'll go to David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David Barden","Hi, guys thanks for taking the questions. Thanks for the expenses format on the call, I think it's super helpful. Randall, I guess, my first question would be the telco guy, the media industry is definitely not my wheelhouse yet. But if I'm watching what's happening out there, we've got Fox deciding that they're not big enough to be a competitor in the media industry, so they're selling.","And we've got two large competitors in Comcast and Disney who feel, in order to be competitive with the Netflixes and the Googles of the world, they need to get even bigger.","And so I guess, my question for you is kind of how do you - how comfortable, do you feel, with the scale that you have now in the content business. And are you on the cusp of having a global strategy that's going to kind of try to compete with those other larger content houses? That will be my first one if I could.","And then the second one, John, will be for you. We've been hearing a lot about the directionality of the deal about how we take the information from your side of the business, we bring it over to Brian and let him crunch through it and sell it into Turner.","But as you sit there and look at what WarnerMedia could mean to your business, the broadband business, the mobile business, even the business, business, kind of what do you see as the opportunities? And if you could give us some examples, that would be super helpful? Thanks.","Randall Stephenson","David, this is Randall. I'll go first, and I'll hand it over to John Donovan. You said John. That's just not just very descriptive. But I'll direct that to John Donovan when I finish. In terms of the - what you're seeing happen in the landscape, the media landscape, it's fascinating to us.","We expected some time back this is exactly what you would see happen, that you'd begin to see media companies consolidate and people would see the importance of scale and changing models, changing distribution models and so forth. And so it's hard to imagine.","But it was back in 2016 when we actually did this deal, and so it was early in 2016 where we were asking ourselves, if you believe that's going to happen, if you believe that your networks are going to be able to distribute seamlessly premium content, if you believe that your information and your distribution business is really valuable and can drive different advertising models, then you probably ought to move fast and own media.","And as we look at a scan of what opportunities are out there, Time Warner jumped out. It's just the obvious choice. It was the one scale player that had a great scaled distribution platform, a great scale in terms of advertising inventory and cable networks.","It had the scale position in terms of content creation with Warner Bros. And it was just the obvious partner for us, and everything else was a distant second. And so from the -- to answer your question directly, we feel really good about what we have. And then you add to it the digital properties and CNN being an off-the-charts, great digital property.","You put all the CNN digital properties together, they are the most accessed digital news sites in the world. And so putting all this capability, data, ad tech and so forth, together with the media company, we think is a really, really great combination, and we could not be happier that we moved first.","I think moving first, you rarely forget -- you rarely regret it when you see an industry trend happen. So we saw this would happen. We went first, and we think we got the best business that was on the -- that was actually in the media space. So we feel really good about it. JD, you want to talk about integration of content?","John Donovan","Sure. Thanks. So Dave, we had 600 days to think about this. And when you form your synergies, you deal with some of the straightforward things that John Stankey talked about. But we -- over the last year or so, as we started to put wireless and video together and saw the trend I talked about earlier start to manifest, we are learning as an integrated carrier.","So I circle back and say, when we bought DIRECTV, remember, we talked about bundling up and a lot of skepticism about the value of bundling up versus it being just a price discount.","And I got to tell you, you start to look at the economics of churn reduction and you start to learn how these currencies pass back and forth, you see the same opportunities here. You see -- because the killer app right now on broadband and on wireless is video.","So as you start to look at what customers place value on and you move from buying and reselling or see us being completely out of that market and you go to owner's economics, we really have always had a good sense as to what customers are using and doing on our network.","So to be able to value that into pricing and start to trade off these currencies that we learned over the last 3 years of how do you trade off an acquisition dollar for a dollar of content, how do you trade off a customer install cost versus a churn reduction, we've built some solid muscle now to know how those economics move around.","So we are really thrilled about what the content business can mean for us in simple ways. Store traffic, our -- one of our wireless strengths is that our close rates in stores are up. We want more traffic in the store. If we have a tent-pole release from the studio and we can find a way to integrate in the stores and drive traffic, we found a synergy.","So basic things that video does, like drive traffic and hours of consumption, become assets for us to acquire value in ARPU and retain customers, and we really are getting our strides to figure out how to move those currencies across franchises. So we're really thrilled about what this can do for broadband and for mobility.","John Stankey","David, let me suggest -- I would flip your first question around slightly. I don't worry about scale and content. I mentioned at the outset of this discussion, we're going to do 70 TV shows to the industry this year out of Warner Bros. Didn't even talk about what the incremental number of series will be coming out of HBO, which is very unique, high-valued, premium content that's targeted.","Our ability as a company to decide to produce content that scales, that matters is probably second to none in the industry, and that's at a rate that I'm not sure others operate at or are just coming close to that.","I think the race is on for scaling customer bases, not scale on media content. We're on a good shape on our ability to scale media content. We have -- and we start with 170 million customer relationships in that race to have a scaled customer base to sell to. So I don't worry about that dynamic.","Randall Stephenson","And add to Stankey's comments, the 170 million, add to it what John has over at WarnerMedia, when we talk about cnn.com being the most frequented news site in the world, you put cnn.com, the Otter Media, Bleacher Report together, there's another -- I think it was almost 200 million monthly users, unique monthly users on each of those sites.","And so this is already a big scale direct-to-consumer business. And so now what can you do with HBO and some of the Warner content in terms of taking it directly to the consumer as well that add owner's economics that John Donovan just spoke of and then the ability to have owner's economics going across these platforms, pretty exciting.","David Barden","Thanks for taking the question. Thank you.","Operator","And we go to Mike McCormack, Guggenheim Securities.","Mike McCormack","Hi, guys. Thanks. John Donovan, just maybe some questions regarding entertainment margin, some puts and takes as we think about second half. Obviously, you've got NFL costs that are going to uptick. But what should we be thinking about as sustainability in that sort of 24% type range?","And then secondly, I guess, a question, I guess, just for -- actually, maybe John Donovan and John Stankey. Just thinking about the WatchTV product. I guess, firstly, any sort of early takeaways from that product, how successful it is?","And then also, can you use that as a model for more integration with the Time Warner or WarnerMedia assets? And how far can you take that without risking legacy linear distribution revenue? Thanks.","John Donovan","Yes. Thanks, Mike, a lot of questions nested in there. I'll try to be brief and have you ask follow-ups if I missed anything. If you start with video margins, you see this at the beginning of the evolution of our products that we're trying to get them, as I mentioned earlier, into affordability slots where you get high engagement and therefore, high value for the money.","One of the things that is -- it's not well published as you think about these ad stream count differentials, so you fit in the different viewing patterns. So WatchTV has a single stream product; the DIRECTV NOW having two with a pay up to three, obviously, the linear TV products, the satellite delivered and what we are going to be coming out with here in beta next quarter in the early stages, which is a broadband delivered version of it.","Now all of a sudden, you'd have a whole series of price points. And so you saw the beginning of what we're doing to reshape DIRECTV NOW. DIRECTV NOW is a placeholder in the market until the deal was finished. A placeholder in the market, that product tried to do too much and too little. So we tried to stretch it down on price. We tried to stretch it up in value.","But over time, we think that there will need to be - hit various price points and get the right package bundled in there so customers find value for it. So you saw the first moves that we added, vertical capabilities on top of it, a third stream. And when we got cloud DVR and enhanced the product, we put the price into the market rate for that price.","So we've seen DIRECTV NOW. We just had a very strong quarter of DIRECTV NOW ads. So a highlight for you that when you net all of this drama out for a minute on sub counts, if we start there, we were 25 million subscribers when we bought DIRECTV. We're at 25 million subscribers now.","Customers we lost in cord nevers and cord cutters, we replaced with products that fit their affordability range. We watched cannibalization closely. Roughly 15% to 17% on every given - in any given month is the cannibalization rate, but 1\/3 of those are listed in our linear TV product. It's very likely to churn because of their engagement and where the costs don't fit.","So we are watching that very closely. We're slotting these products into affordability and an engagement range where we get the value of it. And I'll point out to you how we procure content on WatchTV. And there's a variable nature to its cost. It is profitable and reasonably comparable to the traditional margins of the business on a percentage of revenue basis.","And so the real question that we're learning as we go, once we get out of linear TV and get into open video, which is software-based TV, how much does the category grow because we're getting cord nevers, cord cutters, but also we're getting redundant accounts where it's becoming a personal video product, where a team with a more personalized approach can build a playlist and stack their favorites in a way that it becomes a one stream product that is a playlist that behaves much like music.","So when you start to look at addressable markets, you look at the ARPU available, the margins and then you add the owner's economics, which is Brian Lesser getting higher CPMs and John Stankey having owner's economics on a portion of that video cost, now these margins start to blend up into much higher territory.","So we look very closely at the blended margin and the movement between these rungs, all while keeping an eye to make sure our subscriber counts keep us at that 25% to 30% share player in the marketplaces. So that's how we're thinking about the strategies in the margins.","And the last thing I'll point out is that on those lower-end products, on a revenue basis, I'll remind you that the acquisition cost is much lower because it's much more heavily a digitally acquired product and also, the stacked costs are lower. The cost to deploy, the cost to maintain is much lower. So over time, as we build those volumes up, those are products that will get scalable margins. I'll stop there and see if I missed anything.","John Stephens","This is John Stephens. JD, great job on that. I'll give it to you this way. First of all, Mike, we're not giving out specific guidance on margins on any of the specific businesses as I mentioned before, when I think Simon asked the question with regard to Time Warner's specific EPS impact.","What I will tell you is this. JD talked about the fact we'll be able to move DTV Now's deliverables, cloud DVR, streams, pay per view, future data insights and other opportunities, it's going to provide revenue opportunities.","Secondly, the fact that we've got the four products that are going to cut down on subscriber acquisition costs moving from a satellite -- the only truck that shows up now is now one of our trucks that hang a dish but maybe the UPS or the FedEx truck delivering that incline in the future.","All of those things give us the expectations that we can see the margins continue to improve. As our advertising team continues to learn more and get more effective, those advertising revenues will help out on that entertainment margins. So all of those things are giving us optimism as we go forward.","With that being said, we've got -- traditionally have tough compares with the NFL content so forth the rest of the year, so we're not giving specific guidance on margins for the third and fourth quarter. Well aware of the improvement in some of the stabilization of the operating contributions in the Entertainment Group, we're - we noticed that.","We're aware of it. The team's working hard to achieve that, but we'll keep this process going to see overall improvement on a year-over-year basis coming in 2019, and that's when we expect to see it.","Randall Stephenson","Okay. Thanks, Mike. Lori, we will take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. That's from Mike Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.","Mike Rollins","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. How do you view your sports rights between SUNDAY TICKET for DTV and the NBA for Turner as sustainable points of differentiation for your media strategy? And how important is it to take those content right and put them into your emerging, evolving direct-to-consumer strategy and platforms?","John Stankey","Well, let me all answer on behalf on the Turner side of things in sports and John can certainly address the NFL relationship on DIRECTV. The -- look, I view the right sports rights as being critical to our strategy over time. And I view the right sports rights with leads that want to participate in a manner that is reflective of how platforms are evolving and how technology is evolving and how consumers are changing their consumption patterns as being the right partners to work with.","And I feel pretty good about the partners that we have at Turner and their flexibility to sit down and look at new models, new approaches to how they put their content in front of consumers, how they think about the importance of digital and their product and the speed at which they're willing to move around those things.","Our advertising business is a healthier business with sports in the mix. I think you saw that in the second quarter numbers. Those were largely powered by the great performance of the NBA and a wonderful product that they have, and they're great partners.","And so I think it'll be very important for us to continue to manage that portfolio and have the right mix of sports and general entertainment in our portfolio that's attractive to customers in the linear format, and we'll continue to do that going forward. Now that mix may change a little bit.","Over time, different options may show up, but the asset test is going to be, I think, sports that are well received by customers, that are valued properly, that are flexible on how they work with distribution rights and technology and then working today's fast paced and dynamic society in terms of how they are consumed.","Randall Stephenson","I don't know -- this is Randall, Mike. I don't know if there's much to add as it relates to NFL. I think John Stankey just characterized what it is that we look for in terms of what's important when we think about sports programming.","And it's really critical when you think about our business, where everything is going, where John Stankey is going direct-to-consumer, where John Donovan is building platforms, better streaming platforms, where Brian Lesser's monetization opportunities for advertising are tied to streaming capabilities, those are probably our best opportunities. So finding sports programming that fits within those directions, where we as a company are going, are really, really important.","John Donovan","And I would also say, just as we get more targeted, just sort of one way to think about it is a sports lover in the future is not going to be the segmentation. It's going to be a Red Sox fan, a Yankee fan who spends winters in Tampa.","So these things had been acquisition tools over time. They're much more retention and engagement tools now that fit in that profile I mentioned earlier. And so we're going to really be trying to innovate on all of these things that are very segment specific, and I think you're going to see us really get creative in what we do going forward.","Randall Stephenson","Okay, very good. Listen, that wraps up what we wanted to cover with you this evening. I appreciate everybody joining us. What I would sum it up by saying is we've had a few months of distraction. And make no mistake about it. It's been a bit of a distraction for both businesses, the WarnerMedia as well as the AT&T side.","That is behind us, and we are executing. And I feel like we're executing very well on the communications business side, the momentum it's gaining as you're seeing service revenues are up. Subscriber metrics are improving, margins are improving. I feel really good about how that team is executing.","The WarnerMedia side, I couldn't be happier with the position that the company is in, the business is in, and it's going quite well. Our LatAm business, Mexico, it's going on all cylinders. It's been aggressive on pricing down there, but we are staying the course. We're competing aggressively.","We're gaining a lot of momentum. It has a strong path and a good line of sight to profitability. And stay tuned on advertising. I could not be more excited about the opportunity here for advertising, the ad tech acquisitions we've made. So thanks again for joining us and look forward to seeing and talking to everybody again."],"2525":["AT&T, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]","Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mike Viola. Please go ahead.","Michael Viola","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon everybody. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. It's great to have all of you with us. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer.","Randall will provide some opening comments and then he'll close with 2016 guidance. John will cover our results and we'll follow all of that up with a Q&A session. Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T Web-site. That's att.com\/investor.relations.","Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. You've seen this before but it says that some of our comments today may be forward looking and as such they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's Web-site.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Executive Officer, Randall Stephenson.","Randall L. Stephenson","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon everybody. Before John just steps you through the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes to just reiterate the strategy we are pursuing that is to be the premier integrated communications company in the world, and obviously that's a strategy that we are pursuing in every single market segment, and as from our largest multinational customers to the most price-sensitive consumer.","And when you look at 2015, it was an eventful year where we've put together a lot of the pieces that were required to fulfil this objective. Primarily, we closed on the DIRECTV acquisition, and we secured a very deep spectrum footprint in the government auction that's giving us the network capacity for our TV Everywhere plans, and we acquired two Mexican wireless companies with extensive spectrum holdings and distribution, and this gives us access to one of the very best emerging market economies in the world.","Now, we financed the DIRECTV and spectrum purchases at very attractive rates and we did all of this putting together and exited 2015 with a very strong balance sheet, and our dividend coverage has returned to a level that's very consistent with our historic norm.","As you look at our strategy, the core is getting the basic connectivity element right, because if you want to be an integrated solution provider, it requires more than anything else world-class, high-speed, secure connectivity, and it can't be just wireless connectivity or broadband to the home or business, but all connectivity, wireless, broadband, satellite, VPN, and it all has to be integrated.","So for example, TV Everywhere, DIRECTV is really accelerating our introduction of next-generation TV, and the DIRECTV content agreements combined with our networks is proving to be a very powerful combination. So we can now deliver the best entertainment packages over traditional linear TV or streamed over the Internet to essentially any mobile device.","A couple of weeks ago, we launched a nationwide solution that combines any of our TV entertainment packages with unlimited mobile data, so our customers can now stream their video without incurring overage charges. And this is only our first move. You're going to see the offers and the customer experience continue to get better and better as we move through 2016.","We also launched a number of integrated solutions for businesses, and I think the best example of this is our Network on Demand service which lets customers dial their bandwidth up or down literally on-demand. Internet phone service is also having a lot of success, and I think this is a beautiful example of an integrated solution. It gives a company the capability to securely access information from a mobile device over a VPN into virtually any major cloud provider, and that includes Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, or salesforce.com.","The common thread to all of this is providing our customers with a seamless integrated experience, and again the core to making all of this happen is the network, and our LTE network now covers 355 million people and businesses in North America, and we expect to hit the 385 million mark by the end of this year. We're continuing to build out our GigaPower footprint, and we can now deliver speeds up to 1 gig to over 1 million customer locations in 20 markets, and we've announced plans to enter an additional 36 markets. We also continue to expand our fiber network to more businesses, so we're really feeling good about our networks, and we believe we do have the most comprehensive capabilities now in the industry.","But to compete in today's market, the solutions do have to be global solutions because at the end of the day our customers are global, and that global focus is why we're the leader in serving multinational businesses. In fact, we connect 3.5 million businesses that include nearly all the Fortune 1000, and we do it in almost 200 countries and territories. We've extended our wireless network into Mexico now, and as you're going to see in a few minutes our growth in Mexico is exceeding all of our expectations.","And also in 2015, we built on our global leadership position in the Internet of Things and our IoT solutions are not U.S. solutions, they are global solutions. We invested very early in this space and it is paying off. We now have over 26 million devices connected to our network. We're also a leader in Connected Cars. We added a million of them in the fourth quarter and recently we completed a deal with Ford that we believe is going to connect at least 10 million cars over the next five years.","And finally, we're investing aggressively in the network architecture that is going to give us a competitive advantage in cost. We're driving the industry to software defined networks, and I have seen few opportunities over my career to drive down the cost to deliver service like this. We're also on track to deliver at least $2.5 billion in annual DIRECTV synergies by 2018, and we continue to invest in spectrum. We began last year by investing $18 billion in the auction to significantly deepen our spectrum footprint, and as a result we now have 40 MHz of fallow spectrum to deploy over the next few years to support TV Everywhere.","But just as important is the impact that such a deep spectrum footprint will have on our cost to build and operate our networks. So as we look out over the next few years, we're convinced the software and defined networks combined with the DIRECTV synergies and our deep spectrum position are going to give us an industry-leading cost structure, and our objective is really straight-forward, we want to move the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit.","Today, we think we're a company with no obvious peer. We have a nationwide TV and wireless footprint. Our IP broadband footprint reaches nearly 60 million customer locations. We have end to end capabilities in enterprise, world-class distribution, and a globally respected brand, and while all these transformative moves were taking place, we executed pretty well in 2015.","If you look at Slide 5, as you see, adjusted EPS growth was solid, our cash flows were way up, margins continued to expand, and consolidated revenue growth was on track. We ended 2015 with 137 million mobility subscribers, 45 million video subscribers, 13 million IP broadband customers, and an LTE network that's covering 355 million people, and we're seeing nice growth across all of our key product categories. In the fourth quarter, we had really solid net adds at wireless, satellite, video, and IP broadband.","So to wrap it up, strategy is working. We have the critical capabilities we need to execute the strategy, and I'm going to hand it over to John now, and then I'll come back later to give a full year outlook for what we see in 2016. So with that, John?","John J. Stephens","Thanks, Randall, and hello everyone. It's great to have you on the call. Let's start by taking a look at the quarter and our financial summary on Slide 6. We finished the year strong. We had double-digit growth in consolidated revenues, adjusted earnings, and free cash flow. At the same time, we continued to see margin expansion in every segment of our domestic business.","In the fourth quarter, reported EPS was $0.65 and adjusted EPS was $0.63. That's up more than 12% over last year's fourth quarter. This includes adjustments for merger and integration related costs and the annual mark to market of our benefit plans. This strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations and some deferral of recognition of video revenue.","Consolidated revenues grew to $42.1 billion. That's up more than 22% year-over-year, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. That growth comes even with lower equipment sales as customers chose to hold on to their smartphones for a longer period of time.","During the quarter, the Company aligned DIRECTV's revenue recognition for new customer promotional offers to AT&T's practices. The Company will now recognize revenues from customers reflecting the amounts billed over time. Recognition of expenses will not change. The fourth quarter impact of this change resulted in lower booked revenues by about $300 million, and it had a corresponding impact on income, margin, and a $0.03 impact on EPS as well.","Cash flows continue to be a great story. Free cash flow was more than $3 billion in the quarter and nearly $16 billion for the full year. That brought our free cash flow dividend coverage to about 64% for the year.","Let's take a closer look at our operational highlights, starting with Business Solutions on Slide 7. The biggest news here in our Business Solutions segment was our dramatic margin improvement. EBITDA margins improved 360 basis points year-over-year as cost efficiencies far outpaced equipment revenue declines. Equipment sales were down year-over-year as we sold fewer handsets and less wireline CPE to our business customers, but higher-margin service revenues were essentially flat on a constant currency basis with rolling strategic services and wireless services largely offsetting legacy wireline declines.","We continue to see stabilization in our wireline data revenues. Total data revenues now comprise nearly 60% of wireline business revenues. Growth in our most advanced products is keeping pace with declines in legacy data services. Strategic services revenues grew by more than 10% year-over-year and when you adjust for foreign exchange pressure, growth was even stronger coming in at more than 12%.","We served the total connectivity needs of our customers and more and more that means mobility. Mobility and cloud solutions are changing the way business gets done and AT&T is delivering this to customers. We're connecting people, cars, homes, cities, devices, machines and businesses to the Internet and each other. We've established ourselves as the world leader in IoT. We signed more than 300 new Internet of Things business agreements in 2015 alone. Our recently announced new Connected Car agreements with Ford and BMW build on our industry leadership in that category and our new Smart Cities and Connected Health initiatives demonstrate how connected devices can help cut costs, grow revenues, boost efficiency and satisfy customers' needs.","Let's now move to our Entertainment Group results on Slide 8. This is our first full quarter reporting with DIRECTV and the results reflect the growing revenue and increased profitability that we expected to receive from combining these operations. Reported revenues for the quarter more than doubled year-over-year, mostly due to the DTV acquisition, but our U-verse revenues also showed solid growth.","We also saw exceptional margin expansion which points directly to the benefits of the acquisition. Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%. That's up more than 800 basis points year-over-year. We shifted our marketing focus to driving satellite net adds and you can see that in our subscriber results. Satellite net adds were 214,000 with our total video net adds for the quarter down just slightly.","We've been really pleased with our growing flow share with DIRECTV. Year-over-year gross adds have been up every month since the deal was closed, thanks in large part to our wider distribution. And we are seeing an increase in satellite customers in our wireline footprint bundling broadband with their video service. Sales of satellite and IP broadband to new customers were up 60% from the end of the third quarter this year. That helped drive the increase of more than 190,000 total IP broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter.","It's still early but we see a lot more opportunity to use video to drive sales and lower churn for all of our services. Our new unlimited wireless data for combined wireless and TV customers has been very popular since we introduced it two weeks ago. We've already had more than 0.5 million wireless subscribers sign up for the unlimited data plan and TV net adds are going strong as well, and we expect to launch a variety of new video entertainment packages this year.","These offers definitely add some sizzle to our bundling offers but the real impact is to build a strong relationship with our customer base. Our goal is that TV Everywhere experience with broad viewer choice both inside and outside of home that is simple and easy for our customers to use. AT&T is already a leading provider of online video.","Our DIRECTV app already allows live video streaming of more than 100 different networks and by the end of the first quarter we expect to have nearly all the top 25 cable networks. We've already seen about a 50% increase in the number of customers using the DTV app since the second quarter of the year. We are driving an OTT capability with our video services, one that provides great choices at a fair price and that's [indiscernible] is also a win-win for the content providers in our integrated offerings.","Now let's move to our U.S. Mobility results on Slide 9. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are now divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, we're providing supplemental information for our total U.S. wireless operations here.","During the fourth quarter, total net adds came in strong with 2.2 million new subscribers and with gains in every customer category. That's the third consecutive quarter where net adds have exceeded 2 million. Almost 1 million of those net adds were branded which includes both postpaid and prepaid, driving positive phone additions in the quarter. We're putting a lot more focus on branded customers and with good reason.","Cricket has energized the prepaid space for us. We added more prepaid subscribers than any other carrier in 2015. In fact, we added more subscribers than the rest of the industry combined, and Cricket churn is coming in at industry leading levels. This helped drive an increase of 213,000 branded phone subscribers in the quarter. Compare that with our postpaid pressure of about 250,000 phones, the vast majority of which were higher churning feature phones with average ARPUs at about $35. All the while three quarters of our Cricket gross adds in the fourth quarter were on rate plans that were $50 or higher. This points the overall strength of our business and our ability to operate an efficient smart business in the competitive mature market.","We also continued to grow our high-value smartphone base, adding about 1 million branded smartphone subs during the quarter. At the same time, we had another strong churn quarter. Total churn was down year-over-year once again, thanks to our great networks, our quality offers and our top-notch customer service. Postpaid churn came in at 1.18% for the quarter, an improvement from the year ago quarter, and full-year postpaid churn was 1.09%, one of our best years ever. That's an impressive performance at a time when we focus on higher value subscribers in a heavily competitive market.","And I need to add a point about the Cricket churn. We have seen improving churns throughout the year even as we shut down the legacy CDMA network and move subscribers to our 4G LTE network. Fourth quarter Cricket churn was the best yet, coming in at 3.8% or 170 point improvement over last year's fourth quarter and about half when you look at the comparable weak fourth quarter from two years ago. Cricket has become a powerful part of our wireless story and we are very pleased at how it's performing and we expect it to do even more in 2016.","Wireless margins and ARPU are on Slide 10. Our relentless efforts to drive efficiency and move our smartphone customer base to the no subsidy model once again drove record wireless EBITDA margins. You can see this clearly in our operating expenses. Equipment revenues were down more than $700 million, mostly due to lower upgrade volumes. Total cash operating costs were down 1.8 million, thanks to our sharp focus on cost management and efficiency. That helped increase EBITDA by nearly $900 million in the quarter and drive our best ever fourth quarter EBITDA service margin of 43.2%.","We also had our best ever full year service EBITDA margin coming in at 46.7%. By the way, if you exclude regulatory and insurance fees from service revenues, as some of our competitors do, our full-year number is about 50%. Total wireless revenue was impacted by lower smartphone sales. Service revenues continue to stabilize. Equipment revenues also were impacted by increasing number of bring-your-own-device subscribers. We had about 700,000 in the quarter. That includes those who purchased new smartphones through vendor leasing programs or vendor installment programs. BYOD sales are our lowest cost subscribers and we're happy to have them. They value our quality network coverage and reliability as well as our [indiscernible] selection of rate plans.","Phone-only plus Next ARPU continue to grow at a steady pace, up 4.6%, even with a growing number of BYOD subs. The number of smartphone customers on no device subsidy plans continues to expand. More than two thirds of smartphone subscribers or nearly 70% are on no subsidy plans with about 46% of that smartphone base on AT&T Next plans.","Now let's look at our international operations. That information is on Slide 11. The wireless scene in Mexico is really getting [indiscernible] these days. First, we blew through our year-end 4G LTE deployment target by reaching 44 million POPs. That puts us well on our way to our next benchmark of reaching 75 million POPs by the end of the year and it brings our North American LTE coverage to 355 million people, which is more than any other carrier.","We also launched our rebranding to the AT&T name in several areas, beginning in markets where we've deployed LTE. That includes Guadalajara and Monterrey with Mexico City slated for April. And we continue to expand our distribution network. We've added 1,000 new store locations since we acquired these properties earlier in the year. All of this helped drive strong subscriber growth for the quarter with nearly 600,000 total net adds with gains in both prepaid and postpaid.","Mexico financials continue to reflect our operational investment and strong subscriber growth. We expect comparable results for the first half of the year and the investment cycle to continue through 2016. In Latin America, our DIRECTV operations continue to show solid growth on a local currency basis, but foreign exchange rates continue to pressure our results. Revenues, ARPUs and margins are all pressured by FX, are being hampered by challenging economies across Latin America. Subscriber pressures in Brazil impacted net adds. But even with all of this, we generated modest positive cash flow from these operations in the quarter.","All in all, we feel very confident that we will be able to create value with this business and with these assets. We're more integrated with the day-to-day operations and we have solid local management teams that are adding stability in a very challenging economic environment.","Now let's move to the consolidated margins on Slide 12. Consolidated margins reflect the overall strength of our business. Adjusted consolidated income margin came in at 16.8% in the quarter. This was a 230 basis point improvement over the year ago fourth quarter. And adjusted EBITDA margin was 160 basis points higher than a year ago. Strong fourth quarter results helped drive 130 basis point improvement in the full-year adjusted operating income margin. That's a tremendous accomplishment for a company with $146 billion in revenue.","There were some reasons for this improvement. Strong margin expansion in our Entertainment Group and Business Solutions and our focused sales approach and efficiencies in wireless drove strong consumer mobility margin gains as well. We'll continue our laser focus on cost reductions. We've driven savings through greater efficiencies, productivity gains and expense savings. Project Agile continues to build momentum as do our Digital First initiatives. We're seeing cycle time reduction and lower call volumes.","Software defined networking will radically reshape not only our cost but also the flexibility of our network deployment. Our margin momentum continues to be strong. We're confident we'll continue to expand [indiscernible] margins and to cut costs to offset pressure while we're in the investment cycle in Mexico.","Cash flows were outstanding in 2015. Let's take a look on Slide 13. We improved our ability to generate cash in 2015 and our ability to have strong free cash flow even with strong capital investment. In the fourth quarter, cash from operations were more than $9 billion and we've generated more than $35 million in operating cash flow in 2015.","Capital investment totaled $6.8 billion for the quarter. This includes about $700 million that we spent in Mexico where we received equipment and are putting it into service in the normal course, but we've got financing terms from our vendors that don't require us to pay for it until the end of 2016 or a little bit later. For the year, we made capital investments of nearly $21 billion.","Free cash flow was $3.1 billion. For the full year, it was nearly $16 billion, coming in higher than our increased guidance. We also continued to tap the securitization market to manage working capital with Next. We received about 900 million in the fourth quarter. When you combine this with the foregone payments from prior securitizations, the net impact is about $100 million of pressure on cash flow. So cash flow in and of itself was very strong from operations.","In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion for the quarter and about $10 billion for the year, which gave us a payout ratio of 64%. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.31. We ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. We're proud of our ability to generate cash. This gives us the financial strength to invest in our business, reduce debt and return substantial value to our shareholders.","Now, I will turn it back to Randall to provide our 2016 outlook.","Randall L. Stephenson","Okay. Thank you, John. Last summer we provided a long-term guidance after we closed the DIRECTV deal and it really hasn't changed. We're tracking almost exactly on what we told you. And so when you look at 2016, what you can expect is double-digit consolidated revenue growth, adjusted EPS growth in the mid-single digit range or better, stable consolidated margins with a solid business plan to improve in each segment even while we're investing in Mexico. Capital spending will be in the $22 billion range with our focus on cost efficiencies and SDN creating a downward bias to that forecast, and we expect our free cash flow dividend payout ratio to be in the 70s with a goal of growing free cash flow this year.","So that kind of wraps it up and with that John and Mike and I are glad to stay in for questions. So, Tony, we'll turn it back to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Michael McCormack","John, maybe just a comment on the service revenue in overall wireless should be sort of lapping the big mobile share value push last year. Just trying to get a sense for the trajectory on the year-over-year decline. It looks like it continues to get better. I'm assuming we should expect that throughout the year. And then secondly on the Entertainment segment, I guess looking at sequential margins versus year-over-year, it looks flatter sequentially but there was the impact of the revenue recognition change. Just trying to get a sense for what we should be thinking about with margin trajectory there, maybe particularly as you go in there and get more wireless rights for content and maybe where those wireless right content costs flow through the model?","John J. Stephens","Let me give you a couple of insights there. First into the service revenues in wireless, we have to wait and see what 2016 brings, but we're expecting it to improve throughout the year, the year-over-year trends. We continue to see a little optimism in what we're seeing from the customers and demand, so we expect to see improvement throughout the year in that service revenue.","On the Entertainment margins, the first point I'd like to make is the $300 millionrevenue deferral did impact margins in this quarter. The margins would have been close to a couple of basis points higher if we would have had that recognition. That's the first point I want to make to you.","Second point, what we'll see is we will see the merger synergy savings starting to show up in margins in 2016, and specifically most of the $1.5 billion worth of run rate savings we expect to get to by the end of the year we'll start seeing coming through the Entertainment Group. As we go through the year, we'll see what happens with other competing interests, but clearly those items are leaving us with the expectation that we will have improving margins in the Entertainment Group.","Michael McCormack","John, just as you sort of progress on getting more and more mobile rights for content, how should we think about where those incremental costs for the rights should flow through, is it entertainment or is it on the mobility side?","John J. Stephens","We expect it to flow through in the Entertainment Group.","Operator","That will come from Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Philip Cusick","Two things. First to follow-up on Mike's question, can you just remind us, John, what the deferral is and will that impact revenue any further or is this sort of the most you'll need to defer? And then second, Randall, since 2009 you've been known as a bit of an economic savant. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing from your customers in the U.S., both consumer and enterprise, and do you see any signs of economic weakness?","John J. Stephens","Phil, on the revenue deferral, this had to do with one of our major contracts and a customer signed up a two-year contract, and so previously DTV had recognized equally over each month of the contract. We recognize it as we bill it. So we just came to a consistency, brought it to the AT&T methodology. So that $300 million is not in anyway, shape, or form lost revenue, it's just deferred, doesn't change our customer contracts, it won't change our cash collection. It's just a deferral. And additionally, we didn't defer any expenses. We continue to recognize any out of pocket expenses with regard to that in the same way we have done before.","Philip Cusick","And that's mostly only going to impact 4Q, right?","John J. Stephens","There will be some further impacts throughout next year, but by the end of the next year, we'll get into the situation where the originating piece and the reversing piece of this will be offsetting, but that will take us through the next year.","Philip Cusick","Got it.","Randall L. Stephenson","Phil, this is Randall. 'You're economic savant', I've never been called that. So it won't surprise you what we are seeing. We are seeing some softness if you look at enterprise business on anybody that has anything that touches oil and gas industry. All those companies are a little bit defensive right now as you might guess. Also anybody, big exporters, people who are exporting, who have exposure to foreign currencies, particularly the strong dollar, we're seeing weakness there. But I will tell you, we are kind of netted out. Our revenues kind of held their own on the business side because we are taking share and NetBond and Network on Demand, we're having a lot of success in the marketplace, and so we're taking share and holding our own but we are seeing some softness in those areas.","The consumer continues to spend money. In fact, there's a decent holiday season in light of really aggressive competition, but the consumer continued to spend money. I might have anticipated, in fact I do anticipate a little more robust Christmas season because you're seeing energy prices at lows we haven't seen in a long time, and you didn't see the step-up in consumer spending that you might've expected in the third and fourth quarter. But the consumer did continue to spend.","As we look at 2016, we've built this plan around a 2% GDP growth rate in the U.S. roughly, and there's a lot of science that goes into that but you can basically turn around and look at the last few years, you see it's been 2%, it's not really hard to forecast it these days. We've been fairly tight in terms of hitting our estimates for the last few years.","What I am concerned about, I'll be honest with you, is as you look at 2015, there are a lot of things that went the consumers' way and that went the economy's way, not the least of which are energy prices. But even over the last few years, there's been some benefit from 2 million people being put back to work. And so as we get to end of 2015, those benefits that we've seen over the last couple of quarters, if you look forward, are you going to see those in the future, probably not. And so I made a comment last week that got picked up that we're assuming 2%, if you ask me to kind of handicap is there more downside or upside to that, probably downside, but it's probably within a tight range of 2% is what our estimate is right now.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski","The first question I wanted to ask was around your strategy in the mobile area. As you mentioned, Randall, during the prepared remarks, you have unveiled what I assume is the first of many plans integrating your mobile and video anywhere solutions. How should we think about your approach towards the competitive landscape going forward in terms of your go to market strategy? I mean it does seems though on a relative basis you probably weren't as promotional as some of your competitors, and would love to hear your thoughts as we progress through 2016.","Randall L. Stephenson","So we closed DIRECTV on July 24 and immediately put in place some plans that will be kind of for the first phase of integration. We brought the TV capability into our retail stores and have had nice lifts, as you heard John talk about going through his remarks, and then January we did the unlimited data plan for our TV subscribers.","What you should expect is you're just going to continue to see as we roll through 2016 capabilities and offers that take advantage of putting the two together, and the customer experience is going to continue to get better and you're going to see offers that we think are unique in the marketplace. I'm not going to get very detailed with you right now, Amir, because we are still in the process of getting some of the really critical content deals secured, but things are coming together very nicely and you're going to see this kind of a phased rollout over the next few days and in fact over the next 45 days you will get your first look what one of these will look like, and so stay tuned.","But I think it will be an eventful year for the industry as we rollout new and different kind of capabilities, new and different type of programming options for the mobile device and even new ways to think about how you price in a mobile-centric environment. So actually I'm very energized and the further we get into it and work with our partners on the content side, the more energized I get about it.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much. And then maybe if I can switch gears to the video side, as you mentioned it seems though you continue to benefit from [indiscernible] integration has progressed, are you on the verge of rolling out more converged offerings with broadband and video and how should we think about that opportunity set for yourselves?","Randall L. Stephenson","So, Amir, I'll tell you right now we are early in the process. The sales channel is just really starting to get their legs underneath them on how to attach satellite and mobility together. This is a new category and so we're very, very new in this and the performance continues to get better and better in the sales channel.","Also keep in mind that we don't even have the installation workforce up to speed on provisioning this. So we're just getting the installation and workforce up. We just had the latest union contract gave us the rights we needed to push this out across our entire footprint. And so you're going to see us continue to get better and better there as well.","As you pointed out, the satellite adds were strong in the fourth quarter but U-verse churn offset that, so we were slightly negative in total. You'll see that relationship get better and we are doing some things to shore up the U-verse base because we are focused on the satellite product and so as a result you're seeing U-verse churn up. We're doing some things to shore that up. It will improve. Not the least of which, we did some things on pricing to ensure that we can help begin to mitigate the U-verse churn.","The other thing we did, and it's early but I think we are going to see some not inconsequential impacts from this, is the unlimited offer for all of our TV customers. U-verse customers can now step into an unlimited data offer and this is we think a hugely retentive offer. It's a great value for our customers to have this type of offer put in front of them.","So we think you'll see the U-verse churn get better, you'll see the subscriber numbers continue to improve as we move through 2016 and the sales channel improves, the provisioning channel improves. And then some of these offers I talked about, some unique offers that will be mobile centric offers and some unique content available, we think those are going to continue to add momentum to this as well. So bottom line, we think the subscription numbers get better as we go through the course of the year.","Operator","The next question in queue will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman","John, just a question on the cash flow outlook that you provided for this year, you obviously gave us some help thinking about the revenue, the EBITDA and the CapEx piece parts in that calculation. I think you mentioned some deferred CapEx related to Mexico. I'm curious if that's factored into the guidance. If you can give us any help on how to think about cash taxes with deferred bonus depreciation or extended bonus depreciation and anything else that we need to think about, like pension, that would be very value added. Thanks so much.","John J. Stephens","Couple of things. One, with regard to the deferred payments in Mexico, those have been our plans all along. We continue to work on the cash flow opportunities and we're doing for a number of years. So those are all in already. There's nothing new here.","Secondly, with regards to bonus depreciation, as we told the community when we first gave our guidance that we were taking that into consideration assuming that we'll get passed but we would meet that \u2013 we would meet this guidance even if it didn't get passed. It has gotten passed.","The one point I would make to everyone is that it's now 15 years our bonus depreciation has been in place, and so getting the bonus depreciation extended for five years and [indiscernible] is really important, but the creation of benefits from bonus depreciation is now being largely offset by the reversal of prior year's benefits that have been taken by taxpayers. So it's much more of a balancing item there.","With regard to that pressure on cash flow, it did not come from our pension. We have a pension contribution we'll make this year and about $200 million but that's already been in the plans. That's the only thing that's required. Our pension plan is very well funded.","And then we do expect total tax payments to be up this year on a year-over-year basis, but as you know from our prior year filings, our tax payments were really modest last year, and so we would expect those to go out. But all in, we feel pretty comfortable hitting our guidance and we are certainly working very, very hard to do better on that guidance.","Brett Feldman","And just to make sure I heard it correctly, and maybe I didn't, but I think you said that this year's CapEx did include some of the deferred payments in Mexico, meaning that you will hit your free cash flow next year even though you have already recognized the CapEx early on your [indiscernible]?","John J. Stephens","So [indiscernible] talk about CapEx is like it was this year that it was 20.7 and we'll have about that 15% of service revenues which is about, so it gets to be about $22 billion for this year. That will be our CapEx. The working capital impact of paying for some of last year's purchases this year is in our working capital calculations. I think of it separately from my CapEx numbers, but yes, it's already in that guidance, so we will be adjusting the guidance for that.","Operator","The next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David Barden","Maybe this one is for John or Randall, for the first time in a while we're looking at some reasonably comfortable headroom on the balance sheet, 2.3x leverage versus I think your kind of historical comfort level limit of 2.5 turns, and for a company of AT&T size that's a real money. Obviously we have the 600 MHz auction coming up. New York Post tells us you are buying Time Warner. It is obviously a lot of things that could be on the agenda here including just sticking to your deleveraging agenda. Could you kind of rank order some of the ways you want to use what headroom appears to be there relative to the deleveraging priorities?","John J. Stephens","With our strong cash flows, we're going to continue invest in networks as we've said, keep this quality up and keep these product offerings moving out and we feel comfortable about doing that within that $22 billion range, but we do believe that positions us well. We do think that includes all our merger and integration activities. We've got a lot of fallow spectrum out there that we bought over the last few years. So we're in a very good position to be able to operate within those kinds of parameters and still provide the highest quality service.","With regard to the cash after we've done that investment [indiscernible] and we're going to continue to be [indiscernible] loyal and respectful of our shareholders in accordance with our Board's direction. Third, we're going to focus on reducing debt levels. But with that, as you do that, you keep your balance, be strong and keep opportunities available, but that's where we'll be focusing.","Randall L. Stephenson","It's right now I think we've been pretty clear that the next couple of years we want to get our debt levels back down to kind of more normal levels for us. We spiked them a little bit to get the spectrum bought last year and then also to do that DIRECTV deal. So we'll spend the next couple of years working the debt back down before we start talking about different capital allocations in terms of share buyback or anything of any magnitude.","David Barden","And could we interpret that as being kind of relative to historical comments of being willing to bid for instance $9 billion in the 600 MHz auction, would those comments, Randall, suggest that maybe you're going to take a much more conservative attack as that comes up?","Randall L. Stephenson","We'll see what the auction brings and then how everybody participates, but I haven't been bashful in saying if there's an opportunity to get another 2x10 at that spectrum, we would pursue it. And so we think we can do that within the guidance John has given here and execute on that, but we'll have to see, David. It's not yet to us really clear what the spectrum footprints are going to look like and whether you can piece together truly a ubiquitous 2x10 type footprint which is really important to us to be bringing another band of spectrum into our operation, it's going to be really important to have a ubiquitous broad footprint. And so we'll have to look at that and obviously we're going to have to look at the person, that bid that the government has just issued the RFP on. So there are a lot of ways we'll evaluate the spectrum scenario, but it's reasonable to assume that we'll be active one place or the other.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.","James Ratcliffe","Two if I could. First of all, just to dive in a little more into the DTV integration, any incremental thoughts on sizing what the revenue upside there is? I know it's early but now that you have for example some track record regarding unlimited data and you'd be able to share data across the two operations. And secondly, any incremental thoughts and the status of sponsored data and how you expect to see that roll out over the course of the year?","John J. Stephens","On the DTV integration and the revenue upside, let me frame it this way. We are pleased with what we have seen so far, specifically the unlimited data and the wireless I mentioned here. We had 500,000 wireless customers signed up for it already. So we're overall pleased with it. We think there's [great opportunity] [ph] there. The timing of those could give us a reason for some carefulness there for this reason.","For example, Randall mentioned the training of our technicians who do the installs. We're just going through the completion of that now, and that's really going to be more off a second half of the year where we'll see how really effective that is. We have seen a lot more bundling of the satellite with broadband but we need some more time to make sure that we understand the momentum of that and the progress of that.","Additionally, we are still going through the sales process of training our reps who never sold broadband when they sold satellite before or who sold broadband but never sold satellite before, and as Randall pointed out, because we sell wireless we have to increase all their sales activities, whether in the stores or in the call centers.","So all of this is going to take some time for us to really track [indiscernible]. I will tell you, we are optimistic and pleased with the initial results but giving any guidance on the revenue synergy sort of perspective is a little premature.","Randall L. Stephenson","On your question on sponsored data, James, I think it's important to think about what we have assembled here. And so between DIRECTV and our Otter Media relationship, we think we have the best premium set of content available to anybody anywhere and we're getting the rights secured to allow us to begin delivering this over whatever platform the customer wishes. If the customer wants it on a tablet or a smartphone or on a TV and we're getting to the place where we can do that.","Now if you think about the most premium set of content, whether it would be sports programming, whether it would be binged type programming that has stacking rights and [look-back] [ph] capabilities, whether it would be movie libraries or whatnot, it's just a very, very robust set of content that we're piecing together here to be delivered. I think one would just have to assume that sponsored data would be a critical element on how the customer would take advantage of this.","And so we haven't developed or announced I should say, we are doing a lot of work right now on how we come to market. We have not announced any plans but I think it would be reasonable to assume sponsored data would be a part of how our customers would take advantage of this kind of content library.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Perhaps you could give us some sense of what you are including in 2016 guidance for realized synergies and any kind of expectation around what integration cost might be this year? And then Randall, following up on that content theme, maybe you can update us on the Otter Media and the joint venture with Chernin and any perspective on whether you want to get deeper into ownership of content more broadly?","Randall L. Stephenson","Simon, let's say it this way, by the end of the year we expect to be on a run rate of $1.5 billion, which is going to be about $125 million a month. That's how we think about it. That's how we're doing our plans. I certainly don't mean to imply we're at that level in January, don't want to convey that, we're not, I don't expect that, but we expect it to grow throughout the year. We did have a very good first five months of getting costs aligned and addressing a lot of the administrative or headquarter some of the easier costs to start getting out.","So we did well with that and we're making good progress on the content, and quite frankly are shifting to a satellite based customer base is helping. But from your question perspective, I would think of it in that way that we are going to hit and hopefully exceed the $1.5 billion run rate which will be $125 million a month by the kind of December timeframe, fourth quarter timeframe.","With regard to any capital required for those integration costs, that's already included in the $22 billion of capital guidance. And from the expectation of integration costs, while we have some, without giving guidance, I would suggest to you this way, if you think about what makes up our integration savings or merger savings, content negotiation, staffing, supply chain, the cost to do that are not necessarily significant. It's just a matter of getting it done and doing the business. So I wouldn't expect those types of merger integration costs to be significant.","I will tell you we're still going to have customer facing amortization, trademark, trade names amortization, those kinds of normal merger integration. We're pretty explicit with those in the details we provide in our filings.","On the content side, and specifically you asked about [RV] [ph], that's going well. We're still early, but as everybody knows, we're partnered with Peter Chernin who I think probably is the best content talent on the planet, and early leveraging the Fullscreen acquisition that we did out of Otter Media, Fullscreen is obviously moving into a subscription model. We're really early to see how that progresses. But we're using that platform to do a lot of work for developing what I will call mobile centric content designed for the mobile device, and very optimistic about what the opportunities are there.","In terms of other or broader content ownership, there are a number of areas where we have what I'll call proprietary content. We own a number of regional sports networks. Some of those we acquired through the DIRECTV acquisition. Others we have acquired over the course of the last year. We also have a lot of what I will call exclusive content that is produced by us, everything from the Dan Patrick Show to a particular network we have on DIRECTV and some series like Kingdom and so forth.","And Simon, you should expect us to continue to engage at that level and as we have success, you'll see us invest more in the areas where we have success, but right now I think our plate is full doing full-scale integration of DIRECTV and bringing it into the mobility channel.","Operator","The next question in queue will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Frank Louthan","Can you talk a little bit more on the mobility side about deals with Ford and so forth? Does that include getting just maybe beyond new cars but also getting into the used dealership networks? And then on the Mexico side, can you comment on your aspirations for video with those customers there?","Randall L. Stephenson","So the Ford deal is exclusively the cars coming off the manufacturing floor, and so those are new cars coming out over now in 2020. Like we said, we are expecting 10 million automobiles to roll off the floor between now and 2020 with our connectivity and just from Ford.","You bring up an interesting point and that is there is a massive used car fleet out there that is not connected and there is actually technologies that are now available. I have a sports car, old sports car that I now have connected to the Internet and it's actually a fairly elegant solution.","And so there are some capabilities that we are putting into the market, in fact we are selling into the market today, to connect the used car fleet that is out on the U.S. roads and we think that's important because the average age of a car on the road today is 11 years. And so if you really want to grow this business, you need to tap into the used car fleet. So that's a priority for us and you'll see us pursue that.","On Mexico, and as it relates to the video opportunity, we are fairly convicted that mobile and video are going to be a category that's very, very relevant in the U.S. and we're early on here in the U.S. but based on early success we continue to get more and more convicted, it is going to be an important category, bringing the two together is going to be important. And if it's going to be important in the U.S., we think it will be important in other markets and Mexico will be no different.","As you know, we have a minority share position in a satellite company in Mexico and hopefully we'll be able to do some partnering there but we do think the video combination with mobile is going to be important in all geographies in all markets.","Frank Louthan","At some point, does it make sense to take a larger position in that ownership?","Randall L. Stephenson","I don't know if our partner has any interest in selling that position. So time will tell. We'll just have to see.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Rollins","Just two if I could. First, the management in the past has discussed the investments in broadband within the wireline footprint over the last few years. Is there a way you can size the footprint where you've made the upgrades but you are underpenetrated for broadband share and help us think about the gap you hope to close given the speeds that you are now offering? And then if I could just throw in a second question, I was wondering if you could share some of the segmentation of how you spent capital in 2015 capital expenditures specifically and how those allocations might change as you look at the 2016 budget?","John J. Stephens","Let me take a shot at this. With regard to our wireline footprint, we have about 60 million IP broadband enabled customer locations [indiscernible] from our consumer side and we've got about 15 million IP broadband customers today. So these are round numbers. The stat profile will give you the details. But with that, you can see that [indiscernible] penetration right now is about 25%. The key change here is the fact that we now have a national video product in DIRECTV and a satellite product, and such that we didn't have that before.","So many of our, if you will, broadband capable locations didn't have a video offering, now they do. And so as we improve this single [indiscernible] capability, this sales channel capability, all of that, we expect to grow that share and we would expect that it would be a significant improvement over where we're at today.","With regard to the expansion that we are doing now with regard to fiber, we are seeing very good results and the ability to always have video available with the satellite product is going to prove I think to be very beneficial for us. So we will expand on that 60 million footprint over the next four years when we will also get to \u2013 some of it will overlap but we will get to 14 million fiber-enabled and quite frankly there is a likelihood that we may get to more than that when we are finished. So that's the way to think about that footprint issue.","With regard to the capital spend, you are right, we don't go into great detail on the capital spend because in our wireline and wireless footprint and we are an integrated carrier, the spends become overlapping, whether you're taking high-speed backhaul to a sell-side or whether you are stripping wireless traffic or wireline traffic or an IP backbone.","But from a general perspective, in 2015 we spent probably about half of our capital in the wireless area, the other half in the wireline area, and if you will the [indiscernible] the shared services area. I will tell you that pickup in the fourth quarter in part was due to Mexico and in part was due to the set-top box and the sales opportunities in DIRECTV. So, I'll give you that way to think about it and I think that will be kind of a consistent story as we go through in the coming years. We are investing at a rapid rate in all of our businesses.","The one thing about our wireless business is when you've got the tower network that we have today, the infrastructure that's been there and you have the spectrum holdings that we have today, you can do great things with quality service, at least our networking can do great service and continue to meet all the needs and you can be pretty effective with your capital spend.","It's not a situation where there isn't investment, it's that much of this investment has been made over the last three years for the spectrum purchases through the VIP project putting extensive fiber into the ground and backhaul capabilities and we are going to continue that quite frankly with GigaPower as we put more fiber near other cell sites that we can then give even better high-quality backhaul. So it's a really integrated process but needless to say we continue to be very proud of the performance and continue to invest there.","Randall L. Stephenson","Don't forget software defined networking continues to push capital requirements down over the next three or four years. We think it's going to be significant.","John J. Stephens","Tony, we'll take one more question.","Operator","And that will come from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Timothy Horan","Just a couple of follow-ups. John, so maybe just on the cash tax rate, can you give us maybe a little bit more color? I think Verizon said in the high 20% range. I know you've reported taxes of 35% over the next few years. There's a lot of moving parts. But is kind of mid 20% range look pretty good? And then a quick follow up for Randall.","John J. Stephens","Tim, [we don't like to give that guidance] [ph] but let me say it this way. I can completely understand how Verizon or [indiscernible] a similarly situated company can get to that level.","Timothy Horan","Got you. Randall, clearly there's unprecedented technological change of cloud and artificial intelligence and everything else going on and you've had a lot of your peers slash CapEx and OpEx spending and Sprint seems like they are really on the road to doing that right now, but we've had a lot of European carriers do the same thing. I guess the question I get a lot is, how much of a focus is that at AT&T and do you have confidence that you can kind of see some of these benefits? And I guess maybe in that regard, I know you have Project Agile out there, any kind of update on where you are in that process and ability to cut expenses, that would be great?","Randall L. Stephenson","When you think about software defined networking, as you think about the merger synergies for DIRECTV, $2.5 billion run rate synergies, you think about all this going on and just the core business, you've got Project Agile John does where we are really just streamlining a lot of various operations, moving a lot of the customer interaction at their request to digital, the opportunity is really impressive to continue taking expense out of the business.","I would tell you, if you look at just this quarter's results, it ought to give you some degree of comfort in terms of what's possible, even at a company of our size and our scale. Whether it's Business Solutions segment, our Mobility segment, our Entertainment Group segment, consolidated \u2013 I mean it was a clean sweep in terms of taking margins up and we weren't taking them up 5 or 10 basis points, the margins really moved up considerably. And so we feel really good about the path we are on and the momentum we have on the cost side of taking cost out of the business.","On the capital spending side, this is a unique opportunity. We're at a place where a lot of things are converging in terms of maturity that's going to create some incredible opportunities as we go forward. These ubiquitous high-speed mobile networks, I mean they are here and they are ubiquitous, they are low latency, combine that with cloud, combine that with data analytics capabilities that are available to the masses, I mean the world of big data is here and it's available to everybody, and then sensors.","The sensor technology, the ability to actually put in sensors at virtually no \u2013 I mean the cost is nominal to put these sensors in place. Millions upon millions of these sensors, all of these, these four elements coming together at one time is a massive opportunity and people are not thinking about how to take advantage of ubiquitous mobility, high-speed, low latency networks with cloud, with data analytics, with this sensor technology are going to miss it and we think we're at a place right now where we have a unique position on bringing all of this together and creating growth. We're going to invest through this cycle. We're going to invest in video and making sure we can deliver video to our customers, we think that's going to be a huge opportunity, and expanding our footprint into Mexico.","I mean all of these are converging we think to give us a growth platform for the next four or five years that is unique. So we're trying to be prudent, our downward bias on an incremental basis of capital. As we continue to emphasize that, we are being more and more efficient with our capital spend. John pointed out the implications of spectrum. Don't miss this. As you deploy these 2x10 MHz blocks of spectrum, the efficiencies it brings to building and operating mobile networks is significant and we think we're in a very unique position in that regard too.","So I said in my opening comments and I'll say it again, our intention is to deliver over these networks the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit to deliver. That's our objective and that's the path we're headed down. So we feel good about being able to achieve that.","So thanks for the question and I also thank everybody for your participation on the call. We are off and running with the DIRECTV acquisition in Mexico, those are going well, and we feel good about where we are as a business and looking forward to 2016. So thank you for your interest.","John J. Stephens","Thank you all. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today.

I\u2019m Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John will provide an update with perspectives on the quarter then we'll follow-up with questions. Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That\u2019s www.att.com\/investor.relations.","I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on slide 2. This presentation and comments may include forward-looking statements. They\u2019re subject to risks. Results may differ materially. Details are in our SEC filings and on AT&T\u2019s website.","Now before I turn the call over to John, let me quickly cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on slide 3. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.67 that\u2019s up more than 11% over last year\u2019s first quarter. Our results this quarter include about $0.03 help from an income tax settlement, when you exclude this earnings per share was $0.64 for about an 8.5% increase over last year\u2019s adjusted first quarter EPS of $0.59, which is adjusted to exclude our divested Ad Solutions unit. ","Consolidated revenues excluding Ad Solutions were up 0.9% year-over-year. Thanks to solid revenue growth in wireless, continued gains in U-verse services and growth in strategic business services. Revenues were impacted somewhat by lower regulatory fees this quarter. When you normalize for the difference in these charges, consolidated revenue would have grown 1.3%. Consolidated margins were down slightly year-over-year primarily due to wireline pressure.","Cash flow started the year strong. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled $8.2 billion and free cash flow was $3.9 billion. And we continued buying back shares as part of our repurchase program. In the first quarter, we bought back 168 million shares for $5.9 billion. ","With that overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?","John Stephens","Thank you, Susan and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for being with us today and as always thank you for your interest in AT&T. Before we get to the detailed results, let's start with a quick overview, highlights are on Slide 4.","First, we had a solid start to the year. Earnings per share growth was strong. Adjusted consolidated revenues increased. And cash flow continues to be a success story for us. We added more than $2 million IP broadband connections in the quarter when you combine both wireless and wireline connections. ","In wireless, it\u2019s all about the mobile Internet. Data growth was strong, smartphone sales set another first quarter record. Tablet showed post-paid growth with an exceptional quarter, and customers continued to flock to our mobile share plans making it easier than ever to add new devices and drive further growth. This resulted in improved revenues, better margins, post-paid ARPU growth and lower churn. ","In wireline, U-verse continues to shine. We had our best ever U-verse high speed Internet sales in the first quarter. This drove positive broadband growth. In fact, we had our best total wireline broadband growth in nine quarters. U-verse video sales also were strong, as we added more subscribers than we have in any quarter over the last two years. ","So the team is executing at a high level and we have the right strategy. Our financial results were solid, our capital structure sound, all in all a solid start to the New Year. ","Before we move to operational results, I\u2019d like to give you a quick update on Project Velocity or Project VIP. Details are on slide five. It\u2019s still early, but we already have made tremendous progress with our LTE deployment. We are running ahead of schedule with nearly 200 million LTE POPs covered to date. And we expect to complete nearly 90% of our $300 million POP LTE build out by the end of this year. The LTE network also is operating at high levels. First our LTE network is the fastest in the nation that\u2019s supported by an independent third-party testing group. ","Then on wireless network performance including call, text and data. RootMetrics ranked AT&T number one or tied for number one in 14 of the 23 markets they have surveyed so far this year. And this comes on top of ranking first or tied for first in more than 70% of the markets RootMetrics surveyed in the second half of last year where we had deployed LTE. ","Our U-verse VIP deployments will begin rolling out later this year. But the incredible first quarter U-verse results add to our confidence in making this a larger part of our growth strategy. We had record high-speed IT broadband net adds along with increasing U-verse video games. We continue to gain market share in areas where we offer U-verse and Project VIP expands those areas even more. ","The same holds true with our strategic business service revenue growth and our fiber build into business. Even in uncertain economic times, we are seeing growing demand for high-speed connectivity and our advanced dial services. These results once again are going to show that Project VIP is working and the right strategy for AT&T.","Now, let\u2019s move to our operational results starting with wireless, where we had another solid quarter. Thanks to continued growth of the mobile Internet. Revenue and ARPU are on slide 6. Mobile data continues to surge. Revenues were up 21% in the quarter that helped drive 3.4% service revenue growth and total wireless revenues were up 3.4%. You will recall that we adjusted the way we book our data revenues which no longer include text messaging, and as you can see this quarter mobile data continues to surge. It\u2019s now at $20 billion annualized revenue stream growing at 21%. You also can see the impact of data growth when you look at postpaid ARPU.","Data ARPU grew 18% and total postpaid phone-only ARPU was up 2%. Total postpaid ARPU, which includes high margin, but lower-ARPU tablets and other non-phone devices, also grew in the quarter, up about 1%.","Our postpaid smartphone base also continues to expand. Those details are on slide seven. Smartphone subscribers increased by more than 1.2 million in the quarter and by more than 7 million in the last 12 months. Overall smartphones now make up more than 70% of our postpaid phone base and smartphones accounted for nearly 90% of postpaid sales in the quarter, giving us even more room for smartphone growth. These are the premium subscribers in our business.","They have twice the ARPU of non-smartphone subscribers and much lower churn. So their conversion brings additional revenue. Another new first quarter smartphone sales record of 6 million helped drive that growth. We had 4.8 million iPhone activations in the quarter while our upgrade rate was steady when compared to the last year\u2019s levels.","The number of postpaid subscribers on usage base data plans also continues to grow. Overall, almost 70% of our smartphone base has moved to usage base plans. ","Mobile share plans continue to be popular by the end of the first quarter, mobile share accounts reached $3.3 million. These accounts include about $10 million subscribers or devices such as smartphones and tablets. This growth is even more impressive when you remember that we give customer the choice when picking a data plan allowing them to pick the one that works fast for them. At the same time, take rates in the higher mobile share data plans those that are 10 gigabytes or higher continue to run above expectations with more than a quarter of mobile share accounts on those plans.","And we continue to see a steady movement of subscribers on unlimited plans taking advantage of Mobile Share, more than 15% of subscribers have moved over from unlimited plans or about 1 million subscribers today. ","During the quarter, we introduced larger Mobile Share plans targeting businesses as well as consumers who need more data. These plans offer up to 50 gigabytes per month and provide an attractive revenue yield. We also see the impact of the mobile Internet on our postpaid net adds, details are on slide 8. We have strong gains in tablets, this new growth area draw postpaid growth of almost 300,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter. We also had another solid quarter with our connected devices adding 431,000 subscribers primarily with security and tracking devices. ","Reseller and prepaid impacted our overall result or overall net adds. Reseller had a net loss this quarter primarily due to resellers rationalizing there are no or low usage accounts. These disconnect had a negative impact of more than 600,000 on reseller subscriber net ads in the quarter and on total subscriber net ads in the quarter. Although the reseller volumes involved were significant, it had little impact on revenue. In fact, our reseller revenue is up more than 50% year-over-year.","Prepaid sales continue to be impacted by declines in session-based tablets. We do see some changes across the mobile marketplace. As always, we continue to evaluate and look for opportunities to take advantage of our network, including new product offerings, funding opportunities and alternative forms of distribution, but we also continue to see improvements in churn.","Postpaid churn had another strong quarter, down year-over-year and sequentially. And we had our best ever first quarter smartphone churn, which was less than 1%. We did have a policy change with regard to third-party retailers that had a small impact on churn, but with or without that change, we saw a reduction in churn and we continue to see year-over-year improvements in postpaid churn.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at wireless margins on slide 9. Our wireless margin story continues a trend we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters. Smartphone sales continue to be strong, but even with increased sales, margins are expanding. The story is no different this quarter. We set our first quarter record of 6 million smartphone sales, yet our wireless EBITDA service margin was 90 basis points higher when compared to the first quarter of 2012 or 43.2%.","Smartphone subscribers continue to be a wise investment. You know the long-term value they bring; higher ARPU, lower churn, strong data growth, driving growth in operating income, which was up more than 4% year-over-year.","We really feel good about our wireless position. Revenues continue to grow with expanding margins. The mobile Internet continues to bring strong data growth with more and more subscribers on usage-based data plans, customers continue to embrace our Mobile Share plans helping drive tablet growth and our LTE deployment is ahead of schedule and winning praise as the fastest in the industry. So, all in all, a really solid wireless performance has set the stage for a strong year in 2013 and beyond.","Now, let\u2019s look at our wireline operations, starting with consumer, which you can see on slide 10. Once again, we had another impressive U-verse performance with accelerating subscriber gains. The growth of our high speed IP broadband has been nothing short of dramatic. We added more IP broadband subscribers this quarter than ever before, more than 730,000, which helped drive our best total broadband net ads in two years. IP broadband now makes up more than half of our total broadband base with an ARPU growing at more than 9% year-over-year, plus we are gaining share against our competition.","U-verse TV also had a great quarter. We added 232,000 U-verse video customers, our best showing in nine quarters. These gains help drive overall consumer revenue growth of 2%. Adjusted for changes in regulatory fees it would have been nearly 2.5%, with U-verse revenues up more than 30% in the quarter often ever increasing base. So once again another solid quarter in consumer, and we see more opportunity for growth with our increasing U-verse penetration and planned Project VIP expansions.","Now, let\u2019s move to wireline business, which you can see on slide 11. When you look at the three major components of wireline business, you\u2019re seeing a similar story that we\u2019ve talked about in prior quarters. The continued drop in small business starts is still pressuring that part of the revenue stream. Wholesale and government solutions continue to be challenged and our enterprise revenues after showing some positive signs last year were challenged in the first quarter. Combined business revenue was down sequentially and year-over-year, pressured somewhat by regulatory fees. Adjusting for those fees total business revenue was down 2.7%.","One bright spot was the strong growth in strategic business services. Those are products that are part of our Project Velocity investments including VPN, Ethernet, Hosting and other Advanced IP services. These were up 10.8% even in a very difficult economic environment. Expenses were down year-over-year to help offset some of the revenue decline, but uncertainty with the economy continues to be the issue. ","Customers are delaying buying decisions, unemployment improvement continues to lag, the business overhang from regulatory uncertainty persists, and government budget issues are all having an impact on our customers and on our results, but the most challenging aspect for us is trying to forecast the future in this environment. Like others, we are looking for consistent signs of improvement. One thing that is not faltering in our confidence in the future is that it will be driven by high-bandwidth connectivity, mobility and the clouds. Nobody is positioned better to take advantage of these opportunities once the uncertainty passes and the economy turns.","Let me give you more detail on slide 12. AT&T is a recognized leader in solutions for hosting and cloud services. We offer network-centric integrated solutions that provide value to customers on a global basis. The foundation for our cloud services is having one of the worlds most powerful and advanced global MPLS networks that span 187 countries. We operate 38 datacenters that are fully integrated with that network, providing top-of-the-line security, reliability and management.","We see a future where our wireline network assets and mobility come together in the cloud that will mobilize workforces to access business information in a secure environment. AT&T\u2019s expertise in this area has been recognized recently by industry analyst Gartner, who gave the company the highest rating for important capabilities for network services. We have the network, the right tools and the right products to win in the fast developing cloud market and we\u2019re best positioned to take advantage of the growing opportunities in this space.","Now, let\u2019s look at margins and cash flow, consolidated margin comparisons are on slide 13. For the first quarter consolidated margin was 18.9% down slightly from the year ago first quarter. ","Wireless margin expansions offset wireline pressure. However expenses from corporate and new business initiatives did impact the overall margins. In wireline, pressure from business as well as success based expenses in consumer drove operating margins down slightly. Helping offset this pressure were growth in consumer revenues, operational improvements and solid execution of our one AT&T cost initiatives. ","We continue to expect consolidated margins to be stable this year with growth in wireless offset by pressure in our investments in our wireline business. ","Now let\u2019s move to cash flow, which continues to be a very good story for us. A summary is on slide 14. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled $8.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.3 billion with more than half of that invested in the wireless business, which gives us free cash flow before dividends of $3.9 billion more than $300 million improvement over last year\u2019s first quarter.","Our CapEx expectations continue to be in the $21 billion range as we ramp Project VIP throughout this year. However, we are adjusting our longer-term capital spending expectations. We now expect capital spending to be in the $20 billion range for both 2014 and 2015 that is down from the $22 billion level we expected when we announced Project VIP last November. This reduction brings no slowdown in our Project VIP deployment. ","As we have refined our VIP planning, we are seeing greater integration efficiencies in our spending curves. Our LTE build is accelerating into this year\u2019s spending. That along with additional savings in non-Project VIP spending gives us confidence to revise our expectations without changing our overall build targets. Post Project VIP, we expect capital spending to take a step down to more normal levels.","Moving to dividends, payments for the quarter totaled $2.5 billion and we repurchased 168 million shares for $5.9 billion. This makes our total return to shareholders in the first quarter more than $8 billion and more than $30 billion in the last five quarters. Plus, as we announced last month, the AT&T Board approved an additional $300 million repurchase authorization. The Company expects to make huge repurchase decisions opportunistically, which will likely slow the pace of buybacks compared to recent activity.","In terms of uses of cash, total debt was up in the first quarter as we took advantage of historic low interest rates with a debt-to-capital ratio of about 46% and a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.68, well within our guidance in the 1.8 range or lower.","We also continue working with the Department of Labor on a plan that would contribute a preferred interest in our AT&T Mobility to fund our pension plans. We continue to be optimistic on the strategy and expect approval of this proposal in 2013.","So all in all, another solid financial performance. Our balance sheet is sound, our debt metrics solid and our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives while returning value to shareholders.","Now, before we take questions let me close with a quick recap on slide 15. We are off to a good start to the year, and what gives us a lot of confidence looking ahead is that we built a strong, very strong foundation for growth for 2013 and beyond. ","The spectrum position is solid. We are tracking ahead of schedule with our LTE deployment. Our 4G LTE network is the nation\u2019s fastest and winning quality awards across the country. Our capital spending is more effective and efficient than we originally expected. Insurance down and ARPU\u2019s are up and our smartphone and tablet gains continue to be very strong. The number of subscribers we have on usage-based plan is climbing fast. And on top of this, we have one of our best U-verse quarters ever and that\u2019s before our Project VIP wireline expansion really starts to ramp, which we expect to only make all of these things stronger as we move into the second half of 2013 and beyond.","So, we feel good about the foundation we\u2019ve built. We feel good about the momentum we have. We are positioned to grow even in this slow economy. And we are well positioned to continue returning substantial value to shareholders.","With that, Susan, let\u2019s go ahead and take some questions.","Susan A. Johnson","Thank you, John. Tony, we will now open the call for our question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.","Michael I. Rollins \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Thanks and good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the business revenue in more detail in terms of implied erosion of legacy services relative to strategic, is that being hurt by the cyclical as well as the secular, and is that something that continues at this rate, or do you see some improvement coming over the next 12 months to 24 months in that segment? Thanks.","John Stephens","","So, good afternoon, Mike. Real quickly, if you breakdown the three segments, so to speak, of our business revenues into the small business side, we\u2019re encouraged by the acceptance of high speed broadband, U-verse type products, but the business is still challenged by lack of starts. We\u2019re seeing some positive improvement in our Wholesale business, but in our Government, Education And Medical, are still being really challenged by the economy and by funding, and Enterprise is continuing to be challenged by uncertainty and, if you will, delaying decisions even though they are spending on speed and advanced data services.","When we look at the overall business services, Mike, I think about it this way. It\u2019s hard to predict until we get some economic clarity, because while unemployment or regulatory concerns or government spending maybe affecting us as a individual company separately in different ways, it\u2019s definitely affecting our customers and still we get some clarity on that, it\u2019s hard to predict. But what we do feel good about it is the position we are in, when it turns, because we can provide that combination of integrated services like no other. Hopefully, that answered your question, Mike. ","Michael I. Rollins \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Good afternoon, John. You had a very good U-verse numbers, can you talk a lot about, what was driving that specifically? It doesn\u2019t sound like your footprint has expanded dramatically, that\u2019s going to be later on, was it promotional activity I see you\u2019ve got a few new offers out there and do you think that this is sort of a new kind of turn in the corner as the DSO base becomes lower and then given your sort of leverages, is that moving up towards your 1.8, what\u2019s the latest thinking around potential for asset sales or other monetization? Thanks.","John Stephens","Thank you, Simon. And quite frankly on our U-verse positive developments both in small business and in consumer, I would tell you that the simple answer is really, really quality execution by our people and their teams. Certainly there were some promotions, certainly there were good opportunities that presented itself from existing assets, but I would tell you, that it focused on reducing churn, that it focused on shortening installation times, they focused on converting customers from legacy DSL services to the high speed U-verse services. It was really a whole collection of really quality execution by the team and I think that\u2019s what really drove it.","As you can see, we still drove revenue growth and we still are getting very good revenues on their triple-play on the consumer side, so it wasn\u2019t just incentive driven, it was really performance. ","With regard to our balance sheet and our wherewithal, I guess the first item I point out here, Simon with regard your same question. As we\u2019ve shown, we got a great balance sheet, very strong, strong cash flows, very great coverage of all of our responsibilities. So, we feel good about where we\u2019re at. ","Clearly aware what\u2019s going on in the industry with regard to monetization strategies, we have a responsibility to look at all of those because we are here to monetize and maximize value for our shareholders, but with the strength of our balance sheet, we can be careful and prudent with regard to taking those steps and are not necessarily in a position, where we need to do any of that.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead","Phil A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys thanks. I\u2019m thinking about the revenue for guidance that you\u2019ve talked about in wireless for mid single-digits long-term. And I\u2019m struggling to figure out and sort of goes into subscriber and ARPU side as more of the subscribers come from tablets and assuming Digital Life launches fairly soon (inaudible) an update there. ARPU\u2019s slowing down hit 3.5% revenue growth in wireless this quarter. Can that be sustained given sort of where want the industries going and not growing by much, and two, coming to the other side of the smartphone growth or do we really need to prepare ourselves for us lower ARPU, lower revenue growth in wireless going forward, thanks","John Stephens ","Thanks, Phil. First and foremost, we still feel good about our guidance about mid single-digits throughout the growth in the mobility business. I would suggest a couple of things, one; we do still have room to grow on the smartphone as we mentioned. Sales rates are 90%, current customer base is at 70%, that give us a lot of room to grow. ","Secondly, we continue to see the adding of tablets and other DAM devices so that\u2019s going well. As we continue to complete our LTE deployment, we expect and we\u2019ll continue to see growth in other services like video and so forth. So that should provide us with future growth aptitude and all of that as before we roll out things like Digital Life, the connected card, Mobile Premise Solutions and a lot of the other opportunities that we have moving forward. ","So we still feel good about where we are at, we are opportunistic and pleased about we\u2019re going think will forward with that. You specifically ask the question about Digital Lift, we\u2019re going to launch I think we\u2019ve announced, we\u2019re going to launch 15 market in the, by the middle of the year in the spring of this year and so I think you will be hearing more about that soon.","Phil A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","If I can just follow up for a quick second.","John Stephens"," ","Sure.","","Phil A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","It seems like the wireless industry this quarter at least on a voice basis it\u2019s going to be very negative. And it looks you\u2019re negative on your own in terms of voice. Is there an acceptable situation for AT&T and can you continue to be set of negative on voice overtime as competitor set of loose your subscribers or do you need to tun it up a little bit and try and be positive there.","John Stephens","I guess, let me make one of the point that (inaudible), and I think people going to work our churn is done, and the fact that is continuously going down or really optimistic about growing revenues from that perspective, and as that happens we will see impacts on our total revenue base, but if you are asking, are we going to continue to see some form of conversion of revenue from voice to data that would surprise us, but we are positioned well with usage base plans to capture the revenue opportunity the Bad Data provides. So still feel good about all those opportunities, we just need to continue to execute and continue to move forward with our LTE, Bill.","Phil A. Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John C. Hodulik \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Hey, thanks John a quick follow-up just on Bill question, really more focused on the ARPU, you saw some deceleration if you look at some of the components I think at least phone-only ARPU went from 2.5% growth last quarter to 2% this quarter, and then the dilution from these other high margin low ARPU devices almost doubled from 0.6% to 1.1%. I guess first what is driving the phone-only deceleration, is that just you still got a lot of penetration to go, but maybe the incremental penetration from a smartphone standpoint is slowing, and really if you put all these points together, should we continue to expect to see deceleration going forward or is it more of a alternative subs sort of story and less of an ARPU story, and then one of the thing I mean I don\u2019t know, you guys broke out home phone customers last quarter, I wondering if you guys are giving our that number, thanks.","John Stephens","John a couple of things, one ARPU is always impacted by quarterly fluctuations and level of sales and so forth, but quite frankly this quarter is impacted compared to prior quarters, but a change in the regulatory rates, there was 10% change in the regulatory fee rates that are charts are included our revenues, and so that I think it explains a fair amount of the differentiation in some of the revenue growth. That\u2019s all it is. So from that perspective when you take that into consideration, still feel real good about where ARPU is going and our phone-only ARPU.","John C. Hodulik \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Okay. So the regulatory did hit that phone on the ARPU number?","John Stephens","","Yes. I mean the\u2026","John C. Hodulik \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Okay. Got it.","John Stephens","U.S. ARPU rate is one down from 17.9% to 16.1%, about a 10% reduction.","John C. Hodulik \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Got it.","John Stephens","So that\u2019s impacting all of our growth rate numbers and it\u2019s just part of the process.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Mike McCormack with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","","Hey, guys, thanks. John, can you just talk a little bit about, again on the wireline margin side. I know there is typically some first quarter seasonality to the others. Are there pieces that we should be thinking about the Project VIP impact, I guess I was expecting more of a sort of 2014 impact on success base. So I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s been pulled forward, and can you just give a little more detail around that? And then lastly, any reaction to the upgrade policy chains on wireless at Verizon? Thanks.","John Stephens","So on wireline margins, it\u2019s specifically with regard to U-verse. A couple of points, Mike, I think you\u2019re heading on. One, our expansion of our footprint for U-verse services from Project Velocity is really a leader this year in 2014 type event. The sales and success in customers at both video and IP broadband was really great execution in this first quarter. It was an expanded selling space, but with that we still had success based cost and so we\u2019ll take those for these long-term valuable customers. So that\u2019s what I expect of it.","Two, I had expected as we expand the footprint and get additional coverage that we got out of Velocity, you will continue to see some really solid numbers and some pressure from the success of sales. I just believe the first quarter results there are real positive for going forward. So, I mean, you are right, we always have some first quarter pressure with regard to margins, that\u2019s not unusual, but it\u2019s in the comparison to last year also. ","Mike McCormack \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Is this the run rate we should be thinking about John as we progress through the next couple of quarters?","John Stephens","Yeah. I would suggest it this way. We still think we\u2019re going to come in slightly below. We all changed that guidance slightly below last year\u2019s margin amount, but we feel good about the efforts the team has gone through to manage the margins and if you think about the challenges we face in the business revenues, were really performing well on cost management. ","Mike, on your question with regard to some of the changes going into the marketplace, absolutely the marketplace is dynamic and it\u2019s changing and we\u2019re looking at those changes and evaluating them and trying to stay current with all aspects of it. I don\u2019t have anything to announce today, but we\u2019re respectful of our competitors in this environment, but we\u2019re also pretty comfortable with the fact that we\u2019re going to be able to continue to compete at a very high level. ","Mike McCormack \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great, thanks John. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, great. Thank you. John, maybe a couple of questions, first on, tablets, you obviously had a really good quarter. You had a partial subsidy model attached to that and I am wondering and thinking through that is the subsidy maybe something you used just to stimulate demand temporarily and to replace these devices in the base or is that more of a sort of recurring part of the model if you go forward. ","And then second question just on leverage, the 1.8 turn, I think my understanding was to create room to invest in Project VIP and to go through a big capital cycle over the course of 3 years and still leave room to buy back shares aggressively if you wanted to. With reducing the capital spending targets here but still leaving the leverage target out there, sort of the same ratio does that signal an intention to continue to tap that capacity for additional share buybacks? I know you said buybacks were slowing from here but it seems like you still have plenty of room, is that the case? Thanks.","John Stephens","Okay, great Jason. Let me cover you second question first. With regard to the 1.8, it was a couple of things, yes it was a recognition of the fact that we\u2019re going to add some higher capital spend. And 2, it was also a recognition of historically low interest rates. If you look at our interest expense first quarter \u201912, first quarter \u201913 you will see that even though our debt levels have increased, our overall interest expense is down and that\u2019s really what we were trying to take advantage of. It\u2019s the fact that there is a lot of really inexpensive or attractively priced debt capital and with company like ours who has a very solid dividend, we are finding prudent in making the decisions about which capital to utilize.","With that being said, yes the reduction in the project VIP capital projection of the last two years will provide us additional flexibility and that is important to us. With that being said we\u2019re going to stick with what we guided in the presentation and that is we\u2019re going to be opportunistic with the additional buy back. We\u2019d expect to finish this $600 million share authorization in the second quarter and we will be opportunistic and potentially buy at a slower pace as we go forward.","The other question, I think you had, Jason, was on tablet and I would suggest you that you\u2019ve identified it right. We put that in place to see how it would work to stimulate demand and see what kind of, not only take rates we get on the tablet, but also what kind of ARPU\u2019s we would get. After our initial testing of that in the fourth quarter we decided to stay with it because we have found that the economics make a lot of sense.","I won\u2019t suggest to you that it\u2019s a permanent offering, but I\u2019ll suggest to you it will continue to moderate and make a decision as we go forward with regard to keeping in place or adjusting it, just like we do with all our product offerings.","Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in the queue will come from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Colby A. Synesael \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. I\u2019ve two questions. First, on the regulatory fees both in wireless and wireline, curious if those all began on January 1 or if that happened mid-quarter and therefore there is more of an impact to be seen in the second quarter, and also how that relates back to your previous guidance of 2% or greater than 2% consolidated revenue growth? And then, my second question has to do with M&A and what\u2019s the company\u2019s appetite for M&A particularly outside the U.S. and even more so in Europe. Has that increased or decreased perhaps over the last, I guess, since the beginning of the year? Thanks.","John Stephens","So, welcome Colby. The first thing I want to mention to you is that right now we are not changing our guidance with regard to greater than 2% of revenue growth for the year or certainly sensitive in a situation at hand with regard to the economy and the impact it\u2019s having on business revenues. So we want to be respectful of that and we understand those aspects. So the challenges of the economy and the challenges arise from business is something we follow very closely.","With regard to the regulatory fees, those rates are in place for the quarter. That differential was for the first quarter. The new rates have been established for the second quarter and I believe the differential year-over-year is about the same in different rates, but it\u2019s about the same step down. So somehow that regulatory fee pressure will continue throughout the second quarter. We\u2019re aware of that and so we\u2019re taking that into account in all of our planning.","With regard to M&A activity, we don\u2019t comment on any M&A activity and I\u2019m not going to do that now. Yes, we\u2019ve said before. The real issues we find is that the U.S. marketplace that we operate in is well ahead of, appears to be well ahead of the rest of the world and mobility and the developments [around] mobility and as stewards of our shareholders\u2019 assets, we need to see if we can provide and take advantage of the assets and knowledge we have and provide value for our shareholders based on what we\u2019ve learned. But we don\u2019t comment on M&A activities and I won\u2019t comment any now.","Colby A. Synesael \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","David W. Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. John, it looks like with the tax benefit in the income statement and the deferred tax gain in the cash flow statement, it looks like you guys got about $1 billion tax contribution positive to the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about how you see that shaping up over the course of the year contributing to the $14 billion free cash flow or better guidance, and then obviously how the contribution of the wireless business is going to layer in over the course of the year on that front? ","And then, a second question, if I could just kind of go back to this. I just want to be kind of make sure I understand what\u2019s that. I think what you were saying is that from a competitive standpoint, from a wireless subscriber of growth standpoint, AT&T is satisfied with how you did this quarter, say the course in terms of general approach to the market irrespective of what\u2019s going on T-Mobile. And then, as the LTE business kind of ramps up look to that for future revenue growth opportunities. Is that a fair assessment of what you said earlier? Thanks.","John Stephens","","Thanks, Dave. Let me take one at a time. First of all, on the tax side of the earnings, we recognize the fact there was around a $0.03 benefit in the income tax line, a reduction of expense and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve adjusted in our presentation. If you pull that out that leaves us with an effective tax rate just under 33% and I think those of you who probably know that are kind of normal effective tax rate to somewhere in that 33% to 34% range, they wouldn\u2019t expect that to be any different for the rest of the year.","Secondly, with regard to taxes and cash flow, first of all, we take into account and as with our cash tax payments as we determine cash flow and as part of our cash from operations. So that\u2019s all included and we continue to guide that pre-cash flow will be in excess of $14 billion this year. I understand people questioning that number based on the fact that we are $3.9 billion in the first quarter and that\u2019s higher than last year, understand the question, but right now we will continue to guide to greater than $14 billion.","With regard to mobility business, make sure I clarify the sense of we follow the marketplace. We continue to look at what others are doing and what we are doing ourselves and we continue to develop ideas and methodologies and processes to be more competitive. The best example I can give you is the Mobile Share plans as well as Digital Life. So we\u2019re doing that all the time. We will continue to do that, don\u2019t have any new ideas or new product offerings or bundles to announce to you today, but I don\u2019t want to suggest to you that, there is a lack of activity on improving our business or growing it more rapidly than it\u2019s growing today. ","David W. Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. And John, just a follow-up quick on how the contribution of the wireless stake is going to get flow through the tax fine and casual benefit for rest of the year?","John Stephens","Yeah. We have taken into account any of the tax benefits at cash or expense benefits into account in our planning, in the guidance we gave in January and quite frankly the cash flow guidance which I just refreshed and EPS guidance which is what I was changing has already taking that into account.","David W. Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks guys. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Timothy Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer","Well, thanks guys. Just two broad questions; back on the wireless front, John maybe to go into little bit more, do you think you have pricing power in wireless as it improve versus where you were couple of years ago and do you think you can take advantage of that?","And then secondly, maybe you can built into on the supplier side a little bit more, it sounds like the CapEx obviously it\u2019s coming below expectations for the next couple of years, which is great, but is that something that\u2019s coming from just better pricing that you are seeing on the supplier front?","And I guess back to question I have on second quarter, can we start to see the same thing on the handset side? Do you think you have a little bit more leverage at this stage on the hands of supplier front. Thanks.","John Stephens","","So, good to hear from you, so let me pick a few things. One thing, I would tell you this on the wireless side, the way I think about it is this improving network that we have and the recognition from RootMetrics now, the fastest, but the highest quality and this more rapid deployment than we expected that I expect with regard to our LTE really gives us feeling good about the opportunities for the overall wireless business to add more customers through lower return, retain more customers and to generate revenue from usage-based devices. So I think, if you will, the powerful piece of our wireless business that\u2019s going on now is really this opportunity to utilize that really powerful LTE network and grow the business. That\u2019s how,","With regard to CapEx, I would suggest you that there is couple of things going on. One, we got deployment out of the LTE faster on an accelerated basis even last year when we guided to finish at 150 million LTE POPs and we have the earnings now. So we\u2019re at about 170 million and now we\u2019re guiding to be nearly 90% complete with our 300 million POP by the end of this year. So that acceleration is taking some of the CapEx pressure off of 2014 and 2015.","Secondly, we are finding that the integration opportunities when we do, if you will, a bottoms up build plan analysis or finding more integration efficiencies and opportunities than we had originally planned for and that\u2019s driving a lot of the savings. And third, the ability to get out there quicker is really taking off some of the pressure that we expected there with some of our core non-velocity investments. So those are all combining. We\u2019re getting efficiency and the build and effectiveness of build and pushing it that way. I would suggest that\u2019s where the capital savings are coming from.","The last thing Tim, I would suggest you as we are always looking at ways to improve the economics of the handset model. We think that\u2019s certainly really important and we continue to look for ways to do that, but I will tell you we continue to do with the focus on the customer and making sure we developed ideas that are not only focused on economic efficiency for us but for customer satisfaction. We believe we have to have both piece of that to really be successful long-term within.","Timothy Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Chris Larsen with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. And Chris Larsen your line is open please go ahead with your question.","Chris M. Larsen \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc. ","Yeah, I wonder if we could switch over to slide 12 where you talked about the cloud and hosting there. And two questions specifically, first, if you could talk a little bit about what you have been seeing in terms of pricing on cloud. There has been a lot made, the recent pricing declines out of the Amazon and Rackspace and how that has affected you? And then given the fact that you dedicated a slide or two in your slide deck, maybe you can size up that opportunity, how big does that have to come before, can begin to move the needle here on the top line for wireline results? Thanks.","John Stephens","So a couple of things. One, we forgot to how move the needle on wireline results, as you all know our wireline revenue base is in that $60 billion plus range. So I\u2019ll leave it your own judgment on how big it need to get, if you will move that needle. But we believe it\u2019s a real opportunity for us to help us growing that revenue and also providing us the opportunity to continue to provide those network base services. So, keeping the traffic on our services as well as providing the security and the other hosting services. ","So, we believe that the opportunity is strong for us. I would suggest you even recent events will tell you that with regard to our managed network in our security opportunities will provide an even better advantage for us that\u2019s one. ","With regard to recent pricing activities, I would suggest you that I think there is going to be continued pricing movement in this area, we\u2019re aware of that, we\u2019re prepared for that. But we feel long-term we can provide a quality product with good margins to generate returns for our shareholders. So we think it\u2019s very much worth our investment. And specifically we believe it because, we have the, if you will dual side of not only providing the cloud and the hosting. But also being able to provide the mobility connectivity to that for a customer\u2019s employee base. So we feel really good about both sides of it.","Chris M. Larsen \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc. ","Thank you.","Susan Johnson","","I think we\u2019ve got time for just one more question.","Operator","Thank you very much. And then final question will come from Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brett J. Feldman \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for getting me in. So some of the earlier questions we\u2019re sort of eluding to the fact that your postpaid phone base slipped a little bit in the quarter. And obviously the first quarter is seasonally slow and so it\u2019s hard to read into that. But if you put seasonality aside, what do you anticipate for your traditional phone base going forward? Is it something that we should see outside of a seasonally slow period continuing to grow or are you somewhat indifferent now not because you don\u2019t care, but just because the real revenue growth driver going forward is data volume on your network and not necessarily the net changing your phone base quarter-to-quarter.","John Stephens","Yeah, so I think we do find important to continue do if you will grow our phone base, but more importantly convert our phone base because if you think about that the differential between 70% of our postpaid and the 90% sales flow. If you think about that on our base it\u2019s 14 million customers and when you convert them to smartphones you may think of them as a phone but there are generating significant data usage on the network and an opportunity for real revenue creation, so we are focused on, but we are also focused on growing our customer base. I don\u2019t want to leave you with the impression of just conversion, it\u2019s both and we believe we are positioned well to do that. So I think it\u2019s both aspects of that, but when we got the quality network like we do and great sales operations like we have and a customer focused approach, we are optimistic about our ability to be very successful. ","Brett J. Feldman \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question. ","John Stephens","I want to thank you for being with us this afternoon. We have had a solid start to the year and believe we have built a very strong foundation for growth going forward. Our momentum is solid, our balance sheet is strong and our Project VIP expansion is going to bring us even more opportunity. As always, we thank you for being on the call and we thank you for your interest in AT&T. Good night.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&T's Executive teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"2526":["AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call April 26, 2016  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Michael Viola - Investor Relations","John Stephens - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Mike McCormack - Jefferies","John Hodulik - UBS","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","David Barden - Bank of America","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital","Michael Rollins - Citi Research","Tim Horan - Oppenheimer","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Amy Young - Macquarie","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the 2016 AT&T First Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Michael Viola. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Viola","Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. It's great to have everybody with us today. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John will cover our results, and then we will follow with a Q&A session. Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That\u2019s ATT.com\/investors.relations.","Of course, I need to call your attention to the Safe Harbor statement before we begin. The Safe Harbor says that some of the comments today may be forward-looking; and as such, subject to risks and uncertainties, and results may differ materially. Additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website. I also want to remind you that we are in a quiet period for the SEC spectrum auction, so we cannot address any questions about spectrum today.","Now, before I hand the call over to John, let me quickly call your attention to slide 4. Slide 4 provides a consolidated financial summary. We had a very good first quarter at AT&T. First quarter consolidated revenues grew to $40.5 billion, largely due to the acquisition of DIRECTV, but we also saw growth in video and IP-based services on a comparable basis. This offset pressure from lower equipment sales as well as foreign exchange.","We continued our streak of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and after adjustments \u2013 and, by the way, the adjustments included removing over $700 million of benefit from spectrum swaps with other industry participants. And so with those adjustments, first quarter EPS was $0.72, up 10.8%. This strong growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations.","Margins also continue to be a great story. We saw consolidated margin growth, with margin expansion in every domestic business segment. Operating cash flows were up more than $1 billion year-over-year, with free cash flow of $3.2 billion, a 17% increase from a year ago. Capital investment is on plan, coming in at $4.7 billion.","And so with that, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens.","John Stephens","Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thanks for being on the call. As Mike said, we turned in another solid financial performance. Revenues grew, margins expanded, and we had our fourth straight quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Growth in strategic business services, IP broadband, and video were big factors. And ad sales in our entertainment group is now more than $1 billion in annualized revenues and growing.","What makes our revenue results even more impressive is we did this with lower equipment sales and with more than $500 million of pressure in foreign exchange and with the ongoing pressure of exiting some of our marginal businesses.","We are on track to reach a run rate of $1.5 billion in cost synergies from the DIRECTV deal. We are also taking cost out of the business and driving greater savings through efficiency initiatives such as Project Agile, and transforming our network with software. This gives us the financial flexibility to invest in growth initiatives such as our Mexico operations.","At the same time, we are also executing on our commitments to transition and transform our business. We\u2019ve been consistent on this for years, transforming our smartphone base, transitioning from subsidies to equipment plans, moving our broadband-based IP and our legacy database to strategic services. We have done a lot of work, but we have a lot of more to do.","Our video customers are shifting to satellite. We are moving our 2G customers onto our new LTE networks and we are continuing to use bundling offers to take advantage of our integrated networks. All of this makes us feel really good about our direction and the strong start to the year. We\u2019ve built a solid record of setting goals and achieving them. We are very confident that we will continue to do that and transform our business.","Let's now take a look at our business operations, starting with growth in our business solutions segment. Those details are on slide 6. Solid wireless revenue gains drove overall growth in business, and more than offset lower equipment sales and foreign exchange pressure. Total business solution revenues were up slightly, with business wireless revenues up 2.3%, reflecting smartphone and tablet gains, as well as more customers on lower-churn business plans.","Margins also continued their growth trend. EBITDA was up more than $300 million as cost reductions added to our revenue gains. Margins grew to 38.7%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, thanks to a focused performance by the entire team.","Looking at our customer segments in business, all retail customer segments showed growth and our wholesale business is on plan, even though revenues were pressured. Legacy data continues to migrate to our IP strategic business services.","Total wireline data grew slightly in the quarter, and is now about 60% of wireline business revenues. Driving that growth is strategic services. Revenue grew by nearly $250 million over last year's first quarter. That is up 9.3%. And if you adjust it for foreign exchange, growth would have exceeded 10%.","Strategic business services are now more than $11 billion in annualized revenues. We also are seeing continue demand for highly secure mobile business solutions. Security continues to be the top of the mind for our business customers. Every enterprise must rethink its place in today's connected world. We are managing highly secure networks, given our unique experience. And our ability to provide business solution sets us apart, and we intend to be very active in this space.","Now, let's move to our entertainment group results on slide 7. As a reminder, our entertainment group provides video, broadband, and phone services to residential customers. On a reported basis, entertainment group revenues showed strong growth due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. However, if you look at results adjusted to include prior-year DIRECTV on a comparative basis, revenue still grew by more than 3% as IP, video, and advertising revenue growth outpaced legacy service declines.","Our high-speed Internet service grew by more than $250 million and now generates more than $7 billion in annualized revenue. And we are seeing solid growth with our add sales, which are now more than $1 billion annualized revenues and going strong. At the same time, we again saw exceptional margin expansion, which points directly to the profitability benefits of the merger. Our EBITDA margins nearly doubled year-over-year.","Taking a look at our metrics, satellite net adds continue to be strong as we added more than 300,000 in the quarter. Total entertainment group broadband net adds were positive in the quarter, driven by 186,000 IP broadband subscribers. We\u2019ve done a great job transitioning our broadband base to IP, and that transition is nearly complete. About 95% of the eligible broadband subs now have IP broadband. Half of these customers choose higher speeds, which helped drive the 16% revenue growth in IP broadband.","We also made several strategic moves in the quarter as a premier integrated communications company. We announced our new DIRECTV streaming services in the first quarter. We are actively working the content deals for these new services, and we are on target for launch in the second half of the year.","And Fullscreen's ad-free subscription service launched today. Fullscreen is majority owned by Otter Media, a partnership between AT&T and the Chernin Group. AT&T has signed on as the premier launch sponsor for the new service, and will collaborate with Fullscreen to market and promote the service with special offers for AT&T's more than 100 million video, mobile and broadband customers.","We are also seeing our broadband [audio dip] DTV go up. The attach rate of DTV sales with broadband in our wireline footprint has increased 50% since last summer. And in GigaPower areas, the attach rate improvement is even greater. Our new unlimited wireless with video offer started fast and continues at a solid pace. More than 3 million wireless subscribers signed up for this plan at the end of the first quarter with thousands more being added every day. These are some of our highest ARPU subscribers who are even more valuable to us now that they have combined these services.","Our entertainment group team is performing well on every level: merger integration, cross-selling, special bundle offers, advertising, and now streaming services. But the second half of the year is when our integration efforts really take hold. Single truck rolls, cross-selling, and new product rollouts are just beginning to take off. We are on track with all our targets, and we are very excited about what is to come.","Now, let's move to our U.S. mobility results on slide 8. Another reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are now divided between the business solution and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is also providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations.","We continue to see margin expansion and stabilizing service revenues in the quarter. Service revenues were stable year-over-year, thanks in part to having completed most of the transition to the Mobile Share Value plans, as well as adding new customers; while overall wireless revenues were down slightly due to lower equipment sales. We have changed the game with our equipment installment plans. We started the transition more than two years ago with Next, and are substantially through that transition. Our strategy is working and you can see it in our results.","Our laser focus on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove our best ever first quarter wireless EBITDA margins. Wireless EBITDA increased more than $600 million when compared to the year-ago first quarter. And wireless service EBITDA margin came in at 49.5%, its best quarter ever.","Phone-only ARPU plus Next billing continued its strong growth. This ARPU was up more than 5% year-over-year, and also up sequentially. Nearly half of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next. More than 70% of postpaid smartphone subscribers are on a no-device subsidy plan. During the quarter, we discontinued the availability of subsidized phones for most subscribers. This will drive continued growth in the no-subsidy model. In fact, 90% of postpaid smartphone sales and upgrades were all on AT&T Next or BYOD. Our branded percentage is even higher.","Now, let's look at wireless net adds. During the first quarter, AT&T posted a net increase of 2.3 million total net adds, our best first quarter ever. That includes 1.8 million domestic wireless subs. Net adds were driven by connected devices, branded phones, and tablets.","Branded domestic net adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up more than 600,000, thanks to strength in prepaid. That included 137,000 branded phone net adds. And when you include Mexico, we had nearly 1.2 million branded net adds in our wireless operations, and more than 700,000 branded phone net adds.","Cricket continues to be a great option for our value-focused customers. We had 500,000 prepaid net adds in the quarter, and nearly 1 million prepaid net adds when you include Mexico. Our ARPU for the new prepaid Cricket subs continues to run about $41. That compares to feature phones ARPU of about $35. Feature phones make up the bulk of our postpaid phone losses. And the Cricket momentum continues to grow.","We expanded our cricket to distribution to Best Buy and Aaron's locations. Crickets will be available in more than 12,000 outlets across the country. We also just introduced a new Cricket unlimited plan, including talk, text, and data for $65 a month with auto pay, and no hidden fees. We had 1.6 million connected device net adds, matching our best-ever net add quarter. We now have nearly 28 million of these devices on our network, and we are laying the foundation for future growth.","In the first quarter, we also continue to grow our high-value smartphone base. We added 1.1 million branded smartphones during the quarter. More than 95% of our postpaid phone sales in the quarter were smartphones, and nearly 90% of our postpaid phone base has smartphones. Total churn was essentially stable year-over-year.","On a related note, we are moving forward with our previously announced shutdown of our legacy 2G network. We plan on decommissioning it by the end of the year. We have taken steps to migrate our 2G customer base, and expect most to take this transition. We expect to continue to see manageable pressure in the last half of the year from subscribers, mostly connected devices, choosing not to make this migration. While this might have a slight impact on revenues, we also see the cost benefits from shutting down the network; and the spectrum will be redeployed to help meet the growing data demand of our customer base.","Now, let's look at our international operations. That information is on slide 10. We continue the hard work and heavy lifting to make our Mexico wireless operations world-class. That includes deploying of 4G LTE network, integrating operations and support services, and rebranding to the AT&T name. The team is doing a great job with all of this. Even more impressive, they are adding customers at the same time. We added more than 500,000 wireless subscribers in the first quarter, and nearly 1.1 million in just the last six months. That brings our total subscriber count to 9.2 million.","Rebranding is also gaining speed. We've launched nationwide advertising where branding in Mexico City is nearly complete. Our LTE deployment now reaches 51 million people. In just a year, we're more than halfway to reaching our commitment to deploy LTE to 100 million POPs by the end of 2018. And we are also on target to reach 75 million POPs by the end of this year. First quarter revenue reflects seasonally lower equipment sales, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, as we successfully continue to execute our strategy.","In Latin America, our video operations continue to show solid revenue growth on a local currency basis, but foreign exchange rates significantly impacted our published results. Revenues are being hampered by a challenging economy. Subscriber pressures in Brazil impacted net adds, but foreign exchange also impacted lower company expenses. We did see sequential profitability trends in the quarter, and continue to expect self-sustaining cash flow for the year.","Now let's move to consolidated margins on slide 11. Consolidated margins reflect the overall strength of our business. EBITDA margins were slightly up, and adjusted consolidated operating income margin came in at 19.9% in the quarter. That was a 110 basis point improvement over the year-ago first quarter. Strong margin expansion in our domestic segments more than offset nearly 90 basis points of margin pressure from our growth initiatives in Mexico.","Our drive to have the industry-best cost structure also is continuing on track. Efficiency initiatives and our software transformation are driving productivity gains and expense savings. On a comparable basis, our expenses were down more than $300 million year-over-year, driven by excess costs efficiencies, automation efforts in service delivery, IT rationalization, and software savings. We also continue to see lower call volumes and improvements in cycle times for our efforts to improve the sales experience.","During the quarter, we also eliminated subsidized phones for most of our postpaid customers. This should sustain further margin improvement, even though most of our smartphone base is already off the subsidy model. Our margin momentum continues to be strong. We are confident we can continue to expand domestic margins and cut costs to offset pressure while in the investment cycle in Mexico. And we expect Mexico to improve its profitability late in the year. Cash flows were another strong story.","Let's take a look at the results on Slide 12. Along with solid earnings, the margins - we also continued to deliver strong cash flow growth. In the first quarter, cash from operations was nearly $8 billion, up 17% year-over-year; and free cash flow was $3.2 billion, also a 17% increase from the year-ago first quarter. The strong free cash flow growth comes even with more than $1 billion of pressure from timing of fourth-quarter payables. With these first-quarter results, we are on track to meet guidance, and on plan to grow free cash flow for the year.","We continue to find ample demand and great rates in the securitization market to help us manage our Next receivables. We have received about $1.5 billion in the first quarter, or about the same amount as last year's first quarter. Capital investments totaled $4.7 billion for the quarter. Wireless CapEx is down slightly from the fourth quarter when we accelerated purchases of equipment to capture significant savings.","On average, wireless CapEx was about $2.2 billion for the last two quarters. But not captured in those costs are investments in shared infrastructure. For example, running fiber to a cell site, but also using that fiber connection for our business wireline services. Shared infrastructure is about half of our non-wireless spending, and is one of the benefits from our integrated network carrier strategy. With our industry-best cell density and balanced spectrum portfolio, we\u2019re adding wireless capacity far more effectively and efficiently than anyone in the industry.","Our virtualization and software-defined networks are already delivering material CapEx savings. We will be adding 2.5 times more capacity at 75% of the capital costs compared to just a few years ago. In our other uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio declined to 2.27 times. And during the quarter, we successfully exchanged $16 billion of DIRECTV debt, and issued $6 billion of debt at very reasonable rates.","We ended the quarter with $10 billion in cash and short-term investments, giving us the flexibility and financial strength to manage the overall needs of our business. Before we get to your questions, let me close with a quick recap of the quarter on Slide 13. The first quarter demonstrated our ability to deliver strong, consistent results as we execute the strategy we have laid out for you. Our approach has been methodical. Our results have been consistent.","We again grew revenues, expanded margins, and delivered double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our DIRECTV integration continues to go smoothly. And we\u2019re on track to deliver a run rate of $1.5 billion or more in cost synergies by the end of this year. We are also providing the first glimpse of what it means to be the premier integrated communications carrier in the world with our integrated offers and streaming plans.","Our business solutions segment continues to outperform the market with strategic service revenue gains and margin expansion. Wireless again had record margins, growing phone-only plus Next ARPU, and had strong growth with its Cricket prepaid perform. In Mexico, wireless is fast becoming an emerging growth story as we quickly build that business and expand our North American 4G LTE network.","We are convinced our strategy is working, and our momentum is strong. We are proud of what we have accomplished this quarter, and even more excited about what lies ahead.","With that, let's get to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Go ahead please.","Mike Mccormack","Hi Guys, thanks. John, maybe just a comment on handset phone additions and postpaid, what strategies do you guys have in place to kind of turnaround or stem the losses there? I presume as the feature phone base continues to decline, that will become less of a headwind. And then just thinking about ARPU, I think the trajectory on phone on the ARPU without Next payments continues to get better. Is there a point at which you can see that starting to turn positive later this year?","John Stephens","Yes, thanks for the questions Mike. Couple things; one, our strategies with regard to the overall business, but including our phone market is really on this integrated carrier strategy. So as we roll out these products that we can combine or video and our mobility and our broadband; and as we see these values net to the customers, we are optimistic we are going to be able to continue to improve our business. One other point I will make to you, though, too, is with these kinds of margins and these kinds of expansions in margins, it gives us the flexibility and, quite frankly, it grows the universe of customers that are long-term value-creating customers for us with these new margin standards that the team has set. So, we are real optimistic about being competitive.","With that being said, we are still viewing the Cricket and the prepaid platform as a very viable, profitable long-term strategy. We believe it gives us an entree into a market that is significant, and, as you can see, generating great results. We are seeing continued improvement in service revenues. We saw it, as you can see, in the first quarter, and in ARPU. So we are very positive about that. We believe there is real opportunity to continue that. But we will continue to worry about performing first, and predicting it afterwards. But we are optimistic; we like what we see. We like what happened when we combined the video and wireless offerings and the number of customers, for example, that not only added their phones, but added their tablets to the program. That was very encouraging, so we are really optimistic. Thanks for your question Mike.","Mike Mccormack","Do you think that is having a negative impact on ARPU, if you think about the tablets coming on, as well is the bundled offers? Or is that not a significant impact?","John Stephens","The tablets come on at $40 for the video offering, so they come in at a real strong rate. Depending upon whether they are a new and they are an addition, or whether they are a conversion of an existing tablet, you could have different impacts on ARPU. But we are certainly very pleased with those coming on.","Mike Mccormack","Great. Thanks, John.","John Stephens","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik","John, could you just maybe frame the service revenue impact you talked about with the second-half shutdown of the 2G network? I think you said you have gotten back to flattish. Is that going to change the dynamic in the second half, first of all? And then second, upgrade rate was even lower than we thought, at 5%. Obviously that also helped the EBITDA margins. How should we look at that over the next few quarters, both, say, the second and third quarter? Obviously, fourth quarter is a little bit of a wild card. But do you expect the same kind of margins in those quarters that we - the strength that we have seen this quarter? Thanks.","John Stephens","John, with regard to 2G, we have been on this path to convert our 2G customers for a number of years. If you recall, we first announced, I think a year and a half ago - or more than a year and a half ago - our plans for 2G. So we have migrated much of that base already, a significant amount. In fact, in the last 12 months, we have migrated something like 6 million customers off that base. And that has been flowing through the numbers that you have seen.","So, we are working through that on a regular basis already. So that impact is included in the service numbers that we - service revenue numbers that we've reported and that we talk about going forward. So it is already in that; and because of that, we're going to be careful. But it is already in that optimism that we have. With regard to the upgrade rate, I could see it continuing to be very moderate until a new device, until a significant or iconic device comes out. Once that happens, it\u2019s a little bit unpredictable. But I could see this, a lower rate continuing throughout most of the year.","John Hodulik","Got you. Okay, thanks.","John Stephens","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick","Hi guys, thanks. Similar theme, the overall video decline, a little better than we had expected; U-verse a little bigger; DTV a little better, so, two things: one, do you still expect that you can get to positive for the full year on the video numbers? And just confirm that that does not include the over-the-top product. And second, I have been under the impression that you are trying to stem some of the U-verse declines through some efforts. Is that still happening? Or are you going to sort of watch this tail off at this pace? Thanks.","John Stephens","Thanks for your question Phil. First of all, folks, we want to keep all our quality customers and so we will do prudent, rational steps to keep all of our customers, and keep them as part of our AT&T family. We are interested in doing that in any event. With regard to the video perspective, let me give you this thought. In the second half of the year, we will have had the integration efforts really completed and fully ramped. So, single truck roll, which for example, we didn't really start training nine of our states in the Southeast region until this year. They have now been all trained. But we will see that start to - we are seeing it have improvements now.","But as that becomes a normal part of the business over the next few months, and we get repetition with regard to the success base on that, and we continue to have all our sales channels fully up to speed and selling those territories as we add those single truck roll capabilities, we see real optimism on the second half of the year. Secondly, just from a traditional basis, I think the NFL package has a real positive effect on net adds, and it occurs generally in the second half of the year. And we think the ability to add further integrated products and expand our wireless bundling further will give us that opportunity to, for the full year, grow video customers.","Phil Cusick","I'm sorry, just not to push, but you had guided to full-year video growth. Is that still the guidance?","John Stephens","Yes. That's what I said. We are still getting there to total video growth. And we think those - the reasons I laid out; the fact the NFL contract comes really has impact on sales in the second half. The fact that quarter-over-quarter, every quarter since we merged, we\u2019ve increased satellite sales. The fact that the full single truck roll integrated sales, integrated customer service, will be most effective in the second half of the year will give us that ability to add video for the year.","Phil Cusick","And it sounds like that does include the stand-alone over-the-top product, or it does not?","John Stephens","No, we don't have - we have not made any predictions on the stand-alone over-the-top video product yet. And so we are expecting to reach positive with not including those numbers.","Phil Cusick","Perfect. Thanks, John.","John Stephens","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead please.","David Barden","Hi guys, thanks for taking the questions. First question, John, would be just in terms of getting to the $1.5 billion synergy savings run rate by the end of the year. Could you kind of size what was this quarter, and what is on the come for the rest of the year? And then second, just on the unlimited, I saw in the disclosures that there's about 3 million unlimited customers. Obviously some of those are going to be related to the video bundle that you are doing. Could you talk a little bit more about the learnings, about what people are doing with mobile video, with an unlimited wireless capability? And what is the economic model that you see supporting giving away unlimited data for this purpose? Thank you.","John Stephens","So, the first thing with regard to the $1.5 billion, we are making real progress on our content cost savings. We are getting those from new content - contract negotiations; as well, quite frankly, as the fact that our base is shifted more to DTV, and we get that from the existing contracts. Two, we got a lot of it from our headquarters advertising the traditional things you find with headquarter companies merging together - those savings in professional fees and contractors in consulting fees settings - we are getting that. And then we are seeing some savings, and we would expect to see more as we go through not only on the expense side, but on the cash flow side from aligning vendor contracts, best price of both companies' contracts, and best payment terms. So those are what\u2019s underway.","We've been at this almost 9 months now, or a little over nine months, and it\u2019s going relatively well. We\u2019re encouraged, not only that we are going to meet the $1.5 billion run rate, but that we have the opportunity to exceed it. So that piece of it, David. I think the first thing on the 3 million unlimited, those are the customers that are buying video from us. Many of those customer, most of those customers, were already buying a video product from us. So you can imagine when they buy the video, when they buy the wireless, and they often buy the broadband, these are some very high ARPU customers, and customers that are very valuable long-term to us.","And so, giving them this opportunity to use our services any time, any place, where they live and work is very positive for them and creates not only satisfaction for them, but also high value for us. It also has added some video customers. We have been able to use this as an opportunity to add video customers for the wireless customers who want to get this opportunity. Secondly, we are still in the learning stage of it. But we are still finding that 80% of our video traffic, or some number like that, is on Wi-Fi or it gets offloaded very quickly. So, while the impact is convenience for the customers, so far, it looks like it is going to be a manageable exercise for us. We are continuing to evaluate it, and we\u2019re going to continue to learn. But the common place where people use this video still allows us to have Wi-Fi supplement for it, and that is providing us some measure of opportunity for success. But the real issue is when the customers are paying us for all those services, it makes real sense. We can really get comfortable with offering the unlimited. So far, it is working well.","David Barden","Alright, thanks John.","John Stephens","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays Capital. Go ahead please.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much and good afternoon folks.","John Stephens","How are you Amir?","Amir Rozwadowski","Well, John. I was wondering if we could talk a bit about the standalone OTT offerings. You had mentioned in your prepare commentary that you have had some progress with the content partners. How should we think about the positioning of those offerings going forward in terms of potential opportunities set to either expand the addressable market for DIRECTV or, conversely, there have been some concerns that it could come in and cause some level of potential cannibalization for certain types of users. And then I've got a follow-up question, if I may.","John Stephens","Yes, So the AT&T now and the AT&T mobile are really specifically - the DTV Now, excuse me, the DTV mobile - the DTV Now is really expected to look and appear and have a channel choices very similar to what we have on the traditional subscription DTV product today. The attractiveness for us is that, yes, there is a market of 20 million households that don't have it today. There is a collection of, if you will, core nevers, young people who have never had their own subscription that they might be able to get this. And quite frankly, the cost efficiency of being able to deliver it without having the cost of installation of a satellite dish or possibly a set-top box - whatever the cost that may be eliminated out of this - are really attractive and make it something that not only could grow the customer base, but also can be a very reasonable profitability for us.","So, we believe that we are very excited about that opportunity, and it gives us a way to compete in different places, even those places where we don't have the broadband product in place. So, we are excited about that. Right now, the people who buy our DIRECTV and U-verse video products are the high-end customers who generally want a subscription video product in their home, with three or four televisions connected, and that variation. So it is a slightly different marketplace or different customer base with regard to DIRECTV Now.","Likewise, we are excited about the opportunity to do it on mobility, and provide the DTV mobility to those customers who use mobile devices as their broadband alternative. With that being said, we are really excited about growing the market. And, at this time, we are excited about the ability to package a collection of content that is very similar to and very attractive to the customers that we would be targeting with this.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much. And then just a quick follow-up, thinking about the cash flow generation capabilities of the company at this level, you had mentioned you feel like you are on track when it comes to the synergies associated with the DIRECTV integration. There have been other cost synergy or cost reduction initiatives ongoing at the company for some time now, be it Project Agile or other initiatives. How should we think about the opportunities for improving the cash generation capabilities of the combined entity?","John Stephens","Real simply, the numbers we have out in public was our Project Agile initiatives, which are going quite well. We are about $3 billion of annual cost efficiency, cash operating expense savings or cash savings. Our merger initiatives are $1.5 billion a year or more, once they get up to the run rate. As you have seen, we\u2019ve got software-defined networks which are really driving the opportunity to, if you will, reduce capital cost and reduce cash operating expenses from the ability to eliminate truck rolls and other installation costs.","When you roll those up, it's pretty easy to take those public numbers we have given and get to a number that is a $4 billion or $5 billion, $6 billion opportunity, whatever totals you want to get to. That kind of opportunity is very exciting for us. We are striving and working very hard. If that is to occur, we will have a very strong opportunity over time to grow cash flow.","Amir Rozwadowski","Great. Thank you very much for the incremental color.","John Stephens","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to Michael Rollins with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Rollins","Thanks. Just a couple of questions. First, can you give us an update on the initiatives that management discussed around deploying 40 megahertz of new spectrum to fuel capacity for the emerging video strategy and mobile broadband demand that you are seeing? And then secondly, if we can just an update on your thoughts more broadly on the strategy in Latin America, and how you perceive the need to [indiscernible], to either scale up or scale out of those markets over time? Thanks.","John Stephens","So, with regard to \u2013 and I will stay away from anything with regard to the auction, as Mike mentioned at the first, can't make any comments with regard to that. Our overall spectrum plan, though, as you all know, we started the IP some years ago, and put in a lot of fiber in the ground and put LTE nationwide. It was our effort to have a network, and particularly a wireless network that had extremely strong backhaul capabilities, and would be built in a manner such that we could upgrade the technology rather easily, as new technologies came along.","With regard to having that network, it is a very dense network with macro towers, and as such, we are now in a position that with our 40 megahertz of WCS and AWS-3 spectrum, we are now in that position of taking that spectrum and rolling it out and putting it to use over top of this very high-quality, dense, fiber-rich network that we have already built. That allows us to deal with the capacity needs of our business for a long period of time and continue to then position us, as appropriate, to do software upgrades as we move onto the next group of technologies.","That allows us to deal with the capacity needs of our business for a long period of time, and continue to then position us, as appropriate, to do software upgrades as we move onto the next group of technologies. So we feel in a very good position and feel like the overall strategies that we started with some years ago with Project VIP, and getting the 300 million LTE POPs out there, and getting a fiber-rich backbone out there support the backhaul for the right decisions that are really paying off with this, as well as the decisions we made to buy the WCS and buy the AWS-3 spectrums. They are really coming into value for us in a very significant way.","With regard to Latin America, as we mentioned in our comments, we mentioned before \u2013 tough environment, but the team down there, we have been impressed with, they are operating very well. Brazil is a challenging environment, both economically and politically. But the team is performing quite well and the overall profitability is impressing us for a management team to be able to operate in that environment and produce the results they are. We are focused not on customer accounts, but on profitable growth and quality.","And quite frankly, we are recently encouraged by the change in some of the exchange rates. If you look at where the Brazil real is today, at closer to 3.5, you can look at where the Argentine peso is at 14.5; and even some improvements, quite frankly, in Mexico and the peso coming up, we are starting to see some light. It's very early, and so we will continue to work very hard to improve operating results. We will keep flexibility with it. We are impressed with the teams that are there. We're going to keep working hard to make it the best business we can.","Michael Rollins","Thank you.","John Stephens","Sure, Mike. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Tim Horan","I wanted to focus on the handsets a little bit more. Do you think the quality of the handsets have gotten better, so that the life can be extended here? And do you think customers are going to look to save money on handsets? And if so, can we see some elasticity in terms of service spending with you guys a little bit more? Thanks.","John Stephens","Tim, the first thing is, to your first point, on the quality \u2013 I do think that is part of it. But what I also think is, if you will, the BYOD aspect of our business, we\u2019ve seen significant increases in those numbers since we started the equipment installment plan or the Next program. And so I think there were a lot of phones that were still very operable, very good shape, that were in, quite frankly, that were idle in the drawer, so to speak. And I think we\u2019ve seen the reuse of those phones extensively. We have seen our BYOD numbers grow from 80,000 to 90,000 a quarter, some years ago, to 400,000 or more in a quarter. So I think your point on that is best exemplified or best described by that.","With that being said, I think when consumers get the choice and understand that they are making spending decisions with their money, they are going to be very efficient. Last, I think that there are \u2013 it's a fluid market; and there is, quite frankly, developing a lot of quality, lower-cost handsets. We are seeing that really in our prepaid business extensively, where there is a lot of good quality smartphones that are much lower per-unit cost. All of those things are impacting the marketplace, and they are impacting our equipment revenues, but they are impacting our equipment expenses. And as both of those go down, we certainly are striving to have the opportunity to have the customer continue to reinvest some of those savings in our services. And we will strive to continue to do that. We will see how that plays out. In the first quarter, we did have good, solid performance in our wireless service revenues. We are extremely encouraged by that.","Tim Horan","Thank you.","John Stephens","Thank you, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman","Thanks, two quick ones, one just coming to cash flow, and a statement you made earlier in your remarks about seasonality of payables. It looks like you used about $4 billion cash on payables. And I was just hoping we would get some color on how to think about working capital items impacting cash flow for the balance of the year. And then the 3 million subs who took the unlimited wireless plan, a lot of them were existing customers. It is generally ARPU accretive when the customers move into the unlimited plan? And since it is still ongoing, should we view that as a source of ARPU stability going forward?","John Stephens","Good question, Brett. I think, Brett, you're looking at the cash flow statement and you're looking at that change in accounts payable. It was about a $1.8 billion impact last year for the first quarter and about a $4 billion impact this year. And you are looking at the right numbers. The reason that increased was twofold. We had the opportunity to invest a lot of CapEx. There's a lot of equipment and a lot of inventory in the fourth quarter at very good prices and rates, and satisfying contractual commitments. Those things turn around and get paid for in the first quarter.","With that being said, we think that is a timing item, and we don't think it will have a permanent impact for the year. It will just reverse out as we go through, so that is it. We bought up some inventory, enhanced that to the other items, and we made some investments in equipment. So that is that aspect of it. That is why we are encouraged about free cash flow not only meeting guidance, but actually growing year-over-year.","Secondly, the 3 million subs are mostly existing subs. And initial times where that \u2013 many of them brought not only their device, their handsets, but their tablets with them, and there was some positive impact for those who did bring those tablets. We are encouraged by that. We are optimistic about that. But we are going to be very patient and careful about that to see how that plays out. We did, though, get some new video customers out of this. And I won't suggest it was a significant amount of the 3 million, but we did get some new ones. And we are also very encouraged about that. And we are learning from that to find out how we might be able to make that a more \u2013 grow that addition of video customers even more through these types of offerings. So, positive on both ends of your questions.","Brett Feldman","Okay. Thank you.","John Stephens","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go-ahead please.","Simon Flannery","Thanks a lot, John. You touched on GigaPower and the attach rates for your broadband. Can you just update us on the build out or is that going to be fairly linear? Where do you stand today in sort of the FCC commitments? And going back to the 2G decommissioning, perhaps you can just let us know how much spectrum is tied up in 2G that will get freed up by this initiative? Thanks.","John Stephens","Thank you, Simon. On the GigaPower, I think we are at 1.6 million fiber-to-the-prem locations that are active and running today. We are on track with our FCC commitments and are confident we are going to meet those on a timely basis. And included in our CapEx plans for this year, and our longer-term multiyear plans includes fully funding all that activity, so we are optimistic about that.","With regard to the 2G commissioning, the one item I want to make sure I am straightforward with is as the volume of data traffic or volume of traffic on the wireless network has gone down from 2G devices, we have been, if you will, taking parts of that spectrum and repurposing it as we go. So, in some markets, we may only have a 2 by 5 slice of spectrum left to repurpose. So we have been doing that, if you will, so to speak, ratably or as we go as we have been able to free up spectrum.","So there is more spectrum to free up. I don't have the specific numbers at my disposal, here, Simon. But I will tell you, even with that, there still is a lot of cost that are left just to operate even a piece of the 2G network. And so we are anxious to capture that savings and use it to continue a strong EBITDA story for our wireless business, and a story that is coming from good quality network operations and efficiency.","Simon Flannery","Great, thank you.","John Stephens","Thank you","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Go-ahead please.","Frank Louthan","Great. Thank you. Can you give us a little update, as you have been making the transition between the U-verse customers there, what is sort of the cannibalization rate between some of the DIRECTV and the wireline U-verse? And the same thing on the broadband, are you seeing a shift more to taking advantage more of the GigaPower and away from DSL? How much of that is just losing share?","John Stephens","Yes, Frank. Thanks for the question. On the broadband side, Frank, we are through most of the opportunity of where they have DSL and also have the choice of either GigaPower or high-speed broadband products. About 95% have already transferred. So we have got some left. The rest of it is just a legacy DSL footprint. We will continue to support those. We will continue to try to provide good service to those customers. But, if you will, that trade-off has \u2013 the team has worked hard to get people to upgrade into speeds and to take advantage of our better-quality products and services. I think of that as a success.","With regard to U-verse and DIRECTV, it is really the focus has not been so much about cannibalization as it is that the sales channel has been focusing on selling DTV satellite service. And the reason is, is because it is a lower cost structure. We can get, if you will, the content synergy savings by adding the customer there. So, that's really what's going on. It's not so much a cannibalization or a concerted effort, if you will, to shift. It is more of getting the new customers on DTV. And then in some cases, certainly, when we have same desk opportunities, one of the ways we can do it is getting onto the lower cost structure. So, that is really the focus. We still get good Net Promoter Scores and good quality scores on both the DTV and the U-verse platform, and we are still pleased to support both. I have U-verse in my own home, so it works very well for me.","Frank Louthan","All right, great. Thank you.","Michael Viola","Kathy, we will take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Amy Young with Macquarie. Go-ahead please.","Amy Yong","Thanks. I was actually wondering if you could talk a little bit about your Mexico business. You had two quarters now of consecutive net add growth. What sort of trajectory should we expect going forward? I think in your commentary, you mentioned profitability improving in the back half of the year. What kind of metrics should we expect? Thank you.","John Stephens","Thanks, Amy. We are not going to give specific guidance on customer accounts in Mexico, but we are excited about the progress we've made. And certainly when you have got two quarters in a row growing customers at this level, you want to keep that momentum going. I think the more important aspect on Mexico is this: one, we do expect at the end of this year we will have 75 million of the population covered with LTE. That will probably bring our total North American footprint to well over 390 million.","So we will be at essentially 400 million POPs by the end of this year, but certainly by 2018 on the North American footprint. That growth in LTE POPs then gives you the opportunity to expand your sales in other markets. Including in that is launching additional markets with an effective market strategy where we not only have the network, but we also have customer care, customer service, the AT&T brand, and acceptable distribution. And we will continue to grow that effective marketplace. We have got, if you will, markets launched of about 42 in Mexico today and we expect it to be up to 160 by the end of the year.","So you can see that getting the LTE to 75 million POPs, and getting the customer care service and the distribution at that same level is going to provide us a much greater opportunity than we have today and will give us some time to establish ourselves in those markets that we have just joined. So, you can understand why we are optimistic about it, and that we believe that the team is on the right track in doing that. It is a long-term investment for us. We believe highly in the market. And we think it is a natural addition to our North American operations, not only for wireless, but also for our business opportunities.","Amy Young","Great, thank you.","John Stephens","Thank you, Amy.","John Stephens","I think that will conclude our call for today. As we do, let me just close by saying thank you for your time. We appreciate your interest in AT&T. And as always, as you're going home tonight, please don't text and drive. The text can wait. Thank you, and take care.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and choosing AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.",""]}}
