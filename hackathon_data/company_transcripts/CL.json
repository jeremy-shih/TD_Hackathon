This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","Today's conference will include forward-looking statements. These statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of the first time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements. So for information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements on Forward-Looking Statements.","This conference will also include a discussion on non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We will discuss organic sales growth, which is net sales growth, excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and derivatives. We will also discuss gross profit, gross profit margin, SGA, SG&A as a percentage net -- of net sales, operating profits, operating profit margin, net income and earnings per share on a diluted basis, excluding the impact of items described in the press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted in the For Investors section of our website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","Just a reminder, there may be a slight delay before the question-and-answer session begins due to the web simulcast.","Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President and Investor Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, Bina.","Delia H. Thompson","Thank you, Danny, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","We're pleased with how this year has started out, with solid organic sales growth and encouraging growth margin improvement despite the major currency headwinds we have been facing. Our business is on track. And as Ian said in this morning's press release, our anticipated full year earnings per share decline reflects a double-digit increase on a currency-neutral basis, of course, excluding restructuring charges. And as you'll hear in more detail shortly, we made very good market share progress across categories and divisions. This is a result of ongoing innovation around the world, supported by a healthy level of advertising. And while our reported advertising was down absolutely versus the year-ago quarter, the 10.6% level as a percent of sales is up meaningfully from the fourth quarter 2014 level of 9.7% and compares to a level in last year's first quarter of 11.1%, the highest for last year. And as we've said on many occasions, it's the combination of this reported advertising and our very impactful in-store activities which drive volume and market share growth. And our efforts in the area of efficiency continued to pay off, with our Funding the Growth initiatives off to a very good start. In fact, it's the strongest first quarter we've had in that area in some time. In addition, our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track and delivering the savings we had projected. And as referenced in the press release, our balance sheet is strong. Working capital levels are below last year.","So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. Our North American business continues to grow. As mentioned in the press release, our year-to-date market share is up in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. In addition, it's up in mouthwash, body wash, liquid hand soap and fabric conditioner.","In the toothpaste whitening category, the February launch of Colgate Optic White Platinum Express White has added incremental share. Our year-to-date share for whitening is 5.8%, which grew to 6.8% in March. Part of our successful integrated marketing campaign included the use of YouTube beauty experts to engage our millennial consumer. Another 2015 toothpaste innovation is Colgate Enamel Health Multi-Protection toothpaste, which includes premium packaging.","In the body wash category, our year-to-date share is up over a full point to almost 10%. Our February launches of both Irish Spring Signature For Men and Softsoap Fresh & Glow have contributed to these results.","And our liquid hand soap share is at 31.4% year-to-date, with the most recent share at 33.1%, largely driven by the Softsoap Fragrant Foaming Collection.","We're also very pleased with our Tom's of Maine business, which is growing very strongly. Innovation as well as increased distribution have played a role. We're getting good traction with our recent launch of a line of baby products. Our in-store execution has been excellent, including a very impactful Earth Day event. And you'll hear about more new products later in the year.","So let's turn then to Europe\/South Pacific. Momentum is strong across this division, and market shares are growing. Our strong organic volume growth of 5.5% is the highest in almost 5 years. Our year-to-date market share is up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, liquid hand soap, shower gel and fabric conditioner.","Our year-to-date toothpaste share is at 36.4%, up 40 basis points, with the most recent reading at 37%. Toothpaste innovation this quarter includes Colgate Total Daily Repair. This new product helps reverse early damage for better oral health. It's an everyday multi-benefit toothpaste with proactive repair benefits and is priced at a premium to the base business. In the whitening category, we're launching Colgate Max White for men with powerful stain removal for whiter teeth. And more toothpaste innovation is planned for the second half of this year.","Our manual toothbrush share is up 2 full points to 26.9% on a year-to-date basis, with the most recent share at 27.2%. And innovative products such as Colgate 360\u00b0 and Colgate Slim Soft toothbrushes reported by excellent in-store execution have helped drive these results. The U.K. and Australia had particularly good performance, with year-to-date toothbrush shares up 660 basis points and 240 basis points, respectively, clearly strengthening already robust leadership positions.","In the Personal Care category, we're also launching a new men's variance, Palmolive Men Fresh Care. This is a 3-in-1 product, which combines a face, body and hair wash in one convenient package. We told you last quarter about a new line under the Sanex brand, Sanex ADVANCED. This has had excellent trade acceptance and in-store implementation. We expect that share results should follow soon.","Our year-to-date fabric conditioner share is up 80 basis points to 27.4%, with the most recent period at 27.7%. This was helped by the launch of Soupline Paradise Sensations, which brings new trends to the fabric conditioner category with its powerful bundle impact and sophisticated fragrances. The pipeline of products moving forward is strong, with the relaunch of Soupline Perfect Glide and Magic Moments, offering easy ironing and superior long-lasting fragrance. The new premium look with outstanding on-shelf impact and a high-performing formula commands a premium price.","Turning then to Latin America. Organic sales growth was strong in this region, despite a strong year-ago comparison. And as elsewhere, premium innovation has helped drive results.","Our regional toothpaste share is up 150 basis points to 77.7% on a year-to-date basis, with good gains in many countries. In Brazil, we're up 40 basis points year-over-year to 71.7%, while our nearest competitor has seen sequential declines in the last 3 bimonthly share periods. In Mexico, we're up 110 basis points to 80.6% and this despite continued promotional pressure from some of our competitors.","In manual toothbrushes, premium offerings such as Colgate 360\u00b0 and Colgate Slim Soft have contributed to share growth in many countries. In Mexico, our leadership share increased 80 basis points to 43.1% on a year-to-date basis, widening the gap between our nearest competitor to 150 basis points. In Colombia, our year-to-date share increased 30 basis points to 46.7%.","In bar soap, the year has started strong, with the division holding market leadership at 30.7%. Both equities, Palmolive and Protex, continued to be the #1 and #2 brands across Latin America. And we achieved record high shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala.","Our market-leading fabric conditioner business in Mexico expanded its market share by 50 basis points to 47.2% on a year-to-date basis. Newly launched Suavitel Aroma Intense achieved a 1.4% share in the direct trade in the first quarter. And a new smaller base business size helped compete with low-priced local competitors in the bodega retail environment.","Innovation in Latin America continues this quarter across categories. To build on our success in the whitening category, we are launching Luminous White Advanced toothpaste in Brazil. This is Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste, which intensifies the white of your teeth 3 shades whiter. Its unique formula contains the same ingredient dentists use, and you can feel it working while you brush. As a companion product, we will offer Colgate 360\u00b0 Luminous White toothbrush, with stain-erasing cups and a 2x whitening action.","In the mid-tier segment and as a companion to our Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Neutrazucar toothpaste, we are relaunching Colgate Zig Zag Maximum Cavity Protection toothbrush. The product has multi-angled bristles and a flexible neck which help with plaque removal.","And in the Personal Care category, we have just launched a new line under the Protex brand. Protex Complete 12 body wash, hand soap and bar soap, providing long-lasting antibacterial protection.","Turning then to Asia. As you've seen, organic sales performance in this region was somewhat muted this quarter. But going forward, we have a full pipeline of new products to reignite growth.","In India, our toothpaste share is up 30 basis points to 54.6% on a year-to-date basis, fueled by the launch of Colgate Active Salt and Colgate Max Fresh. In the Philippines, our toothpaste share increased 120 basis points to 60.9%, with the most recent read at 61.2%. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste has achieved almost a 3% share of that market.","Our manual toothbrush shares increased in 5 of 10 countries around the region, with our divisional year-to-date share at 29.9%, down modestly from the year-ago period but still the market leading position.","And we continue to grow our mouthwash business. Our regional share is up 30 basis points to 24% on a year-to-date basis.","In India, Colgate Plax Active Salt and Colgate Plax Visible White helped drive our market share up 100 basis points to 18.2%, while in the Philippines, Colgate Plax Jasmine Tea was a major driver of a 220 basis point increase to 26.8%, with the most recent read at 27.9%.","And in the second quarter, the innovation continues. In toothpaste, we will launch Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair & Prevent, which repairs the sensitive areas of teeth and with regular use, provides lasting protection to prevent sensitivity from returning. In the base sensitivity line comes Colgate Sensitive with Sensifoam to reach all areas of the teeth.","For the Thai market, we're launching Colgate Salt Charcoal. And as you know, charcoal is an attractive ingredient to consumers in this region based on local insights.","In manual toothbrushes, we've just introduced Colgate Slim Soft Gold Charcoal toothbrush, with less than 0.01 millimeters slim tip antibacterial bristles for deep but gentle cleaning. And we're extending charcoal to the value portion of our toothbrush business with Colgate Zig Zag Charcoal toothbrush.","In personal care in Thailand, we will launch a line of soap, body wash and hand soap, Protex Omega 3, body wash with Omega 3 essential oil and which washes away 99.9% of bacteria while keeping your skin feeling moisturized. Also in that market, we will introduce Protex Intimate Care feminine wash, the bundle now selling in Brazil.","Turning to Africa\/Eurasia. Organic sales in this region were strong, building on the momentum we saw as we exited 2014. And innovation has driven these good results across categories.","Our regional toothpaste share is up 90 basis points year-to-date to 33.7%, with market share increases in virtually every country. Our share in Russia was up 160 basis points; in South Africa, 120 basis points; and in Turkey, 130 basis points. Similarly, our toothbrush share increased everywhere with the exception of East-West Africa. Shares in Russia, South Africa and Turkey increased 170 basis points, 90 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively.","Our bar soap share was also up across the region, up 290 basis points year-to-date. In South Africa, our share increased 180 basis points to 32.4%, thanks to the new products we told you about in previous quarters: Protex Men and Protex African Therapy.","And more innovation is planned for this quarter. In toothpaste, we will be launching Colgate Optic White Whiten and Restore. The formula with an active mineral complex and fresh mint flavor provides 1 shade whiter teeth in 1 week while helping to restore enamel strength. And the consumer can have the confidence of always being able to look her best without compromising the health of her mouth.","In Russia, following on the success of our Altai Herbs bundle, we will be introducing Colgate Plax Forte Oak Bark & Fir mouthwash. Oak Bark & Fir are attractive ingredients to consumers in this part of the world based on local insights.","And in the shower gel category, we are adding a new variant to our successful Palmolive Spa Gourmet line, Mint Shake, with an uplifting mint fragrance and rich creamy formula infused with natural mint extracts that leave your skin feeling pampered.","To build on our success in bar soaps, we're launching Protex Complete 12, similar to the bundle launching across Latin America.","And Hill's. Hill's solid organic sales growth was a good balance between volume and price, both here and overseas. In addition, it's encouraging that gross profit margin is up year-over-year. As you may recall, we indicated this would indeed happen despite initial costs associated with reformulation of new and existing products.","And we're pleased that in the U.S. market, retail consumption in the large format retailers is up nicely. Among the drivers are our new premium Hill's Science Diet offerings, which have been supported in-store with impactful displays and are growing faster than the rest of the Hill's Science Diet line.","This quarter, we've begun a 10-week turnaround campaign to support Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight. The objective here is to educate consumers about pet weight loss, creating awareness and buzz around the product to drive trial. Consumer engagement activities will be both in-store and online.","Hill's Ideal Balance also continued to perform well. Hill's Ideal Balance Crafted was launched in the first quarter. This new sub-line with its premium positioning offers authentic ingredients prepared with care. A full support campaign has included new product kits and feeding trials along with online ratings and reviews.","The packaging and messaging relaunch of our Hill's Prescription Diet line is off to a good start. Here in the U.S., it's received excellent feedback from the profession. The packaging is seen as being more consumer-friendly with increased and clearer descriptive. And this is now rolling out across Europe.","So in summary, we're very pleased with the way 2015 has started out. The momentum we saw as we exited 2014 has continued in many regions of the world. Our new product pipeline is full across all categories, and our ongoing savings programs as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program are providing funds to support that robust innovation. And as we implement our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, our people are becoming even more focused on winning on the ground each and every day. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go forward through the year.","And now, Danny, I'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Ian, I was hoping you could just provide us the quick gross margin bridge. And then the broader question is, from a competitive standpoint, just curious if you could just give us a State of the Union on what you're seeing in some of the key markets in terms of some of the competitor activity. Are you seeing a scale back in some promotion -- promotional spend, especially in some of those markets where one of your competitors has really been making a push over the last 2 to 3 years?","Ian M. Cook","Okay, Nik. Happy to do the gross profit walk-through. So if you take our first quarter, the first quarter of 2014, the gross margin was 58.6%. We pick up a positive benefit of pricing at 1 percentage point. Between Funding the Growth and a very modest contribution from restructuring, we pick up another 170 basis points. And as Bina said in her remarks, you can see that, that places us with a far quicker start on our Funding the Growth in 2015 than we had prior year because of the intense focus we have put there. Material prices were a headwind of 230 basis points, and that was almost wholly a transaction impact. There's another 10 basis points of other, and that gets you to the current year of gross profit of 58.9%. We were very pleased with the 30 basis points improvement we had in the first quarter. Indeed, many external views saw our gross profit coming down because of that foreign exchange transaction impact. And we like to think that the balance we're finding between pricing, between Funding the Growth, between Global Growth and Efficiency, driving our innovation and meeting competitive marketplace needs is allowing us to grow the top line while, at the same time, increasing our gross margin. And as we said on the last call, and it remains true for this year, we expect our gross margin to continue to build across the year. And we still plan to expand that gross margin on the year between 50 and 100 basis points. So I think that captures the gross margin approach and thinking from our side. In terms of the marketplaces, I wouldn't say we have seen anything holistically different. We see in pockets increased promotional activity. We see in other pockets increased couponing activity. And we see in other locations, frankly, an easing in the promotional environment. We do see quite a lot of pullback from our principal competitors in media advertising across the first quarter of the year. And I would say our reaction to it is as our reaction has always been, we balance between driving trial for our innovation and meeting promotional needs when they are there, but at the same time, growing and growing our gross margin. And that continues to be our view of the external environment promotionally for the balance of the year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dara Mohsenian.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So, Ian, pricing decelerated sequentially on a year-over-year basis in Q1 versus Q4, and I'm just trying to get a sense of what drove that. Are you seeing a more competitive manufacturer environment in terms of promotion as you just talked about? Is it more related to consumer demand elasticity? I guess I would have expected it to build giving greater FX. And then can you talk a little bit about plans in the balance of the year to cover any additional FX pressure?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. We were actually quite pleased with the pricing in the first quarter. You're right. As always, you're balancing your speed of response with what is there in the marketplace and the consumer. We do expect our pricing to build across the year. As you correctly say, we use pricing along with other vehicles to offset that transaction impact of foreign exchange. But I return to the point that I think we're working very hard to maintain that right balance, so we can invest to grow market share and drive the top line while increasing our gross margin. And we feel we started the year in a good place with that 30 margin point expansion, knowing that pricing takes a little bit of time to catch up with the foreign exchange impact. So more pricing across the balance of the year and reiterating the plan to expand our gross margin, again, across the balance of the year to increase by 50 to 100 basis points for the full year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A little bit of a follow-up on Dara's question, Ian, which is more about the mechanics of pricing and especially when you have this much volatility. And so I guess, how do we look at sort of the time frame that it takes to react to some of this emerging market currency volatility in the transactional FX? Is it something where the pricing goes in relatively quickly? Or do you sort of have to wait for things to stabilize as we look at sort of how to balance, again, some of the wild movements in the currency and whether or not if you price for transactional and then the currency moves in your favor, there's an additional spread that works in your favor?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. It's -- in some situations where the marketplace change is significant and dire, we, along with others, tend to take significant pricing steps very quickly. Russia would be a very clear example. In others, we are more balanced in doing it. If I broaden the discussion a little bit and you think about selling price increases, in fact, our selling price increases in the quarter were between 4% and 5%. Then with some of the activities we have at the store level, we spent some of that back. So you end up with the net pricing number, which is what you see at 2.4% and on balance between the two, still grew gross profit by 30 basis points and kept advertising at a healthy level of 10.6%. So that's what we tend to be juggling with as we balance gross pricing with how we execute in the marketplace. And our responsiveness will be as the market dictates, and our balance between the gross and the effective pricing will reflect also marketplace needs. But again, that balance will see our gross margin expand as the year unfolds by 50 to 100 basis points, which sees us with our traditional advertising up absolutely and as a percent of sales on the year.","Operator","From Citi Research, we have Wendy Nicholson.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question was on Hill's. And it looks to me that the operating margin is kind of back to close to an all-time high level, which is awesome. But over the last few years, it seems like when margin has crept up, then you soon thereafter lose share, and there's kind of been a trade-off. And I'm wondering, number one, if you can comment on that and whether there's been more structural change so that we really should think that a 27-plus percent operating margin is sustainable for Hill's, combined with an outlook for top line growth. And also, as the Hill's business sort of expands, I know you've entered some new markets like Eastern Europe and Latin America, I assume you're not opening up manufacturing yet in those places. So is there a risk that there is more transactional cost to the business as currencies move and you don't have local manufacturing for that business specifically?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. The Hill's consumption is very strong. And I think all of these are a balance between the value of the consumer believes that they are paying for and the gross margin that, that delivers. So Bina went through much of the innovation that we can so far talk about on the Hill's business thus far this year, and a large part of that is accretive from a gross margin point of view. So we're creating innovation that is margin-accretive that the consumer is attracted to. So you will remember, when we went through the process of turning Hill's around, we said one of the key strategic things we wanted to do was to make the innovation flow in Hill's sustainable, not episodic. And we have that now. So yes, we do believe, and it was part of our plan when we made the investment in gross margin, that we would return to historical levels. Now from a local country expansion point of view, we're not in any new markets compared to the emerging markets that we had already been in, like Russia, like Brazil, like Mexico, those types of marketplace. And indeed, we do have a transaction burden because we don't make Hill's products in Russia, for example. But all of that is based into our business plan. We make the same pricing adjustments to address the transaction impact on Hill's as we do for the Colgate business. And maybe strategically down the road one day, if we were to invest in capacity, of course, that would give us further margin improvement on those businesses. The other comment I would make is we are finding with Hill's and our engagement with the Hill's consumer that the emotional connection is so rich that you can engage with that consumer through digital vehicles almost entirely because they will spend extraordinarily (sic) [extraordinary] time finding out information, and they will spend extraordinary time with Hill's representatives to take care of their pets. So with that business, in particular, we're building a very efficient model of targeting and reaching the consumer given the emotional investment they have in the category of the brand and, of course, their pet. So long story short, we think it's sustainable.","Operator","From Goldman Sachs, we have Jason English.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm looking at Asia, Africa\/Eurasia combined. Sort of what you used to report as Greater Asia and Africa. And the organic sales growth blended of 2 1 [ph] is the weakest we've seen since the third quarter of 2014. And it looks like it's really coming on softness in Asia. I noticed in the press release you referenced to volume declines in China. And I think last quarter, you said the destock was behind you. So I was hoping you could just drill a little bit deeper into what's happening in the Asia segment, why price sort of rolled negative, why volume is still relatively soft and, more specifically, what's happening in China.","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Fair questions, Jason. And obviously, your math is correct. And indeed, the country that bears comment is China. And so let me make a few remarks around China because that really is the country, the geography to discuss. I think the first thing to say is that you will remember, we were one of the first to recognize that trade destocking was occurring in the second quarter last year. And we said that destocking process would be completed by the end of 2014, and the trade inventories would be back to balance. And that has happened. The inventory destocking is completed in China. If you look at our consumption in China, which is to say, the consumer's purchases of our products, our quarter 1 consumption was up a healthy mid-single digits, in line with the marketplace. Our January, February market share was up meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2014 when the destocking ended. And indeed, our local sales in China for the first quarter were up behind that strong consumption, meaningfully, fourth quarter to first quarter. Now the comparison with the first quarter of 2014 is down due to the comparison with what was our highest quarter in 2014, which, again, you will remember was the quarter before the down-stocking occurred. So what I'm saying is our consumption is leading our sales back up. Our market share and that consumption predict continued growth in sales. And I think most importantly, the second quarter in China is off to a brisk start. So consumption is good and that future growth for that business will continue to build.","Operator","We have Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question is just on pricing in North America. It was up for the first time in probably about 2 years. So is the couponing starting to lap? Is competition improving? And then also specifically on pricing in Brazil. Is -- are you planning to raise prices? And I ask in the context of Brazil volume having declined in the March quarter. And then finally on the organic sales outlook for the full year. With the first quarter sort of at the low end of your longer-term outlook in the sort of 4% to 7% range, can you just talk through that a little bit?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Well, in the U.S., obviously, we were pleased with the pricing pickup in the first quarter. And yes, I would say there has been some modulation in the promotion activity. And indeed, you will remember, the first quarter for us last year was the quarter in which we had launched many, many of our new products. And of course, the couponing behind the trial for those new products would have been in the first quarter of 2014. So there's a timing aspect to that as well. We have, indeed, taken pricing in Brazil. But I would comment on Brazil that it is a different story to China and that the marketplace economic activity and, indeed, our categories worsened since the last time we spoke in January. I don't think that's new news to everyone. It has been widely reported. Pleasingly, as Bina said, our market share, approaching 72%, is up year-on-year. In fact, when I was down there 2 weeks ago, the General Manager said with great pride that it was the highest market share in 19 years. But who's looking? And so our shares continue to be strong, i.e. we're growing faster than the market growth. And as you would imagine, given our experience in Latin America, we're doing a very, shall we say, attentive job of managing our cost structure. But I think it's fair to say that we should expect, and indeed, we are planning for, a slower Brazil marketplace for the balance of this year. Now the organic growth outcome, I think you can do your own math. We provided a range of 4% to 7% because of the choppiness and volatility in our world. And if -- to put that in comparison, that 4% is up against the highest quarter of last year at 6.5%. So the compares ease a little bit as we go forward. And if the China growth returns the way we expect it to, it will clearly move us up that range. So we're still comfortable with the 4% to 7% range, and we'll see how it unfolds quarter-by-quarter.","Operator","And we'll take Steve Powers from UBS.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I think previously -- this is a little bit of housekeeping maybe. But I think you had called out FX as a 7%, 7.5% headwind to the top line for the year a few months ago and a 10% headwind on the bottom line from a translation standpoint. And I apologize if I missed it, but could you just call out specifically how that's evolved as you see it? Because I'm wondering if the effective 2- to 4-point reduction in all-in EPS is 100% FX versus other factors on the margin like Brazil, which you mentioned. And if I could squeeze in a related follow-up. What would trigger -- on FX, what would trigger a move to the SIMADI rate in Venezuela for you? And how incrementally impactful would you expect it to be on kind of a pro forma 12-month basis? Because it just feels like it's essentially a matter of time before that needs to happen.","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Well, to take the second point which is housekeeping, you will find that broken out in our Q. So we actually provide the calculation where they're a requirement that we do that, which is to say what would the impact on the business be if we were required to go to the SIMADI rate. The foreign exchange impact on the year is around 10%, more or less. It is more on the bottom line as it was in the first quarter. I think top to bottom was 10% and 14% on the first quarter. So it's about a 10% impact on the year. There are no other factors affecting our guidance other than, and I stress, the translation impact of foreign exchange because as you know well, we seek to cover the transaction impact because that is what leads to operating results.","Operator","And we'll take Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you talk about the growth opportunity in Home Care and Personal Care? Only because like Oral Care is sort of indisputable given your market shares. But it seems like in those categories, there's a lot more local competition and commodities are rolling over. I look at some of the data, I'm not sure the syndicated data is great, but like you look at Home Care in Venezuela, and it was like the business in bolivars was up sort of 50% year-over-year in 2014 versus '13. So I'm just wondering what you think of the outlook there to have that continue to grow and then maybe it's an opportunity because people are exiting the market. So maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way. And since you guys are the last guys standing, maybe it's better than I would have otherwise thought. So any thoughts would be appreciated.","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Well, I don't like being categorized as the last guy standing. And Venezuela is a unique case. So I don't know what data you're seeing, Bill, but our Home Care business is not a focus for us in Venezuela. And indeed, material availability is modest in that business. I think as you heard Bina talk, we're quite pleased with our Home Care and our Personal Care business. Yes, there are more competitors in Personal Care than we find in Oral Care. But if you take Personal Care against the company, Personal Care organic grew around 3% in the first quarter, quite healthy growth. And more competitors means the marketplace is more fragmented, and therefore, you can garner progress because there are simply more players in the space. And I think some of the examples Bina quoted are very good examples of where we're doing precisely that in emerging markets as well as developed markets. So no, we still think there is opportunity for growth in those categories, and we're going after it.","Operator","We'll take Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a quick clarification. I just missed something and then to the core question here. I apologize. So you said FX will be a 10% impact on the bottom line. But in the...","Ian M. Cook","No, on the top line.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","On the top line. Okay, fine. Sorry. I missed that. Okay. If you go to kind of the pricing and dig down a little bit further in kind of 2 buckets, one is Asia at negative 1% and then Europe, negative 4.5%, how do you think that goes going forward? So do you think that kind of negative pressure will continue on those marketplaces where it's going down? And then on where the pricing has been driving your overall pricing, so Latin America and Africa\/Eurasia, both in kind of 7.5%, 8% range. Both of those, as you comment, are driven by highly inflationary areas. So Venezuela, as an example, in Latin America, call it, 50% or 60% inflation, it's 3% of your business, overall, 10% of that region, Africa\/Eurasia, Russia, obviously, the driver there or one of the potential drivers there. And thereto, what do you think the sustainability is of that? And if you were to pull out Venezuela and Russia in those pricings, what would it be? Sustainably both of the negative, so the bad stuff and then potentially the good stuff on pricing.","Ian M. Cook","Wow. Where to start? The -- if we take pricing overall, and you may have missed the response we gave a little bit earlier, we continue to believe we have pricing power. And therefore, the growth pricing we've been able to take is around 4.5%. And we have reinvested some of that in the trade spending activity to grow market share, which, along with the traditional advertising we have invested, have continued to be productive. We are growing market shares broadly, and we are seeing our gross margin expand. We think in terms of the pricing in Africa\/Eurasia and Latin America that, that is sustainable. We're not, again, going to talk about Venezuela specifically other than to say when we got pricing in the fourth quarter of last year, so did many of our competitors. And regardless of what the inflation is in a country, in Venezuela's case, pricing is controlled by the government. So we don't have the flexibility to follow the inflation with self-directed pricing in Venezuela. So Venezuela is all rollover in 2015. I would also say that we have very broad-based pricing increases across all of Latin America. You forgot Hill's, where I think we've got a very good balance between effective pricing and volume growth on that business and beginning to see the gross margin build back nicely, which was clearly one of our objectives. The U.S., North America pricing possibility, that will always be a bit choppy, given the timing of couponing behind new products and the fact that couponing goes into price. And I think there will continue to be pricing pressure in Europe, but our expectation is that it will ease over the balance of the year compared to the first quarter level. Now in Asia, specific to China, we made some corrective pricing actions on a couple of our businesses, which are now baked in for the full year. I think that was responding to all the questions you asked, Ali, at least I hope so.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And forgive me if you've touched on this. There's a lot of stuff here. But advertising growth for the full year, do you expect the actual recorded number to be up in local currency and in dollars would be the first thing. And then just on China, there's been a move to premiumization in many categories, and toothpaste is one of them. The local toothpaste I think is a premium product. Are you doing anything -- I know your Darlie brand is very successful, but within the Colgate brand, are you doing things to premiumize and try to take advantage of that?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Yes, we are. I mean, on the advertising side, when we look at advertising spending for the year, we see, on a ratio basis, an increase year-on-year. In local currency terms, it will certainly be up. It will certainly be up. The -- from a China point of view, you're absolutely right. There is a fair degree of premiumization going on in China, and we indeed are taking advantage of that. When you put China in a longer context, over the last 8 years, we built our China business from about a 29 share to a market-leading 33, 34 share, 34 share January, February this year. If you look at our principal multinational competitor, they've gone from 25, down to under 15. And the other multinational competitor has gone down from mid-teens to high single digits. And that premium local brand you mentioned is what is taking up the slack. So we're continuing to hold market position quite nicely. And indeed, we are adopting a premiumization strategy.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Ian, you alluded to kind of the pullback in marketing from the competition earlier. And there's been some talk about your largest competitor meaningfully pulling back on kind of media spend over the next few months or few quarters. How do you look at that? Is that some -- an opportunity to keep the foot on the pedal? Or is there just too much marketing and advertising out there? Maybe everybody can benefit a little bit.","Ian M. Cook","The -- I would say when we think about our -- I'm now talking the traditional advertising media. I would say that our focus is more on what is necessary to reach, engage and convince our consumers to stay with our brands from an emotional point of view and to try our innovation. That's the purpose. And that dictates a certain reach and frequency for your traditional media. These days, it also requires a mix between the traditional and the digital and other ways of connecting with people. If some of these pullbacks continue to be as we have seen them, maybe it does create a little bit more of a rational opportunity in some markets. But we'll track that for a while before we make any significant changes.","Operator","From Raymond James, we have Joe Altobello.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions on SG&A. I guess, first, in terms of overhead, a little surprised it was up this quarter. Was that all FX-driven? And then secondly, if you could remind us what you're expecting in terms of total restructuring savings this year.","Ian M. Cook","Yes. The -- you're right on the overhead, Joe. In fact, total dollar expenses were down. So the reason the ratio is up is a combination of timing and dollar-denominated expenses against a weakening foreign exchange-driven top line. As to your second point, I think we have in our K -- I think we're talking 65 to 75 after-tax for the year -- sorry, that was the restructuring.","Operator","And we have Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I feel like most of this has actually been covered. So I'm just going to leave it alone and let you proceed to the next person.","Operator","We'll go ahead and move on to Eddy Hargreaves with Canaccord.","Eddy Hargreaves - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Two questions, actually. Sorry to harp on about the advertising spend.","Ian M. Cook","Harp away, harp away.","Eddy Hargreaves - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","You answered the last person who asked you this in terms of ratios, but I think what you were saying, implying that you think that worldwide advertising investment will be up for the full year in absolute terms, just is down 10% to $430 million in the quarter. If that's right, I'm slightly surprised because it implies quite a step-up in the next 3 quarters, given your overall sort of commentary about the media environment. Perhaps you could square that circle somewhat.","Ian M. Cook","Maybe I misspoke. Let me answer the first one first and then you can ask the second one so we don't lose the point. It will be up in local currency, on a currency-neutral basis. And it will be up on a ratio basis. The dollars will be broadly in line, maybe modestly down, year-on-year. And your second question?","Eddy Hargreaves - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. Yes. And the other one was, there's been some sort of comment earlier on in the questioning about the North American pricing looking a bit better. You obviously said that it tends to be choppy. But if we look at the overall organic performance top line in North America, it looks as weak as it's been for quite a few quarters sort of looking back across the spreadsheet as it were. Perhaps you could sort of give some sense of how you see the North American consumer environment generally, given potential oil price-based benefits to consumers, that type of thing. Are you fairly confident that the environment will look better in H2 than H1, for example?","Ian M. Cook","Who knows? I mean, the first quarter economic numbers were just revised down. I think there is an underlying confidence that the U.S. economy is on the turn, but I think it's a slow turn. Frankly, our consumption in the U.S. is ahead of the consolidated growth in the categories we're in, that U.S. category growth is between 1% and 2%. We're slap-banging that. And as Bina commented in her remarks, our market shares are up in North America. So we're quite pleased with that. And we will be poised to take advantage of the growth should it accelerate because we have a rich array of innovation to bring to the marketplace.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","My question actually has to do with Brazil. Is it that -- we heard from your competitors, L'Or\u00e9al, Unilever, that category growth was flat in terms of volume. But your volumes are actually down. And then you're telling us that you're gaining share. So then the question is, is it that the calculation has to do because people are trading down within Colgate's portfolio and that's why you are getting negative volumes. Or is it that at the end of the day, you are overrepresented in channels that are losing market share, say, large format retailers and that's how we reconcile the fact that you have strong shares, but actually, your volumes are negative, which your competitors are not posting negative volumes?","Ian M. Cook","The -- I guess all these countries have to be a balance between volume and price, given the transaction impact of the foreign exchange. So in Brazil, we took pricing and we took pricing against volume, to your point, to establish the pricing in the marketplace. At the same time, because of the economic decline, several of the categories did go negative in volume terms. So not all the categories were positive from a volume point of view. The other thing one has to say, and I spent 3 days down there not so long ago, is there is quite a bit of short-term disruption in the marketplace. The economy slows down. You have the various scandals unfolding day after day. Interest rates go up. And what happens is the indirect retailers take a step back and wait to see how everything is going to settle out. So there is an added element, I would say, of short-term hesitation in terms of the way the market would normally line up. But as I said earlier, our focus is going to be on growing market share, controlling our costs, expanding gross margin and weathering what we believe will be a slower Brazil environment for the balance of this year.","Operator","And we'll move on to our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So two questions. One, just wanted to get an update on the Tom's of Maine expansion and sort of your thoughts thus far, bigger opportunity, smaller opportunity than maybe you had thought originally. And then housekeeping, is there any impact on cash usage, CapEx, share repo, dividend, et cetera, from FX?","Ian M. Cook","The Tom's business is doing very well. The first quarter organic growth was up double digits. We have, as you know, an extremely strong position in Oral Care toothpaste in the United States, over 50 market share in the channels that are unique to Tom's. And that's why, as Bina said, we have taken the opportunity now that we have consolidated our position in toothpaste to extend the Tom's name into the baby skin health space, which we think will be a big opportunity for Tom's going forward. As I have said before, this is not a marketing accelerated business. You have to win consumers one at a time and be patient. But once they are Tom's consumers, they're Tom's consumers forever. And they almost pledge allegiance to the brand, which we may have them do one day. In terms of cash usage, no major change in CapEx or repurchase. No major change.","So listen, I understand those are all the questions on the line. I thank you very much for your interest in the company. And as always, I thank Colgate people around the world for making it all happen. Talk to you next time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation.

Please go ahead, Bina.","Bina H. Thompson - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Jessica. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","We're very pleased with the continued strong organic sales growth in our business across all divisions. In fact, the pace of such growth has accelerated nearly everywhere. Innovation continues to play an important role in our successful array of new products across categories has resulted in strong and growing market shares.","As Ian said in the press release, our robust organic sales growth is particularly notable in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions in many markets; however, foreign exchange continues to be an even more significant headwind, and that is continuing into the third quarter.","And as you know, we're diligent in taking pricing to offset currency-related transaction costs and are pleased that even with the pricing we have taken, there is still a good balance with volumes. Our savings programs are delivering excellent results both our ongoing Funding the Growth initiatives as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency program.","Cash generation is solid and our working capital is low, down year-over-year. So, we think we're making good progress in 2015 and have good plans in place to keep up the momentum.","So, let's turn to the divisions; starting with North America; we're pleased with the solid organic sales growth in North America this quarter and acceleration from the first quarter 2015 growth, driven by a solid volume increase of 3%. And as mentioned in the press release, U.S. market shares are strong across many categories. Innovation continues to play a critical role; although, we also see strengths in the base business. For instance, Colgate Total toothpaste continues to maintain a market share of around 10%.","In the first quarter, we launched Colgate Total mouthwash for gum health, which allowed us to drive the regimen concept in-store with a claim of 45% stronger, healthier gums versus non-antibacterial mouthwash. The mouthwash is off to a great start. It's the number one new item at a major U.S. retailer.","In toothbrushes, our newest addition to the Colgate 360\u00b0 line is Colgate 360\u00b0 Optic White Platinum. This has been incremental in the line. Colgate 360\u00b0 has come from a 13% share for full-year 2011 to a 19.3% share of the total category year-to-date. And as we said in the press release, our leadership manual toothbrush here is now well over 40% at 41.4%.","We're particularly pleased with the performance of our Tom's of Maine business. Sales are growing healthy double-digits with the strongest growth in our top 10 retailers. With the expansion of our shopper marketing initiative, we achieved our first-ever end aisle displays in many customers during our well executed April Earth Month integrated marketing campaign.","Our new Tom's baby line is off to a very encouraging start with wide acceptance across retail channels. The line is receiving positive online consumer reviews and the body lotion and hair body wash products are within the top SKUs ranking in selling ahead of many other big and established baby brands.","The fastest-growing segment within fabric conditioners is scent boosters. We launched Suavitel Fragrance Pearls in-wash scent boosters in March of this year with the claim of five times longer-lasting fragrance versus detergent alone. Distribution continues to build within major accounts, and our year-to-date share in the overall category is at 18.7%, up 70 basis points, with our second quarter share at a record 19.5%.","Looking ahead in the third quarter, we'll be launching Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste, which helps reverse early damage for better oral health and goes beyond promoting traditional benefits to a new consumer relevant space, with the best testing Colgate Total concept ever. And as you can imagine, we'll be backed by a full support plan including TV, PR and social media, professional and multicultural outreach and of course in-store shopper activity.","As you know, in the second half of 2014, we launched Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste. In the first quarter, this year, we added Colgate Enamel Health Multi-Protection toothpaste to the Enamel footprint. And now in the third quarter, we're adding Colgate Enamel Health mouthwash to provide a complete regimen solution. This new mouthwash helps replenish natural calciums, reverses enamel softening and helps prevent cavities, all with a great-tasting flavor. And finally, in the Kids' segment, we're launching the first-ever regimen portfolio with Minions branding across the toothpaste, toothbrush and mouthwash categories.","Turning then to Europe\/South Pacific; we're pleased with the acceleration in organic sales growth in this region from the first quarter. Continued innovation has contributed to the results. Consequently, our regional year-to-date market shares are up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouth rinse, body wash, liquid hand soap, underarm protection and fabric conditioner.","The regional launch of our premium priced Colgate Max White One Optic toothpaste has been incremental to our share in the whitening category and has helped to increase overall toothpaste share in France, Italy and Spain. In addition, in France, a strong integrated marketing campaign has helped grow our elmex SENSITIVE toothpaste business in the mass channel.","Growth in our manual toothbrush business has been driven by innovation and excellent in-store execution. The favorable gap between us and our nearest competitor has widened over the last five years from just 70 basis points to almost 7 full points on a year-to-date basis.","Across Europe, our manual toothbrush share is up 150 basis points to 24.6% year-to-date. And in Australia, our share is up 170 basis points to 63.3% year-to-date, with the most recent read at 63.8%.","And we told you last quarter about an exciting new innovation in Personal Care, Sanex Advanced. This is off to a very good start. The line of body washes and underarm deodorant has been incremental to the business and, in the last month, our body wash share has met or exceeded our goal in France, Spain and Belgium. Innovation continues in the second half of 2015.","In the toothpaste category, we're just now launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent toothpaste. This premium-priced offering repairs sensitive areas of the teeth and prevents further sensitivity for instant and lasting relief.","An extensive shopper marketing program will support a complete re-launch of our Colgate 360\u00b0 manual toothbrushes, which provide superior cleaning for a whole mouth clean versus an ordinary flat trimmed toothbrush. This premium-priced line, which includes Colgate 360\u00b0 Expert White and Colgate 360\u00b0 for men should help continue the excellent momentum we've seen in this category.","And in our body wash business, we'll be launching Palmolive Gourmet body washes, a line of creamy body butter washes with fragrant ingredients, including vanilla, chocolate and peach, which have already been very successful in the Africa\/Eurasia division.","Moving on to Latin America. We're pleased with a continued strong organic sales growth in this region. Two of our largest subsidiaries in the region, Mexico and Brazil, delivered solid performance and, of particular note with Brazil, where organic sales growth accelerated nicely from the first quarter. Market shares for Latin America increased year-to-date in toothpaste, shampoo, liquid cleaners, dish washing liquid and fabric conditioners. Our regional toothpaste share is at 75.7% year-to-date, up 70 basis points, and the highest level in four years despite competitive entries during that time period. In Brazil, our year-to-date share is up 40 basis points to almost 72%, while in Mexico our year-to-date share increased 70 basis points to 81%.","Our Home Care business in Mexico is extremely strong; dish liquid shares are at 52.2% year-to-date, up almost 3 points; liquid cleaner shares are at 33.5% year-to-date, up 80 basis points; and fabric conditioner shares are at 48.6% year-to-date, up almost 2 points.","In the dish category, the launch of Axion Complete exceeded expectations. And our very successful Thank You Mom campaign behind Suavitel, our leading fabric conditioner, helped to further strengthen that brand equity.","Our innovation pace will continue in the second half. Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothpaste will be rolled out throughout the region. This is Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste available in Latin America. It intensifies the white of your teeth three shades whiter with a unique formula that uses the same ingredient dentists use. Accompanying the toothpaste will be re-launches of Colgate Luminous White mouthwash and toothbrush.","In the Personal Care category, we will be expanding the distribution of Protex Complete 12, a range of bar soap, liquid hand soap and body wash that provides long-lasting antibacterial protection and offers 12 times more protection than non-antibacterial bar soap.","And in Home Care, we'll be introducing a rinse-free formula to our base Suavitel fabric conditioner business currently available only in premium offerings, which should further enhance our strong number-one position.","Moving to Asia. We're pleased with the acceleration of organic sales growth in Asia from the first quarter. In particular, our business in China is performing well and back to solid growth. As we said in the press release, we maintain our strong leadership in toothpaste across the region. In India, our year-to-date share is stable at 54.8%, with the most recent read at 55.1%. And in China, we hold the number-one position at almost 34% year-to-date.","Our toothbrush business in the Philippines is strong and growing in the Premium and Super Premium segments. Our year-to-date share is at a record 57.4%, up 70 basis points, with the most recent read at 58.3%. Our Colgate 360\u00b0 Charcoal Gold toothbrush first launched in China has been successful in this market as well.","Our regional share in mouthwash is at a record 23.5% year-to-date, up 60 basis points, with particularly strong performance in the Philippines and Hong Kong. And as elsewhere, more new products are planned for the balance of the year.","In China, we will be re-launching our base Colgate Anticavity toothpaste in both the whitening and all-around anti-cavity segment. Elsewhere in the region, we're excited about our Colgate Total Charcoal Deep Clean toothpaste gel, which has a unique antibacterial formula that reduces bacteria on 100% of your mouth surfaces and provides 12-hour protection for a healthier mouth.","In toothbrushes, we're introducing a line extension of our Colgate Natural Essences toothbrush, which has lotus-infused bristles. In addition, across the region, we're launching Colgate Kids Spiderman and Barbie toothbrushes with 0.01 millimeter slim tip bristles.","Africa\/Eurasia. As elsewhere, significant currency headwinds affected our financial results in this division. The good organic sales growth of 4% was price-driven as we took pricing actions to help offset transaction costs. However, with negative 21.5% foreign exchange across the division, we couldn't recoup all the losses. So, it's encouraging that our local businesses are doing well and our market shares are generally solid.","Our regional toothpaste share is up 100 basis points to 32.9% year-to-date, with our most recent read at 33%. Notably, our share in Russia increased 2 full points to 33.6% year-to-date, with the most recent read at a record-high 34.1%.","Both Colgate Total and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpastes have performed very well. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection was launched in early 2015 and it's already reached almost 1 full share point nationally and has garnered 1.2 share points in the modern trade.","In Turkey, our share increased 120 basis points to 26.6% year-to-date. And in South Africa, our share was up 60 basis points to 50.3% year-to-date. Our toothbrush share is up in the 15 countries to 16 countries, which represent over 99% of our toothbrush business in the division.","In Russia, incremental listings in the country's largest retailer have contributed to year-to-date share increase of 240 basis points to 47.2% with the most recent read at 47.7%. And in Turkey, our very successful Colgate Slim Soft toothbrush has helped grow our share by 150 basis points to 28.3% year-to-date. Our regional bar soap share is up 290 basis points to 22.6% year-to-date, driven by gains in our two top markets; South Africa and Russia.","More innovation is planned for the second half of the year. We will be refreshing both our base business Sensitive toothpaste as well as launching our Premium Colgate Optic White toothpaste with new and more impactful graphics.","In South Africa, where we have a strong Protex business, we will introduce Protex Complete 12 ourselves, which provide 12 times more germ protection and offers long-lasting anti-germ action.","And finally, Hill's; we're pleased with Hill's strong organic sales performance in the quarter. The business is on track and innovation is driving both the domestic and international business. Our unique weight-loss product, Prescription Diet Metabolic Canine and Feline food is gaining share globally. We recently introduced a stew product along with the dry, and that has accelerated growth in the wet segment. The product comes in a new global packaging design and has been supported with a global testimonial campaign as well as print and online media.","Adding to this successful innovation in April of this year was Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Mobility Canine food and Metabolic Plus Urinary Feline food. These new foods, which are nutritionally formulated for concurrent health conditions, have been the primary focus of our 2015 pet conferences.","Another global success in the Prescription Diet line has been upgrade of our k\/d formula for kidney care diet in cats. Cats with renal conditions typically suffer a loss of appetite, so it's difficult to get them to eat the food, which will help them improve their conditions. This product contains our new EAT Technology Enhanced Appetite Trigger, which improves appetite while helping to both preserve lean muscle mass and increase energy. The feedback from vets has been excellent, and we've received excellent testimonials from clients and the veterinary healthcare teams.","As you expect, we have more innovation planned for the balance of the year. To keep the momentum in our Prescription Diet business, in the third quarter in the U.S., we're beginning to roll out a Prescription Diet i\/d sensitive, the first product in the GI segment for food sensitivity, free of wheat, gluten, lactose, and soy proteins. A trial program and pet parent guide helps veterinarians and pet parents to see the difference this food makes. These are part of the complete IMC bundle, with trade ads, printed and e-detailers, as well as in clinic seminars.","A new products in our Science Diet line is Urinary Hairball Control Feline food, the only wellness food that addresses the two most common conditions in healthy cats. The launch this month in the U.S. is supported to the PetSmart store associate feeding program as well as from Petco's whole pet specialists.","So in summary, we are pleased with the way 2015 is progressing, particularly in light of the macroeconomic challenges that we and other space around the world. We're committed to investing in the business in order to drive solid organic sales growth and global market shares.","We will continue to focus on brand building innovation as well as our worldwide productivity programs. Colgate people around the world are implementing our effective strategies, which we expect will allow us to continue to deliver solid results, and we look forward to sharing these results as we go through the balance of the year.","And now, Jessica, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I'd like to turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience. We ask as well that you limit yourself to one question in return that to the queue to allow everyone the opportunity to ask their questions.","We'll now go to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for the question.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jason.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Bina, you kind of closed at your prepared remarks talking about continue to focus on driving solid sales growth in market shares and certainly as you ran through the market shares performance, it's indeed impressive.","But looking through the belly of the P&L and particularly gross profit, the leakage of cost inflation, which I know includes FX, and I suspect it's predominantly FX-related remains sizable. How do you wrestle with the balance of getting more price to cover some of that, even if it comes at the expense of some near-term market share versus continue to drive the market share? And do you think you're at the right balance right now? Or should you be leaning a little more towards price?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks for the question, Jason. We didn't rehearse this, but it's a perfect lead-in to some remarks I was wanting to make to put the gross profit in context, tell you to exactly your question, how we are thinking about that balance over the rest of the year and then probably I'll just go through the gross margin roll forward to save time, somebody else asking the question.","I think to begin with, it goes without saying that 2015 is a volatile year, and characterized as we all know by economic challenges in many parts of the world, and I think very specifically as Bina mentioned, a continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which accelerated across the second quarter; and in fact has continued to strengthen with the current rates, we're seeing into the third quarter.","And so, as you put it, we are very well pleased with the continued strong; in fact, accelerating organic growth in our business and we see that overall having a healthy balance between volume and pricing, which is a balance one tries to maintain. Indeed, as we look across each of our four business categories, we see a healthy balance between volume and price.","And I would say at this stage that we are still expecting top line organic growth for the full-year to be in the 4% to 7% range. Now, when you step back from that and say what is making that work, we think it's three things; our innovation is clearly working, and it is broad and it is lined up well for the future. We believe, as we have said before that our commercial programs, which is a combination of traditional advertising and trade spending are effective and that together the strength of our innovation and the effectiveness of those commercial programs are seeing market shares growing quite broadly.","So, in sum, our strategy is delivering strong brand led growth and double-digit EPS increases on a currency neutral basis. Now, as you rightly say, our gross margin in the quarter was pressured more than expected, despite the fact that we realized good pricing, that as you will see when I go through the gross margin roll forward we had good continued delivery of strong Funding the Growth and restructuring savings. Indeed, we offset year-to-date to the dollar impact of the cost increases so far this year.","But in the second quarter specifically, we face three unanticipated negative impacts on our material costs. Obviously, we expected a meaningful impact from foreign exchange transaction costs, but we did incur the incremental costs of the faster than forecast foreign exchange deterioration.","We saw in several high inflation emerging markets, including Venezuela, an increase in local material costs in the quarter. And finally, while not a significant factor in the overall gross margin decline, we did see additional material cost increases in Venezuela due to a slowdown in dollars received at the official rate.","Now, what to do over the balance of the year? As you would expect, our planned response is additional pricing; and as I said on the last call, as we think about pricing we try and maintain this balance between volume and price.","In some situations, Africa, Eurasia, as Bina mentioned, where the exchange impact is so significant, we take extremely aggressive action and, indeed, concede volume to get price and stabilize the business. In other parts of the world, we seek to maintain a balance, but regardless of approach, additional pricing is planned for the balance of the year.","Clearly, we will redouble our focus on Funding the Growth, and we intend to take full advantage of generally weakening commodity materials pricing, which on the last call we said would really begin to benefit towards the end of the second quarter. So, those are our three responses.","We believe we have planned them in a way that will allow us the maintenance of the top line growth in that 4% to 7% range. And now, our thinking for the year, we'll see a sequential improvement in gross margin across the balance of the year; and for the full-year, an increase of 10 basis points to 30 basis points.","So, let me go from that to the gross profit roll forward. So, if we take the second quarter, we start with the prior year at 58.8%, we pick up a one point benefit from pricing, we pick up 2.2 points of favorable from Funding the Growth and the modest contribution from restructuring. We take a negative impact of 3.5 points of material prices, which traced back to the unexpected impacts I just referenced, 20 basis points of other, which gets you to the 58.3% in the quarter, the 50 basis points decline. So, that's how we're thinking about it.","And as you rightly say, one is trying always to find a good balance between the top line growth and the recovery of the ratio in gross margin. And we think we have that in the plan for the balance of the year. Thanks for the question.","Operator","We'll now go to Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. A question on Venezuela, actually, Ian, following up on some of things you just mentioned. Clearly it's a topic that comes up every time you visit with us in one form or another. You obviously continue to account for CP Venezuela at the SICAD rate. Many others have either shifted to SIMADI or else chosen to deconsolidate, as we saw from P&G this morning.","So I know there are legal and accounting guidelines that dictate the appropriate treatment of Venezuela, but I'm wondering how much discretion there is on those matters because, at some level, it feels like kind of taking the hit, so to speak, and moving on would provide some benefit, especially if your access to dollars is decelerating, as you mentioned in response to Jason's question.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I wasn't necessarily expecting it as the second question, but I think we were expecting a remark or two on Venezuela. I think the first thing I would say in terms of the breadth of information that we provide on Venezuela, we have I think over time been providing increasing disclosure in our Qs and Ks. And I think you will find that continues to be the case when you read the Q on this quarter.","As may know or you will now know, for the first six months of this year, Venezuela represented about 4% of our revenue and 2% of base business operating profit for the six months ended in June.","And we do provide in the Q the detail of the net monetary assets that we hold of just over $600 million and the non-monetary assets that we hold of just under $300 million that could be subject to impairment.","We also provide information as to the effect on that if we had to go to the SIMADI rate, which would see us with a charge of about $340 million after-tax or $0.37 per diluted share. And that would also likely lead to an impairment of our non-monetary assets. And we also provide, as we have done for some time, Colgate's total investment in Venezuela, which is about $1 billion.","Now, the reason we continue to manage Venezuela the way we do, first of all, we have for 2014 and into 2015 been receiving dollars and are able to operate our business even though, as you say, that has become a little bit more volatile in the second quarter.","Second, each company has its own facts and circumstances. And we still understand that our dividends would be remitted at the SICAD rate and, therefore, that's why we translate the business at that. And of course, we moved to the SICAD away from the official rate, so it is a little bit more conservative.","But as you rightly indicate, Venezuela is a period-to-period assessment. You will see in our Q that our conclusion at the end of the second quarter is that we will maintain the translation rate we have and that we will continue to consolidate that business and we will specific to our facts and circumstances, as we always do, to continue to revisit that quarter-upon-quarter.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Bina and Ian. Good morning.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","How easily they forget.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you just talk about structurally how you view advertising? Because it seems like your market shares aren't impacted at all by the pullback, and maybe it's like a share of voice issue because maybe the guys are pulling back as well. But maybe structurally could that advertising ratio be lower going forward because it's not having much of an impact on your market share trends?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll resist repeating the last man standing comment, Bill. But in terms of advertising, as I have said before, we build our programs from the ground up, and we're very much focused on what it takes to maintain awareness of our base business, build awareness of new innovations and build trial and go on and repeat, given the quality of our products for the new products that we bring to the marketplace.","As you rightly say or suggest, and we have seen and we talked about it on the last call, we have seen many competitors in several significant markets around the world substantially pull back on traditional advertising and, therefore, we can accomplish our strategic objectives and not lose competitive presence on the ground.","And as we've tried to express before, a lot of what you can do at the retail level today is far more sophisticated and strategic than maybe 10 years ago. And we make no apology for choosing to construct our marketing programs with good reliance on both.","We talk about integrated marketing communications and we talk about reaching consumers at all touch points, which of course does, yes, include traditional television and digital, but also includes the retail, dental professional, veterinary professional environments that shape their purchasing decisions. I would not project seeing our advertising levels decline meaningfully.","In fact, as we think about this year, we expect to be up on a local currency basis and probably at about the same level as last year on a ratio basis. But we'll obviously again as we go forward look at what it takes to build the engagement without consumers to keep growing market share and therefore our brands and therefore the top line of the company.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then, can I just ask you, are you shipping to consumption now in most of the markets? So, is it stocking largely done?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you for the one question. The...","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","It's a short one.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In China, as we said on the last call, in fact, the consumption was mid-single-digits. We suggested, I think, that the second quarter was off to a good start in China and that we expected to be back to consumption.","You, I think, can see that in the Asia numbers. China is back to consumption, and as Bina mentioned, we saw a bounce back in Brazil, and when we look at our categories in Latin America, including Brazil, the growth rates of the categories is around that mid-single-digits level; so we would say, you know, that's the expected environment going forward.","In fact, to comment for the emerging markets, mid-single-digits for the U.S., about 2% on average or the spread is 1% to 3% depending on the categories; and Europe at the same, 0% to 2% range bound level it's been in for some time.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Chris.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Ian, I guess that's a perfect transition to Brazil. The last time we were talking about Brazil intra-quarter and in last quarter's call, you weren't particularly optimistic about it. The recovery there, though, your volumes, your organic was up nicely. I guess can you talk about what's changed? Has it been the category growth rates or is it \u2013 it doesn't look like it was an acceleration of share based on what you said, but I'd just love any commentary you can offer up there?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Our share is up. I mean, Bina talked about the year-to-date. The latest period is over 72%, as I said last time, who's looking? I think, fundamentally, Chris, it has to do with the category.","I think we were prudent the last time we spoke, because the country was in a state of short-term dislocations; and in fact I had just come back from Brazil and so felt it up close and personal, and we thought it was better to take a more prudent stance for the balance of the year, until we saw the category growth rates come through.","I would say that has now stabilized. We expected to provide an update at the end of the second quarter, and we're able to do so, and I think we can say that the underlying consumer consumption now in our categories in Brazil is back to that broad mid-single-digits growth rates. So, it traces specifically to the category growth.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Just going back to Latin America, just wanted to \u2013 and maybe I can't do the algebra; but on unit growth, it looks like it was flat excluding, I guess, the acquisitions year-over-year, and it said it was partially hurt by Venezuela. I mean, would it have been up meaningfully without Venezuela? And do you expect unit growth to kind of start to bounce back as we move through the year?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, again, I think we were very pleased with the organic growth, to save Ali the trouble when he comes on, we don't break out Venezuela; but our volume growth in Latin America, we see as coming back, but we were quite happy with the trade-off we made to price relative to volume in this quarter to an earlier question. The volume ex-Venezuela was indeed more positive than you see for the division, but by a multiple. Did we lose everybody?","Operator","No, your line is still open.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Do we have no more questions?","Operator","I guess, Mr. Chappell, your line is still open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that was \u2013 yeah. So, it was just to clarify, you do expect unit growth. It's just a matter \u2013 and Venezuela did kind of wipe away all of the unit growth this quarter?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Venezuela depressed the division's unit growth, yes.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And but even with incremental price increases, unit growth should bounce back going forward?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now go to Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you so much. Good morning. I'm just wondering...","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Caroline.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Could you dig in a little bit on Russia, where P&G had really, really awful June results, I believe, I think down 57%, just very difficult times? And also comment generally on whether some of your foreign competitors are behaving differently, given they don't have the dollar currency issues you have?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I really don't want to start getting into detail by countries; but suffice it to say, we did not have the declines in Russia that some others are quoting. Our market shares in Russia are strong and growing.","And we, of course, have taken some fairly significant pricing across that division, but very specifically to Russia, given the foreign exchange impact, actually, our toothbrush here in Russia was up two points. So, is back to the opening remarks, really, and that is, yes, we are taking pricing as we need to. We're focusing on Funding the Growth, we're focusing on the Global Growth and Efficiency program, but we're also focusing on building our brands and building our market shares. And I would say the progress in Russia fits that model.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","And just on foreign competitors, are you seeing them, you know, enter any markets anew or do anything differently, the ones you don't have a dollar exposure?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think most everybody is hurt a little bit by the Russian circumstance. We certainly don't see any irrational behavior the other way, no.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Sorry. I didn't mean specific to Russia. I mean, in general.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh. You know, again, you see pockets of increased activity. You see pockets of decreased activity. I would characterize the global landscape as business as usual.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ali, Ali, Ali, don't shout at me.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Why? Do I shout?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, no, no.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","You're listening to our previous call?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I was reading the transcript. Yeah.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I just state the truth. That's all I try to do. So, on advertising spend, you know, it's the fifth quarter in a row where we've seen it down. What we see, at least, understand the gross to net, but what we see in particular is down in Latin America and Africa\/Eurasia, and I can't pretend to say that if you decline, you know, reduce advertising spend in those regions you'll get an immediate response, but you did see flat volume in Latin America understanding on the price\/mix that you got or the price parts you got. Africa\/Eurasia was down 3%, which is some of the worst we've seen. And I get the share of voice comments. Our share voice isn't lower. It's actually higher and that's why we're gaining share. As your senior brethren are feeling quite some pain as well.","But what's happened to the category? So, what's the category responsibility? I mean, maybe share voices isn't the right metric, because the category itself should be, could be growing a little bit faster going forward. So, I wanted to get your thoughts on that a little bit. And I know it's only one question, but as a clarification on the gross margin that you described earlier on, if you would, please?","So, the gross margin guidance is down to like 80 basis points at the high end, but you're still to kind of negative low single-digit EPS growth number? I'm trying to get a better understanding what the offsets are just staying in that low single-digits or is it just kind of worst low single-digits, when you describe it for the year? Thanks very much.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the first question is a very broad question. To be clear, I'm not saying that our share of voice is necessarily higher by market. I'm saying that if you use that as the measure of consumer engagement, which is a questionable hypothesis, even though, it gives you a number, we have remained competitive.","And back to the comment we made earlier, you know, our objective is to make sure we have brand awareness of our base business and build trials for new businesses. And we believe the spend levels we have do that. If you look at the category rates of growth, I would argue that growing categories is a lot more complicated than simply media pressure.","Obviously, in our advertising we do the educational work, but sometimes perhaps we don't talk about it enough or people don't focus on it enough, but how you go to market, the depth of distribution you build, the sizing pricing you have in your portfolio, indeed, the price points you have in your portfolio amplified by price both at the low-end and the high-end creates access points for people to come into and stay in a category.","And we put an awful lot of pressure and effort to making sure we construct our portfolio the right way in order to keep the category penetration up and keep the growth rates of the categories at healthy levels. And all of that you see in the portfolio choices we make, the sizing pricing choices we make, the distribution gains we get, right down to the furthest rural areas, and that is very much a driver on sustaining a category growth. Now, it's a very big discussion, Ali, and I'm not trying to trivialize it. I'm just trying to suggest there are more factors that come to bear than just advertising.","And then to come to your second point. And some of you have already started to indicate this, so let me try and respond to the question and be clear. As we said in our release, at current spot rates, we continue to expect a low-single digit earnings per share decline on a dollar basis, excluding, of course, the restructuring and the other charges we highlighted in the release.","Now to be clear, low-single digit earnings decline range, dollar earnings decline range, is minus 1% to minus 3%. And in as much as we have seen continued significant deterioration in foreign exchange rates over the course of the second quarter and since we last spoke, we would expect to be at the more negative end of that range, which would still reflect a double-digit increase on a currency neutral basis.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks for being clear.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ian, if you look at the gross margin reconciliation that you did, obviously a huge hit on the raw material standpoint. You talked about raw materials sort of beginning to trend more favorably in June, I think you said in your commentary.","So, as we look at the transactional piece of that versus the general, let's say, dollar-based raw material inflation, how should we see those things changing as we look out over the next six months to 12 months and that starts to flow in? So, I guess can you give us some direction in terms of how much of that transactional piece you'll be able to offset just with the more favorable moves in the underlying raw material rates? Thanks.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think depending on your view on foreign exchange, we've just given you our view on foreign exchange, that unfortunately is likely to continue. So the benefit will come in the material costs, the commodity costs, over the balance of the year and the increased pricing that we will be taking. So if I give a general view, that's really the way it breaks down.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. So, I guess I was looking for a little bit more of a directional view in terms of excluding the FX, excluding the productivity, just how big can the swing in the raw material benefit be, even if it's just directional over the next several quarters?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that was the detail I didn't want to and still don't want to give.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. First just following up on John's question. The gross margin outlook, while down from prior expectations implies a very big acceleration in the second half. And you mentioned plans for more pricing, so that's part of it. But can you talk through some of the other key drivers like Funding the Growth and some of the cost savings programs that will help drive that meaningful improvement in the back half margins?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Olivia, clearly it really is a combination of the factors that I raised before, which is more pricing, more Funding the Growth, more favorable underlying commodity pricing and maybe a little bit of Global Growth and Efficiency as well.","And then you've maybe got the mix aspect of our business that could provide a factor as well. But the real drivers will be pricing, will be Funding the Growth, underlying commodity costs and maybe a touch from Global Growth and Efficiency, as we have seen before.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. And then on North America, why does there seem to be more volatility on pricing in North American than all your other regions? Because results last quarter and then it reversed to be down this quarter. So, what's driving that difference?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the biggest single difference, Olivia, is couponing. Couponing is a very effective draw mechanism in the U.S., used more in the U.S. than any other geography around the world, and of course, goes into trade spending.","Bina mentioned some of the new products that we have been introducing, and we have obviously been trying to build trial of those new products and, therefore, you invest in couponing and you see it in the volume growth of the business. So you're always going to see North America is a little bit more lumpy quarter-on-quarter because of that difference in the go-to-market.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Mark.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I wanted to ask, as you go around the world, which geographies are you seeing the most impact from local or regional competition? And how do you think about changes in go-to-market strategy to compensate, if any? And thoughts or current updates on a different way of actually going to market? How are you embracing internet, where applicable, and so forth?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say local competitors are a factor around the world. I guess they've been often discussed by several folk in China. Certainly, we see them in Latin America. And your best way of responding and the way we try to respond is to understand the consumer and make sure that the innovation we're providing is competitive against the benefit or the product offering the local competitor is providing.","And then secondly when you mention go-to-market, it is often the case with the local competitor that they have a particular infrastructure that can build downtrade distribution and a lot of activity, again, at retail level, and you just need to be effective in making sure that your products are available at an equal weight to that competitor and that you have the same degree of activity at retail level to compete with them.","Now, China is an interesting example where our market share over the last several years has gone up from 29% to 34%. One of our principal competitors has come down from 25% to under 14%. And another has come down from 12% to high-single digit and the local competitor has really taken the difference.","So without making one example a predictor for the world, I think it demonstrates we have managed to defend and continue to grow our business quite well. But, it comes down to product offering, and the strength of your go-to-market, particularly down trade and particularly activity at retail.","Operator","We'll now go to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning, everyone, Ian, Bina.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Javier.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","A quick question with regards to Hill's. Very good number, the 7%. It seems like the growth at least in your 10-Q, you say that the Prescription Diet category, more like the veterinary side of the business, it was the most meaningful contribution. I had expected because last year we had this problem at the PetSmart specialty stores kind of outlets that it would be the other way around. So, if you can explain the dynamics of the pet food market with the entry of this Blue Buffalo as a publicly traded company, are they promoting more how \u2013 what is happening in the specialty stores? And how sustainable this growth is in the veterinarian channel? Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I guess, the simple answer is they both grew. And the reason for the growth was driven by innovation, both on the Prescription Diet line and the Science Diet line. The appearance of Blue Buffalo in the pet super stores is not a new thing. They have been there for a long while.","And our presence in those stores, our activities in those stores has not been affected. So, we saw very good growth, and as we have tried to say several times on calls, one of the big differences we were striving for was a stream of innovation on Hill's, so that it was not episodic, but that we had a flow of innovation both on the Science Diet business and the Prescription Diet business, and we think we have that. I mean, who couldn't love innovation that has Enhanced Appetite Trigger built into it? I bet the Petco for that. So, it's driven by innovation.","Now where Blue Buffalo will be new is in the more therapeutic side of the business. They have announced two entries in only two segments. One is gastrointestinal. You'll remember from Bina's remarks that we are going to market with a very compelling gastrointestinal product right now with the Prescription Diet line, so I come back to the innovation. We think it's strong, and we think it will see us well with our very elevated share with the vets, which as you rightly say, continue to grow in the second quarter. So, we think we're well-positioned with both, Javier.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hello. I was just, a couple of things. One is on \u2013 I know it's very clear mathematically that the SG&A have to be sort of the plug with the lower gross margin outlook, but I was wondering if that is really sourced from the restructuring savings, if it's an acceleration, what you're tapping into to kind of be able to offset some of the gross margin impact.","And then the second thing was, is it reasonable to assume that some of the gross margin impact, it's just the timing issue like the pricing that will be coming through to the balance of the year, as you get into 2016 will kind of make up some of this incremental pressure you're seeing on commodities because of FX?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Could you repeat the second question, Lauren?","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Sorry. I realized as I was talking I was getting really unclear. So, the transactional impact on commodity costs, which I think is sort of what you were saying in Venezuela, is the timing of the pricing the issue? That it's not that you're not going to price to recover this incremental pressure, it's just we can't get it in fast enough to cover the impact this year, but as you go into next year, it starts to catch up?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, correct. We've always had this situation. I tried to say earlier in response to a question, in some cases, Russia would be a classic example where a crisis emerges. You take very aggressive pricing and accept the fallout on the volume just to stabilize the business.","In other cases, you simply can't take pricing quickly enough, and intelligently manage the balance between volume price and therefore the top line growth in response to transaction, which hits you the minute you exchange slides. So, our pricing benefit from that will be progressive over the balance of the year, and you are correct, will continue into 2016.","So, as we look at the balance of the year, yes, it is to do with the Global Growth and Efficiency program; and as I said, advertising will be broadly in line with last year. You may recall the last time we spoke from a ratio point of view, you may recall the last time we talked about it being up. So, heavily led by Global Growth and Efficiency, and I think you could say a moderation, again, we still think by our share and our top line delivery competitive for the moderation and the advertising over the back half.","Operator","And we'll now take Iain Simpson from SocGen. Go ahead.","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)","Thank you very much. We've seen increased commodity, volatility and also increased currency volatility of late. And you've sort of talked about how your attitudes took pricing and trade spend change in response to that. Have you seen anything unusual from any of your global competitors and how they prioritize the balance of their spending? Is the landscape moving more towards trade spend or advertising? Or if you could just give us some color on the dynamics there? Thank you very much.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, first of all, it's a great name. But in response to the question, as we answered the previous question, I would say from a global point of view, no, you know, no substantial difference. I mean, if you go country-by-country around the world, you see different approaches from different competitors that you have to react to, but no overarching strategy that sees a significant change, no.","Operator","And that was our final question. I would like to turn the conference back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. Thank you very much, Jessica. Thank you all who joined the call and your interest in the company, and as we always say at this time, thank you especially to the Colgate people who make it all happen. Bye-bye.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"6265":["Colgate-Palmolive Co.

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. ","Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.","John Faucher","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO, Dennis Hickey, CFO, Victoria Dolan, Chief Transformation Officer and Corporate Controller, and Elaine Paik, Vice President and Treasurer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC including our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables eight and nine of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. ","Ian Cook","Good morning. This is Ian. I thought before John jumped into his customary division review, I'll just make a couple of opening comments.","Suffice it to say as we said in the press release, this indeed was another challenging quarter and as I think we all know, the industry continues to face global market volatility and we have seen a further slowdown in consumer demand in several key markets, most especially the U.S. Southeast Asia and South Pacific.","On the positive side, that pressure was offset someone by strong organic growth in Latin America with a good balance between price and volume and a return to positive organic sales growth at Hill's.","My purpose in making the introductory comments now is to give you a sense of where we are focused going forward and going forward, we are focused, focused intensely on returning our business to growth over the balance of the year and improving bottom-line performance and our focus is heightened and will be heightened on four fundamentals.","The first is increased advertising spending behind more impactful creative. The second innovation across our portfolio of businesses particularly, for personal care and oral care in the growing natural segment and especially naturals for toothpaste, which has a particular target of local brands in some key geographies in Eurasia and Asia.","Third, greater investment behind our high growth eCommerce business and fourth, aggressively maximizing productivity up and down our income statement. Those are four fundamentals we are focusing on for the balance of the year and I be back later with more detail on each and turn the call back now to John to go through the discussion of the quarter, John.","John Faucher","Thanks Ian. As Ian said in the press release, the second quarter was another challenging one. Net sales were down 0.5% in the quarter due to 1% pricing growth offset by 1% volume decline and slightly negative foreign exchange.","Organic sales growth was flat year-over-year in the second quarter below our expectations. Our categories in the markets remain volatile as the macroeconomic picture remains mixed. We've seen a further slowdown in demand in several markets including the United States, Southeast Asia and South Pacific.","Looking at the cadence of the quarter, after a weak April, we saw improvement in organic sales through the first half of June. The back half of June was however, negatively impacted by retailer destocking in some markets and a reduction in shipments in India in advance of the implication of the new Goods and Services Tax.","As Ian mentioned in the press release, there were also several encouraging factors in the quarter as compared to the year ago. We saw strong sales growth in Latin America driven by a balance of volume and pricing and we saw a return to positive organic sales growth at Hill's following two weaker quarters.","We're also encouraged that our foreign exchange headwind have lessened over the past several quarters and raw material costs are increasing at a more modest rate. We believe consumer usage of our products have remained broadly stable in the vast majority of market, which would be the basic category takeaway should normalize going forward.","While we have seen a small decline in purchase frequency in some markets we're taking steps to adjust price point where necessary to spur consumption usage. While we're pleased with these bright spots, we're attacking the headwinds with a focus you would expect from our company and a strong sense of urgency.","Through pricing and productivity, we achieved gross profit margin expansion in Q2 with 20 basis point of expansion on a GAAP basis and 50 basis points excluding the impact of our 2012 restructuring program. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit margin was down 230 basis points year-over-year in Q2.","Excluding the impact of our 2012 restructuring program, our operating profit margin was down 10 basis points as the improvement in gross profit margin was more than offset by increased advertising investment, higher overhead expenses and other income expense net.","On a GAAP basis, earnings per share of $0.59 was down 12% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of our 2012 restructuring program and a net benefit from a previously disclosed foreign tax matter in the second quarter of 2016, earnings per share was up 3%.","We returned almost $1.6 billion to shareholders year-to-date through share repurchases and dividends. This is a 16% increase versus the first half of 2016.","Now moving to the divisions. We'll start off with North America. In Q2 we saw improvement versus Q1 in both net sales growth and organic sales growth in North America, but not to the extent that we expected. Net sales and organic sales growth in the quarter were down 3.5%. Category growth rates in the U.S. slowed sequentially versus the first quarter, dipping slightly negative, driven by notable decline in April. May and June were better particularly May.","In the toothpaste category, we strengthened our leadership in the U.S. where our market share lead versus our largest competitor increased again versus Q1 and now stands at more than one share point year to date.","We continue to gain share in the ultra-premium whitening segment seeing benefit from our latest launch Colgate Optic White Beauty Radiant and Tom's of Maine Luminous White.","Outside of oral care, our Tom's franchise also continues to gain share in underarm protection, tapping into the continued consumer interest in the natural space. Tom's has expanded it underarm protection line to now mentioned men's and children's variance as well.","Turning to our hand dish category, while we saw sequential improvement in market share in the quarter versus Q1, the business is not yet where it needs to be. Our restage of the business is progressing slower than anticipated as it has been impacted by both category weakness and heightened competitive activity.","The rollout of the new SKU is complete and we're adjusting our promotional strategy to compete more effectively on shelf.","Now we'll look at Latin America. Latin America delivered 7% net sales growth and 8% operating profit growth. Organic sales growth was also at 7% as foreign exchange was even with the year ago period. Our strong gross profit growth in the quarter funded a significant year-over-year increase in advertising investment.","We are encouraged that our volume performance improved across categories and geographies in the division. Our net and organic sales growth of 7% was driven by a mix of volume plus 2.5% and pricing plus 4.5%.","While Mexico volumes were down slightly against difficult comparison, our two state market share in Mexico is up 170 basis points year-to-date versus year-to-date 2016 to 82.1%, our highest share in six years.","We saw sequential improvement in our volume performance in Brazil, Columbia, Argentina and many other markets across the division. As I mentioned, we are encouraged by volume growth in Brazil, but the market remains volatile. We are managing our price points to ensure that we are competitive on shelf.","Our toothpaste market share in Brazil remained at 72% in the quarter, even with Q1. Our Latin America business will benefit from several new product launches in Q3 including Colgate Triple Action Extra freshness toothpaste, Colgate Total Mouthwash and in Brazil, Protex Pro-Hidrata bar soap and body wash.","Moving to Europe, Europe net sales were down 3.5% in the quarter with organic sales down 0.5% and similar to Q1 and a 3% negative impact from foreign exchange. Our U.K. business continues to perform well with a mix of pricing and volume growth, although this was offset by significant negative foreign-exchange impact, which should abate as we cycle easier foreign-exchange comparisons in the second half.","Encouragingly, we saw a further improvement in our French business. Our oral care market shares are improving sequentially as we regained distribution and we would expect this trend to continue into the third and fourth quarters.","Our Personal Care business in France saw strong growth behind the us and at zero relaunch this relaunch features new graphics and new product claims immediate investment for the Sanex Zero relaunch.","This relaunch features new graphics and new product claims. The median investment for the Sanex Zero relaunch includes both TV and digital support that is tested well above advertising testing norms.","Looking forward along the Sanex relaunch, we expect to see benefits from the launch of Colgate Max White Expert Complete Toothpaste, Colgate Minions License Battery Powered Toothbrush and the launch of Palmolive Naturals with precious oils.","Next Asia Pacific, net sales in Asia Pacific were down 5% in the quarter and organic sales were down 3.5%. As mentioned in the press release, organic sales for the region came in softer than expected, primarily due to the reduction in shipments in India in advance of the new Goods and Services Tax or GST, increased competitive activity in Australia and consumption declines in Thailand.","Volume was down 2% in the quarter, driven by declines in India, Australia and Thailand, with Greater China down modestly. Volume performance in India worsened sequentially in Q2 in advance of the implementation of the new Goods and Services Tax, which took effect on July 1.","Due to uncertainty about the new law, the trade in India was cautious and shipments basically ground to a halt for the last two weeks of June. As I mentioned, our Greater China business posted a modest decline in volume in Q2, which was a sequential improvement from Q1.","We are driving significant growth in eCommerce and as a company, we increased our industry-leading toothpaste market share in the quarter in this highly important channel.","In the Philippines, we continue to see solid volume growth performance in market share gains across our oral care personal care portfolios. The Africa Eurasia division reported net sales growth of 1% in Q2, driven by price increases in foreign exchange, which more than offset weaker volumes.","The volume weakness was driven primarily by the continued impact of our distributor changes and our sub-Saharan African business. We showed sequential improvement in volume in our Russian business in the quarter versus Q1, as we raised advertising spending and adjusted price points given some of the recent currency movements.","Benefits from pricing and savings from our Funding the Growth initiatives allowed us to significantly increase our advertising investment in the division. We continue to invest in brand building activities, both in terms of increased television and digital advertising as well as programs to build per capita consumption to drive long-term changes in consumer behavior.","Looking at the second half of the year, we expect the Africa Eurasia division to benefit from the launch of Colgate Ancient Secrets toothpaste in Russia. This premium price line uses locally gleaned insights to tap into the rapidly growing Premium Price Natural segment in the country.","And we'll finish up with Hill's. Hill's delivered flat net sales for the second quarter as organic sales growth 0.5% was offset by slightly negative foreign-exchange. Volumes were down 1.5% with pricing up 2%.","We are encouraged by an notable sequential improvement in volume trends in the United States versus Q1, driven by continued strength in our eCommerce business and greater availability in the pet specialty channel. We made significant progress in regaining distribution and promotional activity in the pet specialty channel in the quarter and we continue to expect improved performance as we further aligned our strategic priorities with our top accounts in this channel.","Our eCommerce growth continues to outpace the category as our eCommerce business in the U.S. doubled year-over-year in the second quarter. Also, our Prescription Diet business in the U.S. is growing nicely, driven by strength into that channel.","Hill's continues to benefit from the recent US launch of Hill's Science Diet Youthful Vitality, which is especially formulated for dogs aged seven years and older to help fight the effects of aging. It's gaining share in the aging dog segment, driven by a strong integrated marketing program that has driven 43 million impressions across all platforms, including some of the most impactful digital advertising we've ever seen on the Hill's brand.","We continue to see significant opportunity to build the Hill's brand in emerging markets with a special pet food category remains underdeveloped. Our emerging markets business volume growth in the quarter was led by Mexico, Brazil, Russia and South Africa.","Now we'll turn your outlook for 2017. As stated in our press release, we lowered our guidance of flat EPS on a GAAP basis to down mid-single digits on a GAAP basis. The change in our GAAP EPS guidance is due to the additional projects I meant -- is due to additional projects bringing our projecting charges for the global growth and efficiency program to the higher end of our previously disclosed guidance range.","On a non-GAAP basis, our guidance remains for low single digit EPS growth. Based on current spot rates, we expect net sales to be up low single digits for the year with a slight negative impact from foreign exchange.","However, given the organic sales weakness in the first half of the year we now expect organic sales growth will be in the low single-digits versus our previous guidance of modestly below our historical long-term range of 4% to 7%.","We still expect solid gross margin expansion but we're now planning for gross margin to be up in the low end to midpoint of our 75 basis points to 125 basis points long-term guidance range versus at the high-end previously.","Lower topline growth in certain higher raw material cost have impacted our year-to-date gross margin performance. We still expect gross margin expansion to accelerate in the second half of the year given less impacts from raw material costs and greater benefits from our Funding the Growth initiatives.","And now I'll turn it back over to Ian.","Ian Cook","Thanks John. So, let me come back to my introductory remarks and say that despite the recent category weaknesses we have seen, we believe a heightened focus on the full fundamentals I mentioned in essence, our focus on brand building and productivity will allow us to reaccelerate our top and bottom-line growth.","So, let me talk a bit further about each of them in turn. The first one is you will remember increased advertising spend behind more impactful creative. So, we are as you know from the beginning of this year, committed to more consistent advertising investment sustained across the year with an increase on both a dollar basis and as a percentage of sales.","The year-over-year increase in advertising investment is planned to accelerate in the second half as we lap lower levels of spending in the prior year. Obviously, part of this advertising will be digital, which is a growing percentage of our working media spend and when I talk about quality, we're talking about advertising that is tested to be motivating and persuasive with consumers using testing norms and what it sees is an increase in advertising behind what you might call the equity of the brand or the purpose of the brand advertising behind the base business sustained over time, while we use incremental advertising to launch new products.","That the most immediate investment effect, but what I wouldn't want to forget is our increasing investment in building per capita consumption of toothpaste, which of course drives sustainable long-term growth, particularly for Latin America, Asia and Africa.","Our Bright Smiles Bright Futures program is well on its way to reaching $1.3 billion children and teach them how to brush their teeth by target year of 2020 as you may recall, spending behind this program generates returns that are three times our return on traditional advertising and our analysis has shown that in our top markets outside the United States, 70% of our addressable population brushes their teeth on average less than one a day.","The point being there is significant upside over time in consumption in oral care and so we are investing sustainably to generate that consumption over time. So, advertising for the near-term and advertising for the longer term.","Secondly innovation, innovation of course across our portfolio for the balance of the year and into 2018, but innovation particularly in the Naturals space, which is a growing area of opportunity and further than that, specific innovation in the natural space for toothpaste, which is both an emerging segment and an effective counter we believe against local brands in Asia and Eurasia.","Now on the natural side beyond oral care, John already spoke about progress with Tom's on UAP and obviously we broadened that Tom's range now into other personal care categories like body cleansing and bath soap.","On toothpaste, we have launched the Colgate Naturals toothpaste line in several markets across three of our divisions and the rollout of that bundle will continue over the balance of the year, particularly across Asia.","Our consumer innovation centers located in those geographies have allowed us to build bundles that are tailored to meet local needs and preferences, in other words a counter to the local brands we find in those geographies. I'm very encouraged by the initial results we're seeing.","Now on top of that, as I have mentioned previously, in terms of regional brands, we continue to see benefit from underlying growth on brands like elmex and meridol in toothpaste in Europe, Darlie in China and Sanex in Europe.","So that's the second. Innovation across the portfolio particularly focused on naturals and especially focused on naturals for toothpaste. The third is working with retailer partners full growth on our business and specifically greater investment behind the high growth eCommerce space.","So, given the changes that we're seeing in the retail landscape, we continue to aggressively adapt our go-to-market execution to serve as the very different brick-and-mortar retailers growing in our categories today and of course e-Commerce.","The focus nature of our portfolio and the industry-leading market shares that we have, make us relevant to the shoppers in those outlets and give us influence in our key categories and we of course are working very closely with our retail partners to help them drive traffic to their stores across all of the different segments of brick-and-mortar retail.","Very importantly, we continue to build our capabilities in eCommerce and this I think is reflected in our leadership in toothpaste from an eCommerce point of view in our top markets, the United States, China and the U.K. and for Hill's as consumers increasingly move to online shopping we have the ability to reach an entirely new group of consumers and we make sure that our presence is structured to provide the information that pet owners need to make a smart decision about, which Hill's product is right for their pets.","Interestingly year-to-date Colgate's worldwide eCommerce business growth is up 65%. So, an area of aggressive focus for the back half of the year and finally, the fourth aggressively maximizing productivity up and down the income statement.","On the cost front, we are of course focused on realizing both short and long-term productivity in order to drive sustainable margin expansion funding the growth that you know well continues we believe to be a best-in-class productivity program that we used to work down cost on all lines of the income statement.","In 2017 funding the growth is delivering significant saving in areas like ocean freight, direct and in direct procurement, co-packing and fragrance and formula harmonization. We're also tackling long-term cost structure through our Global Growth and Efficiency program.","We'll continue to see benefits from our hubbing activity and our move to centralized Colgate business services and the back office services that they indeed provide and we have said consistently over the loft six to nine months that in this last year of our Global Growth and Efficiency program, we are being particularly focused to capitalize on the opportunity it affords us and so in the second quarter of this year, we initiated two additional projects as part of that program with the goal to better align our cost structure to longer-term trends.","One, addresses the structure of our European business and one addresses our corporate infrastructure, both underway and these additional projects take us to the upper end of our previously disclosed cost and savings ranges and we continue to say that we remain very focused on identifying as many additional projects in the last year of this program.","So those are the four areas of heightened focus; increased advertising spending behind stronger creative, innovation across the portfolio, particularly in Naturals and especially in Naturals on toothpaste against local brands, sharp focus with our retail partners and particular emphasis on the high growth eCommerce marketplace and continuing to aggressively maximizing productivity up and down our income statement with two new programs now public in this quarter just closed.","So those are our areas of focus for the back half of the year and now I'd be delighted to open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] We'll go first to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey. Good morning.","Ian Cook","Good morning, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","So, I am sure you guys are spending a lot of time analyzing the drivers behind the topline growth slowdown the last few quarters. My question is how much of the recent topline growth variance in the last few quarters versus your long-term forecast, how much of that do you think is due to factors that may linger longer term by consumer brand fragmentation away from leading brands that was sort of implied by your focus on natural and increased competitive environment or any other longer-term factors versus more of the shorter-term factors that mentioned and that's in both North America as well as emerging markets?","And the background behind that is, is your long-term 4% to 7% organic sales growth outlook still reasonable? Why should we have faith in that given the magnitude of disappointment in the last few quarters, the fact that it sustained over a few quarter periods and has surprised you guys?","Ian Cook","Yeah well, a lot in there Dara. First, I think as we -- as we came into this year and we've had the two quarters we have had, when we talked about the prior quarter the first quarter, we clearly said we would be below that range and now we are saying based on the first half performance that our growth this year will be low single digits.","I would not offer a comment at this stage on the 4% to 7% range. I think that's something that we would come back and revisit once we gain more practical experience of how this year unfolds. I will say there have been a lot of one-time or at least volatile episodes in the last couple of quarters particularly late in the second quarter, which have been -- which have been problematic.","And it would be fair to say that the continuing slow consumer demand is worrisome, but there's nothing that we see in the data that suggests that consumer behavior is changing in any way.","As John said, we have seen pockets of length and frequency of purchase and we're addressing that both strategically with advertising and innovation and also some price point action on the shelf. The competitive environment is variable. It can be volatile and it can be particularly sharp and we saw that for example in June here in the United States across many categories, heightened, competitive activity.","So, I think that's going to be a variable and our belief and I think the most important belief here is that the consumer behavior will see the categories come back. The only thing we can practically do to address that in the short term is to drive our market shares because then whatever the category growth is we will be getting the best return out of the category growth that exists.","And in that regard, I can say that our global year-to-date market shares are better or even with the first quarter shares on all of our about priority businesses. So, we are beginning to see our market shares rise.","But I think before one takes a view on longer-term growth rates, one would want to see this year play out and get more information on that consumer behavior, get some practical evidence that indeed the consumption patents do return to the norm. And then when we give guidance for 2018 that would be the time to have the conversation.","Dara Mohsenian","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Bonnie Herzog, Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. Good morning. Hi, I just have a few questions on the stepped-up innovation that you discussed. First, could you give us a sense of the growth rates of the natural toothpaste category versus non? And then how much cannibalization are you anticipating of your exiting business from some of this new innovation?","I guess I assume this is a premiumization opportunity. So, to some extent, cannibalization could be welcomed. And then finally, curious what you have innovated here earlier. Were you not sure of the growth of this emerging category would necessarily be sustainable, but now you are and I guess for me it's sort of begging the question, are there other emerging categories that are pressuring your existing business that you might need to move more aggressively in?","Ian Cook","Yeah, well all good questions. It's suffice to say that the Natural segment is growing faster than the average growth of the category, which is what makes it attractive. We of course have participated in this segment for quite a while, particularly in markets where it's important Asia or even go back to now more than decade ago acquisition of Tom's of Maine here in the United States, which continues to grow very, very nicely.","I guess the point is that the offering we are talking about now is different from the naturals offerings that we had thus far much more tailored to brands that now exist that didn't exist when we had our Naturals portfolio first in the marketplace competitive with those brands tailored from a flavor point of view and to the point you made at a meaningful premium price compared to prior offerings in the marketplace.","So, it's more the tailoring of it than the existence of it because segments obviously more over time. So, I don't think it's a question of missed. I think it's a question of tailoring the product to the category as it evolves over time.","And you know the question of cannibalization is a very difficult one to answer in the general. It varies market-by-market premiumization tends to reduce the cannibalization obviously with low businesses and we will of course be supporting our base businesses when we come with this premium innovations that we'll be working very hard to keep the cannibalization to a minimum, but regardless to the point you made from a cannibalization point of view this will be accretive from a pricing point of view and therefore favorable.","Operator","We'll go next to Wendy Nicholson, Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Good morning. A couple things, first just to clarify, when you said your global eCommerce business was up 65% in the quarter, can you break out roughly how much of that was held versus for the core? And then just remind us off what base that is? Is global eCommerce still like 2% of your sales or is that number out to date?","And then secondly, just kind of higher level, you talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about maybe taking some I think strategic pricing down a little bit in a couple of countries or categories and I wanted to go back to something that I had heard Noel talk about recently, which is a little bit more focused on raising pricing and revenue management and may be that Colgate's price points are below where the company would like them to be from a longer-term strategic perspective.","So I get that you're doing things that are right tactical and strategic to recover some share, but how important is this concept of revenue management? How much it factors into your thinking of your growth algorithm going forward etcetera, etcetera, thanks?","Ian Cook","Thanks Wendy. Well the eCommerce growth 65% is indeed for Colgate in totality. In other words, it is the Hill's business and it is all of the Colgate businesses and frankly we don't intend to break out the difference between the two, nor do we intend to break out the percentage of that business that is eCommerce suffice to say it is still relatively modest, but very, very high growth. And once it reaches a tipping point, we'll certainly bring that information to the marketplace.","The pricing reaction is actually not mutually exclusive. When we talk about price point adjustment at retail it is to be competitive on purchase cycles and while it applies to all of our categories in promotional pricing, it is less focused on oral care, which of course is what Noel was talking about.","So, they're selective, they're surgical and they're less focused on oral care point number one. Point number two, from an oral care point of view, just the prior discussion on the Naturals offering, we're also bringing innovation that is materially higher priced to that business and as Noel may have described, in some cases as we have relaunched literally tiers of our business, TIERS, of our business in different parts of the world behind that relaunch we found a way of elevating the value the consumer gets and the pricing of the line to increase the average life -- the average price of our entire portfolio.","So, I guess that's the way to answer it and yes, revenue management is extremely important, the topic that Noel talked about remains highly relevant and what John was talking about was surgical activity less applicable to oral care on promotional pricing, not strategic pricing.","Wendy Nicholson","Can you just put those two concepts together? I know you said consumer behavior vis-\u00e0-vis, the oral care category is really changing, but clearly consumer behavior with regard to eCommerce is changing a lot.","So, if you think eCommerce plus pricing, in your analysis so far, if I'm buying toothpaste on Amazon as opposed to in Walgreens does the consumer tend to be more price-sensitive, more brand loyal, this is a high-level question you guys do such great job of analyzing the business. I am wondering if you have any kind of high level takeaways about how to make sure that your shares are as strong online as they are in brick-and-mortar, thanks?","Ian Cook","Yes, interesting Wendy, it kind of works the other way. What we observe on eCommerce thus far is that the consumer is actually -- tends to buy more premium and even if they're not buying the premium brands, they tend to buy in multiples.","So, in fact the eCommerce behavior is favorable to us from a consumption point of view and if you look at the Hill's business, 15% of the Hill's business in the U.S. on eCommerce is subscription.","So that means once they buy it one time, they're signing up to regular delivery of that diet over time, which is we believe a good business model for our brand.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, this is actually [indiscernible] on behalf of Jason. Thanks for the question. Gross margin improvement has been impressive in spite of a softer topline growth, but guidance for the full-year was brought down slightly in spite of a good faith run rate proceeding.","Now is this mainly due to the higher expected reinvestment you plan to make in the second half and would those continue into 2018?","Ian Cook","Yes, well thanks for the question, the gross profit as John said in his remarks was behind our expectations for the first half of this year, largely because of raw material cost increases, which in fact was primarily in the area of fats and oils.","Interestingly, the cost of fats and oils has ebbed since the first half of this year. So as John also said, we now moving into a more favorable raw material cost environment and of course for this year thus far and it gets easier against our projections over the balance of the year there has been less transaction headwind because foreign exchange has not been so negative as it had been in -- as it had been in previous years.","So, we are looking at what we believe will be a multiple benefit of material cost easing and transaction costs lessening and as John also said, we therefore expect to see a sequential improvement in gross margin as the year unfolds. So, I think that's the answer to the question.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Powers, UBS.","Stephen Powers","Great. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Hi Steve.","Stephen Powers","Hello a question to follow up on your advertising comments if I could historically if we go back your advertising was spread out pretty evenly quarter-to-quarter as a percentage of sales but over the last several years we've seen 200 basis point gap open up between first half spending and second half spending.","And I know that directional you tend to close that just based on your comments but just say get back to 10% of sales in the back half which will still be 50 basis points slight of what I think you spent so far, this year that would imply 160 basis points of incremental spending in the back half than skew to Q4 if of my math is correct.","I just love to get your sense if that\u2019s the right order of magnitude to be considering and then if so what kind of ROI do you expect that's going to have will it contribute to the second half topline improvement that you're expecting or should we not expect the list to really show through until fiscal 2018 perhaps that answer lies in how much spending goes to new launches versus the things like Bright Smiles, Bright Futures but just in the context to how you think about what the magnitude of increase spending and then the unexpected ROI and when you see it flowing through? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes. Good question. And I'm glad you got the scale thing on the table you're right for the last couple of years and I think we were quite express about this when we talked about 2017 faced with sharp foreign exchange negative impacts and with having no immediate to place to go.","We reduced advertising and we said coming into this year we did not want to do that and but even if foreign exchange were going to run sharply negative for whatever global calamity reason that we would not go back on our advertising investment.","And our intention at the time we said that and it remains our intention and our plan is to continue our advertising investment in the second half at approximately the same level in other words sustained advertising that we have seen so far across the first half.","And yes, that will suggest a fairly meaningful set up in advertising investment. We think the ROI will be good this is now talking to the traditional advertising because as I said earlier we have a lot of advertising vehicles now developed that have tested extremely well.","So, we know the advertising works very, very hard and is persuasive to consumers and interestingly it is good to have this balance between announcing what new and shall we say supporting and reminding of the reason consumers give trust to the brand in the first place. And so continuous advertising behind as we call it the base is an important part of that decision.","And you're right obviously the Bright Smiles, Bright Futures investment is not a short-term investment but is again I tried to spell out we know the ROI on that is terrific we know we get good ROI on our media in general.","And therefore, we are very comfortable with the investment decision and of course it is our expectation that this will be part of the reason to return us to growth as we work our way across the year. And again, Bright Smiles, Bright Futures we hope will be part of the reason why we will be able to sustain that growth in the toothpaste category out of the time.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jason Gere, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason Gere","Okay thanks good morning guys I guess obviously what we\u2019re hearing the first half of the year pricing help to offset I guess the weaker volumes and the second half it sounds like volumes will probably offset price to get to that low single digit.","So just wondering if you can just lay out maybe a little bit more some of the macro, micro impacts that you saw in the first half how that place in the second half so on the micro side talk about some of the distributor changes in Eurasia, the U.S. liquid I think in Europe there were some packaging changes.","So, there were things that were within your control and I was just wondering how that plays out in the second half. And in the macro side I think you were talking \u2013 besides India and how that kind of plays on the second half I think you said that there was some destocking in the second half of June where that is and maybe a little more color so how we can think about that going forward? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Good question Jason let me try and take it on. The U.S. dish reset, which I think we have well covered we now have the products fully in distribution there on the shelf where we want them on the shelf we were hit in June as we've said by heightened competitive activity very heightened. And we are responding to adjust our promotional planning on offering to jumpstart progress across the back half of the year.","So yes, in our control and I think a plan in place to rebuild growth. On the decisions that affected customers I guess I would focus on of the three you raised you have decision to move broadly to e-commerce in the United States with our pet nutrition business which we continue to believe is absolutely the right decision.","And we\u2019re in equal opportunity believer in that space in other words we are just as happy to lean in aggressively with the retailer who has a brick-and-mortar offering and an e-commerce offering as we are with the pure play eCommerce company.","We had a hiccup shall we say with a customer in the U.S. that hiccup is now substantially behind us and a return to normal promotional and other consumer engagement activity is recommencing and will of course build across the balance of the year.","The European retailer matter I think John covered well we are seeing our market shares rebound quite nicely and growing sustainably and sequentially and we expect to see that continue across the back half of the year.","In Africa\/Eurasia we made those distributor choices that we again believe are the right choices for the business over the long-term and we will continue to lap those comparisons until the fourth quarter of this year.","So, the third quarter will still be burden by a difficult comparisons and then of course the reality is that even though each of them we believe was in the right decision they had a compounding effect all at the same time which was problematic but I think faced with the requirement to make the decisions again we make the same decisions.","The GST you know we were just digging out of the demonetization headwind and then boom you get the GST which basically saw the stock list close up sharp the last two weeks in June and we're hopeful you know barring another event that we will see that rebuild across the back half of the year.","So, I think on balance those issues I think we've identified them before and I think we are in the process of building them. The macro environment looking forward you know it really comes down to the categories we think the behavior will come back, but we're focused on building our market shares so that whatever the category growth rate is we're getting frankly more than our fair share of that underlying growth so that's the way we\u2019re thinking about that while we get more consumer data in terms of behavior as we work our way through the balance of the year.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Faiza Alwy, Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy","Yes hi, good morning I just had broader strategic question because I think if you look at some of the per capita consumption trends it seems like the opportunity is really in some of these frontier markets like in Africa and India which can be pretty volatile from a macro point of view and may be geopolitical point of view.","So, are you thinking about extending -- using your distribution network globally and extending it into other categories so maybe skincare you have a great brand in Sanex may be taking that global or another brand or just extending your overall reach into just these global markets where you a great set up?","Ian Cook","Yes, I think that's a very relevant and pertinent point and yes, of course it is within our strategic remit. It's not and I know you know this but it's not a simple as simply taking a product and putting it through a proven distribution system when you bring products the people may or may not be familiar with in their entirety i.e. from a usage point at all or certainly from a brand point of view it requires a considerable degree of investment and patients over multiple years to build a position in the marketplace.","But the answer is yes, it is clearly one of the assets we believe we have that we can leverage the question will simply be timing and pace so watch this space.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Grundy, Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Ian Cook","Hi Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","First question if you don\u2019t mind just a housekeeping one in the past you\u2019ve been kind enough to supply category growth rates by region U.S., Europe and EM so we get an update there.","I think probably in aggregate category growth rates will probably come in about a point since 3Q but an update there will be helpful. And then the second question more broadly Ian would be around M&A and you talked a lot about areas of focus for the balance of the year which we well covered on this call so I appreciate that it's very clear.","But the question is I guess given this sharp deceleration which we haven't seen your portfolio in a long, long time does this give you any pause with respect to M&A which is not been a big part of the company's portfolio strategy that's a nice tuck-in deals of course with Sanex and Hill's but said differently in a slower growth environment does this increase your appetite for M&A. And if so would you consider pursuing any businesses outside the current portfolio. Thank you.","Ian Cook","Yes, well category growth -- frankly it\u2019s reasonably straightforward certainly for the last quarter the emerging markets are still mid-single-digits in some countries with much more of a presence now on e-commerce China would be the obvious example.","And in the developed world what we have seen is a Europe and a United States or North America were essentially flat I mean that's the way the world splits today. M&A do we have appetite we've always had appetite we\u2019re just I would say very strategic in our appetites and when we look at M&A we look at it from the point of view of strengthening the portfolio of the company not meeting our sales requirement.","And certainly not jumping into a new business that we don't know where too much about and mustard would have been a very expensive one to get into for example.","So, I think you could see us buy on the fringes of the businesses we\u2019re in we have with Sanex for example you know lotions and creams that we are now expanding in Europe.","But if we were to play an M&A and we are very keen on expanding our portfolio with the light asset I think you would see it in the broader definitions of the categories we\u2019re already in oral care, in pet nutrition and in personal care and that's the way we think about it we\u2019re not going to do anything in an undisciplined way adjust for a tactical response we remain king.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Andrea Teixeira, JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you hello good morning so can you elaborate more on your comment on the cadence of the quarter in North America and Asia it seems that June got worse from May and then the destocking was not only U.S. and China which obviously you mentioned in the last call as well as India.","But I was just hoping to see if there is any other areas where you kind of recover from where we were in the first half. And if you can comment if orders are starting to come in faster now that we are probably six to eight months behind us in terms of the destocking mostly in the pantry and the retailer destocking.","And related to that I mean in terms of the funding of your funding for growth you elaborate a lot on the sales perspective but is there anything that we can think of the SG&A I know you had invested a lot more in overhead over the past two months globally, but if you can elaborate if there is any other source of potential savings on that front that could allow you to continue to invest and faster further growth? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Okay Andrea well let me start with the global growth and efficiency program and the SG&A idea I mean you were right we remain extremely focused on maximizing our opportunity in this final year of that program and I think you know that is reflected in the two actions that we talk about in the second quarter one of which reflected in the costs in our filing both of them are directly and meaningfully in the SG&A space.","They will play out over time in terms of realizing the benefit that they will afford a benefit and we continue to focus on finding other areas that we could do like without in any way damaging the firepower we need to be successful on the ground. So yes, it's a very clear area focus and I think it evidenced in the actions that we took.","It\u2019s very difficult to come back to this cadence on the quarter again as John said in the U.S. actually the second quarter in aggregate was worse than the first quarter overall with the combination of a weak April and then a June that faded.","In terms of destocking we have seen that on volatile basis I guess the only thing I can repeat is that we are seeing on a year to-date basis our global market shares in our priority categories are better or flat with the first quarter which gives us a sense that our underlying consumption driven growth is improving and we look forward with the four areas of focus I mentioned to capitalizing on that fully as we work our way through the back half of the year.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Olivia Tong, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Hey thanks I guess perhaps can we talk a little about just the aggregate impact of some of these one-offs, like the dish in the U.S., France, GST etcetera. Just trying to understand what you think your underlying growth would be if not for all these things because it's still probably not at the end -- at below end of your long-term range.","And then also given these one-offs and recognizing the comp differential in Q3 versus Q4 in the second half I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color there.","And then just on naturals we talked a lot about specific for naturals and oral care and that was very helpful, but one category where naturals has also been taken disproportionate share is pet food and we've talked about that in the past but just wondering can you talk about how you think about that category and the growth potential there and interest in standing in naturals and pet as well? Thank you so much.","Ian Cook","Yes, well taking it in reverse order in pet we think about it more in terms of the formulation of our products we are unabashedly a brand that provides proven clinical benefits to pets whether it's preventative or whether it's curative with our prescription diet business.","And certainly, on the preventative health line we have reformulated our products to put proteins first and not give people a reason to switch out of our business and if they value a particular clinical benefit to not have a barrier to them trying the Hill\u2019s the product and we think that has been quite successful and conceptually moving into a very, very almost homes like naturals is difficult to do.","We have tried a couple of times with Hill\u2019s and the heritage of the brand doesn't give you the bandwidth to go pure on naturals. So, we've done it by formulation to eliminate barriers.","I don't think at this stage given the compounding effect of the slowdown in our markets trying to do the math on what is the one-off and how does it relate to the underlying category growth is going to be particularly helpful because the expectation is that the category growth will come back.","So, the reason the way we\u2019re thinking about it is to say over the year we expect this year now to be low single digits from an organic sales point of view and we continue to be very focused on the consumer and the consumer behavior.","We've taken some actions that John mentioned to try and capture the frequency of purchase in some of our businesses and as we learn more will be able to respond more authoritatively is the behavior coming back or is there something else driving what we see in the categories and we think it would be premature and probably misleading to get into that at this stage.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ali Dibadj, Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi guys so I have two questions one question is when we talk about those initiatives and that you laid out so eloquently around naturals local competitors, e-commerce, more ad spend, better productivity or lower SG&A.","These are all things you\u2019ve heard many of us kind of collectively push for and push you on the pass on these conference calls. I guess for a while I remember three years ago about eCommerce were only local competitors and all of us were kind of asking these questions ad spend has been an ongoing discussion. And now you're saying that we got to do something about these things.","So, I guess my first question is I'm just wondering why it took so long to react what was turning point and now just still you\u2019re behind. So, I guess why it took so long.","And the second question, I lay it aside if it's related or not I guess, but there's a lot of buzz out there right now a lot of discussion and I think your stock performance today given the numbers would suggest there is a lot discussion in investor community that the numbers today are so bad the number last quarter are so bad that they are actually good for shareholders and activists will come an acquirer will come in and get involved.","What do you think about that view certainly helps your stock recently, but what do you think about that view and how hard will you work to specifically prevent a bid or an activist in that context so thanks for those two hopefully the focus questions?","Ian Cook","Yes, I guess on the first question I'm not sure I completely agree I think it's fair the criticism on the advertising spend and the lack of consistency of advertising but that we addressed coming into this year's budget and I'm just reaffirming that it is playing out the way we expected it to play out.","On eCommerce, we have been very focused on e-commerce for a long time we may not have talked about it as eloquently as you find I did this morning, but we have been focused on it and I think that's why we have the toothpaste leadership positions in the markets that we talk about and the growth rate.","And subscription levels on the Hill\u2019s business that we talk about even if we took the pain of making those decisions in the marketplace which we\u2019re now after almost nine months nearly a year just working our way out of. Naturals again we had been talking about the naturals for a while yes, it's only coming to marketplace right now when the local brands idea came up we were saying that that is our response.","You can try this on the speed of getting it to marketplace and I won't fight that but in terms of the idea and that was accounted to the local brands we feel good about the offering that we're on. And on the efficiency, I'm not sure you were implying any critique of the productivity and I think the action that we have taken in this quarter that we have mentioned was evidence of our focus in that area.","So, when we think about going forward would buzz is one thing and there seems to be increasing buzz in this world about virtually everything which can become an enormous distraction.","So, the only thing I can say and I won't repeat the remarks I made at Bernstein, but I will say we are focused on the areas that I have mentioned we think these are the right areas to focus on to see a recovery in sales momentum across the back half of the year. We are focused on the SG&A line in our income statement to get us more productive from a reasonably advantaged base going forward.","So, we have no blinders in terms of a need to focus on our cost structure and we will continue to do that and if we have more to say in that space we will say that in a way that we think is consistent with driving growth sustainably over time. And with or without buzz we are steadfastly focused on that.","So, I'm sorry I can\u2019t sound more energetic it seems to fail me, but I think you can rest assured but we don't have to rest assured I guess I'm saying that we very much our focused-on growth and on cost structure.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney, Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","Hey and just thank you for your comment earlier about the focus on innovation to address yeah, the local brands and particularly in Asia and Eurasia I know it\u2019s other places, but you called out that specifically. And I'm trying to understand maybe why is it now versus any of the times in the past 10 or 20 years where you had really nice businesses in these places that local brands are gaining traction.","And does it have to do with a change that is relevant to other markets is it technology driven and specifically does it have anything at all to do with I know it's some markets in Asia e-commerce is developed somewhat rapidly.","Does the pressure that puts on your retailers and retail distribution have anything to do with the increase traction some of these local brand forms are having with consumers? Thanks very much.","Ian Cook","Yeah, I think I don't think it's driven by e-commerce I think it's driven by shall we say business entrepreneurs who are local I think pleasingly for us it's driven by ideas that tend to be premium which are ideas we happy to compete with rather than perhaps in the early years ideas that were more pricing driven.","In some cases, it's driven by affinities so the union by our brand in China was already a well-established wound healing brand in the country. You take it into the toothpaste category and say you stop bleeding gums well-known brand in the toothpaste category and they didn't do much advertising in the early years and the business started to grow.","Patanjali in India takes a very nationalist view of his business so these are concepts in the local market. They tend to be premium price oriented and it means that you have to respond with a very specifically constructed offering that attacks the benefit the consumer is looking for. Hence the natural -- the natural reaction.","So, I think it's more a function of entrepreneurs, concepts, affinity with the local, the market which is why we have innovation centers and technology centers in China to be close to the consumer on the ground in that country.","And in the end, the winner over time in these clashes are going to be the companies that best understand the consumer and serve them offerings that they want over time and of course that's what we all resourced and focused on doing.","Operator","We'll go next to Iain Simpson, SG.","Iain Simpson","Thanks very much. Hello everyone. Couple of questions if I may, firstly just drilling down into advertising, this is a big picture stuff I guess. Your volumes are down 1.5% from the first half and that really does seem to imply very significantly with share loss.","Yet your own -- your advertising is only up 10 Bps year-on-year and you're talking about marketing being about level in the second half as well. Is that enough up until 2014, your advertising was 10.5%, 11% of sales pretty much every year and recent years it's been more like 9% and 9.5% and we've seen your topline slow pretty meaningfully.","So structurally where do you think advertising needs to get to medium term? And secondly, visibility on assets is pretty limited, but if you do get a big transactional FX tailwind be it in second half '17 or in 2018, what will you do with that? How much will you let through to the bottom line or will you reinvest it?","What are the sort of key factors you'll look at; will you be in a position to make that decision? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Well, let me start by saying you start with a great name, so that's a good place to start. Our point on advertising was not to do with the advertising in the first half. Our point on advertising and the numbers you referred to in the recent historical cost was to do with adjustments downward that we made in advertising in response to unfortunately foreign exchange very sharply going the other way, but your second question was suggesting","And when came into this year, what we said was that isn\u2019t what we were going to do. Advertising North of 10% is a good level of advertising and so what we said coming into this year is that we wanted to sustain our advertising across the full year, which means the comparison over the last couple of years is driven by a lower second half in those prior years and what will be a sustainable level over the back half of the year, which means the advertising will be meaningfully up versus the prior year.","So, it's sustainability rather than a lack of in terms of -- in terms of investment and hey foreign exchange, you look at the last five years, I think the pundits have been wrong coming into basically every single year and if foreign exchange does turn positive, we will have a quick round of the applause and then we will bring it back to the business.","Our general historical rule of thumb has been to reinvest some and to bring some to the bottom line. What we would actually do this time around would be a subject of internal debate but that rule of thumb has been our historical action.","Operator","We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman, Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Good morning. Okay. First is I have to ask the gross margin pressure as we won't have it is one. And secondly, maybe let's talk about Latin America for a second, where things turned very much for the better and I think about six to nine months ago now I got to spend some time with Thanos, and he talked about a broader innovation pipeline in Latin America where you were going to be bringing more news to lower priced tiers in your portfolio to giving the consumer more room to trade up at a lower level.","And I was just wondering have some of that news flow started to hit the market because it was a pretty significant change in that volume, really dollar weighted volume metrics that we can talk a little bit about what's starting to work in Brazil that we've started particularly this term, thank you?","Ian Cook","The gross profit roll forward, so prior year gross profit was $60.2. As you know we picked up 40 Bps from pricing between the restructuring, which is de minimis and funding the growth of positive 170 Bps, material negative 180 Bps, which was primarily the fats and oils as I said other 20 Bps and that takes you to the 60.7, which is up 50 basis points year-on-year. So that's the gross margin roll forward.","I would say in Latin America it is a focus on the fundamentals. It is innovation. I wouldn't go so far as to say the lower end innovation is making the difference and I would say markets like Brazil. I'm afraid remain variable.","So, we're very pleased with that bounce back, but we'll be watching very closely in terms of sustainability through the third quarter. But the fundamentals are the same fundamentals for Latin America across the back half of the year.","Ian Cook","Okay. I understand that is the last call. So, thank you for being with us and we look forward to talking to you again in October.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference.

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.","John Faucher","Thanks, Lisa. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are, Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Henning Jakobsen, Vice President and Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Vice President and Treasurer.","Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our more recent filings with the SEC, including our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website.","Ian Cook","Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. Belated Happy New Year. As has been our custom for a little while now, I'd like to provide some introductory thoughts, and I intend them to be framed on the fourth quarter results and our thinking for 2018. You will recall on the last call and, indeed, the one before that, we talked about 4 areas of business focus for the company, increased advertising spending behind more impactful creative innovation across the business but especially naturals in toothpaste, which I will come back to; working with all retail partners, especially e-commerce; and then, finally, aggressively maximizing productivity up and down the income statement. And those remain our 4 areas of our business focus.","But to talk more specifically about the fourth quarter and 2018, let me start by saying that while our organic sales performance in the quarter improved sequentially versus the third, the rate of improvement was modestly less than we expected and comes despite what we see as sequential improvement in growth rates for our categories and importantly, improved market share performance as we work our way through the quarter. That's, of course, particularly true for our Oral Care business where we made significant incremental advertising investments across the second half of last year.","So let me focus specifically on 4 things, which, hopefully, will give you some clarity on the progress we believe we're making. First, category growth. As we discussed on the third quarter call, we continue to see improvement in category growth across many parts of the year -- the world. If we look at the U.S., growth in the categories in which we compete improved from being down slightly in the first half to 1% in the third quarter and 1.6% in the fourth quarter. In Asia Pacific, we saw a second half acceleration in toothpaste category growth in key markets like China, the Philippines, Southeast Asia and Australasia. And in Europe, we are seeing initial signs that our categories are strengthening with the improvement in growth driven by Oral Care. And very interestingly, this morning, the scanner data for the last 4 weeks in Europe just issued, which show our sales, on a consumption basis, up around 7.5% and our toothpaste market share, up a full point. So all signs we see of an improvement in category growth.","Secondly, on top of that category growth, we continue to focus on growing our market share. This is one of the key reasons for our increased advertising over 2017 and, as we said in the release, continuing into 2018. And we do believe we are seeing initial signs of this paying off as our market share performance is improving in many of the key markets where we have ramped up the advertising. We're seeing it in Europe. And during the fourth quarter, we gained market share year-over-year in 6 categories. Through the third quarter, we were not gaining share in any categories. And it is broad-based. It is beyond simply a reinstatement in one retailer in the western parts of Europe.","In Brazil, we posted a 73% market share in the fourth quarter. In fact, in December, our market share was 73.7%, which is basically tied for the highest share we've -- we ever had in that country. And we gained market share year-over-year. I would also say that our market share in Mexico is back up to 83%.","And we continue to spend behind new launches as well, including the Colgate Naturals offerings. In Russia, which, under the name Ancient Secrets, has a very unique and differentiated advertising campaign. We're seeing very strong performance. We have seen nationally the market share build to over 2 percentage points with distribution building. It is adding to the overall share in Russia, which we have seen grow for the last 3 periods. And indeed, in some of the retail outlets, where you build faster distribution, we have seen market shares north of 3% and approaching 4% with penetration, thereby, trial building very, very nicely. We've seen our Naturals offerings in China just under 1 share point. We've seen them in India approaching 1 share point; and in the Morgan trade, approaching 2 share points. So we believe these businesses are off to a good start from a concept point of view, supported the point I was starting with, with compelling advertising and seeing that in our market shares.","So we're seeing improvements in the category growth rates and market shares, which, of course, is leading to increase consumption, which you see in the scanner data, particularly here in North America. And we think that increase in consumption is going to support, and I'll come back to organic sales for 2018, but is going to support our ambitions for organic growth in 2018. And suffice it to say, that is, of course, our #1 priority.","Another area for us in 2018 is acting with greater speed and agility. You may recall, when we began our journey on the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we said that one of the underlying objectives was speed and agility. And we have made quite a few changes over the last several years, which is opening up opportunity in that area. And clearly, the way the world is moving, whether it's e-commerce, digital in general or the local brands, we are committed to moving more rapidly. And this is not just true around innovation; it's about how we go about doing everything in the company.","I mentioned briefly on the third quarter call this Colgate Dare to Love toothpaste cocreated with one of our e-commerce partners in China. And I just came back from China, actually, and we created the product in a very short period of time, around 5 months. It was our largest and fastest-selling multipack on the 11\/11 Singles' Day in China and the single biggest growth driver in our portfolio for this online retailer. Now interestingly, it has additional benefits. It brings us to a younger female millennial user with a higher wealth program. So the combination of our advertising and the offering itself sees us broaden our reach in terms of consumers.","We've also brought greater speed and agility to how we go about our digital marketing efforts. I've mentioned before our consumer engagement centers, which are truly always on as we listen to what's happening in real time online, quickly engaging with consumers. And our increased digital media investment and focus on faster, easier ways to test and improve the creative has led to significant improvements in return on investments over the year. And this has helped us increase our e-commerce market share leadership in toothpaste in the U.S. for both the fourth quarter and the full year. I would say, editorially, is that our e-commerce business, in general, was up just under 60% for the full year.","And finally, although it may seem a minor area to you, packaging development for us is an enormous part of what goes behind bringing our products to the marketplace. And we have completely reengineered our packaging process to get our products from design brief to the shelf in about 1\/2 of the time and about 1\/3 lower cost across our packaging systems all around the world. So the third area of operating focus is speed and agility.","And obviously, the last area I'd like to come back to is productivity. We have a strong history of margin expansion, and we expect that to continue going forward. Our margins have been under pressure across our industry over the past year or so, and we know we need to push productivity aggressively. Now our productivity efforts start with funding-the-growth, and we have seen and did see in the fourth quarter increased logistics costs given fuel and availability, and indeed, raw material costs stayed at about the third quarter level but due to hurricanes and the price of oil resins and given pulp packaging going up beyond our initial estimations for the fourth quarter.","So through our funding-the-growth program, we are working to reduce these costs through many digital platforms interestingly to see us real time looking at what our logistics providers are paying for fuel, allowing us to economize, and at the same time, using new technologies, like Uber Freight, where we are a founding participant, to improve service and manage volatility. And I'll come back to funding-the-growth when we go through the margin roll forward.","And as we talked about on our last call, we remain resolutely focused on maximizing our Global Growth and Efficiency Program to streamline our cost structure. The key, of course, is to focus on where we think we're going to be in the future and organize for that, so that we can meet those changes head on.","For example, we, in the last 4 months, have just redesigned our supply chain organization to become organized by region while keeping the central capability, which allows us, again, to respond more speedily to local market needs while still leveraging at global scale and capability. The productivity is not just about cutting costs. We also think it's about simplification, which is a very big area of focus for the company.","And for example, while we are launching new products like the Naturals I just mentioned, we're also focused on reducing the complexity of our business by eliminating less productive SKUs. This allows us to be more efficient and effective in bringing these products to the marketplace.","Now if we look at our SKUs on a global basis, we see them down about 7% on a global basis and our range of reduction is from 12% at the high end and, in case of one division, a modest increase. But overall, a 7% reduction in SKUs globally at the time we're bringing innovation to the marketplace, which allows you to put the more productive SKUs on the shelf and, therefore, get more productive consumption and sales velocity from them. And as we go through that, we see an average improvement in offtake productivity approaching 7%. So those are the key takeaways I'd like to leave you with as we reflect on 2017 and more importantly, look at what we need to do to further accelerate profitable growth in 2018.","Now before I turn it back to John who has stayed for all of this, I wanted to discuss our longer-term outlook for top line growth, which many of you have asked me about at conferences and on past conference calls. Now before this year, we have consistently delivered against our 4% to 7% long-term organic revenue growth target, although as we have seen more towards the lower end since the financial crisis. You may recall that, that range was determined when global growth for our categories was around 4% to 5% per year on a fairly consistent basis. Of course, if you look at our categories over the last 12 to 18 months, they've been growing at roughly a 2% rate, slightly up, as I commented earlier, in the fourth quarter. But the 2% we've been operating in was developed markets moving closer to 0 with developing markets coming down from a high single digits to the mid-single digits.","Now while we believe these growth rates are beginning to improve, we think it's appropriate to plan with an assumption that category growth rate will be below those heavy historical levels even if it's greater than what we've seen in the most recent past. So as we look forward, starting with 2018, we think it more probable that our categories will grow in a 2% to 4% range. And on top of this growth, we believe that we will return to consistent market share growth behind the strength of our brands, our increased investment, our ability to innovate and in our market execution. And we believe, from a consumption point of view, we're already seeing signs of that.","So this combination of category growth and market share growth should put us in the range of 3% to 5% top line organic growth rate, and that's the stance we are taking for 2018 and beyond. Now obviously, we will be doing our level-best to help bring our categories back to the higher growth rates. But for now, we think that prudence is warranted. And clearly, if the growth rates accelerate, that's a good problem to have. Mr. Faucher?","John Faucher","Thanks, Ian. After providing some general commentary on the quarter, I will briefly go into some detail on divisional performance. I will then provide some further detail on our outlook for 2018 before opening up for your questions. As Ian said, we showed progress in the fourth quarter on our efforts to reaccelerate top line growth. We showed sequential improvement in net sales growth in key markets, like the U.S., Western Europe and India. Furthermore, our takeaway trends, as shown in syndicated data, improved at a greater rate with sequential improvement in market share in key markets.","We exit 2017 with Q4 representing our highest growth quarter of the year in net sales, organic sales and volume. Net sales are up 4.5% in the quarter versus Q4 2016 with 3% volume growth, minus 1% pricing and a 2.5% foreign exchange benefit. Organic sales growth was 2% in the fourth quarter, continuing the sequential improvement we saw on the third quarter.","On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was down 60 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it was down 40 basis points year-over-year. We delivered strong funding-the-growth savings in the quarter, which mostly offset higher raw material costs, while pricing was a negative impact to gross margin.","On a GAAP basis, our operating profit margin was down 200 basis points year-over-year in Q4. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods and the 2016 litigation matter, our operating profit margin was down 190 basis points driven primarily by an increase in advertising investment. On a dollar basis, advertising investment was up 24% year-over-year in Q4.","As Ian mentioned in the press release, we intend to continue to spend behind our brands in 2018 with a focus on our base business, new products and consumption building activities.","On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share of $0.37 was down 46% year-over-year in Q4. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, U.S. tax reform and the 2016 litigation matter, diluted earnings per share was flat year-over-year at $0.75.","For 2017, we returned more than $2.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Now moving to the divisions. We'll start off with North America. In Q4, we saw a sequential improvement versus the third quarter in volume, net sales and organic sales growth in North America. Net sales were up 1% in the quarter with organic sales up 1% driven volume growth of 4.5% and pricing of minus 3.5%, while foreign exchange was even with the year ago period. We continue to see significant pricing pressure in the liquid hand soap and hand dish categories.","Category growth rates in the U.S. continue to improve sequentially with every category, except power toothbrush, posting faster growth in the second half of '17 versus the first half of '17. In Oral Care, we widened our market share leadership in toothpaste and toothbrushes in the U.S. In toothpaste, after seeing declines year-over-year in the first half of the year, our market share increased year-over-year in the fourth quarter driven by our premium brands, including Colgate Optic White and Tom's of Maine.","Now we'll look at Latin America. Latin America delivered 4% net sales growth in the quarter driven by a combination of 4% volume growth and 1.5% foreign exchange, while pricing was minus 1.5%. Organic sales for the division grew 2.5%. Net sales growth in Latin America was driven by Mexico and Brazil.","In Mexico, our volume declines were more than offset by positive pricing. We gained toothpaste market share versus Q4 2016 behind our Kids line and Triple Action Xtra Freshness. Our double-digit net sales growth in Brazil was driven by strong volume performance. And as Ian mentioned, our toothpaste shares in Brazil are improving behind increased advertising support, effective merchandising and new products.","Brazil also benefited from the launch of Colgate Total mouth rinse, which has added two points to our mouth rinse market share since its Q3 launch. In 2018, Brazil should benefit from several new Oral Care product launches in the high-growth pharmacy channel, along with a robust Personal Care pipeline.","Moving to Europe, Europe continues to show strong sequential improvement in Q4 with net sales growth of 13%. Organic sales grew 4%, our best organic sales performance in Europe since first quarter 2010, driven by 6% volume growth with negative 2% pricing. Foreign exchange is favorable by 9% in the quarter. While our price business benefited from lapping against easy comparisons, the volume growth in Europe continued to be broad-based. We saw particular strength in Southern and Western Europe, Poland and the Nordic countries. Europe saw a significant step-up in advertising spending in the quarter versus the prior year, and we believe this is paying off in sequential improvement in market shares as well as in organic sales growth.","In Germany, our largest market in Europe, we have gained a full point of market share year-to-date in toothpaste with our year-over-year share gains accelerating in the fourth quarter driven by strength in the elmex and meridol brands. Last quarter, we mentioned the success of our launch of Colgate Natural Extracts line in Europe, and sales for Colgate Natural Extracts continued to come in ahead of our expectations. The Naturals category is relatively underdeveloped in toothpaste in Europe, and we are looking to launch Colgate Naturals in more markets in 2018 to drive incremental growth.","Sanex continued to deliver solid growth behind the 0% line, while our French fabric softener business, Soupline, which is the market leader in that country, continued its strong growth through premium innovation.","Next is Asia Pacific. Net sales in Asia Pacific were up 6% in the quarter with organic sales up 2.5%. Net sales growth was driven by a combination of pricing and volume growth, while foreign exchange added 3.5%. Our net sales growth was driven primarily by India and Greater China. Our volume in India was up double digits as we lap demonetization in the year ago period. India also benefited from positive pricing, and we continue to see benefits from our launches in the Naturals space with Colgate Cibaca Vedshakti and Colgate Swarna Vedshakti driving incremental sales. In Greater China, negative volume was offset by positive pricing, and we continue to benefit from growth in e-commerce where we have market share leadership.","The Africa\/Eurasia division reported net sales growth of 2% in Q4 as positive foreign exchange offset a slight decline in volume, while pricing was even with the year ago period. We saw volume growth in our Sub-Saharan Africa business as we lap last year's distributor changes. We also delivered solid volume growth in Russia driven by the continued benefit from our Q3 launch of Colgate Ancient Secrets toothpaste, as Ian mentioned. As we called out on our Q3 conference call, the volume weakness this quarter was primarily driven by economic softness in the Middle East. And we'll finish up with Hill's. Hill's delivered 2.5% net sales growth in the fourth quarter driven by a combination of positive pricing and foreign exchange, while volume was even with the year ago period. Organic sales grew 0.5%.","We continue to see strong growth in e-commerce in developed markets. In particular, we are seeing strong share gains on e-commerce in the United States with Prescription Diet. We are also seeing rapid growth in several of our emerging markets, particularly Russia and Latin America. In the United States, both volume and pricing were up slightly. We have seen modest improvement in consumption trends in the pet specialty channel, but the dynamics in this channel remained difficult.","I am also pleased to announce that earlier this month, we closed 2 premium skincare transactions, PCa Skin and EltaMD. Both companies are delivering significant top line growth in the professional skincare channel and in e-commerce. Now we'll turn to our outlook for 2018. As stated in our press release, we expect net sales growth to increase mid-single digits in 2018. We expect organic sales to be up low to mid-single digits with improvement in our growth rate versus the second half of 2017. We are encouraged by our volume growth over the second half of 2017, and we plan for a combination of pricing and volume growth for 2018.","On a GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to be up 75 to 125 basis points in 2018. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we expect our gross margin to be up 50 to 75 basis points as a combination of pricing and productivity from our funding-the-growth initiatives should more than offset higher raw material costs. We expect another year of increased advertising spending in 2018, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net sales. We still see significant opportunity to spend behind our core brands, support new product launches and drive consumption in emerging markets.","Now moving over to the impact of recent U.S. tax reform. On both a GAAP basis and excluding the impacts from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27% in 2018. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be up double digits for the year. Excluding charges related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and the onetime charge resulting from U.S. tax reform, we expect earnings per share growth to be around 10%.","And with that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","So first, I just wanted to get a little clarification of your prepared remarks. I mean, you mentioned market share improved sequentially throughout the quarter. But I'm assuming overall market share result was less than you originally expected, particularly in emerging markets, given you mentioned the organic sales growth was weaker than you expected. So is that the right way to interpret your comments? Or were you trying to say that there's a lot of destocking going on at retail or at the consumer level? I just wanted a bit of clarification there. And hopefully, that doesn't count as a real question because the real question is more around organic sales and the slowdown we saw in emerging markets sequentially on a year-over-year basis or even more so on a two-year basis.","It just seems pretty striking in the face of much higher advertising, the greater innovation you mentioned, the execution tweaks, et cetera, so it feels like something has changed here. So can you help me sort of understand the markets, you're trends in emerging markets, why we're not seeing more improvement, particularly given it looks like we're already seeing rebounding trends in developed markets? And then related to that, how does this sort of change the way you manage the emerging market business from here? Do you have to invest more on price, be more judicious with price increases, particularly given the Latin American pricing decline this quarter?","Ian Cook","Well, thank you for the four questions, Dara. Where to start? I think I'll start with the bigger questions, which is the emerging markets and the market shares and growth. It's interesting, when you -- today, we're focused very much on price, if you take of the big picture view and go back over the last several years when transaction costs and commodity costs were forcing pricing, there was the reduction in the contribution of volume to the organic growth. And much concern expressed in terms of how to regain volume momentum and find that balance between pricing and volume. And in the emerging markets, that kind of effort never comes in a straight line, particularly when you have pockets of competitive activity maybe with competitors who also are in the developed world looking to challenge growth more aggressively in the emerging markets. So in terms of our business in those emerging markets, that's really the challenge. The challenge is the price versus the volume.","John mentioned Brazil. And we have opportunities to fine tune our strategy in the emerging markets on price. We also have the opportunity in the emerging markets to react, too, particularly in Asia, the local brands where that innovation is at a significant premium to the average pricing in the market, which, obviously, drives the value of the market and then your performance from a share point of view. And we have a very broad portfolio because we service all consumers in those markets, the ones coming into the category, which John has talked many times, about our ability to get penetration and consumption up for the long haul and then trading them up the curve. So I think the second way we're thinking about the emerging markets beyond balancing price and volume is building that penetration and usage. I don't think it changes the way we think about the emerging markets at all, and that's why we are focused on those two things.","What you do get in the emerging markets is, as you saw from John's comments about Saudi on the third quarter call and what we've seen in the fourth quarter, you get bumps along the way. They are not as predictable. Indeed, I'm not sure any of the world is as predictable as we might want it to be. And so these things aren't going to move in a straight line and regrettably, perhaps not as quickly as certainly you might want. So that would be my answer on the emerging markets. In terms of share performance in the fourth quarter, actually, we feel quite good about the share performance in the fourth quarter. Obviously, you have the difficulty in the developed world of the measured and the nonmeasured channels. We do quite well in the nonmeasured channels as well. I think the key thing in the developed world is the underlying category growth rates, and that's why we are encouraged, perhaps aided a bit, by our innovation and the investments we're putting behind category stimulation that we're starting to see that come back. If that continues to trend the way we have seen it coming out of the fourth quarter, I think that's going to be an important part of driving potential in the developed world.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason Gere of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason Gere","I guess, Ian, I was just wondering if you could talk maybe about overall company price deflation. I think this is the first time in maybe 6 years that we actually saw prices in negative. And I know from time to time, the U.S. and Europe have been a little bit more of an investment market. But usually, you've had the offsets in other markets. So as you think about that low to mid-single-digit growth, what's your outlook on total price as a contributor? And how do you balance that right now when you are seeing the rising, I guess, raw material prices? Do you take comfort that more of your portfolio is Personal Care versus household? Or I think you might be impacting a little bit more. So I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of color around price and the impact on sales as well as margins.","Ian Cook","Thanks. Let me use this opportunity to comment margin by doing the gross profit roll forward, and then I will come back to price as we think about it for 2018. So if we take the gross margin roll forward, the gross margin in the fourth quarter 2016 was 60.8%. Pricing in the fourth quarter of this year was a negative of 40 basis points. Interestingly, funding-the-growth and a very, very modest contribution from restructuring, together, offset a negative 2.6 points of material prices, the ones that I talked about earlier, basically, resins and cardboards packaging, and that led to the 40 basis points reduction year-on-year, although still north of 60% at 60.4%. The comment I want to make of this and then come back to pricing is we were very pleased with our funding-the-growth delivery in the fourth quarter.","You know well, some tracking us over the years, that our funding-the-growth savings filled across of the year. But 260 basis points, 2.6 points in the fourth quarter is meaningfully higher than we tend to generate in historical years. Any point being that we have doubled down on driving funding-the-growth projects. And we think in that area of focus, we're quite well positioned for 2018. Now come back to pricing itself. Obviously, the biggest pressure on pricing, as you saw, was North America and, as it customarily is, Europe. The North America, we talked about some categories being under pressure from a promotional activity point of view, very specifically liquid hand soap and dish. And we said we were going to have to meet that activity in the third, and it continued into the fourth quarter. And we have seen a share response quarter-on-quarter positive for both businesses. And couponing was a factor for us in the fourth quarter as well as we edge pricing up in toothpaste.","We think that the raw material underlying pressures will inform the marketplace in general about a need to ameliorate promotional intensity to be able to absorb those costs. And we certainly believe that in the emerging markets, we have the pricing power that we have always demonstrated to be able to offset those costs with pure price. And that is something we know how to do and we have done in the past. So it comes back to John's point about our growth in 2018 being a balance between volume and pricing. And we think we are positioned to be able to accomplish that developing markets we have done before, and on the other side, the funding-the-growth initiatives we have are deep and rich, and we leave 2017 with very good momentum in that space. And I would say, just to repeat, we are looking for our gross margin to increase by 50 to 75 basis points in 2018 in the face of the environment we're in.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","So I'd like to drill on pricing and sharing return. Were you able to reinvest in pricing in Mexico and Central America? Or is that mostly concentrated in Brazil cash and carry? I asked in relation to your declining products in Mexico and Central America where volumes rebounded in Brazil and in June. So is that due to the new price instruction -- structure, sorry? Or is that related to destocking in some of your large clients in Mexico who happen to be also the U.S., your large U.S. clients, in many cases? So in other words, embedded in your top line guidance, are you expecting volumes to change slightly in Mexico, in Central America? And for you to recover a share, I'm assuming the household cleaning brands or the softener brands. So -- and how long do you expect the market share to improve in emerging markets?","Ian Cook","Yes. I think, actually, we talk prices in some Latin American countries in the fourth. And in Brazil, there was a degree of price promotion, which, of course, led to a very good result for us. We have, as others have commented, seen destocking with retailers. You talked Mexico, specific to Mexico, and we think, when we look at our market shares with the combination of the advertising and the innovation, and the innovation is -- tends to be more at the premium end of things, that we will see growth, volume growth continuing and some price on top of that.","Operator","We'll go next to Caroline Levy of Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","Ian, you have talked a lot about funding-the-growth and the great success you have there. We saw another company announce a very, very deep restructuring, significant layoffs and plant closures and so on. Do you see opportunity to cut more aggressively go beyond funding-the-growth? Because it seems to me that the environment is such that getting gross margin improvement to the extent that you're looking for is going to be awfully challenging. So just any thoughts of other big activities going forward.","Ian Cook","Yes. Well, Caroline, we fully endorse that notion. Indeed, we have been and continue with a very large restructuring program, which, when it's done by 2020, we'll see costs of about just under $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and savings between $0.5 billion and $575 million. And that's a very profound reassessment of how we go about managing our business. It's all to do with the linked capability that SAP gives us and our ability to reorganize how we get work done and reducing the duplication of work done in various locations. So it's a very proper question. It's a very important question. But indeed, it is a journey that we are on and have been on for a while. So we think it's appropriate, and it's something we are pursuing diligently and aggressively.","Operator","We'll go next to Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Sunil Modi","Just one quick one. Ian, did you -- sorry, if I missed it, but did you comment on trade inventories and destocking? I'm just curious if you're seeing any and how long. If you are seeing it, how long it might last? The bigger-picture question is just, given what's going on in the environment and look, Colgate has been incredibly careful and, I think, responsible in terms of how you allocate capital and M&A, but it looks like the environment is really just tough for all CPG players. And I'm just curious, have you kind of thought about perhaps coming a little bit more overreaching in your M&A thoughts in terms of different categories and pillars of growth? Any thoughts on that would be helpful.","Ian Cook","Yes. Always an appropriate question, Nik, and also an area of focus for us. We tend not to think about overreaching. We are quite broad in terms of thinking about where we might reach. I think, we think the recent additions of PCa and Elta skincare businesses are terrific acquisitions. These are very good technology, highly recommended skin health products with margins that are accretive, growth rates that are attractive and brands that use the recommendation model, of course, in their case, beauticians and dermatologists, to do what we have done so many years in Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. So your question is spot on. The challenge for us is what are the right assets. And I would say, when you think about use of our capital, clearly, when we think about the benefits of the tax legislation, our mind focuses on what we can do for growth, which is around capital investment that can drive growth organically and, of course, capital allocation that can acquire good businesses to further our category ambitions. And we think PCa and Elta are 2 such businesses.","Operator","We'll go next to Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","I had a question on your stepped-up advertising. I guess, I'm wondering if you believe you're successfully reaching your consumers and adapting enough to follow the changing consumer behaviors. So in the context of that, how do you guys evolve your approach? And have you leveraged in social media more and or -- maybe differently? And then curious if you considered implementing a subscription-based model for some of your businesses, especially in light of some of the relatively new entrants that are doing that. I guess, I'm just really trying to get at how you're better communicating with and attracting consumers as behaviors and the retail environment is changing so rapidly.","Ian Cook","Yes, Bonnie, all good questions, all areas of great focus and great focus with speed on our side. We're going to spend around 30% of our advertising digitally, and of course, that varies depending on the geography and the penetration of digital. The Hill's business is 100% digital, for example. And interestingly, with that business, you talked about subscription, we lead in Oral Care online in the U.S. and the U.K. and in China. And the Hill's business is extremely well developed digitally here in the United States. And to your point, given the quality of brand and the trust, consumers having those diets and what they can bring to their pets, today, over 50% of Hill's e-commerce purchases is subscription in the United States to exactly, as your point, the power of brand translated through the way people want to shop that category increasingly today.","In terms of reaching consumers and engaging with them, I mentioned a little bit earlier in some of my opening comments about these consumer engagement centers that we have in the U.S. and China, for example, which allows us to track 24\/7 what the consumers are engaging in online and insert ourselves into that conversation with the brand, take Colgate, that is very iconically all about a smile, all about building a future, a brighter future for the people that use our brand. So we can communicate and has built capabilities to communicate in 3 seconds, 6 seconds or 30 seconds and make sure that the brand's message and brand recall gets through that very cluttered environment. So absolutely, we are leveraging social, and I think we are moving ourselves into the space with speed and agility to do that quickly when you see trends emerge and make sure you stay relevant to consumers.","And the last idea I would repeat is this Dare to Love brand codeveloped with that e-commerce partner, very familiar with the consumers in that space who can be younger. And indeed, that Dare to Love toothpaste that I mentioned earlier that we launched online in China did precisely that, took the Colgate brand to a younger female purchaser, and we use digital to do that as well. So it's not just message; it's who we are reaching with that message. And if I may, although you didn't ask it, but Nik did and I didn't answer that part of his question, we have seen some retail destocking. I mentioned Mexico. It's fair to say that here in the U.S., year-on-year, some of the bigger retailers have seen a reduction of a weakened inventory compared to last year. So yes, we have continued to see that and deal with that as others are as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","You may have just kind of answered it, Ian, but I was hoping we could just definitively sort of wrap up the line. I'm thinking a couple of questions. Your prepared remarks talked about end market acceleration, market share acceleration. They all sounded really a beat, but reported results are lagging. Is that simply a factor of kind of timing of when you're seeing the accelerations? Or are you referencing sort of leading indicators into the new year? Or is the way you saw on the fourth quarter in some of these transitory destocking issues, et cetera, prevented the full flow-through. And then second question, as we think into next year, your earnings algorithm, roughly 10%. It looks like you're getting kind of halfway there on just tax, and depending on your FX assumption, almost the rest of the way there on FX, despite organic sales growth and gross margin expansion. So is it fair to characterize next year as another year of outsized reinvestment back in the business?","Ian Cook","Yes, Jason, I think the right way to think about our remarks related to the consumption in the fourth quarter is, indeed, leading into 2018. And we could go through factors about the sales versus the consumption. But the point, I think, is that we kept our advertising presence with better quality work behind growing relevant innovation. And we're beginning to see a marketplace response, not as quickly as people on the outside perhaps wanted. Indeed, a little bit shy of what we were looking for, which was not quite the same as the external. But from the consumption side of things, we're seeing a very definite measurable response, and we do think that bodes well in 2018 or for 2018. And as I have said at the end of the previous question, in certain parts of the world, destocking was a transitory piece of that.","Relative to the earnings gross -- growth that we talked about for next year, in the release, we said low double digits earnings growth. John talked about around 10% on the call. And whenever I'm asked the question, what does low double digit mean? My answer is always 10%, but your characterization of it is not correct. The tax rate is not half of it and -- nor is foreign exchange the other half. I will say, as we think about the way we're talking about 2018, and to remind everybody, we talked about 3% to 5% organic on the top line, mid-single digits on a dollar sales basis. We talked about gross margin expansion of between 50 and 75 basis points. And we gave the tax range, legislation part, the new treatment to start compensation running through the income statement and said around 10% earnings per share growth. I will say that there is a modest part of the tax return being reinvested into the business quite deliberately, but we think the construct of that income statement and earnings flow is quite robust in the current environment.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","I just wanted to build on Jason's question there with -- but -- with the guidance but as it pertains to advertising and marketing spending. So it would seem to imply that a healthy portion of the 50 to 75 basis points of gross margin improvement will be reinvested, so that advertising and marketing line starts to trend back closer to 10.5% to 11%. I think the high point for the company, if you look back a decade plus or so, it has been at 11%. So the question is really, is this sort of a reaction to the necessity to spend in the current environment? Or is this sort of a more permanent level of increase where it could be 11% or even north of that given a weak consumer, even including in emerging market? So any commentary there will be helpful.","Ian Cook","Yes, Kevin. I mean, we think about advertising in a very disciplined way. It serves the purpose, and the purpose is to build our brands. And the purpose of building the brands, particularly in a lower-growth category environment and historically, is to make sure we develop and evolve and grow the market shares of those brands in country by country because that's where you grow them. So we don't think about it top-down as a ratio. We think about it bottom-up as an expense to support a portfolio of businesses and the innovation we are bringing behind those businesses. And for 2018, as John said, we have a plan, that's see the advertising up, absolutely, and on a ratio basis, and that's because we think the portfolio of brands, the quality of marketing technique and the innovation we have in 2018 will be responsive to that investment to drive the organic growth in that 3% to 5% range. So we think about it entirely in those terms. And will it go up in 2019? Again, we'll see what the plans are.","Operator","We'll go next to Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Look, I appreciate all the efforts, Ian, that you described at the outset, the good 4 focus areas. You got to do those things. And to be fair, I thought lots of questions from the release, like the tax rate guidance seems high, debates on ad spend, Hill's, maybe Naturals not seeming to get traction yet, we've been hearing it for a while. But I wanted to take a step back and maybe, most importantly, talk about potential or apparent lack of pricing or maybe a negative ship in brand power for you. And are we -- I guess, the core question is are we here because Colgate has been milking the business a little bit over the past several years and overearning? And to your comments, a few questions ago, your commodities are up, yet pricing is negative.","Plus, you're investing significantly back into the brand, the ad spend. But not only your top line that challenges your market share still, right? So now it's two years, 140 basis points lower according to your own numbers, right, the track on track, according to your own numbers. And again, this quarter, for all mission, looks like you're not gaining in Brazil and Russia and India and U.K., and France and China at least, and a lot of that to local competitors. So I guess, I'm struggling for confidence, as you can tell by the question, I'm struggling for confidence that things are getting better quickly here. And I guess, the easier comps and FX should help, but I just don't see signs of Colgate doing better underlyingly. And going back to the question I start with, could this mean we're in a longer period of reinvestment necessary to shore up the Colgate brand, the formally impenetrable Colgate brand and pricing power? Does this mean that Colgate has been significantly overearning, and we're here for years of reinvestment as opposed to, hey, Q4 looks better, so 2018 is going to be good and rock the races again? Does that help? Does that make sense?","Ian Cook","It makes sense. I don't agree, but it makes sense. I mean, the words do. The -- I disagree, Ali, because come back to pricing in this fourth quarter, we're seeing to take a quarter and then project the world. But based on the quarter, if I took us back many quarters, the critique was no volume growth or price. This is a problem for brands in general. And as we have worked our way through 2018, supported by advertising, we have built back underlying volume strength into the business. As others have said on earlier calls, in some parts of the world with category growth being slower, which is an industry phenomenon, not a Colgate phenomenon, some people in those categories have invested, shall we say, aggressively in the short term to deliver a piece of the pie. And in some categories, we have made that choice. It is fair to say that commodities in the fourth quarter were up a little bit beyond our expectations coming out of the third, and I think that has been true for others as well. But I come back to our underlying model, our market shares in Latin America are strong.","Our share opportunity in China and India with Naturals, which only went into the marketplace in the third quarter of last year, the initial reaction as I tried to suggest that the Russia example has been very good and is building the Colgate market share. So I think we know how to innovate against competitors, whether they be multinational or local. And I think that the underlying commodity cost pressures will bring some sobering thinker -- thinking to others who compete in the category. We have, back to the criticism of a few years ago, the strength of brand to be able to take pricing in the developing markets, when we do that, there will be a corresponding yin and yang with volume while we establish the new pricing. But we know how to do that. And along with funding-the-growth, that will be part of how we will deliver that 50 to 75 point gross margin improvement, a fairly healthy gross margin, while we maintain a resolute focus on the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in the last couple of years of that program, so we can reduce structural costs as well and focus on building our brands.","So we don't think the model is broken. We think we have the brands, the innovation, the quality of engagement materials to meaningfully drive the business in 2018 and going forward. And actually, we are very pleased to see the positive and continuing reaction in markets such as Europe and North America. Europe, a part of the world that has been flat for quite a long period of time. So we feel okay about the business model, and we feel okay about the future starting with 2018.","Operator","We'll go next to Wendy Nicholson of Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson","My question actually goes back to the 2 skincare acquisitions you made. And I know, a, short answer would be, \"Oh, they're so small. They don't move the needle. It doesn't matter.\" But I guess I'm struck sort of with the question of why bother? It's such a competitive category. It's such a crowded category. I feel like everybody and their uncle is buying these small dermatologist premium price skincare brands. And so just when I think of what is Colgate's kind of right to win in that category, I struggle with that. And I know there's an analogy, hey, we're going to be going to dermatologists the same way we go to veterinarians and to dentists. But at the same time, I mean, a lot of us has been to Topeka. We've been to New Jersey. We've seen your huge R&D facilities. And I've always thought of what makes Hill's and Colgate toothpaste special is how much technology and science you bring to the categories. And I just can't believe that you're going to be able to bring that from a real value added basis to the skincare category. So why bother? Is this a precursor to bigger M&A in that space? Or would you be better served even taking that relatively small dollar investment and putting it back into your core categories?","Ian Cook","Yes. Well, thanks, Wendy. I mean, for the record, my uncle didn't buy any skincare businesses. These two we like for several reasons. They have, again, high recommendation levels. They have very good and proven technology, which is why they have the high recommendation levels. And a small as Tom's may have been and as small as some may have said a GABA was, we have learned a lot from those acquisitions in their respective spaces. So we think we get a technology -- we get technology learning and we think we can bring technology to those businesses. And the idea of, how would you call it, trickle-down science into a more mass skincare business is very attractive. And these are businesses that you can live wholesale to Australia and run the model with governing knowledge in those markets. So we think they are rich with opportunity, not just the businesses of themselves, but what we can gain from a technology point of view.","Operator","We'll go next to Olivia Tong of Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","I guess, if we take your word on Oral Care and the price pressure around some of your categories in pricing, maybe we can switch to the other 60% of your business. I mean, maybe Oral Care is okay, but what about the other categories, the home categories and the Personal Care areas in terms of your pricing power in those categories?","Ian Cook","Well, we have pricing power in two ways in all categories. We have innovation, which is increasingly premium, which takes category and brand pricing up. And we have demonstrated that across categories, not just in Oral Care and even in tough markets like Europe with a fabric softener is we've seen a very strong end to the year with our supreme brand. And in the developing world, in general, we have brands that can carry price increases, I mean, straight price increases as opposed to reducing promotion and\/or increasing mix. And we do that quite regularly. So on the Hill's business, that recommendation is a very powerful vehicle. And I think the testament to that for a product that is quite premium priced is the high level of subscription buying we see in the e-commerce channel, which is a fast-growing space for nutrition. So I mean, we always talk about the Colgate business and the toothpaste business, but we have brands that can earn their right across our portfolio in the world -- in the parts of the world that we have those businesses.","Operator","We'll go next to Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Powers","So building on some of what you said earlier, and you're absolutely right, in recent years, we were critical, many of us were, anyway, of the industry's potential overreliance on pricing to the detriment of volume. And now we're all harping on the opposite, the absence of pricing even the volumes are better. That's totally fair. But I guess, it's also about gross margin pressure. And I know you called out positive pricing gross margin targets in 2018. But the market, especially today, is obviously very concerned about the risk of an extended price more effectively brewing across HPC, just given the growth challenges that we've seen, the negative pricing and margin pressure, not only in your results, but in those with P&G and Kimberly-Clark early in the week. And I know you called out 50 to 75 basis points of gross margin expansion in '18.","But I also think you were targeting like 150 basis points plus in '17 originally, and we finished essentially at 20. So I guess, the punch line is, what gives you the confidence that recent pricing intensity is really temporary versus more structural? And what's the risk that you see that you won't be able to fully offset -- or fully get the pricing you want in '18 such that margin aspirations may come under duress as heightened competition doesn't allow full pricing to flow through? And I guess, if I can just tuck on one more thing. Very specific to that, I wasn't sure how to interpret your comments earlier, should we extrapolate the negative pricing in Brazil that we saw in 4Q going forward as the cost of volume acceleration in 2018? Or was that really specific to the fourth quarter?","Ian Cook","Yes, when we talk about pricing versus volume, again, I come back to the fact that finding the right balance is not a straight line. And we're always working to find the right balance. And we think we have that in our plan on a general basis in terms of this balance between volume and pricing. From a promotional point of view, we have seen some pockets, and we have felt the need to respond. I've mentioned the 2 U.S. categories specifically. But we think that the upward pressure on commodities, which wasn't at the level it is today in the third quarter, has definitely increased, will force people to reimagine how they engage with consumers beyond price in the developed world and in the emerging markets. As I've said before, we have the opportunity to price back to the balance that will see a diminution of volume until that new pricing is established, and then the volume comes back. So those tools, we believe, are there.","When we think about gross profit beyond that, clearly, we have mixed opportunity within businesses back to the premium innovation. And as I said earlier, the PCa and Elta businesses may, indeed, be small, but the gross margins are attractive. So we see mix within businesses, and of course, we see mix between categories in terms of respective growth rate. We have that emerging market pricing power. We have promotional efficiency with the revenue growth management capability that we have underway. We have the funding-the-growth that I mentioned in the fourth quarter, fully -- 250 basis points of favorable in that quarter, fully offsetting the impact of materials in the fourth quarter. And all of that gives us confidence. And we start with guidance on gross margin for 2018, but it's 50 to 75 basis points because of the underlying commodity pressure, not 75 to 125 basis points in a more benign commodity environment. So we think we've been realistic, and we think we have the tools that will allow us to get there.","Operator","We'll go next to Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","Just one follow-up, Ian, to something you said earlier. Maybe you could illustrate what you're seeing in the marketplace that merits investment. You mentioned you've already seen some signs of the market -- of some of your markets responding to the increased investment that you're making, that you're planning to make in 2018. If you give -- but that maybe not to the extent that you really wanted in 4Q, at least not everywhere. Could you give some anecdotes as to maybe one place where the marketplace is really responding to the -- I'm talking specifically about advertising investment in a way that you like and maybe one place where it's not? And what that's -- how you reacted to that as a company?","Ian Cook","Thanks, Jonathan. Well, markets are different around the world. Again, we were actually quite pleased with the overall consumption in the United States given the currently slow start we had to the year. We're very encouraged by the progress we have seen in Europe as that builds momentum in other developed market that is struggling. And if you get behind all of those things, it comes back to innovation. It comes back to brand building, and it comes back to good marketing, in general, working with the retail partners in the countries. Colgate alone is not going to change the market growth rate in a country or category. But we think we can bring stimulation to that and be a part of what is hopefully a rebuilding of category growth rates going forward. But all situations are so country-specific that actually, it wouldn't be helpful even to go through one country example versus another. The principles are effectively the same.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Chapell of SunTrust.","William Chappell","Hey, just a follow-up on the long-term targets. I understand and I think most of it is expected, kind of the change. But just how the company looked at it in terms of is there a fundamental reason why you can't -- the categories can't get back to 4% growth or you can't get back to 6%, 7% growth? I mean, I understand it hasn't done that in a long time. But certainly, it seems like we're seeing it kind of a global improvement in economies. You still have a pretty untapped developing market in terms of the Oral Care category. So is there some ceiling that you were seeing? Or are you just more prudent, it hadn't grown that way in the past 5 years, there's no point in forecasting it for the next 5 years?","Ian Cook","Bill, life is interesting. We were captivated for the last 5 years for being unrealistic about category growth rates supporting a 4% to 7% range. We believe deeply in the growth potential of these categories. That's why we invest a fair part of our advertising investment into emerging markets where middle classes will grow because of the underlying economic trends you mentioned to get people to brush their teeth because that will build consumption and that will build marketplace growth. Our mental view and the way we think about it is we want to grow faster than the categories in which we grow business. If we look at where we are today, I guess, I come back to your word, we say prudence dictates with underlying category growth rates maybe now in the 2.5% range if the fourth quarter maintains, that gives us confidence for the 3% to 5%. But we believe deeply in the fact that these categories will grow.","And if you look at them on an aggregate basis, e-commerce is another area that we'll continue to grow exponentially. I said we were just shy of 60% growth this year. So it's developing people into the habit, and it's connecting with people in the digital world of the 21st century and all of the other channels in between. So we have belief. We think prudence is called for now. And you can rest assure, if we can be a party to bringing category growth rates back, there will be nobody happier than us to elevate that 3% to 5% range. But the principal we think about is growing faster than the underlying growth rate of the categories in which we do business.","Operator","We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","That's okay. We can take it off-line.","Operator","All right, we'll move to our next question. We'll go to Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Just curious, what are you budgeting for oil prices for 2018 just in the model? And then just more broadly, competitiveness has been more pronounced in certain categories, maybe like Home Care and some Personal Care categories more than like Oral Care. I guess, I'm just curious, and maybe even following up on some questions earlier, how you think about the rationale today for continuing to play in some of those places where there is just more competition than in places like Oral Care and Pet where consumers are less likely to jump around?","Ian Cook","Yes. Yes, the oral in our budget on average is in below 60s. Obviously, front-weighted, the way most forecasts are externally. When you think about business strategy, you have to come back to this concept of balance. There is no question we prioritize our businesses for the reason you assert, which is the emotional connection that consumers have, the trust that consumers have with products that they put in their mouth or their kids' mouths and their pets' mouths, hopefully, not their own mouths in the case Hill's, is extremely strong and deep. And that builds brand loyalty. It gives you pricing power, which gives you margin power and usually, growth. Then comes Personal Care, not quite as emotionally bonding but close. And we're very interested to go on this journey in the professional stage where you are solving a specific skincare issues with recommendation.","And then Home Care, which, yes, is more of a grab-and-go business. It's a scale business. Brands still do well in parts of the world that we have them. And so as I've often said, if you have 4 kids, you don't love the fourth one any less than the first 3. So we have, over the years, as you have seen, divested modestly. Bleach, we have divested in some countries in the world where we think that brand can be better developed by another owner than us. But we're very happy with the business in the markets that we have them. They do very well. The U.S. under pressure on dish for the conversion reasons we have mentioned, that is building back. But taken as a whole, we like the business, and we will continue to keep the business in our portfolio. And remember, we are only focused on those four businesses.","Operator","Sir, at this time, we have no further questions.","Ian Cook","Thanks. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us, and we look forward to talking with you again after we close the first quarter, so bye.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today.

Please go ahead, Bina.","Bina Thompson","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, President, Chairman and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","We're pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth, of course negative foreign exchange continues to be a major challenge, but as you\u2019ll hear our market shares are strong and growing, one of the best indications of the health of the business. Happily gross profit margin increase in the quarter as a result of our funding the growth initiatives, pricing actions and our global growth and efficiency program. Worldwide our overhead cost are down on a dollar basis. Now while we reported advertising was down on dollar basis, we think we\u2019re getting good results from the dollars we spend both in-store and out. Digital advertising is growing in fact as an example in Latin America we are increasing our investment in digital to better reach our younger audiences as well as to drive engagements.","And as we focused on developing strategic collaborations with partners such as Google and Facebook, we\u2019re better able to measure the results of our investments. Marketing mix model studies from several countries across Latin America show an ROI for digital investment that is three to four times higher than TV confirming this shift is right to drive our business. Our balance sheet remain solid and we\u2019re making very good progress on working capital. So let's get right into the divisions starting with North America. Innovation continues to a fuel our success in North America. As mentioned in the press release, our market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash and fabric conditioners. And this was true on a quarter-over-quarter comparison as well.","At the same time, we\u2019ve seen a decline in private label shares in many of our categories indicating the consumers preference for branded products and respect of our equities. In the toothpaste category, the launch of Colgate Total Daily Repair supported by engaging media campaign and strong in-store shopper materials has added incremental share to the base line products. In the whitening segment, we offer a full range of products toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash. Our Colgate Optic White toothpaste has grown share from 2.4% in the third quarter of 2011 to a 5.7% share in the most recent quarter.","Colgate Enamel Health has also seen good growth momentum increasing a full share point quarter-over-quarter. Another exciting opportunity is a sensitivity segment where we are a strong number two player. That segment has seen a compound growth of 7.7% over the last four years versus 2.8% for toothpaste overall. In the mouthwash category, where our share is up year-to-date 20 basis points, both Colgate Total for gum health and Colgate Enamel Health mouthwash are picking up momentum. Our Colgate Total for gum health is the number one new item in the leading retailer and receiving full support in-store.","In liquid hand soaps, our year-to-date share is up almost a full point to a leading 30.6% while private label products have declined almost two full points year-to-date to the lowest level in at least five years. Premium offerings such as soap Softsoap Fragrant Foaming Collection and D\u00e9cor Collection foaming hand soap offer distinctive benefits. Similar Softsoap Fresh & Glow body wash with real extract with a unique formula giving you healthy looking skin that glows launched earlier this year has increased our share in that category but almost a full point year-to-date. Fabric conditioner also continue to perform well.","Suavitel Fragrance Pearls in-wash scent boosters which provide five times longer lasting fragrance versus detergent alone which we told you about last quarter have helped increase our national share almost a full point year-to-date now approaching 20% of the market. More trial focus programs are expected to drive further growth in the fourth quarter. Now as you\u2019d expect our new product grid is well populated and we will share with you some more exciting innovation slated for early 2016 on future calls.","Turning then to Europe, South Pacific. Our business there is showing encouraging signs of recovery with innovation playing a critical role. Our market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, body wash, shower gels, underarm protection and fabric conditioners. In toothpaste we\u2019re very excited about the early success of our launch of Colgate Max Light Expert White toothpaste, latest premium offering in this fast growing segment. Launched in the UK in June, it achieved 2.7% share in August and was named the best new toiletries launched for 2015 by one of our larger drug retailers.","Two products under the Elmex brand developed specifically for the pharmacy channel, Elmex Sensitive Professional and Elmex ANTI-CARIES PROFESSIONAL has driven our pharmacy share in France to a leadership position 26.3% year-to-date and now ahead of the nearest competitor by 150 basis points. In manual toothbrushes, our leading market share in Europe is up 130 basis points year-to-date to 24.6% with our nearest competitor down to 17.4%. Driving these excellent results has been the launch across the region of our Colgate 360\u00b0 manual toothbrush line, priced at a super-premium tier these brushes deliver superior cleaning for whole mouth clean and has been supported by a full shopper program.","We\u2019re also very encouraged by our launch of Sanex advanced range of body washes, underarm protection and body and hand lotion. This innovation brings dermatological expertise for skin specific needs to a third growth pillar for Sanex leading the brand towards a more professional approach in mass. Early results are excellent. Since launch Sanex is the fastest growing brand in both body washes and underarm and in our top markets of France, Spain and the UK our market shares are up in both categories.","In fabric conditioners our market shares are up 20 basis points year-to-date to 24% across the European region with the most recent read at 24.5%. Contributing to this success is Soupline Fruity Sensations with a striking look and feel and new different and long lasting fragrances. More innovation is planned across our categories for the rest of this year and into 2016. Specifically in oral care, we will launching the Colgate Expert toothbrush and built in whitening pen. And as you know that product form has helped drive our manual toothbrush share to record high tier in the U.S. In toothpaste we will be launching Colgate Total Proof. This innovation uses breakthrough color change technology that turns the white paste into a blue foam while brushing, giving consumers the confidence of ultimate clean feeling.","Turning then to Latin America. Business across the region is solid and as elsewhere innovation has driven market share increases. Our regional market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, toilet soap, liquid soap, shampoo, hand dish and liquid cleaners. And even in the face of some economic uncertainties in countries such as Brazil, our categories still show solid local currency growth. Our regional toothpaste share is up two full points year-to-date to 78.2%. In Brazil our market share is up 50 basis points year-to-date to 72%, the highest share in over 20 years and in the face of continued heightened competitive activity.","Colgate Total 12 re-launched in August with the positioning of protects a 100% of the services of the mouth. Now has an 18.5% share in the most recent period. In Mexico our share is up 1 point year-to-date to 81.3% with the most recent read at 81.6%, while our major competitor shows continued share decline. Contributing to this success is our premium priced Colgate Luminous White Advanced, Colgate\u2019s most advanced whitening toothpaste formulated to intensify the whiteness of your teeth by three shades.","In manual toothbrushes our market share is up 230 basis points year-to-date to 45.4% with the most recent read at 49.8%. In Mexico we recently reintroduced our Colgate 360\u00b0 line with a new packaging structure with premium finishing and improved benefit communications, all mouth clean with a 151% more bad breadth bacteria removal.

Today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the cell phone audience [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","So first Ian just a detail question, I think last quarter you\u2019d indicated in local currency advertising will be roughly flat year-over-year as a percent of sales in 2015. Is that still the case? How you think about that line item? And then the real question on that front is, it\u2019s now been six quarters in a row where A&P has been down substantially as a percent of sales. I know you\u2019ve indicated before it\u2019s been funneled back into promotion which has been a fact given the market share performance. But the level of pull back in A&P is really striking relative to your -- traditionally the way you\u2019ve run the business. So what gives you confidence this won\u2019t come back to bite you in the long run in terms of lower demand going forward particularly given the macro situation out there right now?","Ian Cook","As you might imagine not an unexpected question, and in answering it as you did let\u2019s take a little bit broader perspective and then come back to your specific question. So the world we\u2019re dealing in today in terms of our categories so I am talking Colgate businesses now and the categories in which we do business not the macroeconomic scene, we have a world where our categories are growing between 0% and 2% in the developed world in Europe at the low end of that and in the U.S. at the upper end of that 0% to 2% growth. In the emerging markets through this call the growth rates in our categories continue to be mid-single digits generally.","And our objective, business objective, in that arena has been to have a sustainable rate of growth organically in that 4% to 7% range that we mentioned at the beginning of the year, which we think we continue into the third quarter and we continue to talk about 4 to 7 of the year and indeed as we think about 2016, we begin our budgeting process with the same ambition next year. And the way you get that consistent rate of growth is by building new brands. And you build your brands as measured in market share and as we choose investment vehicles to build those brands you\u2019re focusing on trial and repeat purchase of our new innovation and our existing businesses.","And don\u2019t forget in many of these emerging markets consumer behavior is challenged by local category conditions in those markets, and in store engagement can be more persuasive than -- we were all educated as being proper advertising investment. So we balance and like to think we invest smartly in traditional media the traditional television magazine, radio, sampling devices that would be in that advertising number with an increasing shift as Bina pointed out to digital, being both lower cost and better rate of return and frankly in Latin America with the millennials are now the predominant parent generation a better way of engaging with that target group. And you as you indicated the in-store work that we do within these volatile times can be particularly powerful. Now all of that said as we think about going forward and we begin our process for the budget in 2016 even though we haven\u2019t yet fully begun that process, if we look at the array of innovation we have over the next three years starting in 2016, I think it would be safe to say that our expectation would be that our traditional advertising ratios would be up in 2016.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay is that on a local currency basis so that\u2019s overall company and also can you give us a sense of where you kind of lead 2015 in terms of the ad ratio?","Ian Cook","Well, the ad ratio will be according to our current plan for 2015, will be up quarter-on-quarter for the balance of the year and now I am talking income statement, so I am talking dollar. And if you think about 2016, I think at this stage the expectation would be dollar and of course therefore local currency given what I think most believe will be an improving or at least less bad foreign exchange environment.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. First of all Bina you talked about the Brazilian competitive environment as still being fairly intent. But can you talk a little bit more qualitatively is that more price based competition, is there more advertising, is there more innovation just fighting for shelf and space or just -- I know your shares are good, but directionally what are you seeing there? And then just separately housekeeping on Hills, can you remind us what the split is U.S. versus international sales now for health and maybe in the quarter. How sales performance differed by region? Thank you.","Ian Cook","The Brazil, I don\u2019t actually recall Bina\u2019s language, but frankly the Brazilian environment hasn\u2019t become particularly more competitive and historically, it continues to be a competitive marketplace to be sure. But again back to my answer to Dara, with the programs we have and the innovation we have we see our market-share continuing to grow and at 72 as Bina said it's the highest in the last 20 years with our principal competitors both down. So frankly at this stage whatever the threats are in the marketplace, we seem to be meeting them.","If we turn to your second question which was around Hill\u2019s, I think it would be fair to say in broad terms that Hill\u2019s is about 50-50 U.S. domestic, international business split.","Wendy Nicholson","And it trends internationally versus in U.S. in terms of growth for Hills, similar?","Ian Cook","Similar. Yes, I mean the innovation moves from the U.S. around the world and I am pleased to say things like metabolic and metabolic plus are having similar impacts where ever we take them, so yes.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy","I am sorry I hopped a little late, but I am wondering if you address Venezuela and the decision not just sort of take it to worst case scenario in the earnings did I miss something there?","Ian Cook","No you didn\u2019t Caroline and I am sure many of you have not yet had the chance to get to our [indiscernible] which was posted earlier this morning. But as you well know from the financial literature and the decisions that one makes in this space any decision that we would take to deconsolidated would be driven by our inability on an ongoing basis to get dollars or if we faced additional restrictions on our ability to make local operating decisions on the ground clearly these are things that we revisit quarter upon quarter and we duly did so for this quarter Caroline, but based on our facts and circumstances and the assessments we made we have chosen to keep reporting Venezuela this quarter and of course that is subject that we will revisit period-by-period as time goes on.","Caroline Levy","And off the 12% pricing in Latin America then can you say how much is Venezuela?","Ian Cook","Well remember the government approved pricing that got in Venezuela which I think was around 70% plus, 74% if I remember correct me, that was in the fourth quarter of last year. So obviously you have the rollover effect. There is pricing obviously we get for the non-regulated businesses but I would tell you that we are getting pricing across Latin America from Mexico down to Argentina.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","I wanted to ask again about why you are confident that you\u2019re striking the right balance in terms of volume versus margin for the long term? And so take maybe two metrics, one take as the move more and more to in store promotion, and in store displays, doesn\u2019t that suggest that the consumer is making more and more decision at the shelf and that\u2019s been a trend going on for a while. It seems like its accelerating. So does that reduce such a competitive advantage over the long term because I think it\u2019s tough to really differentiate yourself as much in store as one could through traditional media as an example? Perhaps online -- although I\u2019d say that the ROI there is still hefty because we know long term history. So, how you balance that? Is that -- are you setting yourself up in a tougher situation by pushing more in store for the long term given you\u2019re trying to differentiate your brand?","Ian Cook","Very good and deep question Ali, as usual. The answer is it\u2019s not either-or and I think if you were to go back to again the days when many of us made our marketing bones, in store activity was pretty rudimentary there was a cardboard display stuck at the end of the shelf with a $0.99 off flag on it hardly brand building in nature and that is why everybody has this aversion if you will to in store investment versus the supposed quality of the engagement we get from their traditional media understanding that that will today is so fragmented that it is less precise than perhaps many of us believed historically. So, no, obviously, you don\u2019t find yourself in a place where all of your engagement with consumer happens at the retail level.","So with the data available to us today with the techniques available to us today with some of the in store engagement materials available to us today, which are brand and benefit and therapy open bracket Colgate specific including some times the coloring of the shelves but house oral care products at retail that is a wonderful environment to get consumers to make that final decision particularly if they are in a stressed highly devalued geography. You still have the advertising and we can debate traditional versus digital, but is making the awareness connection and seeking to provoke the trial, but you miss everything if you don\u2019t engage with that consumer when they come to that store to make sure the trial engendered if the your product. So yes it is a balance so it is not a journey to everything at retail but I think the historical perceptions of what you can do at retail and frankly a prejudice that says what you do at retail is by definition not brand building I am afraid it\u2019s a little bit old school.","Ali Dibadj","So besides that I am old school there here --.","Ian Cook","That\u2019s allowed [ph] by the way.","Ali Dibadj","But do you think -- so I understand engaging at shelf I mean you guys have seen it, you guys have done it very well the [indiscernible] side slightly all show. I struggle with that being not -- that being differentiated so feeling that that\u2019s probably easier to copy with a little bit of spend in store, with a little bit of more discussion with the merchants in store, then really good copy and whether that\u2019d be digital or not. And it just sounds like you don\u2019t even think that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s not as copy able in store?","Ian Cook","Ali, again, take Latin America think about our market share and think about how much of that shelf we have, then think about red, then think about a program that may take a local dentist with an incentive to go to a store and buy Colgate that is hitting you in the face with a therapeutic health message so you\u2019re coming in provoked by the dentist and Colgate is engaging newer shelf, a competitor can spend more money, they\u2019re not going to get that presence at retail. So I would argue it is differentiating and the presence you have at retail with the market shares we have in our specific categories come back to the more fragmented media market, you can argue which is more likely to get the consumers\u2019 attention.","Having said that I am still old school and I agree with you a good copy is very important part of a marketing mix, but it\u2019s a marketing mix I would argue it is not simply more of the store, but everything on media. Things are much more balanced.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Good morning. You said about doing something in organic, it's been a while since you guys have looked at acquisitions and it seems like the industry is clearly changing very rapidly, there is not as amount of active business twist, there is big focus on cost cutting and it seems like you're pretty deeply penetrated and especially in oral care. So is there anything out there that you guys are thinking about this juncture that would making better leverage from your distribution infrastructure?","Ian Cook","Yes, I mean it's clearly a very good question Bill and obviously were I to answer and I\u2019d have to kill you. So I think the headline would be, I think we are very thoughtful and we\u2019re very strategic about acquisition, you have seen that I think in those things that we have acquired. We are all with strategically open to the right acquisition at the right time. As you know these things are little bit of process of serendipity however much you move and peruse and then we are also very disciplined on valuations. You have to live with what you buy for the betterment of the company over the long haul. So I think my answer would be we\u2019re as interested in acquisitions as were in Sanex and GABA and Tom\u2019s and the laser brand in Myanmar and if more were to become available and the price was right, you\u2019d see as this interested going forward as we have been over our recent past.","But I wouldn\u2019t make it a tilting point now versus previously.","Bill Schmitz","Okay, great. Can I just have a follow-up, I am asking to read the tea leaves here, but are there any signs that we\u2019re bottoming in emerging market, I know the category growth rates are still fairly healthy, but almost all that\u2019s driven by price and mix. If people get some of the scan volume data flat up very slightly most of that inflation pricing with the absence of a local competitor. So like do you have any thoughts on kind of when we really start to see consumption come back?","Ian Cook","I think in terms of physical consumption; first of all some of these markets are growing in volume terms, so it's not everywhere. But you're right, when pricing is very aggressive needs as must from a dollar point of view that tends to depress volume in s short haul so without being glib, I think my answer would be once the necessary wave of pricing is behind us and everybody else that\u2019s taking pricing I think you can expect the balance between price and volume to move back more on to the volume side of the equation. When exactly that will be is difficult to tell I would certainly say it will be no earlier than next year.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Good morning. Thank you for question. I want to come back to the investment questions against the consumer. So a two part question; one it sounds like you really were in an environment where shifting more to trade makes sense given the sharper marketing components that ways and the engagement the consumer there and digital course playing a larger role. With that said, is it fair to assume that the measurable AMP line in your income statement we should expect that ratio to sales to remain lower than it has been historically? And secondly as you moved straight and move to essentially a counter revenue line item that we can\u2019t see in the P&L, it becomes a little hard to measure for us to see. So can you give us a sense of if we were able to group of trade and measurably compete together and look at that as a percentage of sales how that maybe changing year-to-date for fair versus previous year?","Ian Cook","The last one is difficult to do Jason because one comes off gross and the other is measured against net. What I can tell you is that what you are calling trade spending is up this year. But to come back to you more fundamental question, a few things; number one, this notion of shopper marketing is not the third quarter 2015 comment. We have been trying to make this point unsuccessfully for the last two to three years for the reasons ID tailed a little bit earlier. We believe well done it is part of building brands.","Number two, you're right digital I think will become an important way to target and reach different consumer groups going forward and that carries with it a different dollar to the traditional media. But no, I would not take the notion this forever going forward our traditional media to sales percentage, the one you do see will be lower and stay lower. That as I said earlier in response to a question I think we\u2019ll be the innovation spread and we have driven by the innovation spread that we have and as I said earlier even though we haven\u2019t finished the budget process, actually we haven\u2019t even started the budget process, but when you look at our innovation grid for the next three years starting in 2016, I think my expectation would be that you will see that ratio head back up a little bit in 2016. So it will move around I am just trying to assert that there is no good and bad, it\u2019s all in the marketing mix and they are all legitimate ways of engaging with consumers. And particularly in volatile times with high devaluations that closure if you will with the consumer on sale in those high devalued emerging markets happen in that retail environment.","Jason English","So can you help me understand why it\u2019s hard to give us sense of the trade spend number? I mean you know the number instead of divided by growth, you could just divide it by net to give us the ratio. Am I over simplifying it by thinking about it that way?","Ian Cook","No, you\u2019re not. We haven\u2019t done that, let us think about that, we could do that it is then a created number.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","So just on advertising, you\u2019ve mentioned it should go up next year. But do you think this level with abnormally low and you will see a big move upwards next year or is there plan for up but not materially so in 2016. And what are you seeing in terms of the decision on promo versus advertising from your major competitors. Because I asking in the context that Proctor sort of shifting some of their trying to realize more margin potentially as a detriment of sale in some cases? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Well, first of all, I had tried to explain the third quarter this year. It is a quarter I wouldn\u2019t have said about it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s abnormally low and therefore as we approach our 2016 budget we\u2019re saying oh we need to get it back up to X or Y level, I do believe, we do believe that with the richness of innovation we have the expectation will be that it will be up, how much it will be up, we will know when we finish our budgeted process. Now as you look around the world and something I elected not to say let\u2019s one sounds defensive but as you go around the world in many parts of the world you continue to see many of our multinational competitors pull back on traditional advertising quite substantially and then many of that fee market, even if you take the old fashioned measure of share or voice, we remain just on the face of it quite competitive.","Now, we have seen some collaborating signals of certain businesses exited by competitors in order to realize price you see the public information in India and you see that in the market place. But if we take the breadth of our business, there is nothing I would point to say, the shape of the promotional environment that we\u2019re in has meaningfully changed.","Olivia Tong","So I can just move to restructuring. Are you pushing harder on the initiatives you\u2019ve already outlined or these new areas that you will be exploring? And will this result in more savings starting in 2016 or is it just an extension to another year of savings? And as you think about reinvestment versus dropping to the bottom line, are there any shifts there in terms of how you think about this new tranche of restructuring savings.","Ian Cook","Let\u2019s take a step back Olivia. Clearly, when we began this program, which by the way is a lot shorter than many of our competitors. But when we began the program we had three key areas and we said at the beginning that it was a global growth and efficiency program and that it was a journey. So, we were establishing hubs and we were establishing business service centers and we were transferring lifting and shifting if you will capabilities to the new structure that we were building that was supported by SAP across out Company. So this gives us the opportunity to transform a little bit what, we are doing with the new structure that we are creating and do it in a time bound window of 2017 rather than extending it over a longer period.","So it is very definitely still within the three areas that we defined at the beginning of the restructuring, no new areas. It is definitely one more year. And as we said in the release we\u2019ll be coming back to you early in the New Year with flushed out ranges of costs for the program and savings. So on that one, we\u2019ll back to you in the new-year.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Steve Powers with UBS.","Steve Powers","Great, thanks. I guess just to cleans up on topics already discussed on Venezuela acknowledging every situation is different, is it fair to assess at least the likelihood of deconsolidation rising on the margin, it feels that way from the outside. I just want to get your perspective on that? And second much to the restructuring that Olivia asked about, is there -- so should we\u2019ll be thinking about more opportunity in this next wave building on the hunting, thread, shared services is there a focus area within the three that is going to be of weight or maybe -- I am just trying to get a sense for where the incremental focus will go either in terms of focus stream or geography?","Ian Cook","On your Venezuela comment, all I can say Steve is that this is something we revisit quarter-by-quarter based on the facts and circumstances that present themselves in each of the quarters and we will continue to do that. So I really and specifically do not want to share how we\u2019re thinking about it. We will be resolutely objective and make whatever decisions we think are appropriate based on the fact and circumstances at the time. Now when you turn to the restructuring, I would say simplistically and we will be back with richer commentary next year, I would say specifically what we\u2019re talking about and activities that will be more transformational in how we used the hubs we have created and how we use the service centers we have created more fulsomely. And I hold it there at this stage.","So it is greater utilization around the basic structures that we will have fully established by next year.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara","The SG&A excluding advertising in the quarter, looks likes it picked up maybe by 100 basis points year-on-year. So can you go through a little bit what might have driven that, I mean is that some of the shift in store, there is some promotional activity?","Ian Cook","Chris that is straight forward leverage, our overheads -- our drawn [ph] overheads were actually down year-on-year with the benefits we\u2019re getting from the restructuring program. But there is a lot of overhead that is dollar denominated and when you have the downward pressure of 13% foreign exchange on the top-line you end up with a leverage negative and it is entirely traceable to that negative leverage.","Chris Ferrara","I guess than the follow-up to that would be, why didn\u2019t we see it nearly to that extent last quarter when it was publicly a pretty similar dynamic around the top-line drivers?","Ian Cook","I don\u2019t know, the only other mix in it is the mix of countries. So it may have been a country mix issue, we\u2019ll have to get back to you on that, I don\u2019t have the answer at my fingertips.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante","Good morning everyone. Actually my clarification has to do with Chris\u2019 because it seems like headquartered expenses run the highest since 2009 and I was surprised because of the having and is this Forex or something else going on in that line? And I do have a question with regards to commercial spending and category growth if I can. Thank you.","Ian Cook","What you called it, corporate overhead is flat. So as I answered before on this quarter, it's definitely a leverage. And your question on spending is?","Javier Escalante","Basically in the past and we know that the fact that this market shares are up across the board in oral care, it shouldn\u2019t be a huge change. But especially in the past when advertising has been down there have been commentary regarding aggregate commercial spending which include trader spending. And trader spending is typically in magnitude two to three times advertising. So could you tell us whether the aggregate of commercial spending is up or not and in the case of category you mentioned that the category has kind of like bottomed out, this is in reference to Bill Schmitz question? So could you clarify whether is it that the category we\u2019re seeing negative mix because of the price increases or actual volumes have slowdown? Because it seems as if considering all the market-share gains, all the pricing that you're taking in oral care the organics could have been better? So sorry for the too many questions. Thank you.","Ian Cook","Well the oral care organic sales were better than the company average number one. Number two, in terms of total spending you're right, the trade spending as a ratio is a multiple of over three times the traditional advertising spending and relative to the category growth rates Bill\u2019s question was to do with volume and my answer to the question was a balance between volume and price. And he was asking whether the volume was bottoming out and would come back and I think the answer we gave was you would expect that balance to come back once the higher pricing that has being taken had worked its way through and that we didn\u2019t expect that to be earlier than 2016.","Javier Escalante","But if I may, so the question that I have is based on your assessment are you seeing, when you talk about volumes there is this interplay between mix and actual tonnage if you will. So my question is whether because of the price increases you were seeing negative mix within Colgate\u2019s portfolio? Thank you.","Ian Cook","And the answer is we\u2019re not going to get into that level of detail.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Just had a question on pricing in Latin America, it sounds like in your answer to Javier that you\u2019re waiting on some of your competitors to match on the price increases you guys have taken. And I am just curious when you talk about your competitors in Latin America, are they mostly local competitors who don\u2019t have the same currency headwinds that you guys are facing right now, or are they multinationals who do have the same currency headwinds?","Ian Cook","We have both, the locals tend to be more country specific, Columbia and Mexico. So they tend to be both. And if I said it then I apologize, I didn\u2019t mean to say it. We\u2019re not waiting on anybody. We have been taking pricing in Latin America and I would further say when you look at the breakdown of raw materials in today\u2019s world many of those raw materials are dollar denominated, so even a local competitor is going to get hit with the local currency transaction impact of raw materials coming into the country. So I would say that the incentive to price is fairly elevated across the board.","Joe Altobello","Okay, that was my question, yeah. I was trying to get to when they would follow your lead essentially on the pricing side. And then on the follow up in terms of advertising spending, I know we\u2019ve beaten this to death a little bit here. But can you give us a sense for what U.S. advertising did in the quarter year-over-year? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Again we\u2019re not going to get into that level of country by country detail.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","So if you could talk a little bit about Europe, actually, this is with organic sales being down this quarter, it\u2019s actually the first time we\u2019ve seen that in quite a while. So, big deceleration in volume and my understanding is there has been little bit of premium based innovation going into market, so just surprised to see volume which we know as volume and mix be so light. Could you talk a little bit about your, that would be great? Thank you.","Ian Cook","I think when you look at the European environment obviously it\u2019s our lowest growth area of the world. I think the good news is that although pricing has been consistently negative in Europe if you look at the three quarters this year it has become positively less negative, unfortunately we had the volume negative in the third quarter. And I would say -- we would say that that is going to come back and we\u2019re certainly planning for positive organic growth going forward.","Lauren Lieberman","Were there any particular big buckets of product launches, appointment, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s a pretty significant change in trend on volume?","Ian Cook","The only thing I would comment to Lauren is that we had a situation in our Europe West grouping which is essentially our Germanic grouping which had to do with the transfer to a new distribution center which disrupted the shipments of that operation specifically in the quarter. So I think I know Europe was in part affected by that on the volume side which we see, A, as one time and B, already corrected and coming back in the fourth quarter. But it did have an effect beyond the usual market travails in Europe.","Lauren Lieberman","And then just similarly on Latin America, it\u2019s pretty rare to see volume go negative. I mean I understand the pricing environment obviously and that volumes have been light. But it is rare to see volume go negative. So just thoughts on what comes next there, understanding shares have been solid and market growth you said is kind of stuck in the single digit?","Ian Cook","Again you\u2019re right it has to do with the pricing. You can see that the pricing of course is more elevated than the prior two quarters in Latin America and we took strong pricing in Brazil which had an impact on volume and usually the way that works is that as I said earlier once the pricing works its way through than the volume comes back, the categories are still growing mid-single digit. So we hope things stay to the normal cycle of events.","Lauren Lieberman","Thank you. And then just so the call doesn\u2019t end without anyone asking, could you share the gross margin bridge for the quarter? It will be great.","Ian Cook","No.","Lauren Lieberman","But then my model breaks down.","Ian Cook","Third quarter the prior year gross profit was 58.6%, we got 140 basis points positive from pricing, but our funding the growth savings and the restructuring, we got favorable 270 basis points, so funding the growth continuing to do very well. On material pricing there was a headwind of 390 basis points and so the offset of the resulting 120 basis points negative to the 140 on pricing gets you the plus 20 and meaningfully over half of the 390 basis points negative was to do with the transaction impact to foreign exchange.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to John Faucher with JP Morgan.","John Faucher","Yes, good morning and I guess its afternoon now. So I\u2019ll try to keep this quick. One clarification which is I think you said that Venezuela pricing was up 74% and if I look at that that would be pretty much all of the Latin America pricing.","Ian Cook","No, no, John sorry, what I said was the official price increase that we were granted was 74% in the fourth quarter of last year. So on some businesses, so that is --.","John Faucher","On some businesses, okay, I got it, that\u2019s what I thought, I just want to make sure. And then as we look out, I know you guys don\u2019t want to get into quarterly stuff here. If you look at it is a more difficult comparison as we look into the fourth quarter. Just sequentially, do you feel like more the pricing flows through and again not looking for specific guidance, but it seems like sort of the lower end of your four to seven range is probably the right way to be in the fourth quarter, is that the right way to think about it?","Ian Cook","I am not sure, I would go all the way there John, I think we\u2019re comfortable with the four to seven range, I think your sense of pricing is right. We still have recovery to move the gross margin because to get to flat on the year, we have to be as you\u2019ll calculate from the squeeze, we have to be up on the quarter. So it will be within range, I think we are thinking if you take the nine months to it would be kind of around there.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Alex Paterson with AGI.","Alex Paterson","Hi Ian, so just a couple of quick ones in the specialty pet channel, have you seen much in the way of a deflationary impact due to lower commodity cost which seem to be impacting the mass channel, has that flowed into that channel for you? And then secondly just curious about the cash you\u2019ve been building and the cash sources are you able to repatriate like you\u2019ve been able to do in the past the cash generation especially in emerging markets back to the U.S. whereas most of that locked into those markets?","Ian Cook","On the first -- again without being glib, the answer is a simple, no. Particularly in our segment of the pet nutrition business which tends to be the more premium and so we have not seen it creep into specialty. Cash repatriation, Venezuela is Venezuela, absent Venezuela it's the same as it has always been. So we have the ability to repatriate sometimes timings is variable country-by-country but no change from prior.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our last question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","So going back to the advertising, I guess the effectiveness of digital would seem to vary by category for various reason. So I am curious assuming if there is some truth to that, are there specific categories in which ads spend is still up year-on-year or up greater than it appears to be and maybe talk directionally about it category-by-category, if you can?","Ian Cook","I probably could, but I am not going to. I don\u2019t think Mark because we\u2019re not going to get into that level of detail. I would say to your general point on digital, it\u2019s less category specific, although the category maybe linked to the user, its more which use that you're trying to get to and how they access. We just went through an extensive review for example in Latin America, majority of viewers millennial. They happen to be a growing majority of parents. They happen to do an awful lot on Facebook and they happen to be avid viewers of YouTube video. So do you want to connect with that group then the best way to get your advertising message to that group is YouTube videos and to do so in a way that is purpose driven. So if you were to Google all of that you\u2019d see some pretty interesting work from our point of view. But it tends to be more driven by the viewer than it does by the category.","Okay. Well, good. Is that it?","Operator","That\u2019s it.","Ian Cook","Okay. Then, thank you all for your questions and thanks to all the Colgate people around the world that deliver the results. Thank you everybody.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation."],"6348":["Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) Q3 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call October 26, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","John Faucher - SVP, IR","Ian Cook - Chairman and CEO","Analysts","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Andrea Teixeira - JP Morgan","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Wendy Nicholson - Citi","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Caroline Levy - Macquarie","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Mark Astrachan - Stifel","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, good day and welcome to today\u2019s Colgate-Palmolive Company Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.","John Faucher","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer.","Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website.","Ian Cook","Good morning, everyone. This is Ian, and I\u2019d like to make some introductory comments. You will recall from our previous quarterly earnings call that we talked in some depth and with some urgency around our focus on innovation and building growth in channels where people are shopping, and our commitment to advertising and continuing to derive efficiency and capabilities. And I do not intend today to dwell on those areas. What I intend to focus on is what was a challenging and disappointing quarter for us.","Challenging on two levels. First, foreign exchange, which moved sharply negative, particularly so in our large Latin American division; and secondly, the underlying growth in commodity costs, partly affected by the transaction impact of foreign exchange. Underlying materials were up over 8%; oil, as you know, was up 46% quarter-on-quarter. And as you will hear from John, who will go forward, our margin roll forward, raw and packing materials this quarter were 390 basis points negative impact against gross margin. And from both material and foreign exchange points of view, we expect that pressure to continue in the fourth quarter. And that is why, we took the pricing that we did in the third, which we spoke to about in the second quarter, and pricing will continue to be an area of necessary focus going forward, as you have heard from some of our competitors quite recently. The disappointing part of this earnings report is the weak top-line, for 6 divisions up, but with Brazil in Latin America and China in Asia drove our top-line from positive to negative.","So, let me start with Brazil. In Brazil, the macroeconomics are volatile, including a hangover from the trucker strike in the second quarter. And of course, less now, but still uncertainty around the elections. The categories, as you\u2019ve heard from others, in our principal businesses, turned negative in the third quarter, both in volume and in value. We took pricing early as we said we would, and we have not yet seen retail pricing move up or competitors for our pricing lead. And as you know and as you have heard from others as well, in situations like this, often there is a gap between the lead and moving price and competitors following. We have obviously therefore seen a volume impact negatively because of the pricing we took. And we reported, you may recall, less of a negative impact from the trucker strike in the second quarter than our competitors, and that may also have affected our third quarter performance a little bit as well.","Our market shares continue to hold in well, up year-to-date and holding through our leading pricing action. And our plans going forward remain the same. We are sticking with our commitment to pricing. And we do expect inflation to return to the categories. We\u2019re launching the premium new products that we said we would, in the pharmacy channel, OrthoGard and PerioGard off to a good start; elmex just starting to ship right now. And Naturals in toothpaste and Personal Care moving to the marketplace. And of course, as we announced at Barclays and this applies globally, we have the relaunch of our scale core Total business beginning worldwide in the first quarter and for Brazil particularly where this is a 17 share business, it will have a favorable impact on growth going forward.","We, I must say, take on Brazil, a more guarded view than we have heard from others given the situation we see in our categories. But, if I would offer a glimmer of light, it is fair to say when we look at our category data, accessing the third quarter, the declines we saw were easing, which hopefully augurs well as we go forward.","China is a different set of circumstances. We remain positive on China. There is growth in the category, and our volume share of 34% has held constant over a good number of years. Our value share, slightly lower, represents the area of opportunity as we have spoken about, because there are two big things going on in China. Number one is the premiumization of categories, led by some of the local brands that we have spoken about; and the second is a very big change in consumption patterns and shopping environment with the explosion of e-commerce in the country.","Now, to respond to the premiumization of the category, as we have spoken about before, we have brought a premium price Naturals offering to the marketplace. We have done online initiatives like the Dare To Love toothpaste that did so well last year and will be repeated in 11\/11 and 12\/12 again this year. elmex, also moving online along with electric toothbrushes and a whitening -- in-home whitening offering for the country all at a premium price offering. But, as we told you in the second quarter, we have also taken meaningful pricing on over half of our business on both the Darlie brand and the Colgate brand. Given that with the premiumization of the category in addition to extending our portfolio into premium, we need to move our prices up from mid tier to the more premium tier. And in doing so, it impacted our volume. Now, we\u2019re beginning to see that pricing move through in the direct trade where it is already impacting our consumption, which is up. But, it yet has to move through the indirect trade, which is complicated by the change in consumption patterns in the Company -- in the country as I mentioned to you earlier. And we are working down inventory to realize that change through the longtail distribution network over time. That is not going to be fixed immediately, but it should get better from here.","Now, to come back to the areas we have been focusing on and the rest of our businesses. We do believe the areas that we have focused on are underpinning our consistent growth now in North America, notwithstanding some of the promotional pressures we have seen and you have seen on toothpaste in that country. Hill\u2019s is rebounding nicely from the troubles we had in prior year. And indeed that growth is led by a strong U.S. business. Europe is continuing to grow quite nicely in a low growth environment. Africa\/Eurasia now, having overcome our distributor problems, growing from multiple quarters, and India is seeing a slow volume and pricing, and our share performance beginning to improve behind the innovation and the advertising support.","And we do believe that consistent focus on advertising and innovation is underpinning those performances and will continue into the future. We are, again, I repeat focused on pricing going forward. And we do see pricing improving, even though we have perhaps begun slightly ahead of our competitors, we see that continuing going forward. And again, as we announced at Barclays, and this will be a big impact for the world, we will have that relaunch of our scale Total business starting in the first quarter of 2019.","So, those are the comments I wanted to make specific to Brazil and China, but also on the rest of our business. And I\u2019ll now turn it back to John.","John Faucher","Thanks, Ian.","Our net sales declined 3% in Q3 as flat volume and 1% favorable pricing were offset by 4% negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the benefit from our recently acquired professional skincare businesses EltaMD and PCA Skin, volume was down 1.5%, driven by the issues in China and Brazil that Ian discussed.","On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was down 100 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it was down 120 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, our 100 basis points of pricing provided a 50 basis-point benefit to gross margin. Raw material costs including the impact of foreign exchange transaction costs were 390 basis-point drag on gross margin year-over-year.","Our productivity program, led by our funding-the-growth initiative, provided a 220 basis-point benefits to gross margin, while there was no impact from other in the quarter. On an absolute basis, advertising investment was down year-over-year in Q3, driven by foreign exchange. On a percentage to sales basis, advertising was up 10 basis points year-over-year. Despite the challenges we faced in certain markets, we continue to invest in advertising our brands to drive brand equity and to build awareness to drive trial for our innovation.","Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, the remainder of our SG&A expenses were down year-over-year in Q3 on an absolute basis, but up as a percent of sales. Excluding the headwind from increased freight, logistics and warehousing costs, our overhead expenses were down in the quarter on an absolute basis and as a percent of sales as we continue to see benefits from a productivity program.","On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share of $0.60 were down 12% year-over-year in Q3. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and a provisional charge related to U.S. Tax Reform, diluted earnings per share were down 1% at $0.72 as we benefited from a lower tax rate.","Now, I\u2019ll take a quick run through the divisions. We\u2019ll start off with North America. Net sales in North America increased 8% in the quarter with our recent professional skincare acquisitions contributing 6%. The North America division posted its fourth straight quarter of organic sales growth with organic sales growth of 2% as we continue to see a nice combination of volume and pricing growth. We saw continued strength in unmeasured channels like e-commerce and club stores.","Year-to-date, our market shares are flat or up in 8 of our 12 categories in the United States with strong gains in manual toothbrushes, liquid hand soap and cleaners. The toothpaste category in the United States continues to see high levels of promotion, particularly through electric couponing, although we have maintained market leadership. As Ian discussed last quarter, we have made adjustments to our promotional plans in reaction to what we are seeing in the marketplace.","Latin America had a difficult Q3, driven by a combination of foreign exchange headwinds and category declines in Brazil. Latin American net sales declined 13% in the quarter as volume was down 6%, pricing was up 2.5% and foreign exchange was negative 9.5%. Our pricing improved in the quarter as we look to offset continued raw materials inflation, as well as the impact of transactional foreign exchange, given recent weakness in currencies like the Brazilian reals and the Argentinean peso.","Outside of Argentina, we generally have not seen similar pricing moves from some of our competitors. We will remain disciplined and rational in regards to pricing as we expect inflation to accelerate going forward. We delivered both volume and pricing growth in Mexico in the third quarter. Although, we continue to see heightened levels of promotion in several categories, particularly bar soap, dish soap and toothpaste.","Moving to Europe. Net sales in Europe were down 0.5% in Q3. Organic sales were up 0.5% with positive volume growth, partially offset by negative pricing. Foreign exchange was minus 1% for the quarter. The UK posted strong volume growth in the quarter, which led to market share gains in Q3. We are particularly pleased with the performance of our premium business in the UK as Colgate Total and Colgate Max White toothpaste continue to gain share. Our UK business should be further bolstered by the continued rollout of our Colgate Natural Extracts toothpaste line, including our latest offering of Charcoal plus White. Sanex continues to grow market share in the body wash category behind the Sanex Zero percent line as well as the Sanex physiologic line, which is bringing high-end premium priced pharma trends into the mass channel in what continues to be a difficult pricing environment in Europe.","Moving to Asia Pacific. Net sales in Asia Pacific were down 7.5% in the quarter, driven by volume declines and foreign exchange pipelines. As been discussed, inventory reductions in China was a biggest contributor to the weak performance.","We continue to be encouraged by the improvement in performance of our India business. We continue to deliver volume growth with positive pricing despite high levels of competitive activity. We are encouraged with the market share performance of our Swarna and Cibaca Vedshakti toothpaste lines. As we see further distribution gains and continue to invest in advertising, we expect our share in the Ayurvedic segment of the toothpaste category to continue to grow. We also launched a new herbal offering in Thailand this quarter, Colgate Naturals Panjaved, further expanding our portfolio in that country in the higher price Naturals segment.","In Africa\/Eurasia, positive pricing growth in Q3 was partially offset by slightly negative volume growth. Net sales in the Africa\/Eurasia division decreased 6%, primarily due to a high-single-digit negative impact from foreign exchange, driven by weakness in the Russian ruble in Turkish lira.","We took additional pricing in the quarter to help offset raw material inflation and foreign exchange transaction costs. We continue to be encouraged by the return to growth of our Sub-Saharan Africa business, which continues to improve following the distributor issues we dealt with in late 2016 and 2017.","Year-to-date, our toothpaste share is flat or up in 13 of 18 markets. And we are particularly pleased with our share performance in Turkey where the Colgate brand is closing in on the market leader.","And we\u2019ll finish up with Hill\u2019s. Hill\u2019s delivered 1.5% net sales growth in the quarter. Volume grew for the third straight quarter, driven by the United States, which also delivered strong pricing growth. We were further encouraged by a rebound to volume growth in emerging markets, despite some additional pricing we put in place over the past few quarters.","The U.S. continues to be led by the Prescription Diet business which has seen share growth in the vet channel as well as online. We\u2019re also seeing share gains in the Science Diet business, with our market shares in pet specialty continuing to improve year-over-year. To help continue the improved momentum on time Science Diet, Hill\u2019s was excited to sponsor NBCUniversal\u2019s fourth Clear The Shelters program, which is designed to boost pet adoption. This year has been the most successful ever with over 1,200 shelters participating and more than 100,000 pets adopted.","We also grew share gains with our Hill\u2019s Bioactive Recipe dog food, which uses Hill\u2019s knowledge of dog\u2019s biology and genes respond to select ingredients so that dogs can get the most out of their food.","Now, I will turn to our outlook for the balance of 2018. As stated in our press release, based on current spot rates, we expect net sales for the fourth quarter to be down low single digits due to foreign exchange with low single digit organic sales growth. We expect the additional pricing taken during the third quarter to flow through, and we expect less of an impact from destocking in the fourth quarter.","Based on current spot rates, for the full year, we expect gross margin to be down year-over-year on both the GAAP basis and excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. The continued increase in raw material costs including the impact of transactional foreign exchange will continue to pressure gross margin. We now expect that advertising will be flat on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales for the full-year versus 2017. This change is due to some of the macro headwinds in markets like Argentina as well as some divisional mix issues. However, the media portion of advertising is projected up on an absolute basis for the full-year versus 2017 as we continue to invest behind our brand. And within that, spending continues to shift from non-working media to working media, as we drive efficiencies within our marketing budget. ","On a GAAP basis, we still expect our tax rate to be between 26% and 27%. Excluding the impact from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, charges related to U.S. Tax Reform and the benefits from a foreign tax matter in 2018, we now expect our tax rate to be around 25% for the full year. Based on current spot rates, we expect GAAP earnings per share to be up double digit for the year. Excluding charges related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, charges related to U.S. Tax Reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018, we now expect earnings per share growth to be 3% to 4% for the year.","And with that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey. Good morning. So, Ian, as you mentioned in you remarks, you talked to us previously about the plan to drive improving top-line growth in terms of innovation, ad spend, e-commerce focus et cetera. And specifics of Brazil, China weakness were helpful this quarter. But, it feels like execution was, the changes you guys have made haven\u2019t sort of been enough in light of this changing landscape. So, I\u2019d love to hear sort of going forward from today how you manage the business differently. And, I\u2019m focused on two areas. A, execution wise, are there things you could do differently going forward to sort of stay ahead of the competition in this changing channel landscape more than you had previously? And B, do you think you might need at some point to reinvest significantly behind some of these areas and increase the level of spend to get the payback you desire from a top-line standpoint? Thanks. ","Ian Cook","Yes. Thanks for the question, Dara. I think in terms of the way we are advancing the business, we think we\u2019re focused on the right things. Innovation is clearly a way to reach today\u2019s consumers and tomorrow\u2019s consumers. And I think we have lots of examples of innovation that is connecting with those consumers. Interestingly, if we look at our market share data and household panel data we have, we see that our market shares with millennials are the same as our general market shares. In some geographies actually, they are higher and growing. So, we think innovation is a big part of what we need going forward.","And we have stepped into now changing the shape of our portfolio as part of that innovation. And that may be the transfer of a global brand to a new geography or a new retail channel, as we have described or indeed the development of a local brand, either in response to a competitor, like Vedshakti in India now transferred under a name pronounced so well by John into Thailand. And I think that will continue. And we\u2019ve also experimented as we talked about the last time with a lot of new leading edge innovation, which will find its place in the world one day.","We think advertising is an important piece of it. And we do believe in those geographies where we are now seeing a consistent rebound and correction from issues we faced earlier that it is the combination of the advertising and the innovation and indeed our go-to-market execution in the case of Hill\u2019s with e-commerce. So, that is making the difference and that is sustainable going forward.","And finally, I would say, in changing the shape of the portfolio, think about the addition of PCA and Elta to our Personal Care offerings, much more in the skin health area, much more linking to the recommendation model that we know so well from our oral and pet nutrition businesses. So, we think we have quite an array of freshness in what we are bringing to the consumer and are focused on the right areas in terms of where those consumers are making their purchasing decisions. And that will continue. And again, I would like to stress the journey undertaken to get to the relaunch of Total next year, which will be a big shift in a core business in our overall portfolio.","As regards for significant reinvestment, I think, given our commitment and our mindset towards growth, we certainly when we will give you our guidance on 2019, will reflect the stance that we have taken. But, I must say, our portfolio of activity coming into 2019, only of which Total is public right now is quite rich. And we will certainly invest at a level that we deem appropriate to drive the top-line of the Company, while making sure that we are taking the pricing and achieving the value necessary with the premiumization of our innovation to continue to build margin and offset commodity costs that we have certainly seen this year.","So, simple summary, Dara, I would say, we will do what is right to continue our focus on recovering growth momentum in next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Olivia Tong","Thanks. I just want to get a better understanding of why you expect organic sales to get better in Q4? First, is it coming more from developed or emerging markets? Because the developed markets comp, it does get a fair bit more difficult. But, I\u2019m also not entirely sure what\u2019s going to drive emerging markets better because broader expectations for China to slow down, so the retailer really destocking are actually managing to a new lower level. And in Brazil, you had mentioned the market volatility and that seems unlikely to abate as well. So, while you\u2019re spending more, it doesn\u2019t seem to have really driven much volume at this point, at least for this course. So, just if you elaborate on Q4 that would be great. Thank you.","Ian Cook","Thanks, Olivia. Lot of questions there. Now, of course, when you take pricing, depending on the competitive context, you often see volatility in volume. We have experienced that before. And I guess, the point we are articulating is that given the inflationary pressures, pricing will be necessary and we will continue to focus on that going forward. As to the fourth quarter, I mean John commented on it. We do expect to see less destocking, whether that is a China or Brazil. And that will of course be a factor. We do expect our developed market performance to continue, given we think the benefit of the innovation and the advertising driving that. And we see that continuing in the fourth quarter. So, I guess, in simple terms, it is improvement from where we are in the emerging and a continuation of the developed. In China specifically, we do believe it\u2019s destocking, not putting inventory to a new level. The category is still growing mid single digits in China. And although e-commerce generally, as other have said, has slowed in its compounding rate of growth as etailers take less inventory at the front end, it still continues to be a very high contributor to growth in China and other geographies.","Operator","Our next question is from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys. So, two questions. The first one is easy. And I\u2019m just wondering what Argentina pricing contributed to you, it\u2019s about 2% of sales I think; inflation, we\u2019ve heard 30% to 50%. So, is that the right number to think about? That\u2019s the numbers to think about? It feels like there\u2019s this kind of brewing Venezuela helping artificially your organic pricing a little bit. So, just want to kind of put that one to rest a little bit? And then, more broadly [technical difficulty]","Ian Cook","Ali, you disappeared.","Ali Dibadj","Hello. Can you hear me?","Ian Cook","You came back. You got to the second -- yes, I didn\u2019t hear anything on the second. So, start the second again.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. Thank you. Thank you for that. So, the second one is, very helpful commentary at the outset, Ian, about externalities and clearly some really tough ones around packaging costs and transportation costs, FX, destocking all the sort of stuff. And I agree with that that, some of your peers as well. But I am still struggling to find, accepting all those externalities, is there anything you know Colgate didn\u2019t do right? Is there anything, as you look introspectively that you said gosh, we just didn\u2019t do this right? Are there mistakes? Because the environment is tough, it is tough for everybody, and we\u2019re seeing market share losses still for you and a lot of things that are kind of different than some of your peers. So, I am trying to understand, as you look at yourself, what did you do wrong? Thank you. I hope you heard those.","Ian Cook","Yes, I did. I heard them very clearly. Thank you. So, Argentina, Argentina is not another Venezuela brewing. In Venezuela, as you well know Ali, you had an official exchange rate that was not the operating exchange rate. Argentina is a dollarized economy, and the exchange rate is the exchange rate and it will and is fixing itself. So, your stats are also wrong. Argentina last year was about 1% of our sales; those were the good old days. And the Argentina of today is more than half smaller than it was this time last year and is around 0.5% of our sales. So, basically, ex Argentina -- the Argentina contribution overall to our organic growth rounds to zero. But, I think the bigger answer to the question is, there is no issue brewing in Argentina. The exchange will take care of itself.","Secondly, thank you for the constructive nature of the second question and -- I mean in terms of recognizing some of the issues that indeed one does face. But if you singularly say, what would we be self-critical of, the answer would be not moving as quickly on premiumization as we would want to. And we are now, as you know, fully engaged in that. But that requires, as I described for China, a bold move beyond simply changing the portfolio to move the pricing of our core businesses, and that brings with it some challenges, which we will work through. But, that focus now on premiumization is very well understood and being acted upon with good urgency across businesses and across geographies. And as we said, at Barclays, when we come with the Total relaunch, that is a terrific new technology, which brings additional benefits to the consumer and is a rich opportunity to deliver value and create value going forward. So, I think that\u2019s the way I would respond, Ali. ","Operator","Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren Lieberman","Just reflecting on the fact that I think it\u2019s been around six years since you introduced Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And that -- one thing that I thought about that program was sort of expanding your productivity efforts pretty demonstrably beyond gross margin and into more SG&A. And so, over these ensuing six years, I know there\u2019s been macro dynamics, but top-line growth has also slowed, even as you were embarking on this broader productivity path. So, just thinking back on some of the savings that you\u2019ve been able to generate, the areas that you focused on. Are there things that maybe efficiencies had the wrong outcome, like maybe hubbing was detrimental in some way? I\u2019m just wondering in that, if it\u2019s purely coincidental, or as you look back at some of the areas where you\u2019ve tapped into savings over the last 5 or 6 years, if there\u2019s been sort of unintended repercussions from a growth standpoint? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Thanks Lauren for the questions. When we started on this journey, we were in typical Colgate fashion, a little bit conservative. The two drivers that set us on the journey. One was having the SAP enterprise-wide system that linked us across the world, which centers down the path of pushing more the administrative back office services in locations to service multiple geographies, because everybody would be connected by the same technology therefore have the visibility, and that would allow us to be cheaper and more efficient at the same time.","And those moves, they\u2019re never without their challenges in the implementation of them. But, we don\u2019t have any we believe structural difficulties with them once they\u2019re in place. And indeed what starts to happen is you see your way to bringing more services to those centers around the world. So, while we were cautious stepping into it, and we have built it up over the life of the plan, we think that was a correct decision, a good decision and one that is accruing benefit today and will too, for the future.","Now, hubbing, we were particularly sensitive to. Because of course, and this may be the implication of the question, we are really focused on winning on the ground as a company, and that requires agility and focus and capability on the ground. And we -- and the way we do our financials and the way we incentivize people, we have been very, very careful to maintain both the passion and the economics in terms of compensation, focused against that winning on the ground.","And when we started the hubbing, we did it with -- I think it was over a decade worth of experience in a couple of geographies, Nordic and Central America that we were building out from, where we had learned the pluses and the minuses. And what hubbing essentially allows you to do is yes, become more efficient, but it also allows you to have higher quality and higher cost talent on the strategic issues governing now multiple countries, while at the same time having adequate resources on the ground to manage what is managed on the ground, which is customers and consumers and brand building. And indeed, in some geographies, we have increased the resources we have on the ground to make sure we keep that contact with customers and consumers. So, I think from its inception, the thinking was sound, based on historical experience and learning. And of course, we have learned our way over the years, the program has been evolving, to make sure we executed a quite well. So, we think on both levels, this has been an appropriate and a wise choice for the Company.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you, and good morning. So, I wanted to go back to the competitive environment, so in particular in the U.S. and Europe. So, for the U.S., what are you seeing across competitors in terms of couponing for oral care, specifically some of your and other major categories in oral care? And for Europe, are you finally cycling some of this -- a couple -- several quarters of pricing, negative pricing. So, do you believe you can finally take some pricing now to hopefully flat and pricing into 2019 or do you believe consumers are still price sensitive there? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Well, thanks for the questions, Andrea. I think we\u2019ve been quite clear over the last couple of calls that we have seen elevated promotional activity, specifically in the United States. And as John commented this morning, with electronic couponing, as before, we have adjusted our plans for the balance of the year to be more competitive in that space. We obviously will be very attentive to what unfolds in the marketplace, going forward, as everybody I think now faces the commodity cost pressures that require some prudence in terms of pricing whether price increases or lower promotional activity. So, we haven\u2019t seen any change yet but we will be attentive. ","From the European point of view, Europe has always been quite a challenged environment from a pricing point of view, and that has continued for several years. It is not a new phenomenon in Europe. And some of that has led to tensions with customers over the years. And we believe now we have our European business well-positioned in that European context. And as you intimate, obviously, our pricing negative was improving in the third quarter. And clearly, we will be very attentive to try and make sure, we can continue that trend as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead","Bonnie Herzog","I had a question on growth. You described this morning the slow category growth and you\u2019ve mentioned this on the past few calls. But, I guess I\u2019d like to understand, if category growth has in fact been getting worse. Have you noticed any change in the rate of growth versus Q2 or even 1H? And then, given the slow category growth, have you seen any change in the competitive environment in either the U.S. or emerging markets? And just like to hear if the promotional environment is rationale. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Thanks, Bonnie. If we look at our categories generally, I think one would say, if you take a global snapshot, Europe is flat to modestly up. The U.S. is probably between 2 and 3, if you include all channels. That is certainly an improvement from recent history. Latin America is choppy, given the economic volatility there. And as we discussed earlier in Brazil in particular, there has been, as the years has unfolded, a definite slowdown in categories, both value and volume, moving to negative in the third quarter as we said. And in the Africa\/Eurasia and Asia parts of the world, I think that mid-single-digit you 4% to 6% category growth continues to be the case.","I will say that -- and John talked about it this morning, that in Latin America, we have seen pockets of elevated promotional activity. I intimated to it when I talked about pricing that some competitors take advantage of a leader pricing to perhaps grab a little bit of volume in the short term. But, I think our assessment that inflation will is and will continue to come back; and secondly, the underlying foreign exchange and commodity cost pressures will demand that competitors and particularly the Latin geographies will need to take pricing to offset those headwinds, and that would be our thinking going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Two questions. So much of your commentary, Ian, is kind of what\u2019s wrong in the marketplace, what\u2019s changing with consumers et cetera, et cetera, and how difficult the external environment is. But I\u2019m just shocked by your market share performance. I mean, the number that you give, it\u2019s your own data for the oral care category, it\u2019s just so bad. And I just don\u2019t remember time it\u2019s ever been so bad. I mean year-to-date, last year this time, it was 43.5 in toothpaste; now, it\u2019s 41.9. I just don\u2019t understand why maybe that isn\u2019t more alarming to you because that doesn\u2019t strike me as it is an external issue. It seems to me very much this is an internal issue. So, I\u2019m surprised you are more kind of grabbing the bulls by the horns and saying holy crap, excuse me, holy moly, our market shares stink. So, that\u2019s question number one.","And then, question number two is, I mean I listened to the webcast when you were at Barclays and I thought you pretty clearly said you had your arms around the issues in Brazil, you had your arms around the issues in China. I thought you sounded pretty upbeat. And so, I guess my question is, did I misunderstand that, were you telegraphing that the third quarter was going to be a big miss to consensus expectations or did this come as a surprise to you at the end of the quarter? That\u2019s it. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Okay. Yes. Well, I guess, I\u2019m not surprised you\u2019re shocked. I\u2019m surprised, you\u2019re surprised by my reaction. Let me come back to the market shares. The share you see there on a roll-up basis, the 41.9, on a year-on-year basis is down something like 130 basis points. The challenge with that Wendy, and it\u2019s been a challenge for, frankly, over the last five years is that there is an enormous foreign exchange component in that. And as the U.S. dollar strengthens, our extremely strong, for example, Latin American market shares become down-weighted, as part of that mix. So, there is a foreign exchange mix effect and indeed year-on-year our market share is in fact down less than half of that 1.3.","Secondly, our volume share is down again, less than half our volume share decline is about 0.3 on a comparable year-to-date basis. And indeed, from a volume point of view, 1 in 2 toothpaste tubes sold are under Colgate ownership around the world. Now that said, are we happy with any share deterioration? Answer, no, we are not. But, we have said a few things. Number one, that in some parts of the world, I think Mexico, we quoted up one-time earlier this year, when promotional activity, the point is being cash margin dilutive, we will not match. And when you don\u2019t match, you lose market share. The same in the United States. And in Asia, it was a different matter.","In Asia, it was local brands that we have had to meet. And recovering against those local brands is taking sometime. But, we are encouraged by the progress in India. And if I look at some of our major markets now around the world as the year unfolds, John mentioned the UK back to positive share; we are seeing positive share progression in Russia. We\u2019re seeing recent shares up in Mexico. Because now the innovation that we are bringing, the consistent support of the advertising, frankly having to match some of the promotions to a certain extent are seeing us build back shares where we have been under share pressure. We are absolutely focused on that. And I don\u2019t know what else to say other than I take the point, we understand the point, we are all over the point country-by-country, tracking it literally month-by-month and much to the pleasure o some week-by-week, depending on the geography. And we think again that the relaunch of Total at the beginning of next year and all of the oral care activity, we have behind that is another step in maintaining that focus. So, I will promise to be more excitable when I talk about market share in the future.","As for Boston, yes, you didn\u2019t hear right. And, maybe one needs to be a lot more emphatic in the delivery, but we were quite clear we thought in signaling. It was on the slides that foreign exchange was going to be a big headwind and that commodities were indeed ramping up aggressively, obviously influenced by the foreign exchange impact of transaction costs. So, my answer to your second part of the question is I guess I\u2019m surprised, you missed that.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","Hey. Good morning, folks. I\u2019m going to stay on the topic of market share, bring it -- zooming in a little bit more myopic in just one region. I think, you upfront for the discourse and discussion on what\u2019s going on in Brazil, what\u2019s going on in China? Europe was a bit of a surprise to me this quarter. I know that the headline numbers look fine but Brazil headline numbers looked fine earlier this year too, and we saw how it eroded fairly quickly. In your 10-Quarter, you\u2019ve highlighted Europe as a source of market share strength with gains throughout the first half of the year. Now, the year-to-date trajectory has stated to flat, suggesting you\u2019ve actually flipped into some market share donation in the third quarter. Can you delve into the little bit more and tell us? Clearly UK has pocket of strength; where are these pockets of weakness that have begun to weigh in your market share there?","Ian Cook","It\u2019s a simple answer, Jason. It\u2019s predominantly Germany. And again, without going into too much detail, it is customer related. And again, if I were going to focus on the period shares, the most recent period is beginning to return. It\u2019s as simple as that.","Operator","Our next question is from Caroline Levy Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Caroline Levy","Thank you. And still good morning. Just a question on the cost side. I think that you mentioned that you expect similar cost pressures in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about any hedging strategies you have on costs, particularly in emerging markets? Which particular items are the issue? Is it PET or is it -- not PET but oil related, is it transports? Just a little more detail as to how long do you think this could go on?","Ian Cook","Yes. Thanks Caroline. For the third quarter, the commodity costs were up just over 8% and our logistics costs were up just over 5%. And yes, you heard correctly, we expect that to continue. And frankly, foreign exchange could be more negative for the balance of the year and that would see transaction pressure on costs as well. So, we do expect the cost pressure for the balance of this year to continue.","Yes. There is of course the effect of those materials that start life as oil. And we are seeing that as others are. Hedging, we tend to be light on hedging. Many of the raw materials we buy in categories where you can hedge, and we do hedge our Hill\u2019s business, materials against the formula on a rotational basis. But for most of the rest, we rely on our ability to price when we need to as the only logical and available offset to cost pressures.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Stephen Powers","Hey, thanks. So, I guess, maybe trying to tie a number of things that are running through my head together. I guess, last quarter, we talked a lot about the sense of urgency that\u2019s been underpinning the recent initiatives. I think you did a good job at the time communicating that sense of urgency and distinguishing it from panic because that was the word you used. But at the same time, I think we\u2019re now at least eight quarters into what has seemingly been a pattern of organic growth and gross margin pressures. So, I guess, the question is, if we strip away the macro challenges, which I acknowledge are severe, but is the message underneath at all that from here, you think Colgate needs to be more urgent, or is there a risk that recent urgency whether it\u2019s the push into e-commerce, the catch-up on premiumization et cetera. Could actually be compounding your problems? And I guess, if it\u2019s not compounding your problems, is there anything incremental in your power to truly fast-track improvement, acknowledging the total relaunch et cetera. But, is there anything significant in your power or is it more just the question of basic block and tackling over time, hopefully with a bit of macro relief? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Wow, that\u2019s a very deep and philosophical question, Steve. It is -- one has to be careful about the language one uses, I think. I can remember and I have mentioned this before, there was a time when we were under pressure in a particular geography. I won\u2019t go into the specific details, but our first reaction was, we\u2019re not panicking, we\u2019re staying calm, and the market read that as you\u2019re not taking it seriously. And the next time one responded, one said boy, we\u2019re really focused on this and we\u2019re going to meet on the beaches. And the market reaction was well now you\u2019re panicking, does that mean we should be worried about something else?","So, I think my answer, Steve would be, and again this combination of innovation and advertising, which is the heart of building brands and capabilities and going where the consumers are shopping to make those brands and that portfolio available to them is where we need to be focused. And we need to do everything in our power, and we truly are to accelerate the return we get from that focus. And I\u2019m afraid, sometimes it\u2019s not as quick as people would want; it\u2019s not as quick as we would want sometimes. But, I do think in the end, building the brand, so sustainable fix is the right way to go about it. And if we find ways of expanding our portfolio as we did with PCA and Elta that is on strategy, we clearly will bring that to bear.","So, I would say a heck of a lot of internal urgency but linked to that urgency is focus, focus on what we believe to be the right things category-by-category, geography-by-geography, store-by-store, etailer-by-etailer. And again, I think the total relunch in the first quarter of next year is a very important part of our oral care business, will be a meaningful step under our control developed over many years to advance that business and with it, the company.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kevin Grundy","Question, Ian, I wanted to pivot to the U.S. pricing environment. Proctor said, they\u2019re much more optimistic on its ability to take price. And at high level, Proctor indicated U.S. retailers are now more receptive to pricing across categories. And that certainly wasn\u2019t the narrative among investors earlier in the year. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, which called into question brand strength and economic, most of these businesses, et cetera. And Proctor also indicated plan to take price in oral care. So, the first part, can you comment on how you see the pricing environment shaping up across categories? Do you share Proctor\u2019s view that there is a much broader receptivity to pricing, it did not exist even a quarter or two ago, do you plan to follow Proctor\u2019s pricing in oral care? Maybe talk a little bit about opportunities take pricing elsewhere. Is it more conducive now as it seems to be? And then, lastly, I don\u2019t expect you to guide, Ian, but margins down in North America 200 basis points year-to-date or something close to it. Should we expect to see margins improve looking out the next year in North America? So, thanks for all that.","Ian Cook","Thanks very much, Kevin. I guess, as far as one can responsibly go on a call like this, which is a public call, I think a fair way to answer it is, I think it is fair to say that everybody in the industry understands that there are cost pressures. And all players in the industry are going to have to find ways that are consistent with their strategy and their relationships with their retail partners to do that. And that can be a combination of a lot of things from efficiency, to revised promotional calendars, to premium innovation, to different promotional activity. And yes, indeed, to a price increase.","And we obviously partner very closely with our key retailers here in United States. And we are very attentive in working with them to bring value to consumers that they see and they think it\u2019s good value to pay for. And that\u2019s what drives our thinking in this space including the total relaunch coming next year. And I think we were one of the ones earlier than many, saying this commodity cost trend was real and the industry would need to be responsive. So, you can rest assured we will be both attentive and responsive.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Bill Chappell","Two hopefully quick ones. One on China. The destock seems pretty identical to what happened last year. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand, is this kind of the way you see it going forward with e-commerce growing that we\u2019re going to have kind of a one destock per year, that\u2019s going to affect a given quarter. And then, the second, on Total, on the relaunch. Should we be thinking -- I know you\u2019re not giving guidance, but thinking about kind of a frontend loaded and a stepped up marketing and advertising spend behind that, or is that fairly kind of normal within the kind of normal plans in terms of the launch?","Ian Cook","I think on China, a good question, Bill. No, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking about a once a year destock in China. I think, the emergence of online created turbulence and destocking and has now complicated the distribution channels in China, particularly the indirect distribution channels. Because candidly, some of the online players now have distribution systems themselves. So, retailers in the chain can buy from four or five different sources, which is very different than when the e-commerce phenomenon began in China last year. So, it\u2019s a different impact now, really driven by us taking pricing now into a more complicated distribution structure and needing the pricing to equivalize and work its way through the system before we can get the new pricing on shelf with indirect customers. So, that\u2019s a very different reason for the destocking. And as I said, this one is going to take a little bit of time in that indirect trade. But we expect it to get better from here.","And when we talked about Total being the first quarter of next year, the way we signaled it at Barclays, Bill, was that the global rollout of this activity would begin in the first quarter of next year. So, that doesn\u2019t say that all of the activity is happening in the first quarter. But yes, of course, when we do bring such an important initiative with such technology and greater value, we will be investing very diligently to make sure all stakeholders are aware of and get a chance to try the product.","Operator","And our final question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Mark Astrachan","Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I\u2019m going to try to ask the appropriate level of spend question in a different way. So, if we fast forward to 2019, I know you are not going to comment on sales guidance, but unless you say business accelerate towards even the low end of long-term target next year and if you extrapolate to your trends, perhaps that\u2019s where you end up. So, if you get there, given the period share loss you had or issues had in certain key markets, how would you think about the appropriate level of spend? I mean, what does that mean to you? Are you more likely to want to protect the share that you\u2019ve started to see improvement upon? Are you likely to think about things in a different way from an overall advertising spend. So, not necessarily that you need to rebase to get back to growth. But, let\u2019s just say, you do get back to growth, how do you feel about protecting that relative to where you\u2019ve come from?","Ian Cook","Yes. Very good question, Mark. Look, we think about it, and what we\u2019ve been trying to telegraph is that advertising builds brands over time. And so, our thinking from a growth point of view is to continue to support our equities and the core and base businesses behind those equities, and of course, build the awareness to generate trial of innovation. So, we will be deploying advertising, our thinking, we haven\u2019t yet begun our budgeting process to what we can measure and regard as effective levels to do the job of maintaining the strength of the underlying equity and building awareness and trial for new products, including the shift to digital and not forgetting commitment to the consumption building programs that we have in the emerging markets, which deliver benefit over a longer period of time. So that\u2019s the way we tend to think about it. And I would venture to say, as we work our way through our budgeting process that will be the way we will think about it for 2019.","So, thanks everybody for your questions. And I wish a good rest of the day. And we look forward to catching up with you the early part of next year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call.

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. These statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance.","Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements. So for information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement on forward-looking statements.","The conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Please go ahead, Bina.","Delia H. Thompson","Thanks, Rochelle, and good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2014 earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","And we're pleased to have reported another quarter of solid organic sales growth. As we all know, business conditions around the world are challenging. We, as others, have seen slowing growth in the emerging markets and continued heightened competitive activity in the developed markets.","And the dollar has continued to strengthen in the face of economic uncertainty worldwide. And any economic recovery in the developed markets is muted and tentative at best. However, we think, our focused strategies still serve us well and are well-understood by all our people who are intent on winning on the ground.","Innovation is as important as ever and you'll hear not only how new products have helped increase market shares but about more new products slated for the balance of the year.","While a strong dollar along with higher material prices has resulted in a modest growth margin decline in the quarter, we continue to believe we will see gross margin expansion over the long term. Our Funding the Growth program is as robust as ever and is expected to deliver full year savings at or above our goal. And while our reported advertising is down as a percent of sales, if you look at the total bucket of commercial spend, it is up both absolutely and as a percent of sales, as impactful and trial-generating in-store activities have supported our robust new product activity.","Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is proceeding smoothly, and as you saw in this morning's press release, we've expanded the program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities, which we expect will begin to be realized towards the end of 2015 or early 2016.","And we're seeing some encouraging trends in the markets of China and Brazil. While both these regions declined for the third quarter as a whole, we saw a reversal toward the end of the quarter, which we believe should bode well going forward.","So as I said, a challenging environment, but we think we're well-positioned to meet these challenges going forward. So turning then to North America.","Organic sales growth accelerated in North America from the second quarter and market shares are solid. Our excellent performance in manual toothbrushes was highlighted in the press release. One of the drivers was Colgate Optic White Toothbrush and Built-In Whitening Pen. This new product has generated good trial and strong repeat rates, ahead of not only our Colgate Optic White manual toothbrush but a competing brush as well.","In the quarter, another significant launch was Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste and Colgate 360\u00b0 Enamel Health toothbrush. While it's early days, results of the toothpaste have been very good. Our national share at the end of September was over 2%, and this result exceeded both historical competitive launches, as well as competitive launches in the third quarter. Importantly, the launch has added incremental share.","Our overall U.S. toothpaste share is now 35.8% for the past 4 weeks, up 1 full point versus the year-ago period. This 35.8% share is also ahead of our year-to-date share of 35%.","Since the second quarter, consumption growth has been ahead of category growth. In fact, for the past 4 weeks, consumption was up 7.6% versus the category growth of around 2.5%. A relaunch of our Colgate Total Advanced Whitening toothpaste has been accompanied by the launch of Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash to take advantage of the power of a complete regimen. Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash has an innovative formula that helps remineralize tooth enamel, prevent stains and fight tartar and has no burn of alcohol. Our overall mouthwash share in the U.S. is now at 6.5% year-to-date, up 120 basis points. To continue this momentum, we're launching Colgate Kids mouthwash. This is an opportunity to reinvigorate the kids mouthwash segment with a brand mothers trust. Distribution of the product is building at key retailers as we speak.","Of note also is our share in fabric conditioners. The Suavitel brand is, as you know, largely sold in Hispanic markets and has now reached a record 18% share of the general market year-to-date, up 130 basis points. Innovations such as Suavitel Fast Dry has contributed to this success.","Turning then to Europe\/South Pacific. This region delivered solid results. Organic sales have increased every quarter this year and this despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures. Innovation continues to be an important driver of our performance. As you know, 1 of the key elements in our global growth and efficiency program is the formation of hubs, and much of the hubbing to date has occurred in Europe. As of July, all European hubs have been implemented. Central Europe West, Central Europe East, Southern Europe, U.K., Nordic and Western Europe. These streamlined operations should further position us to effectively win on the ground.","Our oral care market shares are strong. In toothpaste, our regional share is at 35.3% year-to-date, up almost a full point from the year-ago period, with the most recent reading at 35.4%. The results were broad-based with increases in virtually every hub. Our regional manual toothbrush shares are up a full point year-to-date to 23.5%, with the most recent reading at 23.8%. Mouthwash is at 17.9% year-to-date, up from 17.8% in the year-ago period.","Our Sanex business is also performing well across its categories, with share increases in body wash, liquid hand soap, bar soap and underarm protection. This year, we relaunched our Sanex body wash, which contains the advanced Dermo Active 3 complex to deliver the 3 key benefits to keep skin healthy, protection, deep moisturization and pH balance. This has helped to strengthen Sanex's credentials in moisturization, and elevate the product's quality perception.","We talked last quarter about the rollout of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer, hereafter to be referred to as Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. And that has continued with the launch of the product in France in September. Italy is scheduled for October, and Central Europe East for November to complete the rollout. A notable performance is in the U.K., where the market share is almost 4% in the latest period. Also in the U.K., we entered the electric toothbrush market 2 years ago. The initial offering, the Colgate ProClinical C350, was at the higher priced end of the market. So this month, we're launching a lower priced version, Colgate ProClinical C250. Around 75% of the market is priced at this price point, so this launch should make us more competitive in the marketplace.","Turning then to Latin America. Business is strong across the region and, as referenced in the press release, we continue to maintain strong leadership positions in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. As elsewhere, the regional rollout of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection is meeting with success. In Brazil, where it has been in market for about 1 year, it has achieved a 2.2% share year-to-date. In Mexico, where it was more recently launched in April, it's achieved a year-to-date share of 1%, with the most recent period at almost 2 points. The product has now been launched in virtually every country, with only Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and the Caribbean region remaining.","Other toothpaste innovations, such as Colgate Total Breath Health and Colgate Luminous White Instant, which we described to you last quarter, are also being rolled out throughout the region. Compelling innovation in manual toothbrushes has resulted in record high leading shares in Brazil, Chile, Puerto Rico, Uruguay and Paraguay.","In bar soaps, our market share is up 40 basis points to almost 30% year-to-date. Across the region, Protex and Palmolive hold the #1 and #2 positions, respectively. A steady stream of innovation in this category has helped increase market shares. A recent relaunch is Palmolive Naturals Daily Exfoliation with oats and brown sugar. Consumers know that it is important to exfoliate the skin. Its formula with brown sugar and natural oats provides a gentle exfoliation for beautiful and smooth skin.","Turning then to Asia. As noted earlier, we've experienced slowing category growth in inventory correction in China, which has affected overall growth despite a very strong performance in other markets. However, this situation appears to be improving, as we said it would on our last call. Despite the external challenges, we've continued with our innovation program. As elsewhere, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste is meeting with success. Launched in Malaysia in February of this year, it has now reached almost 4 full share points in the most recent period and has added incremental share. Our toothpaste share is now at 73.5% year-to-date.","In India, where our share is up 30 basis points to 54.6% year-to-date, our May launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste has already achieved almost half a share point in the most recent period. And across the region, our manual toothbrush share is up 50 basis points to 30.4% year-to-date. In India, our key brand, Colgate Super Flexi, has driven the overall toothbrush share up 210 basis points to 43.7% year-to-date, with the most recent share at 43.9%, consolidating our leading position. And in mouthwash, our regional share is up 140 basis points to almost 22% year-to-date.","Looking forward, we have more innovation to come. One interesting new product planned for launch in China in the fourth quarter is Colgate 360\u00b0 Gold Charcoal toothbrush. As you know, some consumers are very interested in charcoal as an ingredient, but a new trend, which has also emerged with the Chinese consumer is gold. This toothbrush in addition to having gold-colored bristles and charcoal-infused bristles will also have an antibacterial component within the bristles. And in addition, the product should be very impactful on the shelf with its black and gold packaging.","Also in the region, we're very excited about our recent acquisition in Myanmar of the laser toothpaste business. Together with Colgate's 20% share, the added 35% share of laser gives us a strong leadership position in this rapidly evolving country.","Turning then to Africa\/Eurasia. Business remains healthy in this part of the world and we were particularly pleased with the solid volume growth in both Russia and the Ukraine, despite all the political turmoil in that part of the world. Regional toothpaste shares year-to-date are at 32% even with the year-ago period, but our most recent reading is 32.3% and we see good momentum building behind our continued stream of innovation.","Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste launched in South Africa a year ago, is just the beginning to be rolled out throughout the rest of the region. And in toothbrushes, we've had excellent results in the South Africa where the share is up 3 points to 37.7% year-to-date, with the most recent read at 38.3%.","Similarly, in Turkey, where our year-to-date share is 28.4%, we've seen share momentum in the 2 most recent periods, which share reads of 28.9% for May-June, and 30.5% for July-August. Our regional mouthwash share is up 50 basis points to just over 20% year-to-date, positioning us as the #2 mouthwash brand across Africa\/Eurasia.","In Russia, we continue to benefit from the launch earlier this year of Colgate Plax Altai Herbs. Our share is up 220 basis points to 27.7% year-to-date.","Results for the shower gel category is strong, fueled by our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line. Our year-to-date share is at 22%, up 160 basis points, with almost every country contributing to the positive share and momentum.","As elsewhere around the world, innovation will continue. Colgate Total Pro Whitening toothpaste, which provides 12-hour protection for a healthier mouth and whiter teeth, now selling in Russia, Ukraine and Turkey, will be rolled out to additional countries in the region in the fourth quarter and next year. Another pan-regional launch starting this quarter will be Colgate Total Mouthwash, which should help build on our already strong mouthwash business.","And in the personal care category, we'll extend our very successful Palmolive Gourmet Spa shower gel line into liquid hand soap.","Finally, Hill's. The Hill's business is solid as new product activity across our brands has delivered good results. Hill's Ideal Balance is now selling virtually everywhere in the world. Here in the U.S., both the dog and cat wet and dry products have been well-supported by the super stores. In those channels in the quarter, consumption of Hill's Ideal Balance was up almost 40% versus the year ago period. The launch is going well in Europe as well and is being supported by a fully integrated marketing campaign.","Our Hill's Science Diet business in the U.S. is being supported by a Healthier Pet, Happier Lives national campaign, which is focused on preventative care to drive our new Life Care portfolio of diets. For the year-to-date period, our consumption is up 15% in our 2 largest retailers.","In the weight category, both the Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic line and the Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight line are doing well. And next quarter, we will be adding a new variant, Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight for small and toy breed dogs, the fastest-growing pet population.","The recent global launch of Hill's Prescription Diet CD Multicare Urinary Stress feline, supported by an extensive sampling program and in-clinic feeding trials is also helping drive Hill's therapeutic business. And finally, we're really excited about our latest innovation, Hill's Ideal Balance Crafted, expected to launch next quarter. Capitalizing on the growing trend of the humanization of pets, this superpremium price product offers authentic ingredients prepared the right way with care and is crafted in smaller batches to help lock in the flavor. The unique ingredients such as salmon, fresh vegetable, chickpeas, buckwheat, shroud and herbs are customized for dogs and cats. The compelling packaging reinforces the product's attributes.","So in summary, we're pleased that our businesses continue to grow our around the world. Our focused strategies are serving us well. Our new product pipeline is as full as ever, and a broad array of new products launched globally have helped increase our leadership shares in many markets. We are providing our Colgate leaders worldwide with the tools to keep winning on the ground.","We look forward to sharing our results with you as we move to the end of the year. And now, Rochelle, we'll turn it over to questions, if we could, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So first, just a clarity question. What level of organic sales growth and FX impact is implied in your 2015 earnings guidance? And the real question is, Brazil and China, clearly weak in the quarter. Obviously, Bina highlighted that trends improved at the end of the quarter but we had heard some hope. I think, last quarter the Q3 trends would improve, which didn't play out as much. So I just was hoping for a bit of a state of the union on what's causing pressure in Brazil and China, if those factors kind of linger going forward and how much visibility you have here that your business has bottomed in those markets?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, thanks, Dara. Well, let me take a little bit of a step back on the world and our categories and include China and Brazil in those comments and then take you forward to 2015. Let me start with the developed world where, I guess, we have been saying for a time that our category growth rates are in the 1% to 2% range, with Europe being at the lower end of that range and the U.S. now creeping up to the higher end of that range and that hasn't really changed. When you then turn to the emerging markets, as we have said on the last couple of calls, we came into the year from a 2013 where the growth rates were between 6% and 8% and said that the growth rates were now likely to be between 5% and 7%. And on the last call, we said that those growth rates had decelerated to the lower end of that range. And what we have seen is that during the third quarter, that has continued to be the case. In other words, those headwinds have not reversed. Now very specific to China, on the last call, we described and explained how the combination of the deceleration in consumer consumption led to a destocking of the extended distribution system in China through distributors and wholesalers and that we thought that would correct itself in response to a question, if I recall, within 60 to 90 days. And somebody said, well, does that mean the China business will come back from a Colgate volume point of view towards the end of the third quarter? Now many of us have just come back from an extended trip to Asia and I'm pleased to say that is precisely what has happened. In other words, while China for the quarter remains modestly negative, what we saw in terms of independent offtake data is consumption at about mid-single digits and the destocking working itself through the system. So as we finished the quarter, our volume was now servicing again that mid-single-digit rate of consumption. And at this point, we would say we expect that to continue. Brazil is China redux except a little bit later. I think, frankly, we were planning for a recovery following the World Cup and that didn't occur. The category growth rates repeated what we saw in China. And the inventory destocking also compounded against that reduced consumer consumption level. And again, as Bina has said, we have begun to see that come back in Brazil, with the category growth rates now in the mid-single digits. But it started a little bit later in Brazil. So it will be a little bit into the fourth quarter before it fully comes back. Pleasingly, in both cases, the consumption, which is to say what consumers are buying, continues to be at that mid-single-digit level. So for 2014, we think it prudent to say, with all of that in the mix, that our view on organic top line growth is now broader. We're saying between 4% and 7% for the year because we think that's prudent. And as we said on the release, we really have just started our 2015 budgeting process. But based on the information we have today, we think it would be prudent to likewise say that our organic growth range for 2015 will be in that 4% to 7% range.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, Ian, taking that 2015 commentary to EPS, it sounds like, based on where spot rates are today, I think, your '15 EPS preliminary outlook sounds like it would imply your healthy double digit EPS growth into 2015. And I guess, correct that if it's wrong, and if it's not, can you just talk about why you feel that level of confidence, especially with some of the macro trends that are going on out there?","Ian M. Cook","Well, in fact, Chris, thanks for the question, the EPS growth rate for next year, we have tried to be quite specific in guiding to mid to high single digits in dollar terms, not double digits. And that reflects the recent foreign exchange deterioration which, as you know, was very sharp and towards the end of the third quarter and when one goes through the various investor notes that have been written about the business, many people have come to a like conclusion in terms of what they see dollar EPS growth being. So as we said in the release, we're expecting another year of growth. And having been asked the question, we would frame it as 4% to 7% organic. We talk about expansion of the gross margin. And as we go through our budget process, you would imagine that our target continues to be that 50 to 100 basis point expansion and mid to high-single digit EPS growth in dollar terms. And that's the way we're framing and approaching 2015.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit more about the non-China markets in Asia because -- I mean, if I'm not mistaken, I think, China's only kind of like 20%, 25% of that region, and for the overall organic sales growth to be up only 1%, it still sounds like there's real weakness in the other markets. I know you called out India as being strong actually. So what else is dragging down the numbers, is it the Philippines or Malaysia, like what else is big enough to move the needle there?","Ian M. Cook","That part of the world is heavily influenced by China and India. And when Bina said India was strong, India was strong. And the Southeast Asian countries generally performed very, very well during the quarter. So it really is China and the correction of that Chinese business back to, I stress, this underlying mid-single-digit consumption rate for consumers.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Again, a couple of questions on what's going on in a few markets. Let's pick up where you left of on the last one on India. India is strong. I guess, the question is what's strong in India? When we look at some of the Nielsen data out of India, it shows volume decelerating throughout the quarter. At least into July, August now reaching almost down 6% for the category for toothpaste specifically. So I guess, where is the offset or is it just potentially a problem with the data? And then, secondly, we've heard Nestle, we've heard Unilever talk about some of the pricing problems or challenges throughout Europe. You've got another quarter reported here of negative price and promotion. So maybe you can comment a little bit more on what you're seeing in terms of the competitive dynamics and pricing environment throughout Europe?","Ian M. Cook","Well, let's take India first. Without getting into specifics, we have seen consistent double-digit growth in India every quarter this year. We continue to build their market share on toothpaste and on toothbrushes, our leadership market shares. I would also add by the way, with that independent study that happens every year in India, for the fourth straight year, Colgate was voted the most trusted brand in any category in India, which gives you a sense of the consumer loyalty and affection for the brand. One thing we've been doing for a while in India is expanding the strength of our distribution in the rural areas. And I would venture to say, Jason, that when you start getting to that level of distribution without in any way impugning Nielsen or other data sources, the quality of the data becomes perhaps a little bit suspect. In Europe, actually, we were pleased with Europe. There is no question that pricing has become, for some retailer, in some cases, competitor, and other, an approach, a tactic, I guess, to try and build overall growth. So we were pleased to see the volume growth we had in Europe and indeed the modest organic growth along with good-sized margin -- gross margin expansion delivering goods financial results there. And as Bina said in her comments, and I think we have taken this view for some time now in Europe, I think, we are clear-eyed about the growth rates that can be expected there and we have put an extraordinary focus on reorganizing our European business to make it structurally efficient against a flat line growth rate. And I think, we're seeing the benefits of that. And we're also seeing market shares improve, as Bina mentioned in her prepared remarks. So this hubbing that we have moved to in Europe is working very well for us against 1 of the objectives we had, which was to strengthen our executional capability on the ground.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just talk about the Colgate Total growth in the quarter and if this triclosan nonsense is done? And then, I do have a follow-up.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, it was done, Bill, until you raised it.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","No one listens to me I promise.","Ian M. Cook","The share is flat. You may have seen Javier's [ph] note where they ran an independent survey, I think, with 2,500 people, which basically suggested that the awareness was vanishingly low. In fact, lower than other ingredients in toothpaste products. And obviously, as you would imagine, we have like tracking data which shows the same thing. So it is a non-issue. Your follow on?","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Ian, I just wanted to ask you, is the destocking all done globally now? And do you think the U.S. is like really pulling out? Some of the data points, it seemed like the U.S. is really starting to accelerate in the last month or so.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, let's not get too excited. I think, the U.S. is showing modest acceleration. But these things have tended to be lumpy. But I tried to imply that in my remark on category growth that we are indeed seeing the U.S. upshift towards the higher end of that 2% range. On the destocking, given the vastness of the 2 geographies and the indirect nature of the distribution, China, which we talked about in the second quarter, we believe on the data we see is done, was done by the end of the third quarter. Brazil is on the way to being done and that will be completed during the fourth quarter. There are no other spots of destocking.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I want to get a better sense of why you believe that you can go back to double-digit dollar base earnings growth long term, because you haven't done in the past 5 years or so, including this year. And I guess, another way to ask the question is what do you need to get back to that target? And if your answer is macro and FX, then how should we all think about your level of defensiveness and indeed the whole industry's level of defensiveness and macro insensitivity versus history?","Ian M. Cook","Wow. I haven't finished Picasso's book yet so I'm not sure how to answer the question. I think, Ali, the way to think about it perhaps would be on a relative basis. I mean, I think, for the last several years, we have seen things happening in our world that have been truly unusual and volatile events. Many of them having implications both in terms of consumer purchasing behavior and fundamentally foreign exchange, as people run from risk to perceived safety and they impact companies severely in the short term. So while we return to a better macro environment and a more stable foreign exchange environment, I guess, the way to think about it is on a relative basis.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Going back to China and Brazil, I guess, one question on China and Brazil and then sort of an unrelated question, if you'll entertain it, on Venezuela. First on, just on the volume declines in China and Brazil, are you able to parse out at all how much of those declines were true unit declines versus negative mix and trade down, because I can see how the unit volumes could reaccelerate substantially and sustainably with inventory rebalancing but a trading down trend or less trade-up anyway might be harder to overcome without macro relief. And then, on Venezuela, it would seem that you're now running the risk of operating at a loss, maybe a material loss in that market with this latest devaluation. Although I know, in your Q, you've got some price relief that's come through, which is good. So I'm trying to balancing those 2 things out. Will Venezuela now be running at a loss? And if so, can you frame for us how far you're willing to go in incurring losses in that market because it's hard to see how things get better before they get worse at least from a currency perspective.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, I mean, to answer the Venezuela question first, Steve, we're not running at a loss. I think, Venezuela is about 3% of the company's sales and about 1% of the company's operating profit. And as you rightly observed, I think we mentioned on the last call that we felt we had been in very constructive discussion with the government relative to pricing. And indeed, we were granted pricing basically across our portfolio in Venezuela, which won't actually move to the marketplace meaningfully until the fourth quarter and will modestly improve our position there. So indeed, we view that as a positive, and certainly, we'll not see Venezuela in a loss-making position. In China and Brazil, we run a dollar-weighted volume anyway. From our reporting point of view, when we look at the information we have from independent trade surveys, we can track that, whether you look at volume or value. The destocking, as I said earlier in China, is now through. And we are back to meeting consumption with our shipments. And in Brazil, it is in like fashion working its way through the system and will be completed in the fourth quarter. It really was the distribution system catching up to the succession of consumer slowdowns but that consumer consumption now seems set mid-single digits and now our shipments are coming back to that.","Operator","And we'll move on to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you talk about what's driving that 50 to 100 basis point gross margin acceleration next year when presumably, FX and raw materials are still a drag, at least in the first half, and it sounds like incremental savings don't start kicking in until later in the year and then maybe this is an opportunity to also give the gross margin bridge for this quarter?","Ian M. Cook","I was wondering when somebody would do that. Okay. Let's start with the gross profit roll-forward. So last year, it was 59. In this quarter, we pick up a 50 basis point benefit from pricing. Between the restructuring program and our Funding the Growth savings, we pick up 230 basis points, essentially in line with last year. Material prices sequentially worsened from the 2.5 basis points negative -- 2.5 point negative in the third quarter to 3 and you've got 20 basis points of mix, et cetera, and that brings you to the current year at 58, 640 basis points down. Now if we take that and look forward, first thing to say, our Funding the Growth program remains strong. Secondly, our restructuring program remains strong. Third, given the timing of pricing that we took in the third quarter and the Venezuelan price increases, we are now realizing in the fourth quarter, we expect pricing to be a more significant component of offsetting the material price headwinds. Looking forward, again, we have not finished our budgeting process. But in terms of some of the underlying commodity costs, one would say that there are emerging signs of weakness. And one would also say that in terms of oil, even though there is a lead lag before you get the full benefit of that, we have gone into our budget with a $100 assumption and we know where oil sits today. So it will be a combination of the funding the growth where material prices really end up after we have been through the diligence of our budgeting and pricing.","Operator","And Caroline Levy with CLSA will have our next question.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on Europe? And there's been some upheaval in the retail environment there. And is any risk of inventories getting stock in the system there and what are the risks you still see going forward in Europe?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, I think, the risks are pretty much out there for all to see. I'm not sure retailer-specific will be an issue. I think, I know the retailer to whom you are referring. But we have, in those kind of environment, all sorts of checks and balances in terms of inventory against consumption. And I think it highly unlikely that such a situation would arise in the European environment.","Operator","And we'll move on to Connie Maneaty with BMO.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A follow-up on Venezuela. Is the pricing you're getting in the fourth quarter, do you view it as a onetime event or do you think the ability to price to offset inflation is coming back? And then, because of the pricing, will the impact of the devaluation in 2015, assuming rates stay the same, be lower than the $0.03 you're expecting in the fourth quarter?","Ian M. Cook","We -- I will offer nothing on 2015, Connie. We really have not got that far at all. And all I can say about the pricing we have received is that the government provided specific direction as to the categories that we were permitted to take pricing in and indeed what the level would be by category and by size within that category. So I think, it would be perhaps na\u00efve to assume that, that would allow companies to take pricing as they wish. And I think, any future pricing would be, likewise, a similar discussion with the government. So I don't necessarily view it as a onetime, but I don't view it as opening the door to companies taking pricing at will.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I have a couple of follow-up questions on China. You said that demand is growing mid-single digits and I guess you expect your shipments to start growing at that amount -- at that rate starting now. Does that include online sales? And could you also tell us what percentage of your sales there now are online and give us some sense of how quickly that's shifting? And also, how much of that growth is price? And then, finally, I'm just wondering whether the shift to online could be 1 of the reasons that there was an inventory issue. Maybe there was too much inventory in 1 channel versus this other channel that's growing faster?","Ian M. Cook","So to respond Alice thanks for the question, yes, the consumer offtake has returned to that mid-single digits level. And yes, our sales are now servicing that level of consumption. So we saw that in the last month of the quarter. And it would be fair to say that's what we expect going forward. Relative to online, I know in some categories in China, online is a large and fast growth segment or retail environment. But in our business, it's not so. We are represented, but the amount of business done online in our categories is de minimis and I don't think would have in any way, affected the trade destocking. And as we look forward to 2015 in terms of the balance between pricing and volume for a country, again, we haven't finished our budgeting process and I probably wouldn't say anyway.","Operator","And we'll move on to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the advertising and commercial investment mix because Bina pointed out in the prepared remarks that the total basket of spending was still [indiscernible] and advertising was down. So what is your, I guess, plan for that over the next couple of quarters? Was this in somewhat reactionary to the more competitive environment in the U.S.? But is it really -- is that the same around the world? If there's a bit more in-store promotion going on versus advertising? What were some of the decisions made and how I guess not permanent but how sticky do you think they'll prove to be?","Ian M. Cook","If I sort of take a 20,000 view around the world, 20,000-foot view around on the world, we have seen in many markets competitors reduce their advertising weight in market and shift spending to price promotion or coupon-driven promotion, perhaps in the quest for short-term volume. You have no choice at some level but to respond to that. So part of it is that. Part of it, as we have said for a long time and we must find a way of being more articulate about it, but part of it is structural in terms of the way you engage with consumers. With the techniques we have today, in-store engagement, the sharper marketing we talked about with consumers, which often comes out of trade spending, can be a very effective way of building trial for a product. So some of it is a conscious shift to techniques that we know work when you can target particular consumers in different retail environments. And as we think forward, our preferred view, as we have said before as well, is that we believe in driving growth, particularly when markets are growing less fast through innovation and innovation supported by advertising that generates trial, not price promotion. And therefore, our planning assumptions or our thinking going forward is that we would see that traditional below-the-line advertising come back. But we would not let ourselves become disadvantaged tactically as time unfolds. But our preferred model is innovation-led advertising, supported with quality execution on the ground that makes your product irresistible in store. By your product, I mean our product.","Operator","And we'll move on to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Ian, a little bit of a follow-up to Lauren's question with regards to trader spending and couponing and all that. Do you think that -- are you getting -- now that you shifted more toward trader spending, are you getting the volume lift that you hope or not? And if you did, are you -- are we going to see more of flattish advertising versus trader spending? And related to that, also to what extent -- what are the issues you see that market share gains have slowed, either because Unilever is no longer losing as much share in toothpaste and Procter is more aggressive in some of the key markets like China and Brazil?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, where to start. The -- I think, it's fair to say that the adjustments we made and I think we've talked at the beginning of the year about Mexico and the U.S., as Bina has commented, have been effective in rebuilding our market share. And that was something we believe we had to do in the face of the competitive activity. We don't see that as a permanent strategy and I would come back and say innovation-led, advertising-supported but irresistible in store is the way we would think about prioritizing our spending. In terms of the share discussion, you'd kind of have the go around the world. Suffice it to say, you mentioned China, I would say, in China, we have approaching a 34% market share in China, and both our principal multinational competitors are seeing share decline. And so from an aggression point of view, honestly, we aren't seeing it. And we're not -- we're certainly not seeing it in the market share. So it's a market-by-market thing. And in Mexico and the U.S., it was an adjustment we made. But if you take the world, our preferred approach is innovation, advertising-supported, irresistible in store.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to talk about your expectation for 4% to 7% sales growth for 2015 in the context of lapping China and Brazil destocking, and now the commentary about pricing coming in Venezuela. So it would seem a bit like growth should be better next year relative to this year. So I guess that they're both sort of the same but how much of that is conservatism, how much of it is an assumption about category growth somewhere going up, going down. Maybe just any other color you could give sort on the underlying expectations for next year would be helpful.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, 4% to 7%, Mark, allows it to get better. But I think, just based on everything you see in the world today, it seemed prudent to widen that range a little because who knows what next year brings. I think, when we speak again after our fourth quarter and we would have been through our budgeting process, we will be in a far better position to perhaps give a sharper guidance at that time.","So I think, this brings the call to a close. I thank you all for joining us. Thank you very much for the interest in the company and the questions you always have. And thank you, again, to all those Colgate people who may be listening. We value the work you do. Goodbye.","Operator","And that does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation."],"6250":["Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 24, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Bina H.

Today's call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgate.com. Just as a remember, there may be a slight delay before the question-and-answer session begins due to the web simulcast. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Bina Thompson. Please go ahead.","Bina H. Thompson","Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, and welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, and these statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements. So for information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements on Forward-looking Statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We will discuss organic sales growth, excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. We will also discuss gross profit, gross profit margin, SG&A, operating profit, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share, excluding the impact of certain items described in the press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted in the For Investors section of our website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","We're very pleased to report another strong quarter, especially with the momentum that has continued throughout the year. Business is sound in the developed markets of the world and continues to be robust in our emerging markets. Global market shares are healthy and growing in a number of our categories, including manual and powered toothbrushes, mouthwash, bar soaps and shampoos.","Our simple financial strategy continues to serve us well. Gross margin increased to 59%, approaching our near-term goal of 60%, and impressive in the face of a 180-basis-point increase in the year-ago quarter. Importantly, our gross margin savings, as well as the strict control of overheads, has allowed us to increase advertising, absolutely and as a percent of sales, and to increase operating profit. And as you know, foreign exchange has been a headwind for us throughout the year.","Our guidance for full year EPS growth of between 4.5% and 5.5%, which we provided earlier in the quarter, was predicated on more favorable exchange rates than what actually transpired, but we were able to offset this with a slightly lower tax rate. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate of 31.7%, well within our ongoing guidance of between 31% and 32%.","Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is nicely on track. While the anticipated charges in savings associated with the 4-year program remain the same, due to an acceleration of certain projects, our current estimate for 2013 is that charges will now be in the range of $365 million to $390 million before tax, and savings projected to be between $45 million and $55 million before tax. We're just now starting to see the effects of these savings. So a solid P&L accompanied by good cash generations and a strong balance sheet. So let's turn to the divisions.","North America. As referenced in the press release, U.S. market shares are increasing in a number of categories. While category growth overall remains somewhat sluggish, we are growing ahead of the categories in virtually every retail environment, which is reflected in our market share gains. We're particularly pleased with the launch of Colgate Total Mouthwash, launched in May behind record retail support. Our highly impactful in-store displays, highlighting the importance of an oral care regimen, were ahead of our initial goal and up almost 50% versus 2012. Our overall mouthwash share in the most recent period was 7.3%, with Colgate Total Mouthwash achieving 4.2%. Shares in the Hispanic market were even higher. Trial and repeat rates have outpaced other recent competitive launches, and a robust sampling plan has allowed us to reach 30% of mouthwash households so far in 2013. In addition, our professional plan has included sampling, ads in dental journals, digital communication coupons, dental detailing and communications with leaders in scientific affairs.","As mentioned in the press release, we're in the process of shipping Colgate's Slim Soft toothbrush into the U.S. markets. As you may recall, this product was first introduced into the Asian market and has met with great success there, as you will hear later. Here in the U.S., the launch is proceeding well. Beginning this month, we are on air with a consumer-validated television commercial. And in addition, our marketing campaign includes strong outreach to health and [indiscernible] magazine editors with over 40 million impressions to date. Key retailers are providing strong display support. And in the social media space, we have had very positive consumer feedback. We have more innovation slated for the first quarter of next year, which we will share with you soon.","Turning then to Europe\/South Pacific. Results in this region were quite solid given the overall macroeconomic situation. There have been some very modest signs of improvement. Consumer confidence in the Eurozone has progressed from being negative 23.7 in the first quarter to negative 16.6 in the second quarter to an early read for the third quarter of negative 10.5. Germany and France, where we have large businesses, have recently reported modest GDP growth, while Italy and Greece are still negative with continued high unemployment rates.","Innovation is key to driving share and category growth, and we referenced a number of successful new product launches across the region in the press release. Our regional market shares are up in toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash and fabric conditioners. Our toothpaste market share is up in both Western and Eastern Europe. In Eastern Europe, our share is up over 1 point to 37.8% on a year-to-date basis with the most recent share at 38.5%. Across the region, our manual toothbrush share is up 230 basis points to 22.3% on a year-to-date basis with the most recent read at 22.7%.","And in mouthwash, our share is up 40 basis points, 15.2% on a year-to-date basis with the most recent read at 15.5%.","New product activity is continuing in the fourth quarter. In Oral Care, we'll continue with the relaunch of our Colgate base business, as well as elmex Sensitive Gentle Whitening, which we told you about on our last call. In addition, we are launching elmex ortho manual toothbrush. This toothbrush is designed to clean in and around braces and other orthodontic appliances. With a V-trim bristle system, soft and long outer bristles gently clean the tooth surface and along the gum line, while medium-type, short inner bristles clean between and around metal braces.","In Personal Care, we maintained the momentum in our Sanex body wash business. We are relaunching the Sanex Dermo line, supported by a full integrated marketing campaign. The line will have new packaging and a formula with the Dermo Active 3 complex that delivers the 3 key benefits to keep skin healthy: deep moisturization, protection and pH balance.","As you know, we have a very strong Home Care business across the region. In France, the market-leading dish liquid is our iconic Paic brand, a new innovation for Paic is our dish and kitchen surfaces antibacterial with a unique double action benefit of both multisurface and antibacterial, supported by the strong claim, \"Kills 99.9% of bacteria.\"","Turning then to Latin America. We're very pleased with the strong organic sales growth in Latin America in the third quarter, a sequential improvement from the second quarter and a good indication of the health of our businesses despite challenging external factors. As you know, we put a great deal of focus on our on-the-ground execution here, as elsewhere, and that has paid off. Market shares are strong across the region. In Brazil, we've consolidated our leading toothpaste share at almost 72%, up 20 basis points year to date. Successful premium products, such as Colgate Luminous White and a revitalization of our Colgate Total business, has contributed to these results.","In manual toothbrushes in Brazil, we continue to widen the gap with our nearest competitor, now over 5 points. Our record year-to-date share of 32.5% is up 20 basis points versus the prior year and, as with toothpaste, has been driven by the launch of premium toothbrushes such as Colgate 360\u00ba.","Our year-to-date toothpaste share in Mexico consistently remains over 80%. In toothbrushes, we reached another record year-to-date leadership share of 44.1%, up 170 basis points year-over-year. In the direct trade, both high visibility and our focused regimen strategy have boosted share, while specific merchandising plans in the mini marts and mom-and-pop stores have driven results in the indirect trade.","Our mouthwash share is up over 2 points on a year-to-date basis to 23.3%.","Exciting new products scheduled for the fourth quarter should help maintain the excellent momentum in this business. In Brazil, we will be launching Colgate Superior anti-cavity with Nutra Super [ph] Toothpaste. Nutra Sucar [ph] or Sugar Acid Neutralizer is a breakthrough technology first introduced to the professional dental community at the Worldwide Dental Congress in Turkey in August. This is the first and only Colgate family anti-cavity toothpaste with Nutra Sucar [ph] to directly fight sugar acids in plaques, which are the #1 cause of cavities. It reduces early tooth decay by half as compared to toothpaste with fluoride, which reduces it only by 32%. And it has 4x greater remineralization than regular fluoride toothpaste.","As you would expect with a major launch such as this, it will be supported by a fully integrated marketing campaign, reaching the consumer at many touch points: at home with TV, print, radio and digital, on the way to the store with sampling and street activations and in-store with impactful merchandising displays.","In the Personal Care category, we're very excited about the launch of men's and ladies' Speed Stick Cool in Mexico. These 2 new lines of underarm protection contain fragrances inspired and created by the world of fine fragrances. The spray variance have a new shrink sleeve packaging, which provides stronger differentiation on the shelf and a tangible feel that further communicates the Cool concept.","In Asia, we're very pleased with the continued momentum with widespread strong organic sales growth. As elsewhere, our consistent flow of new products has fueled this growth and accompanying higher market shares.","In India, our toothpaste market share is up 80 basis points year to date to a record 54.3%, as premium-priced products, such as Colgate Visible White, have met with great success. Similarly, premium-priced toothpastes have driven our year-to-date share in China to almost 34%, an increase of 30 basis points. In the Philippines, our toothpaste share is up 220 basis points to 55.5%. And in Thailand, our toothpaste share is up 150 basis points to 53%.","And we told you previously about the division-wide launch of Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal manual toothbrush. That innovation continues to pick up incremental share in all the markets where it has been launched. As a result, the year-to-date market share for both Slim Soft variants is now almost double digits in many countries, led by Hong Kong at 20%, Thailand at 17.9% and Taiwan at 10.1%.","In India, our manual toothbrush share is up 250 basis points to a record 41.6% year to date with the most recent read at 42.2%, largely driven by the commercial strategy improvements implemented since the beginning of the year. Our regional mouthwash share is up 40 basis points year to date to 19.6% with the most recent reading of 20.2%.","More innovation is planned for the fourth quarter. Two exciting Oral Care innovations are slated for the Chinese market, Colgate 360\u00b0 Enamel Protects toothpaste, which builds on the success of the original Colgate 360\u00ba toothpaste, developed specifically for the Chinese consumers. The new variant adds the benefit of enamel protection with the whole mouth clean proposition of the original variant, which is important, as the Chinese consumer believes that enamel is the first layer of protection for their teeth.","In manual toothbrushes, to accompany the launch of Colgate 360\u00ba Enamel Protect toothpaste, we are launching Colgate 360\u00ba Interdental toothbrush, which addresses the consumer's desire for a clean mouth that she feels is unmet by her current toothbrush that can't get between her teeth. This brush has slim-tip bristles, which reach deeper between teeth for a whole mouth clean.","Africa\/Eurasia. The momentum in this business is strong as well. As referenced in the press release, successful innovations have resulted in good market share increases in some of the largest subsidiaries in the region. In Russia, for example, our year-to-date toothpaste market share is up 120 basis points to 33.2%. In South Africa, it's up almost 4 full points to 50.6%. And in Turkey, it's up almost 2 full points, 28.7%.","Our manual toothbrush market shares are doing well also. In Russia, our year-to-date share is up 160 basis points to 49.2%, and in Turkey, it's up 80 basis points to 28.9%. Similarly, in mouthwash, our 2 largest markets, Russia and South Africa, saw strong increases, 4 points and 3.8 points, respectively, while the whole division is up year to date almost 2 full points to 19.5%.","We told you last quarter about the launch of Palmolive Gourmet Spa shower gel in Russia and Turkey. Results have been strong in both markets. In Turkey, our market share is up from 34% prelaunch to 37.9%. In the most recent period, the Palmolive Gourmet Spa shower gel adding incremental share and now at 7.3% of the market. This has helped solidify our market-leading position.","We're expecting more innovation in the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier, we introduced our new Colgate Maximum Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste in August at the Dental Congress in Turkey. Next month, we'll be shipping the product to the trade in Turkey with marketing support slated for December and into next year.","In Russia, we're launching Colgate Altai herb toothpaste and mouthwash inspired by herbs, which are well-known natural ingredients in Russia believed to provide gum protection and which resonate well with the Russian consumer.","And in South Africa, we will be launching Colgate Active Salt toothpaste. In this market, rinsing with salt is believed to provide antibacterial protection.","And Hill's. We're delighted with the continued positive volume and organic sales at Hill's. Here in the U.S., both our relaunch of Science Diet, as well as the launch of Ideal Balance are performing well. In particular, our Treats and Wet segments are strong. The investment in store coverage we have made to support these launches is making a difference. For Science Diet, our focused, integrated marketing campaign is successfully delivering the message of natural ingredients. Ideal Balance has received strong support from the large pet retailers, and market share has been building. Early reads on trial and repeat rates are strong and on par with some of the other brands in the natural segment.","The global rollout of our Prescription Diet Metabolic line has also done well. In Europe, our distribution is already above the target we had set for ourselves for the end of this year. We will continue to support this launch with activities to increase awareness among pet parents about the problem of obesity in dogs and cats, as well as trial programs and testimonials.","More new Science Diet products are slated for this quarter and 2014. Science Diet perfect weight will feature break-through technology into the wellness category, with nutrition to help dogs and cats achieve a healthy weight and improve quality of life.","Science Diet Oral Care provides clinically proven kibble technology to reduce plaque and tartar and helps clean a cat or dog's teeth with every bite. New variants under the Science Diet Life Care umbrella includes Science Diet Sensitive Stomach and Skin, Science Diet Grain Free Salmon and Science Diet Grain Free wet for both dogs and cats.","Under the Life Style umbrella, Hill's has introduced Science Diet Small & Toy Breed Lamb Meal & Rice Recipe.","Some new items in the Ideal Balance line include Ideal Balance Grain Free Cat. A good opportunity as this is the fastest-growing segment in naturals. And another is Ideal Balance Hairball for cats, an offering which will be unique in the natural segment. In the dog category, we're expanding our large and small breed portfolios with line extensions. These are just a few examples of the increased new product activity in the natural segment.","So in summary, we're extremely pleased with our results for the third quarter, and we expect this good and increasing momentum to continue as we exit 2013. This good performance is largely result of the strategies which we have in place to succeed in, what we call, winning on the ground. These strategies have us refocusing on the basics of our core business and allow us to get better and better at the fundamentals.","Around the Colgate world, all employees are well aligned with our strategies, and as many of you who have visited a Colgate subsidiary can testify, this results in a positive culture with a real can-do attitude. Our global restructuring program is on track. Our market shares and volume growth are healthy worldwide and providing good momentum. And we look forward to sharing our results for the remainder of the year.","And now Andrea, I'd like to turn the call over for the Q&A, and I'll turn it back to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to -- volume, so -- I mean, sorry, price. And so volume was obviously good, but the other side is pricing, and I guess that was a little bit lighter than I would have expected, which is a little usual considering FX is sort of hitting a peak here on the drag. And I guess, when you think about Latin America decelerating, and I know Venezuela is a piece of that, and then the U.S., I think last quarter, you said -- I think you noted it was a little bit of an aberration. And Q2 got a little better but -- or sorry, Q3 got a little better but not much. Can you talk about how you're thinking about pricing specifically for Lat Am and for the U.S. going forward?","Ian M. Cook","Well, obviously, I think the first thing I would want to say is that we're pleased with our overall organic top line growth. We think it reflects the strategic initiatives that we've been deploying for the last 8 years, including the innovation stream that Bina has talked to, including the fact that we have 53% of our sales in those emerging markets. And obviously, as you imply, Chris, the expansion of gross margin is an important part of what allows us to invest behind the innovation we have, both in terms of media promotion, professional activities and of course, as I have said several times before, the retailer-led in-store shopper marketing promotions that build trial for our business. So at the end of the day, on a global basis, what we're looking to do is to maximize the organic rate of growth and continue to expand gross margin. So if you look at our third quarter, we were very pleased with the expansion of gross margin globally, a combination of price and of course, a combination of our terrific Funding the Growth savings, and that has allowed us to invest in traditional advertising and the broader commercial investment to grow the top line. Now our objective in Latin America is, over time, to offset the transaction impact of foreign exchange, and there's always a lead lag of that transaction impact. And as you say, the biggest drag on Latin America gross margin is Venezuela. We were really pleased with the volume-led top line growth we got in that part of the world. And frankly, from a U.S. point of view, we're very happy with the progress of our business. The second quarter, of course, was helped by the introduction of the -- the mouth rinse, but I think those of you that follow the Nielsen data will have seen, and it relates to the share growth that Bina mentioned, that our consumption, which is to say consumer purchases of Colgate products each month of the third quarter, has been higher than the rate of category growth and indeed, was accelerating towards the end of the quarter. And the gross margin expansion in the U.S. was extremely healthy, as you know. So in the U.S. case, any difference between the volume growth is entirely related to the timing of in-market activity. But I think, the way we manage our business globally gives us the ability to drive our innovation, step up the rate of organic growth and continue to build the gross margin. And that's the way we think about it.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just as a quick follow-up, I mean, is it fair to say that, relative to what you thought was going on a quarter ago or more, the best path to organic growth might come with less pricing and more volume? I mean, does that make sense? Is that kind of what you're saying?","Ian M. Cook","I think all these things are a balance, I guess, which is what I was trying to say in the remark. And as you weigh the innovation timing, the different geographies we have around the world, for this quarter, we believed that was the best balance to deliver what we think in today's world is a very strong level of organic growth as a global company, yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Latin American margins have been compressing year-over-year over the last year here. Obviously, Venezuela has been a big piece of that, but can you help us parse through the underlying margin trends in Q3 x Venezuela? And as we look out to next year, are you anticipating that margins in Latin America will start to re-expand at rates similar to your long-term history? Or are there some reasons why this weakness would linger? And then also, on the other side, North American margins have expanded significantly recently. Can that continue going forward? And what's driving that?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Well, as you think about this year, I think it's fair to say that Venezuela is the unequivocal driver of the margin pressure in Latin America. And we have consistently said that. And you will remember, at the beginning of the year, we said that notwithstanding Venezuela, we still expected to expand our gross margin by some 30 to 70 basis points on the year. And I think, based on the performance thus far, we feel very comforted if you take the 9 months gone, that we think we will be solidly in that gross margin range for the company for 2013. And of course, you can imagine that as we go forward into 2014, even though I said in the release that we have literally just started our budgeting process, but in the current more benign commodity environment that we have certainly seen this year and so far moving into next year, we're going to continue to expect and see progress on the gross margin line, both for the world and indeed, for Latin America, even including Venezuela.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Ian Gordon with S&P Capital IQ.","Ian J. Gordon - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","On Hill's, I think, last quarter, you did say that you expected to get Hill's back to mid-single-digit organic growth, so check there. And you did also comment that you had a plan to rebuild margins over time. I'm wondering if you can elaborate on that because while sales growth is good, I think profit growth is better.","Ian M. Cook","Well, thanks for the question, Ian. The -- we rank sales growth and profit growth equal number 1. Look, on the Hill's business, we're extremely pleased with the progress thus far. And I think when we first talked about seeing Hill's return to mid-single-digit organic growth, we talked about it on the back of some strong innovation, which would be well received and indeed, has been well received by the customers that we work with in this space. And we said there was going to be an investment in formulation to accomplish that. So yes, to your point, check. We have recovered the top line growth. We continue to get very strong support from those customers, indeed growing support, which is encouraging. And I think that perhaps that growing support traces to the trial and more importantly, the repeat levels that we are obtaining for that innovation, which is quite robust. And most importantly, as Bina outlined in her prepared remarks, the pace of innovation on the Hill's business is now not episodic but indeed planned for and will continue out in time. So the margin investment was a conscious one, but we have specifically said that we will rebuild the Hill's gross margin to the historic levels and are planning accordingly. And we will see that develop over the next several years, beginning in 2014.","Operator","Our next question will come from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","A question on global toothpaste market shares. If you could just talk, I think the absence of any commentary on what they were in the third quarter versus a year ago suggests they probably were down, and I guess they were down. But what were the drivers of the declines? And within China, your share was up. Was your share of the Colgate brand up? Or was that all being driven by Darlie?","Ian M. Cook","The market share for global toothpaste was 45%. It was modestly down because of market share declines in a couple of key geographies. One was Mexico, although it's still over 80%. And the other one, which you see, I think, in the Nielsen data, is here in the U.S. where we have selectively, but not completely, responded to in-market promotional activity. And in China, we manage both of our businesses to different consumer segments. And I would say, from a recent market share point of view, the majority of the growth has been driven by the Darlie brand in China. And we're still thrilled to be approaching a 34 market share as a company.","Operator","We'll hear next from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wanted to go talk a little bit about the advertising and get an idea in terms of, are you seeing most of the increase in the absolute dollar spend in advertising, is that mostly new product-driven, core, et cetera? And then can you talk a little bit about some of the geographical mix impacts? Are the lower sales in Latin America because of the FX? I think that's generally a lower ad to sales market. Is that impacting the number? So just a little bit of an outlook and where you think, also, your share of voice is now versus competitors.","Ian M. Cook","Wow, that's a very broad question, John. Let me try and be as specific as I can. First of all, when we think about brand engagement with our consumers, frankly, we think about it holistically. And as I've said before, even though it may not be popular because there's still this feeling that if it goes to trade spending, it's bad advertising and if it comes below the line, as we were all brought up, it is somehow good advertising. The fact of the matter is with the techniques available to you today, you can foster some incredible engagement that is brand building and trial generating with our consumers at the retail level. So first of all, we do think about it holistically. And yes, our advertising has increased, but so has our total commercial investment. The second thing, then, is we build our advertising from the ground up, which is to say behind the brand building and innovation programs that we have scheduled for any planning period and the advertising ebbs and flows behind those initiatives and obviously, strives to be competitive, as you say, from a market share and a share of voice, not totally mechanistically because there are some principles in terms of how you spend your money with competitors. And we would say that our advertising, up 40 basis points for the company, is up where it needs to be up. It is very much growing in the emerging markets behind the rate of growth that we are seeing there but also in some of the key developed markets, depending on our business programs. And as you know, from an A to S point of view, it can be misleading because cost of media varies greatly from country to country. And that is why sometimes the absolute-to-sales ratio differs. But we're very pleased to be able to keep increasing our advertising to sales level in fairly solid ways, we believe. And we do believe, in terms of maintaining the base business and building trial on new innovation, we're spending the money smarter, faster and more efficiently.","Operator","We'll hear next from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two quick ones. So CapEx was really elevated in the quarter. Is there some sort of big initiative going on? Or do you just move stuff between the third and fourth quarter? And then just on the advertising front, I think, you said that U.S. advertising was down like 130 basis points as a percentage of sales. Is that like a permanent shift that just you talked about between sort of promotional spending and advertising? Or was that just sort of a seasonal blip in the amount of new product activity going on?","Ian M. Cook","Let's answer the second one first because that is, I would say, more importantly, and the answer is, it is a seasonal blip, I assume that's a technical term, which is entirely related to the timing of activity. Obviously, we had very strong activity in North America in the second quarter, as we did last year. But this year, of course, it was behind the mouth rinse that we brought new to the marketplace. So this is not a permanent change in strategy. It is timing related. The CapEx, no, the CapEx is certainly not shifting between quarters, but it is a reflection, I think as we said at the beginning with our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, that we would see our traditional 3% to 4% CapEx move up into the 3.5% to 4.5%, probably at the higher end of that range in the near term, as we undertake some of our capital projects directly related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. So planned for, part of the program and as Bina said earlier, very much on track.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just on the North America, I know you're not communicating that, but can you maybe give us an idea, would the volume still be up without the mouthwash business? And are we still kind of early innings there? Just trying to understand from a competitive landscape whether you're seeing kind of increased pressure. Unilever kind of cited that today, and the irrational activity that's tamping things down or whether you're not seeing that in your categories.","Ian M. Cook","Well, I think a few things to say and we have said these things before. First of all, the absolute category rate of growth is low single digits. That has not changed in the U.S. environment. Secondly, we have seen and we have said this before, some levels of short-term activity that we choose not to pursue on the mouth rinse. It is early innings. Actually, we're very pleased to be north of 7 in terms of market share, and we know on that business the trial and repeats are very good. So we have good ambition for the continued progress of that business going forward. And I think the most important point to make is to reiterate the fact that for the entirety of the third quarter, the consumption, Colgate's consumption, which is to say consumer purchases from retail, was ahead for the entire quarter of the market rate of growth and again, towards the end of the quarter actually accelerated as we exited the quarter. So when you look at a volume number that is shipment-to rather than purchases-of, the variance there, as I said earlier, is timing of marketplace activity at retail with retailers. The important number is the strength of the consumption number, which I know several of you have commented on in some of your Nielsen reports.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Actually, a couple of things. I wanted just to go back to the toothpaste share loss and just to get a better sense of why that is purely Mexico and U.S. It sounds like it's competitive. And it also sounds like you think it's going to be short term and go away. I'd like to ask also on that view, a better understanding of your double-digit EPS growth for 2014 as a company in dollar terms this time, not constant currency. And I just wanted to understand specifically, given the volatility in currencies, can you quantify the currency impact you're assuming in that? And are you including anything for Venezuela or Argentina devaluation, which some companies are kind of prudently including in their thought process going forward? Those 2 things would be helpful, please.","Ian M. Cook","Sure, sure. The -- let's take the second one first. As we said in -- or as I said in the quote in our earnings release, we have basically just begun our budgeting process for 2014. And I made the comment that we are targeting double-digit dollar increase in EPS at current spot rates. Now obviously, we're going to work through our budgeting process, but those are our goals for 2014. Clearly, what we see on the landscape is a slightly more benign commodity environment than we have seen historically. And obviously, which is the reason we did it proactively when we announced it in the fourth quarter of 2012, we have a Global Growth and Efficiency Program that is running over a 4-year period that we said when we announced it, would provide a little bit of cushion or protection against events in the world. And so we have that as we go into 2014 and the out years. And our current planning is that Venezuela will continue to be the -- in the position it is in today, which, as you will see in the Q, is about 4% of our global sales and about 3% of our operating profit. And we have not, and we did not previously, assumed a devaluation of Venezuela in any way because one doesn't know timing. One doesn't know level. What we can say and what we have said before on these calls is that you can rest assured that business is being managed appropriately. And I think we have always been prompt and timely and comprehensive in updating the market should an event occur in Venezuela. So that's the way we are thinking about 2014 as we begin our budgeting process in that regard. Now coming back to your first comment, we're actually pleased with our overall market share progress on toothpaste. I think Bina spoke about Mexico, about India, about China. Russia was in our remarks. Some terrific share progress; in some cases, very, very strong share progress, which we think portends for the long term. In Mexico, and I was just down in Latin America, in Brazil and Mexico, we saw some short-term elevated promotional activity, which we reacted in part but not completely to. And I feel confident that, that will turn around. And the same comment relative to the U.S., which you will see in the Nielsen data, and we believe innovation-led, that will turn around going forward as well. So we do not have any systemic concern about our share progress. We know exactly where the short-term issues are, and it really is how dramatically do you want to go after promotional activity that you don't judge to be appropriate, shall we say, in terms of building categories for the long term. So we're in this business for the long term, and we believe that toothpaste share will continue to grow, as is our mouthwash share, as is our toothbrush share, where we're beginning to take more and more market leadership positions, Mexico, in the U.S. in manual toothbrushes being of the 2 most recent. So we believe that we will recover that, and we believe that is consistent with our long-term strategy. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Next, we'll move to Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Wanted to follow up on the input cost side. So I know it's early, but can you give us a sense sort of what you're budgeting for oil prices? And then just given views that it seems relatively benign here, any rethinking of longer-term gross margin expectations or at least achievement of that 60% number sooner rather than later?","Ian M. Cook","Well, we certainly -- you look at the gross margin we have this quarter and I think we feel pretty good about delivering that 60% near-term goal in the not too distant future. But actually, as you raised the question, why don't I take the opportunity, as we normally do, to give you a roll forward of the gross profit analysis for the third quarter. The gross profit in the prior year, 2012, was 58.6%. Pricing in this third quarter of 2013 added 40 basis points. Our Funding the Growth savings gave us 240 basis points, which was actually ahead of the third quarter pace last year. And you know well, Mark, that the Funding the Growth savings tend to build quarter by quarter over the year. We had a headwind of 220 basis points of material price. That was split between the commodity costs and transaction costs because of foreign exchange as we have said before. And then there were 20 basis points of ins and outs, which got us to the 59% or plus 40, which we're quite pleased with. And as I said earlier in the call, I think we would characterize the commodity environment as relatively benign, at least as we begin our planning process, which is a favorable. And our going in position, which was determined a little while ago, was to peg oil at $110 for 2014. Now that's Brent. Today, as you know, it's drifting around the $107, $108, but it's a brave man or woman that predicts the price of oil going forward. So we're quite happy with that projection going in.","Operator","Next, we'll go to John (sic) [Joe] Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. I guess first, staying on 2014 for a second and the per share outlook for next year. You mentioned that you are seeing a little bit more benign commodity environment than you were expecting. Are you guys assuming that most of that drops to the bottom line next year? Or do you think that could lead to a bit of a heightened competitive environment? And I guess, what's baked into that double-digit outlook? And then maybe secondly, if I could follow on to that, a number of your CPG peers have talked about a slowdown in emerging markets, and obviously, you guys have not seen it or at least not seen it at a high level. Is that because you're in more growth advantaged categories, or is that more market share growth or a combination of the 2?","Ian M. Cook","Well, let's take the second point first because I'm not going to answer the first point. The -- when we think about our businesses, as you rightly say, Joe, we think about it in terms of the categories in which we do business. And as we have said for a long time, for a company that has 53% of its business in those higher-growth emerging markets, we continue to see category growth rates, our categories, in the mid to high single digits, sometimes a tad better than that but certainly, solidly, in the mid-to-high single digits. And we see the category growth in the developed world in the low single digits. And I would venture to say, although I wouldn't want to take this as irrational exuberance, that there are some indications from the European environment that maybe we are reaching the bottom here. But still, our general thinking is that the Europe and North America will be growing low single digits. Yes, we are growing market share, and that, on top of that mix of growth rates, we believe, puts us in the position to deliver the kind of growth this year that many, at the beginning of the year, did not feel was probable. And so we continue to look to drive next year based on our innovation plans category by category, and obviously, we'll be able to see -- to say more when we speak to you in the New Year once we have been through that process and closed out this year. Now in terms of that commodity environment, we have literally just begun our planning process. As we have said many times, our belief is that you build categories by building brands, which is a combination of building your base business and adding relevant innovation. We do not believe that the short-term pricing activity accomplishes that nor do we believe it is rational or sustainable. So I think the approach we have for 2014, which is the same as the approach we have for any year, is to build what we believe is a business-building program rich with innovation that will drive the top line of the company, and the bottom line as well, which is the start point for our budgeting process underway.","Operator","Next is Michael Steib with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick question. Just curious, does the separation of the Asia and Africa regions, is that purely a reporting change? Or does it have any implications for the strategy or the management of the portfolios within these markets?","Ian M. Cook","Well, to answer directly the second half of the question, the answer is no, it does not change the strategy one iota. Frankly, Michael, as you are probably aware, all companies go through a process with the SEC relative to their 10-K filing where comments are made and a dialogue between companies and the SEC is undertaken. And we ended up in a very constructive conversation about the growing importance of Africa and Eurasia in our world and concluded, in conjunction with the SEC, that it would be appropriate to separate those businesses purely from a reporting visibility point of view. And that is what we have done. So you can now see that Latin America, Asia and Africa\/Eurasia are growing high single digits from an organic point of view.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I have a guidance-related question and then something on toothpaste. You guided to EPS a share up 4.5% to 5.5% or you repeated that from the past. If you use the midpoint of that, that implies a significant deceleration in the fourth quarter. So I'm wondering if you're actually more comfortable with the upper end of that guidance. And then the other question is about the sugar acid toothpaste. Is there any chance that gets launched in the U.S. in the reasonable near future?","Ian M. Cook","Well, I think, to answer your second question first, the answer is that the acid-neutralizing toothpaste we initially launched in Turkey at the IADR that was held in Turkey. As Bina said, we have -- we're just going to market now in Brazil. Frankly, given the prevalence of the disease condition, you will more likely see our global expansion go to the emerging markets first because that's where there is the greatest need and we believe, the greatest potential. So our planning would see us do that. And relative to the EPS, yes, we would be comfortable with the upper end of that range.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I actually wanted to ask about -- I also wanted to ask a question on the anti-cavity toothpaste. Could you talk a little bit about how you expect the product to kind of impact your growth? Is it going to be a matter of incremental share gain? Or is it a product you expect to accelerate category growth rates in that kind of lower end of the market where anti-cavity is priced?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, it's a very interesting question, Lauren, and I don't have a precast answer for it. The way we're approaching this is, I mean, it remains the world's biggest oral hygiene condition. And so our marketing approach here is a little bit different than a traditional innovation, which is to say we are working very diligently to engage both global and more especially, local health organizations and in countries, health ministries, to be able to inculcate good oral hygiene habit relative to cavity. Now in Brazil, for example, we are enrolling the support, and I won't mention how many because it's an impressive number, of community health people who are essentially government employees to help take this technology and the benefit it can provide to rural communities and schools to really make the superior benefit that this anti-cavity toothpaste can bring, 20% reduction shown clinically for the product, to try and boost oral hygiene. Now whether that will lead to category growth by increased consumption or I mean, one would hope so, but I don't have any empirical evidence to suggest it, but certainly the marketing approach we are using is seeking to do things a little bit differently than we have done. We will learn our way from the initial markets and hopefully, be even more progressively stronger in terms of how we engage local education groups and health ministries to really make a push on advancing the reduction of cavities as a global problem.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I also wanted to follow up on the anti-cavity toothpaste. Given the positioning of that, would you expect that ultimately over time that could take over Big Red? And then, what kind of implications would that have on margin?","Ian M. Cook","Maybe, but I think that's going to be a long, slow, steady journey. And were it to happen, it would be accretive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I was hoping that you would give us a little information on the projects you've undertaken in North America and Europe that have resulted in this year's operating margin expansion.","Ian M. Cook","Well, I think in the main, those that relate to overhead, we have been very public about whether it is facility rationalization in Europe, whether it is regard to some of the co-locations that we have undertaken in Europe and, even though it doesn't affect our performance this year, including the relocation of our facility in Morristown, New Jersey, to Carolina, which won't actually provide a benefit this year but will in the future. So those are the principal changes that have taken place from the overhead point of view. And then, of course, you have the very good growth that we have seen in the gross margin, which is a combination of our Funding the Growth programs. And they would be the 2. And when I talked about co-location, I guess the other way we have talked about co-location is the notion of hubbing, which is this idea of grouping operating units around sort of a mother core, which we have been doing for 15 years now, starting in Central America. And we know it strengthens, as Bina called it, our winning on the ground capability, while at the same time saving us money.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping to go back to something you touched on in your answer to Lauren's question on engaging Brazilian government employees to take the product around. Are you essentially getting a government endorsement on this? And then secondly, stepping back to another question on China, we're looking at the most recent China Nielsen data through July, August, and I know we're missing a month of the quarter there. But it does show a very rare share loss for your aggregate business, both H&H and Colgate, while P&G gets better and the category decelerates on lower price growth. So I was hoping you could talk about the dynamics of what's happening in China and what maybe drove those share losses.","Ian M. Cook","Wow. Well, to the second point, Jason, it can, and we have seen it in other markets, only be short-term promotional activity. So I don't want to be flippant, but we're very comfortable with both our short-term performance in China and the combination of promotion and more importantly, innovation-led growth that will continue in all parts of the world. You may recall that our principal competitors saw their share drop from the mid-20s to below 18%, which maybe is why one sees short-term promotion reaction. But I don't really have any additional comment to offer on that. Government endorsement, I think one has to be careful. We clearly have endorsement from local dental associations. We have support from global health authorities, and we have the support of a whole cadre of key opinion leaders from many different geographies around the world who have been taken through in great detail the clinical prowess of the product. In Brazil, we do indeed have an exclusive relationship with these government health workers to try and improve oral hygiene. We had done something similar in Granada. So it is support and endorsement to eradicate cavities, but that is different from kind of a seal of approval endorsement that you get from a dental association. But I think it attests to the kind of collaborative stance we're trying to take to work to seriously attack a disease condition, in fact, the most severe disease condition in oral hygiene.","Operator","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to our presenters for any final and closing remarks.","Ian M. Cook","Oh, that's me. The -- so listen. It was great to have the opportunity to share what we believe continue to be very, very good top and bottom line worldwide progress. I thank you for your questions and interest in the company. And as we always like to say on these calls, we particularly thank, as Bina said, the Colgate people around the world, some of whom you meet, but these are the people that make all this happen, and we deeply appreciate it. So talk to you next year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, once again, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day."],"6346":["Colgate-Palmolive Co.

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.","John Faucher","Thanks, Elysia. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are, Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Henning Jakobsen, Vice President and Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Vice President and Treasurer.","Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's Web site, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 6 and 6a of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's Web site.","Ian Cook","Thanks John and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning.","At CAGNY in February, I mentioned that we expected 2018 to be challenging of likely less challenging than 2017. So far, this has not been the case as quarter one was just as challenging as 2017 visualizing all material and logistics costs, heightened competitive activity and a slow down in cash [growth] [ph] in some markets around the world.","I would say that in response, we remain focused on increasing our effectiveness and agility to better delay with this volatile environment where growth is harder to find.","Over the past few quarters, I've highlighted four areas of focus as we look to accelerate top and bottom line growth. Advertising behind more impactful creative, innovation across our business particularly in toothpaste and particularly in naturals working with our retail partners to drive profitable growth with a focus on e-commerce, and of course, maximizing productivity up and down the income statement.","These fundamentals remain our priorities in 2018. But on the call today, I'd like to focus on two topics; first, our developed markets where we think we've made progress over the past year. And second, our developing markets where we face some new and continuing challenges that we're working to address. You may remember in the first half of 2017, our North American and European divisions posted declines in organic sales and some weakness in market share since then it's driven by the increased advertising spend that we committed to and to focus on identifying the category segments and retail environments that will deliver growth, we have returned to organic sales growth and are back to positive market share performance.","In the U.S., in the first half of last year our categories declined and we gained share in only one of our categories. In this first quarter of 2018, our categories are back to growth and our sales were up in six categories and flat in one more. This was a continuation of the improvement we began to see in the fourth quarter. In Europe for the second quarter in a row we are seeing broad based growth in sales and market shares elmex continues to drive premium growth in our toothpaste portfolio, while Sanex is driving share growth in personal care and Soupline is gaining share in the fabric softener category.","Hill's has returned to sales growth with both pricing and volume growth in the first quarter. In the U.S. volume growth was positive in the quarter despite challenges in the specialty channel. Our Hill's e-commerce business in developed markets saw a 42% growth in the quarter. And so in simple terms developed markets deliver this quarter and we remain sharply focused on continuing this recent momentum.","Turning to emerging markets, our emerging markets took a bit of a step back, so what are we seeing there and more importantly what are we going to do going forward to reaccelerate growth in these markets. Latin America category growth rates slowed in the first quarter due to lower levels of inflation repricing in markets like Argentina and Brazil. While volume growth slowed in Mexico behind some macro level concerns and some heightened competitive activity which in some cases we chose not to match.","In Latin America, our pricing improved sequentially this quarter and that's a trend we expect to see continue over the balance of the year helped by easier comparisons as we cycle increases in promotional activity last year. We expect inflation to remain below historical levels, but we do foresee modest inflation given GDP growth increasing wages and rising commodity costs.","In terms of reaccelerating volume growth in Latin America, we do have a robust plan in place for the balance of the year. We have a very active innovation calendar including in Brazil significant premium all care innovation in the high growth pharmacy channel. And John will discuss our strong Brazilian market share performance in his section.","For personal care, we have innovation in the Protex line in bar soaps and in the Palmolive line in the naturals space. In Mexico where volume has been down for the last two quarters, we expect to see less of an impact from trade destocking.","In Asia, we're beginning to see the benefits of our aggressive push into the naturals space where we are now rolled out across the geographies but we know we still have a lot of work to do. In the first quarter in Asia, our toothpaste market shares improved sequentially from the fourth quarter in four of our five largest markets. While in toothbrushes, our shares improved sequentially in all of our top five markets.","In China, we are restaging our Colgate 360 brand, which is what we call Colgate Total in China and we are launching elmex as an e-commerce exclusive brand. In India, we are growing, but we need to improve our share performance and we are expanding our naturals Vedshakti platform by broadening the geographic reach and introducing a wider range of price points.","Australia was in fact the biggest driver of our organic sales weakness in Asia-Pacific this quarter. We have been impacted by some difficult retailer dynamics in the market and we will begin to lap that in Q2. There has also been an increase in competitive activity that's putting some downward pressure on pricing and market shares. The Colgate naturals line is entering this market as we speak which along with some easier comparisons should lead to an improvement in Australia over the balance of the year.","So real progress and momentum in our developed markets, which we are focused on continuing and in our developing markets, we have a clear understanding of what needs to get done to accelerate growth with specific plans and a sharp focus on results.","And finally, I would like to compliment our team for a strong start to the year from a productivity standpoint. We achieved solid results on funding the growth which helped us offset the vast majority of our raw material inflation. And we saw limited impact from the increase in freight logistics in the United States as flexible programs like Uber freight and our new 4PL logistics provider enable us to limit our exposure to the higher spot market rates.","And now back to John.","John Faucher","Thanks, Ian.","I will now provide a brief overview of the quarter including some further commentary on divisional performance. As Ian discussed while Q1 represented progress in net sales operating profit and earnings growth on a reported basis, our organic sales growth took a slight step back. We are focused on driving sequential improvement in organic sale through the balance of the year and the plans Ian highlighted demonstrate that focus.","Our net sales growth of 6.5% in the quarter was the highest since the third quarter 2011. Net sales growth was driven by 2% growth in volume with 0.5% coming from our professional skincare acquisitions. Flat pricing and 4.5% benefit from foreign exchange. Our pricing performance improved sequentially by 100 basis points and we still expect positive pricing for the year as our pricing comparisons get easier and we plan to take some additional pricing to help offset raw materials inflation.","On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was down 10 basis points year-over-year excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program it was down 40 basis points year-over-year. As Ian mentioned, our strong productivity savings lead they are funding the growth initiatives was unable to completely offset higher raw material costs.","On a GAAP basis, our operating profit margin was up 40 basis points year-over-year in Q1 excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program, our operating profit margin was down 20 basis points as the decline in gross margin was offset by a 30 basis point decrease in our SG&A to sales ratio.","On a dollar basis advertising investment was up 4% year-over-year in Q1, but was down slightly on a percentage of sales basis as we lapped our highest spending quarter in 2017. As Ian mentioned in the press release we are continuing to spend behind our brands in 2018 and we still expect advertising to be up for the full year on both the dollar and a percentage of sales basis.","The remainder of our SG&A expense was down 10 basis points year-over-year as a percentage of sales as a moderate increase in our freedom logistics costs primarily in the United States was offset by savings from our global growth and efficiency program and funding the growth initiatives.","On a GAAP basis diluted earnings per share of $0.72 was up 13% year-over-year in Q1 excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program diluted earnings per share was up 10% at $0.74.","Now moving to the divisions we will start off with North America. As Ian mentioned we saw further improvement in North America in Q1 continuing the turnaround we began to see in the second half of 2017. Net sales growth was driven by our toothpaste business which showed strong balance through a combination of pricing and volume growth.","Tom's of Maine also delivered double-digit net sales growth in Q1 benefiting from the continued positive trends in the naturals category. Our Canadian business delivered strong net sales growth as well in the quarter with growth across the oral care, personal care and home care.","Ian covered most of the important details on Latin America. Latin America delivered 0.5% net sales growth in the quarter as volume was flat and pricing was up 0.5%. Foreign exchange was flat. As Ian mentioned, our market share performance in Brazil during Q1 was very strong, we gained one share point in toothpaste year-over-year almost two share points in toothbrushes and 3.5 share points in mouthwash behind the launch of Colgate Total 12 mouthwash.","Moving to Europe. Europe delivered solid organic sales growth in Q1 with broad-based performance across our geographies and categories. Net sales growth of 16% was driven by 4% volume growth partially offset by a pricing decline of 2.5%. Foreign exchange was favorable by 14.5%.","Our toothpaste market share growth in Europe continues to be widespread with share gains in France, Germany, Greece, Switzerland Austria and Denmark.","The Colgate naturals extracts line continues to drive incremental sales across the division and we will be launching a new charcoal variant during the second quarter. We saw benefits from other new products in the quarter as well. We launched Coalgate Max White Expert Complete in the U.K., which has proven to be nicely incremental to our Coalgate Max White market share in that market.","And Sanex continues to gain share behind the 0% line which we are expanding through the launch of Sanex 0% Lotion. This new line addresses an unmet need for moisturization with fewer chemical ingredients. Ian also discussed Asia Pacific, so I will simply add a few comments.","Net sales in Asia-Pacific are up 5.5% in the quarter with all of the increase coming from currency as organic sales were flat. While our brick and mortar business in China was weaker than expected and we saw strong growth in e-commerce market shares and have market leadership in toothpaste in China e-commerce.","The Africa Eurasia division reported net sales growth of 3.5% in Q1 as positive foreign exchange more than offset a decline in volume, while pricing was up low-single digit. The volume weakness was driven primarily by South Africa where we were lapping a difficult comparison. In Russia along with Colgate naturals which we had mentioned before we expect the recent launch of Coalgate Safe Whitening to boost market shares and expand the high margin whitening segment which is underdeveloped in the region.","We are also very pleased with the performance of our 12 gram sachet in Africa particularly in Kenya. This package has a retail price point of 15 Kenyan shillings equivalent to US$0.15 or just over US$0.01 per usage. So consumers can purchase it with the change they have in their pockets. Along with our Bright Smiles, Bright Futures program, this is part of our long-term strategy to increase penetration and usage in emerging markets.","And we'll finish up with Hill's. Hill's delivered 5.5% net sales growth in the first quarter. Volume growth at 0.5% was led by the United States, while pricing was up 1%. Foreign exchange was plus 4%. The United States volume growth was driven by continued strength in prescription diet business which is posting rapid growth in the online channel. as we highlighted at CAGNY. We were also excited about our new advertising campaign on our Science Diet brand in the U.S. which focuses on science being at the heart of biology base nutrition.","Now we'll turn to our updated outlook for 2018. As stated in our press release, we expect net sales growth to increase mid-single digits in 2018. Given the slower start to the year we now expect organic sales to be up low single digits with sequential improvement in organic sales growth in the balance of the year versus low to mid-single digits previously. On a GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to be up 75 to 125 basis points in 2018 excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program, we expect gross margin to increase up to 50 basis points for the year. Greater than expected increases in raw material costs are the primary driver of our revised guidance.","As Ian mentioned on our last conference call, our forecast does assume that some raw materials including oil trends lower in the second half of this year from their current levels. Our funding the growth initiatives are off to a strong start this year, we anticipate FTG will help us offset much of the raw material inflation.","As I mentioned previously, we also expect positive pricing in the balance of the year which should provide a modest benefit to gross margin.","We remain committed to consistent advertising across the year and we expect digital to represent about 30% of our media spending this year. Both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impact from our global growth and efficiency program, we still expect our tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27% in 2018. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be at double digits for the year. Excluding the charges related to the global growth and efficiency program and the one time provisional charge resulting from U.S. tax reform, we still expect earnings per share growth to be around 10%.","And with that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience. [Operator Instructions] ","We'll go to our first question from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you. Ian, I'd like to just in terms of the price increases that you embedded in guidance, so if you can explain how in the back-end of the year you're going to be able to raise prices given the elasticity we see in developed markets? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Yes. I guess as we think about pricing Andrea and we talked about this a little bit on our last call. Clearly there is underlying commodity cost pressure that affects everybody. And clearly we have seen a slowing of category growth in some markets around the world and that has resulted in, in some cases is heightened promotional activity price space to try and get more of that smaller pie and that puts pressure on pricing. But as we said in the last call with the underlying commodity pressure with the inflation that we think will come back modestly in Latin America and other emerging markets, we believe there is the potential to take pricing over the balance of the year. We know we can do it from a consumer point of view and we think that other manufacturers are faced with the same cost pressures that we are faced with.","And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks in some instances where we thought the promotional activity was economically destructive we did not participate. So I think a combination of the underlying commodity price pressures, modest inflation and I would say an expected lessening and we're seeing that in some cases of promotional activity which is not a constructive way to build the business for medium term gives the potential for pricing over the balance of the year.","On top of which by the way, we have John mentioned the naturals expansion much of that renovation while not technically an increase in prices is very much at a premium and of the category which obviously gives you the margin benefit of the elevated premium price inherent in our innovation grid.","Andrea Teixeira","That's helpful, Ian. So just on the U.S. and probably like as you lap the price competition in Mexico is that a read into those key markets for you in terms of the pricing or the promotional spending kind of at least lapping in the fourth quarter of last year and being able to get in the balance of 2018 or better at least less couponing if you will on the pricing perspective? Is that the way we should look at it or list price increases?","Ian Cook","Both, both. In the North American environment, I think you saw fairly substantial improvement from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in terms of our pricing. The same in Latin America. So we went from basically negative 1 to flat quarter-on-quarter. And we expect that progress to continue. And we will be taking some of this price increases in parts of the world to offset that underlying commodity inflation. And on top of though it is in the price measure our innovation flow is more at the premium end which will drive value and margin.","Andrea Teixeira","That's great. Thank you, Ian.","Operator","We will go next to Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning.","Ian Cook","Hey Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","So, Ian, I'm basically going to ask the same question I did last quarter which is, if you take a step back in emerging markets, has something really changed here because clearly your market share looks like it's under pressure despite the ad boost from the back half of last year, the naturals focus and your other strategy tweaks. And it's sort of odd to such a strong organization has not seen more traction in Europe consistently missing your own expectations. The organic sales growth is weaker than we've seen in history in emerging markets. And I appreciate some of the country specific commentary, some of the comments on category weakness.","But again, taking a step back from an overall broader standpoint over the last couple of years, not just this quarter, it does feel like there's a pretty pronounced change in your competitive positioning in emerging markets. So I'm just hoping for sort of a state of the union at the high level on what's pressuring their competitive position. Why we should believe you can prosper versus the local competition that's clearly cropping up to a greater extent in that timeframe and how you sort of manage differently in the context of that environment? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Well, a few things to say to all of that. Again, stepping back and taking the broader view, the issue we had to address and we're discussing often across last year coming into this year was the weakness in our developed world. And so, we are actually quite pleased with the progress we have made there particularly as the growth of our categories in those parts of the world is now moving back into a 2% range rather than the one or less that we were talking about before. So we think that's a very good, good progress.","In the emerging markets, I challenge the notion of share weakening in fact as we try to demonstrate by going through some of our key markets. We are beginning to see sequential share progress in the key markets in those emerging countries. In a couple of cases, I mentioned in Latin America, we elected not to compete with promotional activity but those engineered it carried something like 11 gross margin. You can see volume and market share, we don't think it's economically rational to go chasing that kind of business.","So you're making choices all of the time in those emerging markets. Emerging markets by the way where our market share is significantly advanced of our competitors. We've never ducked the fact that the local brands are having an effect in the emerging markets and we have said to some while that our response was going to be with naturals and naturals at a premium price because that was what was being effective in the marketplace. And we have now positioned our naturals offerings in those categories.","I think the fundamental issue in the first quarter was the categories just slowed largely in Latin America because of an absence of pricing and you'll remember an awful lot of the near term growth in Latin America for all companies had been pricing driven. And in Asia, some destocking with the phenomenal growth of e-commerce particularly in China where by the way as John said, we are number one and building share and our e-commerce business was up some 67%.","And behind all of that, when you do the rational work on, our people continuing to brush their teeth. The answer is yes and we continue to invest to bring new people into the category. So in terms of the category growth itself while it's slowed in the first quarter interestingly with the pick up in the developed markets our underlying category growth rate is about 2.5% and we expect those emerging markets to come back as pricing gets more rational. And meanwhile, we are sequentially building share and we are putting advertising behind it and we continue to have innovation behind it. We all wish these things moved in a straight line. But unfortunately, as I said on the last call they don't seem to.","However, we don't think the model is broken and we think the same focus and activity and tools that we are deploying will be effective.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Wendy Nicholson of Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Good morning. My question has to do with the U.S. market. First of all, the 5% sales growth that we saw, is it your read that there is any pipeline fill in that, is there any sell in that makes for a potential sequential slowdown in the second quarter inventory levels of trade et cetera et cetera.","And then, the second question is, it feels like or it sounds like the growth in the U.S. has been driven or the recovery in your business in the U.S. has been driven more by your increased ad spending as opposed to really breakthrough or really meaningful innovation. I mean good innovation but nothing that's kind of like a total toothpaste or an [optic ride] [ph] or something like a big headline like that.","And so can you just say is there anything specific to the advertising, is it just more dollars, is it more share of voice, are you doing more digital, is there something about the advertising that's making it particularly impactful? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Thanks Wendy. First, I would say North America obviously is cycling a weak first quarter of the product here where we suffered from destocking and the sharp slowdown of the category. So I would say we benefited from that underlying category growth rate in North America is about 2%. But there is certainly nothing in terms of an inventory build because of the activity. I would say it's year-on-year comparison and the strengthening growth rate in the categories. And as I said earlier with the investment we are putting behind the business and the innovation which we can judge, however, we want to judge it in the end, the consumer is the final arbiter and if the market share goes up its good innovation in my book.","So that's really the story on North America, but nothing that says the underlying business performance would be disadvantaged over the balance of the year. Now on the advertising side, you have to think about these things holistically when the advertising as we have said before is not just about advertising the innovation, but it is advertising the basic benefits of a brand. Indeed it is sometimes advertising what we call brand purpose which is what a brand stands for. So we can run advertising that we call equity advertising that is very simple, very basic in the emerging markets talking to people having a future they can smile about on subjects like education, on subjects like water conservation on a basic anti-cavity benefit which may not sound glamorous and wildly different, but it's extremely emotionally persuasive and I think what we have come to which we believe is making our advertising more effective is that we've got this balance between the emotional connection with the consumer and the rational connection with the consumers.","Certainly the quality of our advertising is increasing. And then, you look at the shift we have made to digital which gives you a lot more information in terms of how you address consumers and that is playing a role as well. And finally, I would say this year we will have completed a journey over three years which has seen us reduce the amount of money we spend in what we call non-working media by something like 15%, I'm sorry 25% to 30%. And of course that money then gets directed into what we call working media which is advertising consumers actually see. So in the same advertising to sales ratio, you have a shift of money away from non-working into working. So you get that additional benefit as well. But I think it's the type of advertising, it's the vehicles we're using for the advertising and that alongside the innovation. So it's not just throwing money, it is doing it in an intelligent way with a focus on making sure we have quality advertising vehicles with that money.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Powers","Great, thanks. Two fairly quick ones, if I could. I guess, the first as you mentioned at the outset, Ian, you started-off like CAGNY presentation saying that you had seen or you saw improving 2018 in terms of top line growth and that just suggested to me that we were off to a slightly better start to the year than we're seeing today.","So I guess the first question just did you see something happen late in the quarter that might explain that or is this representative of the improvement you expected because it seems just a bit of a disconnect there?","And then, on the gross margin outlook if I could, I think you said up to 50 basis points assuming some sequential reversal of oil from here. And I guess the question there is without cutting into investment spending how much flexibility do you foresee in the model this year if commodities don't cooperate. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes. Frankly, Steve which we did from CAGNY sea changes, actually the developed markets played out pretty much the way we would have expected. It was really in the emerging markets and it was this pricing activity which stepped up as the quarter unfolded and we had to take a position in terms of, would we respond or would we not respond? That took pricing out of the category, which led to the slowdown in the value growth rate of the category. So yes, it did unfold after CAGNY to our disappointment.","Look in terms of flexibility on the year, we have the last year about global growth and efficiency program remaining and we have a very strong funding the growth program off to a very good start this year. Six new areas of fundamental development and funding the growth, which we are now tracking beyond the usual, and of course the pricing that I mentioned earlier. So we're working all of the internal angles to give us flexibility across the back half of the year, if our commodity forecasting does not pan out the way we expect it to, will obviously be close to how that unfolds as the year progresses.","But we're pressing in all of the areas you would expect to give us the most flexibility we can get because as we said in the release, we are committed to increasing our advertising absolutely and as a percent of sales because of the quality of innovation we have and we believe the quality of advertising vehicles that we have across the portfolio.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks.","Ian Cook","Hi, Jason.","Jason English","Thanks for let me ask a question. I've got one quick follow-up and then another question and I will try to jam in here. First, follow up on Dara's question, I think you pushed back Ian on his assertion that your market shares were softening somewhat in emerging markets. In your prepared remarks you certainly talked about the momentum and strength in some of your largest developed markets. Yes, when we look at your market share data that you guys disclosed and just look at toothpastes globally, it's down year-on-year. It's weakened from where you are -- what you last gave for fiscal '17. How do we put those two?","And then, my second question is on Hill's overall, a lot of moving pieces in the U.S. pet landscape a lot of competitive turbulence, a lot of channel turbulence, a lot of it seems really reminiscent of P&G and [IEMs] [ph] with what General Mills is trying to do with Blue Buffalo that clearly creates some opportunities for you guys then. I know the landscape is a little bit different where the growth is, it shifted from pet specialty into online today. But is there reason to believe that some of this turbulence could once again create opportunities for you like it did back then?","Ian Cook","Well, let me take the second and then come down --come back to the first.","On the Hill's strategy and model we have been very disciplined over the years as you know we have two businesses there, we have a wellness business for general use and we have a prescription business against specific conditions in pet. And we have limited our distribution to those outlets that have advisers for the consumers that allow them to make an intelligent choice.","And of course, in the case of prescription respond to a script from a vet, interestingly e-commerce is a perfect channel for us because you can write anything you want and [patent as] [ph] we did all because they're absolutely fixated on the health of their pet. So given the scientific quality of the Hill's products, given the scientific benefits that has been demonstrated clinically and given the discipline we have in maintaining that connection with that we obviously are working very hard to take full advantage as we can of any opportunity in that landscape. One hates to predict that we will be doing our level best to do that.","In terms of the market shares globally, yes the dollar share is down modestly actually the volume share on our business is effectively flat year-to-date year-on-year. And some of that pressure traces to Latin America. Because I mentioned that we had walked away from some promotional activity and what we are now seeing in the emerging markets I think we talked about it in fact that sequentially two places up in four of the five largest markets and toothbrushes up in all 5 from the fourth quarter.","So again, we think the plans we're putting behind the business are making progress and we will keep driving that over the balance of the year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. I just have a few follow on questions. First, in North America wondering how much of the volume left in the quarter was driven by mixed impact via innovation and then realistically how sustainable is the strong growth that you had in the quarter given all the headwinds you mentioned this morning. And then commentary we've been hearing from others.","And then, just a quick question on local competition in emerging markets and I realize you guys are working to innovate as a means of competing more effectively with some of the local competitors, but you guys think that's going to be enough. And have you considered being more proactive with M&A as ways to be more competitive in some of these markets. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes. Let's start with your first which is -- with North America. There's nothing substantively different in terms of the mix of the business coming into this year. I think the two fundamental factors are, the year-on-year comparison where we had a weak third quarter last year because of the slow down of the categories and the attendant inventory destocking as retail. So you've got a rebound in category growth which started in the fourth quarter and is now at a reasonable 2% underlying growth rate.","We've got good quality innovation as we plan to have every year and we are building market share because of that innovation and because of the expenditure behind quality advertising in the business. But it would be fair to say that the first quarter itself benefits from year-on-year comparisons, but looking forward there is nothing about the underlying strength of the business that concerns us for our planning point of view over the balance of the year.","And then, in terms of local competitors in emerging markets this is a journey, we have said when we started talking about naturals some time back that these offerings were at a premium price points. We think we have shaped some very interesting bundles although we talk about naturals in kind of a generic sense actually the offerings we have vary across the world to reflect local market preferences. And we are seeing progress; it's not going to be overnight. And I think it would be fair to say in the broadest sense Bonnie in terms of M&A look at what we have done over the years with Tom's of Maine or even the elmex brand in Europe, which had a dominant position in the Germanic countries. Certainly, if there are quality assets Tom's and the Gaba would have been a local brand in that definition. The relationship we have with Darlie in Asia is another local brand in that regard. That would certainly not be of a strategy in -- that would certainly not be off strategy.","And interestingly a little bit of an aside, the Elta business one of those two personal care companies that we've bought is building -- has built a very strong business in China as an e-commerce business. So in addition with them, we are learning some interesting skills in building direct to consumer businesses online in China with imported product. So not completely off the list of possibilities Bonnie.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Hey, good morning.","Ian Cook","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","First, a detailed oriented question, so the industry growth rates now in emerging markets which you indicate are slowing. Do you have a specific number for us? I just would like a sort of a point of reference relative to the 0.5% organic sales growth in the quarter. And then, the broader question in emerging markets, are you comfortable with your investment levels in those markets, you have very attractive margins not every company can say that in some of these regions and is it possible that the cost of business is moving higher, investment levels need to move higher to compete with some of this local competition just to return Colgate to some of the growth rate that it's enjoyed in the past in some of these regions. So your comments there would be helpful. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes. Yes. Again, our -- how would I say our understanding of the slowdown in the emerging markets is not that we see this as a permanent slowdown, but as I mentioned before in the developed world, we have now seen category growth rates move up into the 2% range historically they had been one and lower. So that's good news.","In the emerging markets what we saw was mid-single digits move down to something in the 2.5% to 3% range. And then, of course you have the destocking that goes with that kind of slow down. And largely, that was in most markets pricing driven because of that promotional intensity that I mentioned.","Now the underlying usage of consumers is the same. And interestingly, if you profile our categories around the world and our geographic mix, if those emerging markets were to stay at 3% let's say, and the developed world at 2%, if you look at our mix of the world, our underlying category growth rate would still be 2.5%, if as we expect those emerging markets come back because we will have the opportunity to price and given our strength and the category that will lift the value of the category then you could expect the underlying market growth rate will move north of 2.5%.","Now from an investment point of view, when we think about advertising as I have mentioned before, we do it from the bottom up. And so we do it by geography, by activity, by product in our portfolio and that ends up in a ratio, we don't work the ratio down through the income statement. So our first quarter advertising was slightly off the highest of last year on a ratio basis happen to be higher than the average of last year. And you can imagine in our priority markets, it is higher still and we think and believe certainly from a share of boy's point of view and a consumer engagement point of view we have an adequacy certainly of investment in those market places we need to capitalize on e-commerce, which I think we're saying we are doing and we need to continue to build these naturals offerings around the world in the emerging markets.","But I think it's more building what we have than the need for absolutely more dollar investment. The pleasing thing with much of this innovation in the emerging markets now is that -- it's at a premium level which gives you investment opportunity underneath that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey Guys.","Ian Cook","Hey Ali.","Ali Dibadj","Hey. I guess I'm still a little confused about what Colgate's on a root problem is. Despite all the micro positives you described in the prepared remarks and some confidence here and certainly some conference, the CAGNY conference results are clearly not what you expected, not what we expected, they're pretty tough, right? And I get that you can blame the category growth, but consistently as you tell your competitors as well when you are 40% plus of the category and in the series of leaders. And instead, we're actually starting to hear kind of different things from you guys saying something and then what we've seen the numbers is slightly different. So advertising I guess we were seeing for the year. I do when I get the bottom up approach but advertising was supposed to be up as a percent of sales already, right? It's not, it's actually down. Gross margin is 50 to 75 that it was now up to 50 and commodities frankly from CAGNY haven't changed that much. FX has gotten better and should have helped you on gross margins.","We thought top-line certainly from our previous discussions would accelerate already. Top-line is decelerating, pricing those supposed to be up, remains challenging, your comps get tougher here. Innovation was already supposed to help, but dollar shares are actually down in India, China and U.K. and Russia and Mexico where we were hoping innovations would help. And this isn't kind of a temporary thing it sounds like it doesn't sound like they're one-timer or like we'd heard about last year.","It sounds like it might be tougher longer term and that's a struggle, personally if I look at the stock today, I guess I think you guys dodged a bazooka, I was going to say bullet, but I think you guys dodged the bazooka a little bit because investors are starting to I guess they're continuing to blame the things that are out of your control. But a lot of things are in your control aren't coming in like we expected. And so, I guess going back to the core question, I just -- I'm still scratching my head about what the root cause of the issues are. You can talk about one-off things that we're trying to do but I struggles with the root causes. And should investors continue to give the stock -- the generous benefit of the doubt it's been getting so far and why?","Ian Cook","That's it. Don't know where to start really. I think in business in general you have to put everything in context. You make the assertion that these are root problems with the company. We pay pretty close attention to the pressures others in our space and other spaces have in this operating environment. You challenged on the fourth quarter this notion of pricing being negative and the underlying question was with pricing negative. Would this put pressure on margins, and therefore, in addition to the share commentary the model could no longer be effective. So we have tried to explain that the pressure point was the developed world which is where everybody has been focused. We feel quite pleased with the progress over the 18 month period and we think those two businesses and the underlying category growth is favorable for us going forward.","And then, we end up with this heightened activity in some emerging markets pressing price and leading to category slowdown. And you make some choices that in some cases we chose short term not to chase economically we thought unviable volume and you take a short-term share hit and you take a volume hit. Faced with the same set of circumstances, we would on balance make the same decision. And when we look at the shape of the structure of our business we see pricing now flat which is not common in our industry space.","We thought the gross profit we would have liked to have done better if we had pricing. But we thought that was quite contained and we kept very competitive spending on the table running through the income statement. We never said that the spending was going to be up on a ratio basis starting January 1st. We said we were going to increase our spending and keep that money on the table to build the business.","So when you break these things down, unfortunately, there is no simple single silver bullet that says problem solution you have to manage many moving parts. And as I have said before this is not moving in a straight line that the underlying consumer behavior is still there. The medium term growth potential we have with a growing middle class in the emerging markets is still there. We have an innovation profile to allow us to build market share in those categories while we now have strengthened our developed countries.","So, while the first quarter was not what we expected, which it seems to me we were in reasonable company in that regard. We think the plans we had for the year allow us to deliver the progress that we have committed to for the year and the underlying consumer behaviors are still sound and solid. And we have brand strength to compete.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Olivia Tong of Bank of America.","Ian Cook","Olivia?","Olivia Tong","Hi. Can you hear me? Hello?","Ian Cook","I couldn't but I can now, yes.","Olivia Tong","Okay, perfect. My question goes back to North America because obviously that was quite a bit better than many of us had expected and certainly better than what track channel data would have implied. So were there particular categories that drove this particular more off obviously in untracked and tracked. And flipping a prior question in the other way did retailers destock too far in the past and now they're actually restocking back to normal levels?","And then following on that, North American pricing looked obviously better and given what Procter's said about Kress last week would be curious what your view is on North American pricing from here. Because just in our channel checks both online and off, we're seeing some pretty meaningful price promotions particularly with larger packs at the premium end. So we just love your commentary on that. Thank you.","Ian Cook","Yes. Again, I think North America is largely influenced by the year-on-year comparison. Last year the categories were declining and retailers were destocking. And we saw in their organic growth decline mid-single digits. This year, the category -- the underlying category growth rates have moved up into the 2% range, healthy for developed world standards. We are building our market shares in six categories are flat in one more. And we have put advertising behind that to do that. And we have -- we said in the fourth quarter we had reacted to some pricing in category specific challenges and we've managed intelligently to we think handle that in a balanced way.","So the underlying category growth rate in North America is around 2%. And as I said earlier, we don't expect anything to change that underlying strength of our now re-established North American business. Interestingly from an inventory point of view we continue to see retailers work down inventory but on our businesses for this quarter in a more measured way or a more modest way than we saw in the first quarter of last year when the categories were actually in decline. But the quest for efficiency is still very much there and we participate year-on-year with retailers in that regard.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Ian Cook","Hi, Nik.","Nik Modi","I just wanted to ask you - hi, how are you. I just wanted to ask a question about culture, I mean Colgate has historically been known to be a very thoughtful company as it relates to capital allocation and just business strategy in general maybe on the conservative end. And that was -- that worked well, your returns are high and margins are high, but the environment is changing dramatically and business as usual doesn't seem like it's working. So I was just curious on your thoughts as the CEO of this company and culture and risk tolerance and how you think about that","Ian Cook","Well, very carefully, I guess is the first answer. We realize the world is changing, but we think we need to be disciplined in managing our company over time. In other words, we think this is an era for urgency, but not a panic. And so it's easy to throw out a lot of what I say make work to window dress the issues we're all dealing with. And we still very much believe in the fundamentals and in the fundamentals of these kind of businesses where people use your products every day, the benefits the product provides are important to their health and wellness not their everyday usage of products. So you need to build brands and you need to find ways of making a connection and you need to find ways of bringing the next generation of users into the business.","Now that is being disrupted in no end of ways, how would you communicate, how would you sell, and so on. And we think -- we're doing quite a lot in all of those areas with a view to building our brands and building value while we do that. Now our risk tolerance in capital allocation is, I think quite balanced. I think we have demonstrated if you take the M&A space for example, I think quite a good track record of identifying good quality assets bringing them into the portfolio and building them over time and in building them building the overall company.","We continue to be very focused in that area like much else in life, it does not move in a straight line and we do not choose to be cavalier and panicky in the allocation of our capital in that regard. That may not be a fashionable thing to say today, but we think in terms of the underlying health of the company, it's the right position to take.","So urgency we get and we are changing and have been changing a lot of things with this restructuring program we started a few years back and we continue to change a lot of things, but we resist the temptation to panic and make work for effect rather than for the long-term health of the business. And we're always trying to balance the long-term with the short-term.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bill Chappell of SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Good afternoon.","Ian Cook","Hey, Bill. Good afternoon, yes.","Bill Chappell","Ian, can you just talk a little bit maybe about trends since the end of the quarter, I guess talking about growth rebounding as we move sequentially through the rest of the year. Didn't know if you've seen a bottoming out kind of in emerging markets and also maybe with that a little more color on Australia. I know that's been weak for quite some time with the retail landscape. So didn't know if something changed intra quarter, or it's more we're just going to be lapping kind of the changes as we move into next quarter.","Ian Cook","I'm afraid Australia has been a case literally of as you know the two major retailers there control much of the marketplace. And there has been I would say a battle for shoppers between two of them. And we have from a joint business planning point of view trying to be accommodative but disciplined and we think we will finally cycle that by the end of the second quarter. I guess that's the simple way of saying that","In terms of trends, all I can say is, the second quarter has started a better click for us and that I hope traces to category information which is as you know we see on a lagged basis and I can't offer any comment at this time.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to dig in on China. It's been a little bit of a tough market for a while and particularly called the volume decline and it struck me that I know China historically has been a real high e-commerce adoption market. And I was wondering if you could comment about your performance in e-commerce in China versus the market broadly. Are you doing better or worse there? Is there anything related to that that's created challenges for you and does that tell you anything about any other markets, maybe strategies you've deployed there or experiences you have had that might be an indicator of what e-com development looks like in other markets? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Yes. Good question, Jonathan. It's interesting in our Hill's business e-commerce is an important part of the business in the developed world, North America and Europe. In the traditional Colgate business, the growth of e-commerce has been relatively modest, I would say in the developed world so far even though we are deploying resource against it. But in China, it has been quite explosive as you have Alibaba and Tencent and frankly 80 other platforms in China to go after from an e-commerce point of view, I think I mentioned earlier our Asia e-commerce business which is largely China was up some 67%. We lead from a market share point of view e-commerce and indeed have made sequential progress month-on-month in terms of share increases this year.","And I think interestingly two things to say in terms of skills. Number one, we believe we can and we are working very hard to do this build a very important part of our business in China with imported products. So marketplace direct to consumer like the Gaba products, elmex that we have just brought to China like a pallet toothbrush that we have brought to China. And like the Elta product, I was mentioning earlier where actually they have people they work with distributors in China that have very good capabilities.","So the thrust of your question is the right one which is that we think there's lots to learn in China. It's an important part of where we are focused and we are thinking about it quite broadly beyond even the businesses we sell pure brick and mortar in China and we're doing it as a business building exercise, but of course it becomes a bit of a learning lab as well. And we can transfer those learnings and those skills to other parts of the world.","Operator","We will take our next question from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thank you.","Ian Cook","Hey, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Hey. So it wasn't great, I wanted to just talk one thing we haven't touched on yet which is and we don't talk about much which is the personal care and home care businesses and I just been wondering a little bit perhaps about I guess one kind of broad strokes like share performance in those businesses in emerging markets, if the competitive environment has changed for those at all?","And then I guess also underlined that in Mexico when you talked about some of the competitive activity you chose not to participate in what category that was in?","Ian Cook","Yes. Well, I would say the personal care business is in relatively good shape. We have strong brands. We talk about Sanex. We talk about Palmolive's. We have the Protex brand. And then in homecare, we have different brands in different categories. But our primary two categories are fabric softener and the dish liquid.","Now when you look at the competitive activity in Latin America, oral care was one business, but then homecare was the other business because from a pure volume point of view, the purchase frequency of homecare products is higher than the purchase frequency of personal care products. If you're looking to drive volume from promotion that is a shorter term play. So we indeed did see a stepped up promotional activity on the homecare businesses. And again, we decide whether to play or not to play and if the margin is destructive and then frankly we don't. And we will rebuild the businesses with the innovation flow that we that we have. So that was a factor in Latin America.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.","Ian Cook","This is Ian. Thank you for joining the call. And we look forward to reconnecting with you after the second quarter. Thanks.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"6139":["Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 26, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Bina H. Thompson - Vice President of Investor Relations","Ian M.

Today's call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgate.com. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Bina Thompson, for opening remarks. Please go ahead.","Bina H. Thompson","Thanks, Anne. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Corporate Treasurer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements. These statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements. For information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements.","We will discuss organic sales growth excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. We will also discuss gross profit; gross profit margin; selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales; operating profit; operating profit margin; net income; and earnings per share on a diluted basis, excluding the impact of the items described in the press release; and earnings per share on a currency-neutral basis. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.colgate.com.","We're very pleased with our results for the start of 2012. The solid top line that we saw build through the year last year has continued into the first quarter, with good organic sales growth composed of balanced pricing and volume. And as you'll hear when we go through the divisions, our pricing actions have not suppressed volume or market share. On a global basis, our market shares are up in 8 of 12 categories, and market shares are up nicely in all regions of the world. Our new product launches have met with success, and we have more in the pipeline to continue the momentum.","Despite continued commodity cost pressures, our gross margin increased sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2011 by 50 basis points, as we told you it would. And as Ian said in the press release, our expectation is that gross margin should increase nicely for full year 2012.","Our Funding the Growth program continues to deliver substantial savings across the P&L. We're particularly pleased with the progress we have been making on our overhead costs, which were down 40 basis points. Our ongoing focus in this area is delivering good results. And as we continue to implement further savings projects, we expect this good performance to continue.","As you know, increasing gross margins and reducing fixed costs allow us to increase advertising behind our businesses at the same time as growing the bottom line. So while concerns remain regarding macroeconomic conditions in the developed markets, we're cautiously optimistic. Although forecasts for GDP growth remain modest, we are seeing growth across our categories, which is encouraging.","The emerging markets, over half of our business, continued to perform very well despite continued competitive activity, as all manufacturers see these regions as an opportunity for growth. As you know, we have been in these markets for many years and have established strong franchises which have continued to grow. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and cash generation for the full year should continue to be strong. So let's turn to the divisions.","Starting with North America. We're very pleased with our results in North America where we delivered solid organic sales growth of 5.5%. For the second quarter in a row, we had positive pricing after 9 consecutive quarters of negative pricing. And while we still need to be cautious relative to the macroeconomic environment and general consumer spending habits, it was very encouraging to see positive dollar category growth in all our categories, with our overall consumption outpacing that category growth. And in addition, the very heavy promotional activity on the part of some of our competitors seems to have lessened, which bodes well for everyone.","As referenced in the press release, our all-outlet  toothpaste share increased a full point in the quarter, widening the gap with our nearest competitor to over 3 points. The momentum behind our super premium-priced Colgate Optic White toothpaste continues as we have created buzz among stylists, celebrity influencers and magazines. And in addition, this successful new product has won awards in a number of consumer surveys for Best New Product. Our relaunch of Colgate Total Advanced toothpaste has also met with success, supported by effective in-store activities and 2 new television commercials: one for the general market; and one for our Hispanic consumers, which is being aired on key Hispanic networks. As you know, our share of the Hispanic market is very strong, about 50% year-to-date.","Our manual toothbrush share was up in the quarter, up 2 full points to 34.6% on a year-to-date basis. Part of this success was driven by relevant toothbrush offerings to complement our strong brand equities in toothpaste: Colgate Optic White, Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief and Colgate Max. This quarter, we are launching Colgate 360\u00ba Total Advanced manual toothbrush to offer a regimen alongside our toothpaste. The toothbrush has a strong motivating claim. It removes 3x the bacteria with a surround bristle pattern, wraparound cleaner and a cheek and tongue cleaner. The super premium packaging increases shelf presence. This new product will tie in with the #1 Colgate equity and its media support and allow for powerful joint displays in store.","In the quarter, we also strengthened our market-leading position in liquid hand soap, up over a point to 38.2% on a year-to-date basis. And encouragingly, the second-largest player, private label, saw share declines in the quarter due in part to our steady stream of new product innovation accompanied by impactful in-store activity. And we're excited about our lineup of new products slated for the balance of the year and expect the momentum to continue in this region.","Turning then to Europe\/South Pacific. This region remains challenging from a macroeconomic standpoint. Economic difficulties, including very high unemployment, are most prominent in Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy, while Germany exhibits a more positive outlook. So in that light, we're pleased that categories in which we do business are exhibiting growth, although that growth is modest. And we are growing market share in virtually all of our oral care segments: toothpaste, manual toothbrushes and mouthwash.","In toothpaste, our regional market share is up 0.5 point on a year-to-date basis to 33.4%, with the most recent share at 33.6%, and this is in the face of heightened competitive activity in many markets. In manual toothbrushes, our regional market share is up 1.5 points. And in the U.K., we've achieved leadership with a share of 32.9%, up over 7 points on a year-to-date basis. In mouthwash, our share in the region is up 30 basis points year-over-year.","Innovation is key to driving growth and market share in the developed markets, and we're pleased with the breadth of new product activity so far this year with more to come. Building on the success of Max White One toothpaste across the region, in the second quarter we will be adding manual toothbrushes and mouthwash, extending the portfolio to provide a full range of whitening products. In addition, we will be redesigning the packaging to conform with a very impactful Colgate Optic White design, which has met with such great success here in the U.S. and in select markets, at the same time we will be introducing the Colgate Max White Professional Whitening Kit to the dental profession.","Also in the second quarter, we will be expanding our launch of Colgate Total Pro Gum Health toothpaste. Initial markets of Romania and Greece have had promising early results, and we will be expanding the bundle to an additional 7 countries in this quarter. The full offering of a premium-priced toothpaste, mouthwash, toothbrush, floss and interdental brushes will be supported by a robust integrated marketing campaign, including a very strong professional plan. Currently, we are underrepresented in the gum segment so this provides an interesting opportunity.","The Sanex integration continues to move forward, and along with it, a range of new products in deodorants and bath and shower gels. In particular, we're very encouraged by the Sanex Zero line, which provides a range of products with mild, biodegradable ingredients approved by dermatologists.","In Home Care, under the Ajax brand name, we will be launching a pure home range of cleaners, which both purifies surfaces from dirt and bacteria and help purify the air with fragrance from essential oils.","Turning now to Latin America. Strong performance continues in Latin America with regional market shares increasing in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, bar soaps, hand dish, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. Our regional toothpaste share is at a record 79.3%. Both Mexico and Brazil, where competitive activity has been intense, increased their toothpaste share by about 2 points on a year-to-date basis.","We told you last quarter about the successful launch of Colgate Luminous White in both of these markets and that success has continued, particularly with the launch of a companion toothbrush. The Luminous range toothpaste, toothbrush and mouthwash has now expanded to Colombia, Argentina, Central America, Chile and Uruguay. Our leading regional toothbrush share of 41.6% is up over 1 point on a year-to-date basis. We lead the market in every country but Mexico where our share is up 70 basis points on a year-to-date basis to 40.5%, fast closing the gap with our nearest competitor. In mouthwash, our regional market share is up 5.6 points year-to-date to 37%, just a little over 4 points behind the market leader. The gap was over 29 points in 2007. And we now have leadership positions in Venezuela, Argentina, Central America, Paraguay and Uruguay.","In bar soaps, our regional increase in share of almost 2 points year-to-date, 31.1%, is driven in part by success in our 2 largest markets, Mexico and Brazil, where our share increased 3 points and over 1.5 points, respectively.","In Mexico, we relaunched our Palmolive Naturals line, along with a new variant, Coconut and Cotton. In Brazil, successful new product launches under the Protex equity have helped narrow the gap with the #1 player from over 17 points to just over 2 in the last 5 years. Total bar soap share in that country is 24.5%, up over 1.5 points from the year-ago period. So we're excited about the continued stream of innovations.","In oral care, as in Europe, we will be launching Colgate Total Professional Gum Health toothpaste. Two exciting new deodorants are Lady Speed Stick and Speed Stick Naturals and Protect. Under the Palmolive brand name, we will be expanding a line of pomegranate, toilet soap, shampoo and shower gel, which is already being sold very successfully in Brazil.","Turning then to Greater Asia\/Africa. Top line results in this division were excellent as we continue to grow volume and market share. Good toothpaste market share gains across many countries were referenced in the press release. More specifically in India, our share increased 150 basis points to 52.3% on a year-to-date basis, and in the latest period reached 53%. The market share gain was broad-based across our entire portfolio of products, both at affordable price points as well as the premium end because as you know, in this vast country, our strategy is to offer a broad toothpaste product portfolio covering a full range of pricing to appeal to all income levels.","In China, where the business is growing nicely, our market share increased 210 basis points to 34.6%, gaining from other multinational competitors. In Thailand, our market share increased 80 basis points to date -- year-to-date to 53.1%, driven in part from good growth in the Sensitive segments. And in Turkey, our share was up 170 basis points year-to-date, 26.1%.","Mouthwash market share saw explosive growth in China, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam. In China, our share increased 280 basis points year-to-date to 32.7%, with the most recent share at 33.1%. Colgate Plax Green Tea, an innovation developed particularly for the Chinese consumer, helped drive the share. To help the expansion of our Sensitivity products, we will be launching both Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief and Enamel Protect toothpaste and Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief mouthwash this quarter. In addition, we will be rolling out our Slim Soft toothbrush to more countries, and in Thailand, we will launch a Protex for men line.","So finally turning to Hill's. Hill's produced another quarter of organic growth despite a modest decline in volume. Pricing was up 3.5%, reflecting prior period increases in line with competition, thus ensuring we are properly positioned on the shelf. As we've previously discussed here in the U.S., the fastest-growing segment is Naturals, a segment consisting of dozens of brands where we are underrepresented. The launch of Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance late last year was an initiative to address the situation and it has had an impact. Shipments in the quarter were ahead of forecast. Data shows that we are bringing new consumers into the Pet Superstores, as well as drawing consumers of Naturals brand to Hill's.","In February, we launched a full integrated marketing campaign to support Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance with both traditional and digital media, national print ads, FSIs and off-shelf displays and retailer promotions. Also in the U.S. in the second half of the year, we're excited about a complete relaunch of our Science Diet business. This relaunch will improve the perceived science of quality in the products, enhance the shopping experience with new packaging design and strengthen and differentiate our message. Our vet-exclusive Hill's Science Diet Healthy Advantage also continues to do well, driving share in the U.S. vet channel. New products in our Prescription Diet line, such as PD y\/d Feline Thyroid Health in the U.S. and Canada and PD j\/d Glucosamine and Chondroitin have helped drive our leadership share of over 70% in this category and continue to grow veterinary recommendations.","In Europe, we're in the process of launching a taste upgrade across our Science Plan portfolio for both dogs and cats. Feline Adult Chicken was the first diet to be reformulated and introduced in the fourth quarter of last year. The remainder of the portfolio is flowing through and in all instances is parity or superior in taste to the leading competitor, a significant improvement. As in the Colgate business, the high-growth markets represent a good opportunity for Hill's and are growing very nicely as we expand distribution in countries such as Russia and Brazil.","So in summary, we are very pleased with the way 2012 has started. Clearly, the momentum in our business, which we enjoyed as we exited 2011, is continuing into this year. Our strategies are working. Our ongoing Funding the Growth program continues to deliver significant savings, and we expect that to continue. Our worldwide focus on increasing advertising is resulting in excellent sales and volume growth, and our market shares are healthy and increasing around the world. We continue to expect that volume growth for 2012 should be in the 4% to 7% range and that gross margin should increase between 75 and 125 basis points. And we do look forward to sharing our progress as we go through the remainder of the year.","That's all I had for prepared remarks, and now if we could open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just as you're walking through kind of the different regions, it sounds like the only region where you're seeing less competitive activity is North America. I didn't know if that was what you think is a start of a trend or if there's any reason why that's -- why it's pulled back there but not other regions.","Ian M. Cook","No, I would say that -- and several of us have been traveling quite extensively as you would imagine this year. And I would say that one is seeing slightly reduced levels of competitive activity everywhere you go, still elevated but lesser than in the past. And as I said on the previous call, if we can move into a situation where the competition is on innovation, this is the way we believe we are well equipped and would prefer to compete. But it's not limited to the U.S. I would say there are early indications in other geographies as well although still at elevated levels.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The question I have is on the profit margin in North America down year-over-year. I think and I know there isn't too much value on just one quarter, but the first quarter margin, 24.2%, I think is the lowest margin we've seen in the U.S. for a long time. So was that just a timing of marketing spending? Is that something that's going to pick up and improve during the course of the year? Maybe just a little more color on that.","Ian M. Cook","Sure, Wendy. The answer is that it is as it was in the fourth quarter, entirely intentional. This is the trial-building investment spend behind Optic White and our other innovation initiatives in North of America -- North America. You will remember we said that in the fourth quarter. And that continues to be the case very much in the first quarter. And then as the year unfolds, that situation will improve. So a conscious decision to invest behind super premium innovation, which is allowing us to grow share, to grow the top line and to increase pricing for the second consecutive quarter in that geography.","Operator","We'll go next to Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just actually a follow-on question to what you just answered for Wendy. I mean, if you look at 2011 and kind of the pattern of the North American operating margin, you did have a blip up to 27.4% in the third quarter, but actually the full year margin was lower than it was in the first quarter of 2011. So I don't really see the pattern that you're talking about that there was heavy spend and then the margin improved later in the year. So can you just kind of clarify what you just said and then how 2012 will unfold? And then my second question is just on the overall corporate kind of volume and pricing progression. I mean you're guiding to 4% volume growth for the year, and yet it was only 3% in the quarter. Should I think about that as the volume growth will accelerate as we see the pricing comparison come off a little and be less positive as the year progresses? Is that the way to think about it? And I'm curious about if you're price comparison will peak in the first or second quarter as being the most favorable.","Ian M. Cook","Okay, Linda. Let me come back to North America and be quite clear here. If you look at 2011, to your point, as I was saying earlier to Wendy, indeed our operating margin declined in the fourth quarter because of the investment spending behind the Optic White toothpaste. And it has stayed at a low level because of the continued investment behind the trial-building spending on Optic, and then will improve across the balance of the year, the balance of the year being 2012 and not 2011. If you take the volume for the balance of the year, we're actually extremely pleased with the way this year started and the balance we have between volume and pricing. In fact, ex-divested, the volume in the first quarter for the total company was 4.4%, and that is with the pricing that we garnered as well. And as Bina said, we did that without impacting our market share progression. Indeed our market shares improved. So I think the first quarter is indeed a good indicator that we can continue that pace for the balance of the year, that 6% to 7% organic growth that we talked about on the fourth quarter. And that's largely related to the innovation stream that we have, the Optic that is rolling -- Optic White toothpaste that is rolling around the world and the other innovations that Bina had mentioned. So we are quite comfortable with that volume progression.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Guys, on Latin American margins, I guess you cited in the press release FX and inflation is hitting SG&A. And I guess I was wondering if you could talk a little bit in more detail about how big those might have been. Because I was surprised that margins would be down in a plus 10 pricing quarter. And then as a follow-up to that, do your -- does your outlook take into account the big move the real has had, so you mark-to-market for a BRL 1.89 right now?","Ian M. Cook","The -- to come specifically to your question on the real, we are BRL 1.82. So we're on market for the real. Latin America, we're super pleased with our performance in Latin America, both on the top line and on the bottom line. The organic growth was indeed very, very strong, and we increased our investment behind the growth initiatives that we have. And that of course is a Latin America in the context of pricing actions that have taken place in Venezuela, which created a great degree of uncertainty in the first quarter, which led to the decline in Venezuelan volume that was called out in the press release. So gross profit margin improved sequentially in the first quarter, indeed improved year-on-year, and we see that improving across the balance of the year. So we're quite happy with Latin America.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just one quick one here. I guess in terms of gross margin, I want to talk about how you get to the 75 to 125 this year. And obviously, it's a good number given where we've been the last couple of years. But if I could just kind of do a back of the envelope, raw materials last year, call it, a 4-point or 400 basis point drag to gross margin. This year, you're looking at something a little bit better than that, probably 100 basis point drag. Your Funding the Growth savings is a 200 basis point positive to gross margin. Pricing is probably 100 basis points. So that right there, that net is about 200 basis points to the positive. So what's the offset given that promotion spending is easing a little bit?","Ian M. Cook","Well, let's -- good set-up, Joe. It's exactly the way we rehearsed it. Let me as a start point on this because in many of the notes, there seems to be a lot of questioning about the gross margin progression. So if we take the first quarter of this year and that 20 basis point reduction versus prior year, which we were very pleased about, obviously a 50 basis-point improvement versus the fourth quarter. But if you do our customary roll-forward, last year's gross profit was 58.4%. This year with the pricing we have taken, along with good volume, I would add, that gives you an add of 140 basis points. Our Funding the Growth started the year actually slightly better than last year. We pick up another 140 basis points there. Material pricing, a headwind of 280 basis points. So -- and if you go back, you will see that, that is easing from the second half of last year. So net -- the total net savings are negative 140, basically offsetting with the pricing and then some minor other changes for the remaining 20 basis points. And if you look across the balance of the year, our material price expansion, we're still looking at that 2% to 3% range of increase, which I think is more of a headwind than you have estimated in there. And we would expect, as you suggest, our Funding the Growth to continue to progress rather like it has in prior years. Obviously, we'll get a better benefit from pricing this year than prior. And that makes us comfortable with the 75 to 125 basis points. So we think it is well positioned and quite achievable. And of course, you come up against more favorable comps with gross margins down quite substantially across the second half of 2011. So we're very pleased with our ability to take pricing and maintain volume. And so it is that lesser headwind, better pricing, our traditional Funding the Growth and easier comparisons that make the year, we think, very doable.","Operator","We'll go next to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I want to spend some time on 2 segments, if possible please. That's in Latin America, in particular just around volume. So first in Latin America, it's 3.5% volume that obviously includes mix. I don't know whether that makes this positive or negative, so some indication there would be helpful. But that's lower than we at least would have expected and granted you took higher pricing. But I'm trying to get underneath that and trying to understand what the volume and price growth was, excluding Venezuela, just give us a better sense of what the underlying is. And also, it sounds like you gained share there, volume and value probably. And if it was volume and value share gains in Latin America, what did you see the category growing? That's the Latin America question. The other one is around pets and it's, at least in my count, I guess 11 of the last 13 quarters that we've seen volume being negative. But we're continuing to hear we're having progress on resetting the pack sizes and the pricing. We're going after Naturals in a better way. But is there something more fundamental that's a problem? And it may be the brand, it may be you, but what about macro? What about competition? What about - just like fewer births or people adopting fewer pets? I mean, what are the other potential dynamics there? Because it sounds like you guys are taking some of the right steps but the volumes just aren't there yet. So some indication on those 2 would be great, please.","Ian M. Cook","Okay, Ali. Thanks for both questions. In Latin America, you are right. We faced a headwind of Venezuela as a drag because of the announced pricing and the uncertainty in the marketplace. So retailers, the distributors and wholesalers were simply not buying. Indeed our organic growth, if you were to exclude Venezuela would be in the mid-teens. And our volume growth in Latin America would be between 8% and 9%, which we view as very healthy. And frankly, you could argue that we saw the worst of Venezuela in the first quarter with people not buying. The new pricing is at retail now on our brands. We have done all of the things anybody would expect us to do in terms of rationalizing our portfolio, maximizing local production, and by the way, continuing to build market share in Venezuela. So we feel real good about Latin America as you say, also significant pricing beyond Venezuela, where of course there will be no new pricing in 2012 assumed. So with that big slug of pricing in the first quarter, we end the Venezuela thing a little bit behind us. We think we will see continued growth progression on the volume line accelerating from the first quarter level as we continue to build market share, as Bina laid out, with an innovation-led plan across Latin America. So we like our prospects in Latin America very much. If you turn to pet, I would characterize it the following way. The point on pricing was merely meant to say that in terms of the new pricing, taken on our pet nutrition business, that is pricing that this time followed competitors. So on that business, the pricing we have at the shelves today is in line with our competitors. That pricing has rebuilt gross profit margin on that business and allowed us to put the advertising investment we have behind the beginnings of what really is the most important objective for the Hill's business, which is to compete more effectively in the Naturals segment in the United States. Ideal balance is a very good beginning. It is a product that takes the scientific heritage of Hill's and makes it more of a natural offering, entering Naturals the Hill's way rather than as a pure-play Naturals product. Off to a good start, building distribution, building volume, building market share in trial, and the repeat rates are good. But that's only part of the story, and we're not happy with the progress we have made in terms of penetrating Naturals, the fastest-growing segment. And really, these are the competitors that are creating an opportunity that we have to create. It's these Naturals brands, of which I think at last count, there were something like 99 in the U.S. that are the biggest competitors. And the relaunch of Science Diet at the middle of this year, which is over 60% of the U.S. business, will see those products more competitive with Naturals offerings in terms of the ingredients, in terms of the messaging, in terms of the packaging, even in terms of the listing of the ingredients on the bag. And we think that is going to be a very significant step forward in reestablishing our competitiveness in the overall category by establishing our competitiveness in the Naturals segments of the category. So we think we have stabilized the business, and we expect that stability to maintain for the first half, and then a return to volume growth in the second half behind that Science Diet restage. So yes, there are competitive issues. The competitive issue though is Naturals, and we think we have the plan in place for Hill's Science Diet to effectively compete in that Naturals segment. The other 40% of the business, which is the Prescription Diet with over a 70 market share is doing extraordinarily well because that is based on the veterinary recommendation of proven -- clinically proven Hill's technology.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ian, do you expect to take any further pricing this year? Have you already taken all your price increases already? And then also, can you discuss the pricing environment, specifically in Europe? You mentioned promotions improving a bit globally. Is that also true in Europe, just given the pricing looks pretty difficult still in the Q1 results in Europe?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, there are 2 answers then. The first is that if you think about our pricing for 2012, on the last call, we said that about half of that pricing in 2012 was rollover from 2011. In fact, that's now about 63% because forward pricing in Venezuela has now been taken off the table. Of the remaining 37% of pricing we had to take in 2012, fully 80% of it will be to market by the first half of this year. And we're really quite encouraged by the way we've been able to balance pricing and volume with our execution in the first quarter and believe that, that can continue as we implement the rest of our pricing. The European situation, I think as we have said before, continues to be perhaps among the toughest for our industry, never mind our company. As we have said many times, the categories in which we do business are growing high-single digits in the emerging markets, and we are blessed by having over 50% of our business in those markets. And the categories in North America are growing low-single digit, and the categories in Europe are growing very low-single digit and in some cases, flat. That's not new. That is a known phenomenon, and we are approaching Europe to try and improve our pricing position there, particularly with some of the premium innovation we have like on the Sanex business. As you say, our first quarter pricing was still tough, but it is our expectation that we hope to make progress across the balance of the year with pricing in Europe. And I think the overriding point to make in those slower growth parts of the world come back to the actions that we have discussed for a couple of years now, which are our continued efforts to revisit our structural costs to make sure that they are in line with the slower rates of growth that frankly, we can envisage for the near-term future. And you saw some of that in the first quarter with that 40 basis points reduction in our overhead. So hopeful to make progress on pricing in Europe, super pleased about 2 back-to-back quarters of positive pricing here in North America, and the European environment continues to be tough.","Operator","We'll go next to Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just wondering if you could dive a little deeper into China and Russia, and what trends are like on your businesses there?","Ian M. Cook","Sure, Caroline. I'm happy to do so. They were up, which are always good trends. Sales growth up indeed across the BRIC businesses: the Brazil, the Russia, the India, the China, very good and encouraging top line organic growth. Our market shares continue to be very strong. The increase in China that Bina mentioned earlier now approaching 35%. The Brazilian share, that's now approaching 72%. And Indian share that in the more recent periods has now broken through 50% and is at 53%; and Russia, holding a strong leadership position at between 32% and 33%, double the share of our nearest multinational competitors. So we're very encouraged by the good start to the year in terms of organic growth and on top of that, the share progress that we are making.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just want to clarify one thing, Ian, which is when you were you're talking about your volume guidance, you talked about, I guess, a 4.5% volume -- unit volume growth start to the year for the first quarter, which I believe includes Sanex but excludes divestitures. So I guess, when you guys talk about the 3% to 4% volume growth, is that what you're using as the metric, which is the including Sanex but excluding divestitures?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, it is, John.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then -- so if we look at it, Sanex is probably adding sort of 1.5 currently. So that's probably a little less than sort of that 75 basis points over the course of the year, is that a fair statement?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, between -- on the year between 75 and 100 basis points. You're about right in Sanex.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alice Longley with Buckingham Researchnex.","And Alice, it does appear that you have disconnected from the queue. [Operator Instructions] "," ","We'll take our next question from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just talk about what the drivers of the volume acceleration are going to be as the year progresses to get into that sort of 4% to 7% range? Is it lapping the pricing in the back of the year? Or do you think that maybe there'll be some category acceleration? And then I'm going to try to ask 2 questions in 1. Just in India as an aside, how much of that growth in the quarter was sort of activity ahead of the competitors' launch, and how much of that was the sort of natural running the business the way you've always run it?","Ian M. Cook","To answer the second question, none. It was all how we run and have run our Indian business. And so as I said earlier, we are very pleased with that. In terms of volume acceleration, obviously, as I indicated earlier, the pricing we have taken, 80% of it will be in place of the new pricing across the balance of the year, and that's only 37% of the pricing that we plan to take in 2012. So you're right to a certain extent, the pricing environment will be more favorable. And clearly, it is importantly driven by our innovation stream. And I would say our marketing programs and the investment behind those marketing programs, which as we have already seen at the beginning of this year, are beginning to build share for us. And I think, as I alluded, although I wouldn't want to over indicate this, we are beginning to see in some markets perhaps some more rational promotional environment, and we feel quite good about our ability to compete innovation against innovation. So that would give us the -- or it does give us the confidence for our balance of year.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess sticking with volume real quick, specifically in North America. I guess we talked pricing and margin in North America, but the North American volume in that mid-single-digit range, do you see that's sustainable going forward? Or is it kind of a onetime factor of like easy year-over-year comps or innovation selling with Optic White?","Ian M. Cook","We -- I would say, Joe, obviously there is a degree of the trial building activity that we have on the Optic. We like the way the share is building, I have to say. And so that is favorable for us. And I think for the year, certainly the volume in North America will stay in the single digits, perhaps modestly off what we've seen in the first quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Sorry, I got cut off briefly there. So I hope I'm not asking a question that somebody else asked in the meanwhile. But anyway, my question's about operating margins for the year versus a year ago for the different geographic segments, and particularly in North America, you said that margins should improve through the year, but I assume that's sequentially. Can operating margins for the year in North America be higher than a year ago even down and the same for Latin America and Europe, those 3 regions?","Ian M. Cook","Alice, I was responding when I gave that information to a very specific question about the first quarter operating margin in North America, which was the continuation of our investment spend in the fourth quarter of last year. You know that we do not provide operating margins by our divisions prospectively. And so I bring you back to the way we have been thinking about this year since it started, which is to achieve the kind of volume growth we have seen in the first quarter while delivering pricing that enables us, along with our Funding the Growth programs, to increase that gross margin by the 75 to 120 basis points that we have mentioned before, at the same time working hard to lower our overheads as a percentage of sales rather like we have accomplished in the first quarter so that we can continue to take what are healthy levels of advertising spending and continue to increase them and deliver the bottom line progress that we reaffirmed in the release this morning. And that's how the year will come together across our various geographies around the world.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Ian, if we can come back to the gross margin progression a little bit. Your guidance certainly, 75 to 120 basis points, seems to be very achievable because it doesn't even get you back to the 2010 level, and you are going to have better pricing. Commodities certainly weren't up 2% to 3% last year. I don't know whether you provided that information but certainly it was much higher than that. And you have 2 savings streams, you have Funding the Growth and then you have synchronizing supply and demand. So the question basically is, is this conservatism? Or I -- it's difficult for me to believe that you cannot do better than 125 basis points given all these points.","Ian M. Cook","Well we thank you for your confidence and optimism, Javier. I must say the general sentiment coming into this year has been that, I guess, an undercurrent of people feeling that our 75 to 125 basis points was too aggressive on the upside. So I can only repeat that we believe it is a reasonable objective and estimate on our part. It is driven precisely by the streams that you indicate. We expect to see sequential improvement, progressive improvement, as we have said before, as the year unfolds. And oh Allah, that you would be right, but our estimation is still the 75 to 125.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I have a follow-up on Venezuela. Could you tell us what Venezuela's percentage of sales and profit is? Also if you think you've taken enough in pricing to offset inflation for this year so that your margins will be essentially flat with last year or if you expect them to decline? And then finally, a lot of the media has been writing about stock-outs and the unavailability of products for consumers. Are you seeing that in your categories, and are you producing to demand?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, Connie, first, Venezuela accounts for about 5% of our sales. As you know, we don't provide profitability on a subsidiary-by-subsidiary basis. Secondly, it would be fair to say, I think, as we have been working hard to manage Venezuela in the past, that recognizing certain decisions may come. We took appropriate actions in terms of our pricing stance to offset inflation and at the same time, rationalize our portfolio to what you might call power SKUs in an environment where we are making in Venezuela over 85% of the volume that we sell. I mentioned earlier and maybe it was when you were cut off, indeed there were some dislocation in the market when the specific price reductions were announced because retailers, wholesalers and distributors in some cases stopped buying as they were waiting for clarity about what would actually happen in the marketplace and not wanting to buy if a price was then going to go down. And we are very much as a company providing our products to the marketplace. But of course, in the early part of this year as people, retailers were not buying products, there were clearly gaps on the shelves. We are supplying the market now, and our market shares continue to be at very, very strong levels. So we think as we have done in the past, we have been responsibly managing Venezuela and appropriately managing Venezuela and maintaining our market position as we do so.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just want to ask a little bit about the Total relaunch in North America. My understanding is that it was in the first quarter. And I know the Nielsen data should be taken with a very large grain of salt, but it did look like the volume for the Total business is actually quite weak or hasn't really shown any impact of what would look like a relaunch. So can you just give us an idea when the relaunch happened, when the advertising was launching and what you kind of see for that going forward?","Ian M. Cook","Sure, Lauren. The answer is in fact North America was our lead country from around the world for launching Colgate -- relaunching, I'm sorry, Colgate Total. And indeed that took place the early part of the second half last year, and we made good progress on the Total business. Then of course, we have now switched to Optic in the fourth quarter and first quarter this year. And our attentions are very squarely on building trial and the repeat that we know goes with that trial with the super premium offering of Optic. And so as the year progresses, I think you can expect that relationship to balance out. But there's no question in the Nielsen data, you will see that the focus on Optic has indeed slowed the progression on Total.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Back on Hill's. As I said previously, the volumes have been weak although operating margin has improved over the last few years. I guess, I'm curious if there's been a change to managing the business more for cash, I guess, or do you think that you can get back to a little bit single-digit volume growth again? And sort of related to what you said about relaunching the business, how do you think about an acquisition of a Natural brand as opposed to simply supplementing it with some of the relaunches that sort of reposition it as a more natural product?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, we view Hill's as a growth business. We view the emotional connection that consumers have with products they feed to their pets. Pets in today's society who are becoming members of a family, and sometimes it's difficult to know whether the parents dote more on their children or their pets. It's close, but we like both. We bring validated clinical science that delivers real benefit and garners veterinary endorsement and commands pricing and enviable gross margins. So we see this as a growth business, and we like it. The singular issue and it is a U.S. issue is having more of a share of the Naturals segments. And that's something that we have to do in the context of the equity that is Hill's, which is a science-based equity. Ideal Balance is a start, and the relaunch in the middle of the year makes the Hill's Science side offering much more competitive with those Naturals brands. ","Would we consider acquiring a business? Yes, we would. And we have said publicly before that our acquisition interests are in oral care, are in pet nutrition and are in personal care. And so strategically, the answer is yes, of course, the other book end of our acquisition strategy is that the economics have to make sense. So, yes, strategically and you can rest assured that any assessment we might make would be balanced with the economic aspect of the equation as well, but there is no strategic negative with the idea of potentially acquiring such a business at some time.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just housekeeping and then just a bigger picture question. Housekeeping, on my trip [ph] you said on currency, the impacts of the full year. Are we still thinking 3 to 4 on the top line? And then on just I guess the bigger picture, as many of your peers are talking about accelerating their investments in emerging markets and getting more of that white space expansion, clearly you guys have decades of experience ahead of them. And I'm just -- outside of toothpaste, just wondering when you look at your categories, where is there still more meaningful opportunity to expand into markets where you're currently not?","Ian M. Cook","The currency this year -- Yes, Jason, we're kind of in the same place. As we said on the last call, top line, about 3%; bottom line, about 3.5% to 4%. So that's the housekeeping. Emerging markets, you're right. We made investments and continue to make investments, but we made substantial investments in those emerging markets many, many years ago and continue to make them as we continue to grow the way we do. And obviously, as you suggest, one of the opportunities we have, which we constantly assess, is the ability to companion strong oral care businesses with personal care category entries. And I think that's part of our strategy that you could see progressing as we go forward.","Operator","And our last question today will come from Lee First [ph] with Wellington Shields.","Unknown Analyst","What can you tell us about the components of your spending mix behind your brands?","Ian M. Cook","Well, the -- it is many, which is the reason I hesitate. We think about our engagements, as we call it, with consumers holistically. And there used to be that old adage that trade spending was bad and advertising was good. And I think today with the techniques available to us, we as marketers need to broaden our thinking to include all ways of touching the consumer. So we think about it as direct to consumer, which means engaging the consumer before they are buying our brand. And of course, we do this in a variety of ways: the traditional television, radio, print, media. And remember, with over half of our business in the emerging markets, television penetration, and its strength as a mass medium is still absolute. But in some of the developed markets, we find ourselves better able to engage with consumers depending on our brands, depending on them as a targeting audience using digital, which we experiment with quite broadly, and in some geographies like the U.S. spend between 13% and 15% of their working media on digital. We also use digital in more, you might say, mundane ways but directly messaging not to a smartphone but to a mobile phone in parts of the world where otherwise you wouldn't be able to reach that consumer. And of course, we do the many educational programs that you may know us for like Bright Smiles, Bright Future, seeking to get kids into good brushing habits, and of course, a lifetime of using Colgate products. And the work we do with dental and veterinary professionals to convey the clinical strength of our products, so they can recommend them confidence. And we also, which comes back to the holistic side of things, think about consumers as shoppers. And today, there are many techniques that you can use in the retail environment that are very effective and very strong from a brand building point of view but wouldn't technically come out of the so-called below-the-line advertising measure. They might be captured in trade spending, which comes between the gross sale and the net sale, but we are adopting and deploying many techniques in that area as well. So that's how we think about it and of course, we do all of that on a market-by-market, category-by-category, brand-by-brand basis with a focus on return on investment.","Operator","And we have no further questions in our queue.","Ian M. Cook","Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us. We enjoyed sharing with you what we think is a strong start to 2012. And as is customary, I would particularly like to thank all the Colgate folks around the world who work so hard to make this kind of result happen. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded, and is being simulcast live via the www.colgate.com. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Bina Thompson. Please go ahead.","Bina H. Thompson","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik,","Corporate Treasurer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements. And these statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time, and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements.","For information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements on Forward-looking Statements.","We will discuss organic sales growth, excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. We will also discuss gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, excluding  the impact of the onetime items described in the press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release, and is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.colgate.com.","We're very pleased with our fourth quarter results, given the turbulent year just finished. The good momentum in our organic sales throughout the year is encouraging as we enter 2012. The challenge, as you know, has been to balance volume and price, and we have met that challenge. Our market shares are strong and growing, and you will hear more detail by division in a moment.","On a year-to-date basis, our worldwide market shares are up in toothpaste, mouthwash, manual toothbrushes, bar soaps, body wash, shampoo, household cleaners and fabric conditioners. In addition, we are pleased that our gross margin improved sequentially from the third quarter supported by not only positive pricing, but another year of outstanding Funding the Growth results. We told you throughout the year of our renewed efforts to reduce our costs, and that focus continues and is succeeding. This is particularly important in a world of volatile raw material costs. And importantly, we increased our advertising in the quarter, absolutely and as a percent of sales, in support of new product launches around the world. So a strong finish to the year. ","In terms of our income statement, our balance sheet is equally solid with strong cash generation and return on capital. As Ian mentioned in the press release, the world remains challenging from a macroeconomic perspective, and is particularly volatile in terms of foreign currency and consumer and competitive dynamics. This has made it increasingly difficult to provide forecasts for specific regions. As a result, we've determined that going forward, we will not provide divisional guidance. We will continue to provide guidance on a total company basis. And for 2012, we expect volume growth in the range of 4 to 7%, and gross margin to increase between 75 and 125 basis points. ","Let me turn to the divisions to give you some color regarding their fourth quarter results and more general opportunities going forward, starting then with North America. We're very pleased that this region reported positive volume and price for the first time in over 2 years. We told you at the start of 2011 that North American results would improve as we progress through the year, and that indeed happened. Our second half new product activity has met with good success, and we have more slated for 2012.","In the quarter, our U.S. market shares increased in 6 categories, were level in 3 and declined in only 2. Our leading all-outlet toothpaste share mentioned in the press release of 35.9% was 36.1% in the fourth quarter. We're particularly pleased with the success of Colgate Optic White toothpaste and toothbrush and the all-around value they are delivering. Value to consumers is reflected in good market shares and some very solid repeat rates. Since the launch, the 4-ounce toothpaste and soft toothbrush are the number one SKUs in their respective categories. Value to our trade partners since, as you would expect, the impact on overall average retail selling price for toothpaste has been very positive and will be delivering value to us through higher volumes, share and profits, a truly win, win, win proposition. This quarter, we will be launching another variant, Optic White Cool Mild Mint, thereby further expanding this very successful franchise. Our second half launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief has also delivered good results. It's been 65% incremental to the Sensitive business, and as such, has driven category growth. To build on this success, we will be launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Enamel Repair this quarter. This is an exclusive new daily use toothpaste that helps repair vulnerable parts of sensitive teeth and provides long-lasting relief as well.","In toothbrushes, in the first quarter, we will be launching Colgate 360\ufffd Surround Sonic Power with 3x bacteria removal action to remove bacteria in 3 ways. The brush has surround bristles, wraparound cleaner and a cheek and tongue cleaner. The transparent handle and clear caps drive differentiation versus our manual toothbrushes. As you know, the Colgate 360\ufffd franchise has been extremely successful in both manual and powered brushes, not only here in the U.S., but around the world.","In Home Care this quarter, we are launching Palmolive Fresh Sponge dishwashing liquid, which goes beyond cleaning dishes to wash away odor-causing residue from sponges, leaving dishes and sponges freshly clean. And this is just the beginning. You'll hear about other new product launches as we go through the year.","Turning then, to Europe. As you know, the situation in Europe remains volatile from a macroeconomic perspective, particularly in Greece and some other southern European countries. Given that backdrop, we are quite pleased with our performance with volume x divestments and acquisitions, growing 1% in the fourth quarter. And as referenced in the press release, our oral care market shares are strong and growing despite a highly competitive environment. In the U.K. for instance, our toothpaste share is up 30 basis points and our toothbrush share is up 250 basis points to almost 30% year-to-date with the latest read at 36.1% despite heavy promotional spending by one of our major competitors. Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief toothpaste continues to do well with a record monthly share in November of over 4%, increasing our share of the sensitivity segment to 30%.","In Germany, our toothpaste share is up over 0.5 point on a year-to-date basis to 37.8% with the most recent share at 38.4%. Colgate Total has been performing well in that market, garnering over 4 market share points. In France, we are making great progress in mouthwash behind our Colgate Plax brand. Year-to-date, our share is at 14%, up from under 12% in 2008 and reaching 14.7% in the most recent period. New products have been key to share gains, and we expect our new product offerings to be even greater in 2012 than in 2011. ","In the first quarter, we will be launching a unique and complete system of oral care products under the Colgate Total Pro Gum Health name. This includes toothpaste, toothbrush, mouthwash and dental floss, and is designed to provide optimum protection for teeth and gums. In the premium whitening segment, we will be launching Colgate Max White Shine, extending the already successful Colgate Max White franchise.","With a novel purple gel aesthetic, this product strengthens and shines enamel for a shinier sparkling smile. And in the sensitivity segment, we will be launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Enamel Repair, which helps to repair the sensitive areas of the teeth for instant relief and lasting protection against sensitivity. In addition, we are also introducing a sensitivity mouthwash to accompany our toothpaste and toothbrush for a complete system to provide effective sensitivity relief.  ","And in personal care, we're very excited about a new line of shower gel and liquid hand wash, Palmolive Ayur Rituals [ph]. This line with variants such as Energy, Joyous and Tranquility is inspired by the secrets of Indian ayurvedic traditions, which have been known for centuries to help regenerate body and mind. ","Another exciting new product is from Sanex, Pro Hydrate bath and shower gels, which help to recover skin's moisture level in a natural way. The products contain natural skin moisturizers and are approved by dermatologists. In the Home Care category, we're launching a range of cleaners called Ajax Pure Home, which purifies surfaces from dirt and bacteria, and help purify the air, thanks to its freshening fragrance with essential oils.","So as you can see, we have a busy year ahead in Europe and are encouraged by the breadth of our activity. And as you would expect, we will support these launches with out-of-store and in-store activity, with an even greater emphasis on all that digital has to offer.","Turning then, to Latin America. We're very pleased with the continued strong momentum in this part of the world with 14.5% organic sales increase. In addition to the market share increases in toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash, referenced in the press release, we increased shares in shampoos and maintained our solid #2 position in deodorants of over 20%. In Oral Care, we're delighted with the excellent performance of our Colgate Luminous White, which was launched in both Mexico and Brazil in the fourth quarter with highly impactful packaging and will be rolled out across the region in 2012 as a system that incorporates toothbrushes and mouthwash. In Brazil, the extremely positive trade reaction allowed us to achieve 95% of the listing objective among target customers in only one month. Total customer engagement resulted in nearly flawless in-store execution which was accompanied by strong media and digital support. In the month of December, Colgate Luminous White toothpaste reached over a 4 national share, just shy of the toothpaste share for the entire portfolio of one of our competitors. Our share in drugstores is twice the national share. ","In Mexico, our results have been equally impressive, again aided by very strong trade support. National Scantrack data shows Colgate Luminous White toothpaste share growing from 2.8% in October, the first month of launch, to more than 10% in the most recent readings. It's the #1 selling SKU in a number of our top customers, and has been 85% incremental to the whitening segment. ","In toothbrushes, despite heavy competitive activity, we gained almost a full share point across the region, increasing our year-to-date share to 41%. We are #1 in toothbrushes in every country in the region with the exception of Mexico, where we are fast closing the gap between our nearest competitor. Our market share is up 70 basis points year-to-date to 41.4%, with the most recent reading at 43%. ","In mouthwash, our share is up 3.7 points to 34% year-to-date with the most recent read at over 36%. In 2007, our gap with the leading competitor was almost 30 points and it now stands at under 8.","As we enter 2012, we have a full pipeline of new products. As noted above, we will roll out the very successful Colgate Luminous whitening system across the region. Other toothpaste launches are slated for later in the year. ","In the Personal Care category, we will be continuing the rollout of Lady Speed Stick pH Active and Men's Speed Stick X5 Multi-Protect. Launched first in Mexico at the end of the third quarter, these 2 products have contributed to market share gains in that country, and we hope to see similar successes in other countries. Lady Speed Stick pH Active delivers protection that adapts to a woman, allowing for better protection from sweat and odor. Men's Speed Stick x5 Multi-Protect provides 5 different benefits that last all day. ","In the bar soap category, Protex with vitamin E is another exciting new product, which will have a regional launch. This variant combines the long-lasting antibacterial protection of Protex with vitamin E, known to be an essential nutrition for the skin, to keep it healthy, protected and feeling hydrated as well. Protex is the #1 antibacterial bar soap brand across Latin America and has steadily gained share every year for the past 5 years, from 8.3% of the market in 2006 to 14.9% year-to-date and 15.6% in the most recent period. This excellent performance is attributable to a steady dream of innovation and bodes wells for the future.","Turning then to Greater Asia\/Africa. Momentum in this region continues as well with excellent organic sales growth of 8.5% in the quarter, the strongest growth we have seen in over a year, and well balanced between volume and price. As elsewhere around the world, we have a robust lineup of new products with more to come this year. In the quarter, we maintained our strong leadership position in toothpaste in the fast-growing markets of China, India and Russia. In the toothpaste category, we will be rolling out Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Enamel Repair, as we are in Europe. Colgate Max White One, which has helped grow share in other markets in the region, will be launched in Turkey, where our market share continues to increase, up almost 150 basis points year-on-year to 27.5%. ","Across India, we will be relaunching Colgate Total with improved packaging and integrated marketing support. This should help us maintain our leading year-to-date share of over 50%. We are very pleased that in South Africa, with the launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief toothpaste, Colgate is now the #1 most recommended sensitivity toothpaste by dentists.","As you know, our strategy is to not only launch proven global bundles in this fast-growing part of the world, but also from time to time, develop products specifically addressing unique consumer preferences in this region. A good example of a new regional launch is Colgate Slim Soft toothbrush with tapered bristles. The tapered bristles segment is growing very fast across Asia, double-digit in most markets. And this toothbrush is designed to capitalize on this growth. The handle has a simple and ergonomic design, and the 0.01-millimeter superslim tip bristles clean easily between the teeth and along the gum line. While it is still early days, initial results are very promising. ","And then Hill's. As in our Colgate business, macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and Europe have presented a challenge for Hill's. Pleasingly, our high-growth markets are growing double-digit in organic sales with both positive volume and pricing. The weakness in our developed market businesses is related to our Science Diet line and less so to our Prescription Diet products as business in the veterinary channel is improving, accompanied by continuing increases in veterinary endorsements. However, we are encouraged with our ongoing new product activity, which will continue into this year. We told you last quarter about Science Diet Ideal Balance. Consumption for the product is growing and bringing new households into the brand. A fully integrated marketing campaign, including digital media, was launched in the fourth quarter. Business also continues to build around our launch last year of Science Diet Healthy Advantage, a wellness food available exclusively through the vet channels. Distribution is now ahead of our original forecast due to sampling of vet healthcare teams, in-clinic awareness centers, as well as pet owner trial rebates and new pet kits.","We have additional products slated for this year along with healthy support behind them. In addition, we will be partnering with the Food Network to increase awareness of Science Diet Ideal Balance to advertorials, patch books and mobile banners to further establish the product as a natural option in the premium segment by increasing awareness and communicating the ingredients in perfect balance message.","All this activity, combined with our ongoing veterinary staff education and feeding programs should bode well for 2012.","So in summary, we're pleased with this strong finish to the year, and believe we have the right strategies in place to continue to deliver solid results in 2012 despite global macroeconomic challenges. We're looking forward to a strong year of investment and volume growth, and continued acceleration in our market shares worldwide. Our leadership team is committed to winning on the ground with superior execution behind an ever-increasing flow of innovative new products. We have a full pipeline of new products, spanning all price points to enable us to succeed in developed and emerging markets alike. And we look forward to sharing our results as we go through the year. That's all I have for my prepared remarks, Lisa, and now, we'd like to open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John Faucher with JP Morgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to ask a question about the change in the earnings target from sort of dollar-based to currency neutral and how we should read into that? You guys have traditionally talked about the playbook that you have in place, particularly in emerging markets, to deal with a stronger dollar in terms of more pricing, and that's what we saw in 2009. So does this signal a shift in the playbook sort of longer-term? Are you talking about this just in the context of 2012? So can you just sort of give us some updates in terms of how we should think about your longer-term guidance given this change this year.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, let's try and put this into some sort of context, John. I -- you will remember when we spoke last, on the last call, that we were just entering our budget process. And we said that it was our goal to try and get back to double-digit growth. And at that time, as I'm sure you and others have done, if you looked at the prevailing foreign exchange rates, a 10% growth in dollars was the same as a 10% growth in local currency. I guess what has changed for 2012 is the volatility we saw since that time and coming into this call. We are very pleased with the fourth quarter. We made good progress, we think, on the top line, 6% organic. We made better progress than we expected on the gross margin line and expect that to continue going forward. But given the volatility in currency for 2012, felt that taking on that volatility was not prudent, would potentially put pressure on our ability to support the business, and so for this year, felt it was better to guide currency neutral. Again, we'll have to look at the world foreign exchange position as we work our way through 2012 into the out years to see what happens. But I think from the macro point of view, continued volatility certainly in 2012 must be the expectation.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So does that mean that you're not planning on guiding currency neutral forever? I mean, it sounds like you're just saying this is just a 2012 issue.","Ian M. Cook","That's what I'm saying.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the view of pricing in Latin America, is that just again sort of a 1-year -- or emerging markets generally, that's just a 1-year issue as well and we'll revisit that in 2013 in terms of using that to offset the price -- the FX?","Ian M. Cook","Well, the -- let's be clear. When we -- as we think about this, obviously, to make the gross margin progress we expect to make, and as Bina said, well within our 75 to 125 range, we will obviously be taking pricing in countries affected from a transaction point of view to make the gross margin progress. So the playbook is very much in place in terms of offsetting transaction, but it did not want to stretch it to the translation end of it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now go to our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to push on this a little bit further. Given that the Colgate we knew would be able to offset commodities and currencies no matter what volatility through pricing, and then continue to expand margins, we've seen tougher times on gross margins, we've seen tougher times on volatility in currencies, and you haven't changed your guidance then. Why now? And I guess, is it really just because of global macro problems that obviously we're all aware of, or is there even any potentially Colgate-specific issue that's at play here?","Ian M. Cook","I think you're taking it too far, Ali, if I might say. We do believe it is the global volatility. Interestingly, if you go back historically, usually, commodities and foreign exchange were countervailing factors. We're not seeing that right now. You know in 2011 that the commodities headwind we had to face was double what we thought coming into the year, and looking at 2012, whilst the rate of increase is indeed slowing, we think it'll be between 2% and 3%, it is still at elevated levels and we're not seeing the usual correlation or loose correlation between foreign exchange and commodities. And that is a global factor, not a Colgate factor.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So in that context then, can you help me understand a few things: One is, volumes in China were down, why? Two is, exclusive of Optic White and other innovations in the U.S., volumes probably weren't that robust, so maybe tell me how much was from the innovation from the U.S. volumes? And then lastly, again, in the same context, Venezuela pricing drove almost all of your pricing in Latin America because it sounds like you were prepared for these Chavez changes and you took the move in December. So what pricing you take outside Venezuela and Latin America? So again, in the context of it's only a 1-year thing, we're going to get over this, China, U.S. volume and Venezuela, would be very helpful.","Ian M. Cook","Sure. Well let's start, in no particular order, with Venezuela. And of course, in that context, the new government regulations came into effect towards the end of last year, and the guidance we are giving in terms of our approach to 2012 is obviously compliant with government regulation, with no pricing, no new pricing assumption in Venezuela, but continued progress in pricing across the world including Latin America. So Venezuela is out of the picture and the rest of the Latin countries will take to offset the transaction, as we said. Optic, the whole point in the U.S. was to return to growth and return to positive pricing. We've stepped up innovation in the second half, and we're actually thrilled with the progress of our U.S. business and our progress in the Oral Care category as being the outline. Here you have a situation where the consumer sees value and the benefit they're getting, and the manufacturer and retail share in the growth and the margin expansion that quality of innovation provides. And frankly, one would look for more of that in the U.S. business and beyond, which is what we're focused on rather than taking it out and looking at the business without that innovation. So it is a particular strategy to try and create that type of innovation, and as Bina commented, with the kind of early results we're seeing in Latin America, when you transfer it, it has global applicability. In the case of China, obviously for the year, we continued in Greater China to see what we thought was good progress. We lifted our organic rate of growth for the year to about 10% with underlying volume running at about 8%. Our market share in China continues to be in the 32, 33 zone, leading the category by 10 points, and that share has been consistent across the year. And the fourth quarter was impacted by inventory adjustments with some of our distributors in the rural parts of the company, and we feel confident we will come back in 2012. So not a fundamental issue, a quarter issue.","Operator","And for our next question we'll go to Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My first question on the gross margin target, is your confidence in being able to get to that 75 to 125 basis points of expansion more on the cost side or on the product mix side? Because it strikes me, given how much promotional spending levels are probably going to remain elevated around the world, maybe that's an aggressive target.","Ian M. Cook","I mean to -- let's come back to material costs. As I said in response to an earlier question, as you know, where coming into 2011, we thought material costs were going to rise in the 6% to 7% range. They actually rose in the 12% to 13% range. And going forward, the first thing to say is that our estimation is that material commodity cost increases will be in the 2% to 3% range. And that is more than offsetable with a continued strong Funding the Growth program, which we expect, and pricing in 2012, which is partly the rollover of the pricing, we think, we balanced well in the second half of 2011 between price and volume. Let me bring you back and use this opportunity to give you the roll through for the fourth quarter and give some sense of how that is beginning to play out. In the fourth quarter, now this of course, takes us from the fourth quarter gross profit 2010 to the fourth quarter gross profit this year. So last year, our gross profit was 59.1%. And if we look at the bridge to the 57.7 this year, we got a benefit of 1.2 percentage points from the pricing we took, up from what we delivered in the third quarter because of the higher pricing. Our Funding the Growth, consistent with our trend historically, delivered 260 basis points of benefit, which was up from the third quarter of this year and up from the fourth quarter of last year. Material prices ebbed somewhat, a headwind of minus 5.1 percentage points, which compared with 5.3 in the prior quarter, so you see that plateauing, but still at elevated levels. And net, that works its way through to the 57.7, down 140 basis points. Progressive improvement, as Bina said, we expect that progressive improvement to continue into the first quarter of 2012. We don't think we'll quite get back to the first quarter of 2011 gross margin, but it will be close. And then with our normal trend of Funding the Growth with our normal trend of pricing, excluding Venezuela as a factor, we feel very confident we will be in that 75 to 125 basis points range. And a key driver is that the pace of commodity increase will lessen year-on-year.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And if I can just follow up one question specifically on the outlook, commodity versus pricing. Pricing in Europe has been weak this year, and I assume some of that is just currency-related, but is there anything specific to Europe from a macro, from a consumer perspective that makes you think that pricing is going to remain tough to take to offset the currency headwind? That's question #1. But then my bigger-picture question, and I promise then I will stop, is the change not only in terms of the guidance to local currency, but also the change of not giving us any quarterly direction by regions? I'm probably thinking too much about it or reacting too strongly, but is there a risk that the thing that has made Colgate sort of so unusual and so special for so long, a decade longer, has been just the incredible analytical focus, the incredible close touch on the numbers, the fact, I think, that historically, you've paid your employees in dollars and so that's what's motivated them to take that pricing in the emerging markets to offset currency headwinds? Is there a risk that Colgate is falling off of some of the very sharp discipline managing every region, every line, that kind of thing? Does that make any sense?","Ian M. Cook","The question makes sense, the answer to the question is absolutely, definitely not.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's a shock.","Ian M. Cook","And when we think about building our business, we will take pricing, we will deliver the Funding the Growth initiatives that will grow our gross margin in that 75 to 125 basis points area. We did not, in these volatile times, which many of you have written about, want to take an imprudent stance of reaching to cover the translation impact of a bouncing foreign exchange, which worsened dramatically from the time we started our budget. And we think this is an appropriate way to manage the business in these turbulent times. We're going to see good top line growth next year. We're going to see good margin expansion next year. We're going to see an increase in advertising investment. We're going to see a reduction in our structural cost as a ratio to sales. All the initiatives that we have had for all of these years are absolutely going to continue. And in local currency terms, we will be growing the bottom line by double digits. So the internal discipline is not going to change at all. One of the other things though you have seen with Colgate over the years, depending on where the world macros go, is an ability to react between geographies to adjust to whatever turbulence there may be from a global macro point of view. And we will retain that flexibility, and we don't think that providing specific guidance by geography at this time does anything other than set up a potential botcher if a number is missed because we've had to make an adjustment from one geography to another even though the company as a whole delivers well from a top line and a bottom line point of view. So we don't think it adds anything. It absolutely doesn't change the discipline internally, nor does it change the flexibility that we have, I think, the judgment to use and have done well so in the past to adjust between geographies as necessary. And to your final point about pricing in general, Europe, as you know, has always been a difficult area from a pricing point of view. We were very pleased with the progress we made in the other half of the developed world in North America with the innovation stream we have, bringing North America into positive pricing territory in the fourth quarter, with an expectation that, that will continue next year. And we look to make sequential progress on pricing in Europe in 2012.","Bina H. Thompson","Wendy, where our discipline is failing is getting people to ask one question and then get back into the queue. There's at least 15 questions on the queue so please, can you limit yourself to one question.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I guess the question is on competition, right? Obviously, we've seen increased competition from P&G. This is nothing new globally, in oral care quite a while. Europe's probably their latest push, and your shares are strong, but I guess profit was down in Europe despite Sanex, right. So I guess the question is, can you take a step back and just update us on the impact of competition to margins going forward? Because I think commodities and pricing have obscured a lot over the last year, right? But obviously, you're guiding back to double-digit EPS growth through this year on a currency neutral basis. Is that because the competitive spending is more rational? It doesn't seem like it, right? Or it's lapped or decreasing, or is it simply a function of the fact that pricing is now ahead of commodity inflation for 2012 so you can do the double-digits despite higher levels of competition?","Ian M. Cook","Chris, competition has always been a factor, and the aspect of it that we have resisted is what one might call price-driven competition. And competition at its best is innovation-led competition, and that's a world we are, I think, well-equipped and happy to compete in, and Optic and the equivalent with Luminous being rolled out around the world are good examples of precisely that. When you look at geographies around the world where new entries have been made -- the Brazils, for example, the U.K.s, as Bina said, our shares continue to grow, and that is even before the benefit of the Optic or the Luminous toothpastes hit our market share. So we feel good about our relative market position. There is no question that the competitive price promotion in those markets continues to be elevated and we compete with it where we choose to and where not, certainly not at the same level as our focus is on innovation to build the business. Now when you look at the geographies around the world and the consumers' behavior around the world, what we have seen is that in the developed world with more of the purchasing decisions being made at retail, we have seen programs executed in retail outlets, what we call shopper marketing, which you don't see in the advertising number, it comes out of the trade spending. And we are, as we have said for some time, balancing our marketing techniques to take advantage of the in-store activity, where that's good, and use the more fundamental basic engagement advertising where we believe that is important. But you look at the structure of our income statement and what we're saying about 2012, I think we're exhibiting an ability to grow the top line while taking pricing, recover and then expand our gross margin, find funding from reducing structural costs as a percentage to sales, so that we can, as Bina said in the beginning, keep building our market shares around the world, which empirically, if you look at the data, is what we are doing.","Operator","And for our next question, we'll go to Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You said in the press release and on the call that organic sales in developing markets rose 12% and that would include the decline in China. Could you tell us what the growth rate, organic sales growth rate, was of developed markets and how these 2 markets are now defined? Because they're not on a straight segment basis, but percentage of total of each one.","Ian M. Cook","Well, first of all, the -- in Greater China, our organic sales were up. It was the volume that was modestly down. Today, we are about 51%, 52% in the emerging markets, and the definitions of those would be broadly, as you would expect, which is that North America and Europe would be developed markets, as would Australasia, and the rest broadly would be emerging markets.","Bina H. Thompson","Connie, that's spelled out in Table 8 in the press release.","Operator","And for our next question we'll go to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I have a housekeeping question that I hope is not taken as that I'm cheating. And the housekeeping question is, if you can comment what was the growth, EPS growth, in 2011 excluding the benefit from currency if we're going to be starting to compare currency neutral? And in terms of my longer-term question or my more strategic question has to do with the relationship between how you get to the double-digit earnings growth currency neutral in 2012? We saw pricing power diminish in 2011. What is going to change in 2012? You're talking about North America stabilizing, but profits were down mid-single digits on top of double digits last year. The same thing can be said about Europe. And if you can comment on what was your saving targets? What was -- how much savings you extracted in 2011 and how that is going to compare in 2012? So could you help us understand how -- what exactly is controllable and that we can believe? Because the assumption that the diminished pricing power in 2011 changing in 2012 is a risky one.","Ian M. Cook","Well, the -- let's take the strategic question first, given that, that is more important. Our savings programs, if that's the place to start, our saving programs, we believe, will be as effective in 2012 as they have been in 2010 and 2011. And we have been very transparent after the fact of the precise contribution of those savings programs to our gross margin, and they will continue. I think, that's something we have demonstrated over many years that you can believe in. Secondly, we have said for at least 2 years now that we had been focusing on reducing our structural costs on a ratio basis to sales. We did that in 2011. We told you about the divestment of the detergent business in Colombia earlier -- or late last year and the effect that, that will have in 2012. So I think you can believe in that as well. And I would challenge this notion of lack of pricing power. We took greater pricing in the third -- in the fourth quarter of last year and held volume at a 4.5, 4.7 rate of growth, organic growth's strong at 6.1%. We believe that we can continue that in 2012, balancing the volume between the rollover of the pricing that we have already taken in 2011 and new pricing in 2012. In neither of those 2 years would the pricing be close to what we had done in 2008 and 2009. And we're seeing market shares and consumption grow, and again, Optic or Sensitive Pro-Relief would be good examples where if you bring the consumer a benefit he or she values, they will pay a higher price for what they believe to be a superior product. And I think you can believe that innovation stream will continue. So for me, those would be the 3 factors. We'll get the same benefit from our Funding the Growth, which is why we're comfortable with the 75 to 125 basis points expansion, we will get rollover and fresh pricing in 2012 without prejudicing the top line. We've already shown after many quarters our ability to get pricing into positive territory here in the U.S., innovation-driven. So we don't see, we don't have the same disbelief, I guess, Javier, that you may be expressing. And with that commodity headwind in the 2% to 3% range, that's something we can offset and continue to rebuild gross margin.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","But if I can, I mean, if this doesn't count as a question, right? Just for clarification. If I get into your -- if I back into your numbers, Funding the Growth came in at around $325 million. You had said in the past that the target is between $300 million and $600 million, so it certainly came in at the low end. Funding the Growth needed to be supplemented with these restructuring programs that we didn't know about it. So it seems to me that Funding the Growth is kind of like delivering at the low end of expectations. And then coming back to the pricing side, basically, pricing came, relative to the past, came in really, really late. And yes, you took pricing in the -- pricing seems to be stabilizing in the U.S., but at the same time, profits are down high single-digit on top of double digits. So it's just hard to understand how you get to sustainable double-digit growth.","Ian M. Cook","It sounded to me like a question, Javier. So the quick answer, before we move on, is we invested behind the premium innovation in the U.S., and we said we were going to do that. And so we did that, and as a company, delivered what we said we were going to deliver. So that was purposeful and intentional. And as we have said before, we make judgments across geographies. And the fundamental flaw in the reasoning on the Funding the Growth question is all you're seeing there is the Funding the Growth benefit that we are getting on the gross margin line, not the totality of the Funding the Growth savings that are working their way through the entire income statement.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","But that was my first question, Ian, what was the total savings? If you could help us understand what was the total saving in 2011 for Funding the Growth excluding -- including SG&A and what is the target for 2012.","Ian M. Cook","We're not going to give that number, Javier, simply said. We have said very clearly that we have initiatives on the structural side. You see it in the ratio to sales as we report results, and we give very clear run through of what we get on the gross margin side. Beyond that, we're not prepared to go.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can I do the same thing with a housekeeping question and then a real question? What do you think the pricing is going to be in 2012 and what you think the tax rate's going to be?","Ian M. Cook","Bill, the -- on the pricing side, I would say the pricing is going to be the same order of magnitude as we saw this year. And given where we are today, frankly, about half of that is going to be a rollover effect of pricing already taken, which is why we feel okay about the pricing. On the tax side of things, obviously, we have a lot of focus on tax savings initiatives and the impact of our capital structure and remittance planning. And for next year, we're looking at a tax guideline of between 31% and 32%.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then for my \"real question,\" have you thought about the portfolio more broadly again, and specifically Home Care and Hill's? Because obviously, it's been a little bit of a drag and probably the toughest businesses, especially because there's so much home care in Europe, and it's -- obviously private label taking a fair bit of market share. So has anything changed in terms of what the priorities are for those 2 businesses and maybe even thinking longer term about where they belong in the portfolio?","Ian M. Cook","We constantly revisit the portfolio. As you would imagine, we most recently did it as part of our strategic process around the middle of last year. And at this time, we have no revised prioritization or plans on the portfolio we have.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I mean just to expand that, what does Home Care and Hill's do for the broader business besides maybe giving you some more scale?","Ian M. Cook","It gives trade strength in parts of the world where on those businesses, we lead. As you know, the Home Care business is a regional business. In those regions, it gives us trade strength. And the Hill's business has historically given us growth, which we are building back to, and also is a very strong cash contributor.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Linda Bolton Weiser with Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I was wondering, the information you gave, the color on China for the year in terms of sales growth and volume growth and market share trends, could you give the same type of stuff for Russia for 2011?","Ian M. Cook","Well, we continue to have market-leading share in Russia, which is between 31% and 32%. And I don't think we tend to give country breakdown from an income statement point of view, but suffice to say that we ended the year with organic growth double-digit, and the business, I would say, on a very good uptick. So shares are good and we ended the year very nicely.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, can I sneak in one more on commodities? I guess I'm a little confused with the comment that your input costs will be up year-over-year in 2012 because I'm looking at comparisons for most commodities that are actually down year-over-year for the full year 2012. So is your projection including in anticipation that spot prices will move up from where they are or can you just explain a little bit more?","Ian M. Cook","Slightly in some categories, but no, it's been a straight run through in terms of the commodity costs. So -- and our oil assumption, which I think is around 110, 113 Brent. So no, it's a straight roll through, Linda.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And is Hill's actually experiencing some -- I mean, Hill's margin was very good in the quarter. Are the agricultural commodities actually down now year-over-year? Or what was the reason for the good Hill's margin in the quarter?","Ian M. Cook","Pricing. We took pricing in Hill's and we got the organic growth we were looking for, so.","Operator","And we'll go to Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm subbing in for Tim Conder today. I guess first, I just wanted to get the unanswered Javier question on what was the 2011 EPS benefit from currency. And then I was also hoping you could give some foreign exchange kind of framework, if possible, since it's fairly easy to figure the sales impact from foreign exchange, but harder to gauge the bottom line impact with all the moving parts. Do you guys have any sort of internal sensitivities you could provide like some other consumer companies have? For example, like a 1% change in net foreign exchange on the top line is an x percent or an x dollar impact to EPS?","Ian M. Cook","I think the way we framed it, Joe, is that we expect the impact on the bottom line to be around 4%. As the current spot rates, the top line is slightly less than that, approximately 3%.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then on 2011, what was the benefit to EPS from currency?","Ian M. Cook","Between 2% and 3%.","Operator","And we'll now go to Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","My questions are all sort of housekeeping as well. I think you said the gross margin would be actually down in the first quarter. So could you clarify if EPS growth is going to be second half weighted and if EPS will actually be up in the first quarter?","Ian M. Cook","We said that gross margin, from a gross margin point of view, we will continue to make progress sequentially as we did between the third and the fourth quarter. You will remember what we actually did slightly better in the fourth quarter than we were expecting. And we expect to continue to make progress in the first quarter, although we will be slightly shy of the first quarter 2011 level. And we expect EPS to be up broadly in line with the year.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","In the first quarter, okay. And then when you said double-digit increase in EPS for the year, x currency, does that mean in the range of 10% to 12%? Or could it be 15% to 20%? What does double-digit mean, a little bit more explicitly?","Ian M. Cook","Alice, it means 10%.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","It means 10%, okay. And then, could you tell us about operating margins? We've heard about gross margins for 2012. Are operating margins going to be flat, up or down?","Ian M. Cook","We don't provide that as you well know, Alice. So we give you the work-through in terms of the top line and the gross profit, and advertising will be up absolutely and as a percent to sales. And we will deliver in a currency neutral way, double-digit with that 4% headwind of translation and foreign exchange.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then my final one is on the sales guidance. You told us volume, 4% to 7%. And then you just said pricing would be about the same as 2011. Pricing got pretty strong by the fourth quarter, but for the year overall, I believe it was 1%.","Ian M. Cook","I'm sorry, I misspoke earlier. I meant more in line with the fourth quarter of 2011.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. So it's more like 3%. So you're expecting organic sales growth to be high single-digit, right?","Ian M. Cook","I -- we certainly expect the volume to be in that 4 to 7 range. I think a reasonable way of looking at it is organic growth in the 6% to 7% range for the year.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","6% to 7%, including the 3% pricing?","Ian M. Cook","Yes.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","The math doesn't work. Because with the 3% pricing on top of 4% to 7% volume, the organic sales growth would be 7% to 10%.","Ian M. Cook","It depends on where in the range of 4% to 7% you are.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. So it sounds like what you're really comfortable with is the 4%.","Ian M. Cook","No. We're saying you can look at our performance across the third and fourth quarter, that's the kind of pacing we're expecting next year.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then if we take that 6% to 7% organic sales growth and take off 3 points for currency, it looks like you're looking for reported sales to be up 3% to 4%. So...","Ian M. Cook","I think Alice, you're -- we're going to have to move on. We have lots of questions. I think we've answered with about as much detail...","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","But basically, operating margins are sort of flattish...","Delia H. Thompson","Alice, why don't you give me a call and I'll be happy to work to you.","Operator","We'll now go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to talk a little bit about advertising. I respect the decision in terms of how you're looking at 2012 to say you want to protect investment levels in the business and not leave that subject to sort of broader volatility from a macro and FX standpoint. But this year, the advertising spending, and maybe even inclusive of promotion, does still feel like it was below what might have been planned or expected at the start of what was to be a big reinvestment year. With the really solid top line performance you put up, I mean maybe the answer is we're asking the wrong question because you guys think you spend the right number already. And so I just want some perspective on -- maybe you don't think advertising actually really needs to go up to deliver the kind of top line growth that you want over the long term.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, Lauren, a good strategic question. I think the way we have tried to answer this historically, and I talked about it a little bit earlier, is to say that what one deploys in order to build brands, market share and the volume, that brings our engagement strategies with consumers. The most common proxy for that is the so-called below-the-line advertising, which then gets distilled into a ratio. But that's the sampling, the television advertising, the digital strategies that you deploy. And some of it is above the line in terms of the trade-related activity that is executed at retail level. And that's because techniques allow you to engage with the consumer, many of whom are making their purchasing decisions, particularly in the developed world when they are in the shopping environment, and that's how we approached this year. So if you look at our overall commercial investment, we actually increased our commercial investment year-on-year. So it's really back to this notion of balancing. We really balance between the activity we do in the retail environment, which is more developed world-oriented, and the investment we put in the emerging markets, and that is a roll-up that we do from the ground up. And then we react to that during the year as events unfold. So actually -- and advertising level that we have today, we think, is a reasonable level. Our plans for next year call for it to move up slightly.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Very briefly, if you could explain, just give us a sense of how Sanex is performing. Because it is in Europe, Europe's been tougher than expected overall. Has it been worse than expected for Sanex as well? And then did you reduce share repurchases relative to a year ago in '11 because of the Sanex acquisition? And if so, do you think you'll see an acceleration in share repurchases this year?","Ian M. Cook","We -- Sanex is doing well. We are excited both by the progress, which is on plan generally and ahead of plan on the top line. And we have said before, the expansion opportunities we see for Sanex going forward. In terms of our share repurchasing, I think as we think about 2012, we should think about share repurchasing at around the same level that we had in 2011. And there was a little bit of pullback relative to the Sanex acquisition in 2011, as you would expect, as we maintain our AA- rating. And you know the borrowing capabilities we have and the benefit we get from maintaining that ratio.","Operator","And for our next question, we'll go to Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just had a quick question on the 4% to 7% volume growth outlook for 2012. That is higher than you achieved in 2011 and I think the highest rate since maybe 2008. So I'm just curious, should we think about that as being kind of innovation-driven, a stronger set of new products for 2012, or kind of just improving macro or market conditions? Just trying to get a better handle on that.","Ian M. Cook","Jon, well, first of all, 4% to 7% is a range. And you may recall or know that, that has been our historical range for a long time. And obviously, in turbulent times, as we saw in 2008 and '09 and as the world, I guess, is in today, companies have to balance, which I think as what Bina said earlier, what we get from a volume point of view and what we get from a price point of view. And we think in the second half of 2011, we balanced well a healthy rate of volume growth in the 4.5% to 5% range and managed to secure pricing, ending the fourth quarter of the year with pricing at 3%. So I would say in broad terms, within that range, that's how you might like to think about 2012.","Operator","And we'll now go to Nik Modi with UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick question on cost savings. If you can just provide some specifics on what you're planning for 2012? Just so we can understand the source of those savings.","Ian M. Cook","The -- well, we have lots. I mean, we focus on Funding the Growth, as I was trying to explain earlier, on what we call direct costs, which are the costs that go into the gross margin, and indirect costs, which are those things the company buys that don't directly go to product. And interestingly, about half of what we buy are the direct costs and half of what we buy are indirect costs. And when we think about Funding the Growth savings, it really covers the waterfront. We think about simplification. We think about synchronization, as we have talked before. We think about the efficiency of our trade spending and the return on investment we get there. We think of material alternatives, formula alternatives, process alternatives. We get savings from capital spending where our rates of return, from a savings point of view, are extraordinarily high, and that will be the way we continue to think about savings from a Funding the Growth point of view. On top of that, as we said last quarter, we have the structural cost savings that we are bringing to the income statement relative to the Colombian detergent business that we sold last year. But when you think about it, Nik, it really is with the benefit of SAP that gives us visibility across all aspects of the business, challenging all areas of cost opportunity, both direct, those that go into the product, and indirect.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So following up on a previous question, I guess I shouldn't read too much into the fact that Michael is resigning. He had responsibility for the Hill's business in terms of how that plays into the future of the business. And just secondly, Europe, North America trends, can you just comment through the quarter? Did they get better, worse, both from a sales standpoint and promotion standpoint?","Ian M. Cook","Mark, Michael's retirement was long planned and we gave him the responsibilities he had at the end of an illustrious 41-year career. And we have clear plans about where the business will go, and I can promise you that Michael's departure has nothing to do with the Hill's business or any of the other businesses that he has managed in Colgate. In Europe and North America, the mood, of course, is good. In North America, I think we said -- you see it in the numbers, you see it in the pricing, and you see it in the market shares. So our year ended brightly in North America and we look for that innovation-led growth to continue. In the case of Europe, Sanex, as we've said, is adding well to our European business.","Obviously, the economic, social and category overtones are not strong in Europe. We have known that for some time. They have not changed. The categories are growing at rates we have said before. And we're quite optimistic about our ability to continue to make progress in Europe, recognizing the slowing growth of the categories, which is why we have the structural cost initiatives that we have. But the European group was, actually happens to be in, and the mood is quite good in Europe, I would say.","Operator","And we'll now go to Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The quick housekeeping is just the other expense line. It's been so volatile over the last few years with FX. I was just wondering if you could provide maybe a range, how we should think about that for 2012. And then just the bigger question on SG&A, going back to some of the structural cost savings. I was just wondering -- I mean if you look at the fourth quarter with a very strong sales number, it didn't get as much leverage, I was just -- in the fourth quarter versus third quarter, it was similar type of growth. So I was wondering, is that the timing of savings or is it currency? And how should we think about this component for 2012 in terms of the similar type of reduction as a percentage of sales, similar to what we've seen in 2011 and '10?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. The -- when you talk about the overhead side of things, it is timing. The benefit will come in 2012. I guess that's the simple answer to that question. On other income and expense, I guess the way one has to think about it is the balance from the fourth quarter of '10 to '11 was really the impact of the Venezuelan announcement in 2010 that was to do with the remeasurement of the balance sheet, where they moved from the dual rate to one rate. So that was the effect there. I don't have a forward projection of that line, Jason.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just to clarify on the SG&A question, so we should see an acceleration of the cost savings in 2012 versus -- I mean, I think it was a 20 basis point improvement in '11 and 30 in 2010. So we should see something more meaningful in 2012? Is that correct?","Ian M. Cook","We will see improvements in 2012, Jason. And we had said we would see the full benefit of the costs that we offset with the onetime gain. And I think we said on a call before that we would expect the savings ratio of that to be consistent with the kinds of rates of return that we had delivered before, which were in that 30% to 40% range.","Operator","We'll now go to John San Marco with Janney Capital Markets.","John P. San Marco - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Can you provide additional detail on the advertising decline in Lat Am such as what markets drove it? And I guess why you decreased ad spend and then maybe what your competitors did in this regard?","Ian M. Cook","No, is the answer. But in truth, the -- we did not reduce advertising in Latin America. It was up year-on-year.","Operator","And we'll now go to Lauren DeSanto with Morningstar.","Lauren DeSanto - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'd like to ask about kind of what trends you're seeing at the premium end of your oral care portfolio, kind of specifically to what degree coupons and promotions and then the trade spending that you've discussed already, kind of to what degree they're driving sales growth, and kind of just to get a feel for how much they've accelerated as growth drivers for this premium portfolio kind of over the past few years. Any detail on this would be very helpful.","Ian M. Cook","Well, I think what I'd say, Lauren, is that what we were trying to say earlier, we learned an interesting lesson, if you go back to the subprime, which is playing out again with Optic White and Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief, and that is when consumers, whether they're developed-world consumers or so-called emerging-market consumers, adopt a premium product, it's because they see a value and a benefit in that product. And even when times get challenging, they stay with that product. So in 2008 and 2009, despite the macro pressures, consumers, whether in the U.S. or in Brazil, stayed with premium products. We are now seeing again, with CSPR and the Optic White product here in the U.S., which is moving around the world, terrific consumer response to what they see as a valuable new addition to the toothpaste category. And by all means, one uses couponing here in the U.S. and other trial-generating devices to build the trial for a product. Again, as Bina said earlier, that is exhibiting some very strong repeat purchase rates. So the answer is that, that kind of consumer engagement strategy is indeed building trial and repeat for good premium-priced products. And once consumers adopt them, they stay with them.","Lauren DeSanto - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes, I guess I was just trying to get more of a sense for a kind of like over the horizon of the repeat. So obviously, for the trial, and kind of maybe the initial kind of purchase cycle, but over the horizon of owning, engaging in buying these products, are the premium -- is the premium end of your portfolio kind of being propped up more and more by couponing and promotions? That's kind of what I was trying to get at.","Ian M. Cook","No. Frankly, you would say slightly less, and in any event, they end up obviously being accretive.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our speakers.","Ian M. Cook","I guess, I'm the speaker. Okay. Well, thank you very much for joining us today, and we look forward to reporting our progress in our turbulent world. And a big thank you to all of the Colgate folks around that world who make it happen.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and the most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Table 8 and Table 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website.","Now, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.","John A. Faucher - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Thank you, Jessica. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; Elaine Paik, Treasurer; and, Bina Thompson, Chief Investor Relations Officer.","On a reported basis, our net sales were down 3.5% in the third quarter due to the impact of foreign exchange, the impact of the Venezuelan deconsolidation and the divestiture of our detergent business in the South Pacific. That said, we continued to deliver strong organic sales growth in the third quarter with organic sales up 4.5%, within our targeted range of 4% to 7% despite a continued difficult global macro environment.","Our organic sales growth was driven by a combination of volume growth, excluding the impact of divestitures and the deconsolidation of Venezuela, and improvement in pricing. We delivered organic sales growth in every division this quarter, but I would particularly point out Latin America where we delivered double-digit growth on a double-digit comparison.","Excluding charges from the restructuring program in both periods, gross profit margin was up 160 basis points in third quarter 2016 versus third quarter 2015 led by cost savings from our funding-the-growth initiatives and our restructuring program. This gross margin expansion allowed us to increase worldwide advertising year-over-year, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales. On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was up 140 basis points versus the year ago period.","Excluding the items specified in Table 8 of our press release, our operating profit grew 1% in dollar terms and our earnings per share were $0.73, also up 1% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, operating profit decreased 6% to $1.071 billion and earnings per share in Q3 were $0.78 compared with $0.80 in the third quarter of 2015.","Through strong working capital performance, we continue to grow our free cash flow, further strengthening our balance sheet. Year-to-date, our free cash flow before dividends is up 17% year-over-year and our net cash provided by operations is up 10% year-over-year.","We continue to be faced with macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world coupled with an uncertain currency environment. Despite this, the Colgate team remains committed over the long term to delivering sustainable 4% to 7% organic sales growth with productivity driven gross margin expansion and double-digit earnings per share growth on a dollar basis.","Now, we'll go through performance in the divisions; first, North America. North America posted net sales, volume, organic sales and operating profit growth in the quarter. Market shares are up year-to-date in most of our key categories and our innovation continues to perform well with a strong pipeline planned as we head into 2017.","A few North America highlights from the quarter; our U.S. toothpaste business continues to grow and increase market share, with year-to-date market shares up 30 basis points. In Q3, our market share was up 70 basis points year-over-year. Our new products, like Colgate Optic White High Impact White and Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpastes are driving volume growth at premium prices. Colgate Total Daily Repair has helped the Colgate Total franchise to a 10.5% share of market on a year-to-date basis. Colgate Optic White High Impact White has helped the Colgate Optic White franchise to its highest share ever at 6.8% in the third quarter versus 6.5% year-to-date and 5.7% for full year 2015. We are also seeing sequential and year-over-year improvement in market shares for our sensitivity business, helped by our latest launch of Colgate Sensitive Smart White toothpaste.","Our U.S. manual toothbrush share is up 50 basis points year-to-date. The Colgate 360\u00b0 franchise continues to perform well with market share of almost 23% year-to-date, up from 20.4% for full year 2015. In particular, the recent new product launches of Colgate 360\u00b0 Enamel Health Whitening Toothbrush and the Colgate 360\u00b0 Total Advanced 4 Zone Manual Toothbrush, which just launched in Q3, have added one full share point year-to-date. Tom's of Maine also posted good growth in the quarter with year-to-date market share up 20 basis points versus last year driven by new products, particularly Rapid Relief toothpaste.","In Personal Care, we continued to gain share in both liquid hand soap and body wash, driven by news products. Softsoap Pure foaming hand soap and Softsoap Luminous Oils and Irish Spring Signature For Men body washes are all contributing to year-to-date share growth in Personal Care.","Now, Latin America; the strong organic sales growth posted by Latin America in the first half continued into Q3. Organic sales growth accelerated to 10.5% despite a sequentially more difficult comparison. Latin America also returned to volume growth in Q3 following flat volumes in Q2. All of this is excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela.","While currency and the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation resulted in a net sales decline in this division, productivity from funding-the-growth and pricing helped deliver 410 basis points of operating profit margin expansion. This led to operating profit being down just slightly despite a mid-single digit headwind from foreign exchange.","There are several highlights across the division. In toothpaste, our share year-to-date is up 20 basis points year-over-year. In our Oral Care business, we also saw share gains in mouthwash and power toothbrushes.","In Brazil, our toothpaste share is at 73.2% year-to-date, up 1.1 share points year-over-year. We are seeing strong share growth, both in Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. We are also seeing toothpaste share gains year-to-date in Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay and Puerto Rico.","In Mexico, we maintained toothpaste market leadership with a greater than 80% share behind strength in our Colgate Luminous White brand. We believe we possess solid momentum as we head toward 2017 not just in toothpaste, but across our entire portfolio in Mexico with significant new product activity across many categories.","Other highlights in the quarter for Latin America include market share gains in mouthwash behind the Plax Ice Infinity brand across the region; share gains in the Kids oral care segment behind the Minions regimen; and, share gains on our underarm protection business in Mexico behind Speed Stick, Lady Speed Stick and Stefano.","Also, we had significant new product activity in our household segment; in our fabric care business with Suavitel Superior Care and Suavitel Sweet Pleasures; and, on cleaners with Fabuloso Pure Cleaning continuing to add incremental share year-to-date.","Moving to Europe, Europe delivered another quarter of positive organic sales growth despite a difficult market environment impacted by macroeconomic conditions, FX and retail dynamics. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the quarter with positive volumes and negative pricing in the market. Net sales were down year-over-year impacted by foreign exchange headwinds.","Market share performance in Europe is strong. We continued our toothpaste share leadership with over 35% of the market, flat year-to-date versus year ago. We have seen share of the market gains year-to-date in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, body lotion and fabric softeners.","Q3 highlights in the European division include: we continue to gain significant share in manual toothbrushes in Europe behind the strength of our toothbrush plus whitening pen. This premium-priced product has allowed us to gain more than 200 basis points of market share in the manual toothbrush category year-to-date.","Our share momentum in body wash is continuing, up 40 basis points year-to-date behind both Sanex and Palmolive. On Palmolive, we are expanding the rollout of our Palmolive Gourmet line and are seeing strong results across many markets. While still early days, we are encouraged by the performance of Sanex Men, which includes body washes, shampoo and underarm protection. This line is focused on men's skin health. This launch is also driving solid growth in underarm protection in France and Spain.","Fabric care grew nicely in the quarter in Europe, driven primarily by Germany. We will see further rollout of the Soupline Complete Care line of fabric conditioners in the fourth quarter.","And now, Asia-Pacific; organic sales growth in Asia-Pacific was 3% driven predominantly by volume with pricing up slightly year-over-year. Volume growth in the division was led by the Philippines and India. Net sales were down in the quarter, primarily due to the divestiture of the laundry detergent business in the South Pacific. Operating profit was up slightly year-over-year despite the net sales decline as the benefits from pricing, mix and savings from funding-the-growth and the restructuring program more than offset increases in raw material costs and advertising investment.","Some Q3 highlights in Asia-Pacific include: in the Philippines on a year-to-date basis, our toothpaste share increased 350 basis points versus year ago to 62.8%, driven by strength across multiple price tiers. Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Sensitive have combined to add more than three share points year-to-date. Other markets with share growth in toothpaste included Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam and Pakistan. Both India and the Philippines saw share growth in manual toothbrushes year-to-date with both markets up more than 1% in share of market behind the Colgate Zig Zag franchise. We have many new product launches in the second half of the year that we think will drive continued top-line growth heading into 2017.","Now, Africa\/Eurasia. Our business across the division remained solid despite macroeconomic challenges and continued currency headwinds. Organic sales growth in the quarter was 8.5%, driven by growth across most of the region. The organic sales growth was driven by double-digit pricing, with volume down 2%.","Net sales and operating profit were up year-over-year despite a 7% foreign exchange headwind. Significant margin improvement was driven by strong pricing and funding-the-growth savings, partially offset by higher raw materials and packaging costs. Overall, our toothpaste market shares in Africa\/Eurasia continue to trend positively.","Q3 highlights in the Africa\/Eurasia division include: our toothpaste market share in Turkey continues to grow year-over-year driven by Colgate Total. Colgate Total brand market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date driven by the Colgate Total Pro line with share growth of Pro Breath Health and Pro White.","In South Africa, we continued to grow share year-over-year and our market share is above 50% year-to-date after finishing just below 50% in 2014 and 2015. We had strong new product activity in the quarter behind both toothpaste, with two Colgate Optic White variants launching in South Africa and North Africa\/Middle East, and toothbrushes, with Colgate 360\u00b0 Charcoal Gold and Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive Gum Care.","Moving on to Hill's, Q3 was a challenging quarter for Hill's as strong growth in emerging markets was offset by challenges in developed markets. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the quarter driven by pricing, as volume was down 2%. Net sales were also up and included a benefit from slightly favorable currency. Operating profit grew 3%. Gross margin was up slightly as funding-the-growth savings and pricing offset higher costs. Volume in the quarter was negatively impacted by a difficult retail environment in most developed markets. We continue to see solid growth in the vet and neighborhood pet channels with particularly strong growth online. Developing market volumes were up nicely, driven by Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic + Mobility and Metabolic + Urinary, Hill's","Prescription Diet Derm Defense and Hill's Prescription Diet z\/d.","So to sum up, in what is proving to be a difficult macro environment for consumer packaged goods companies, we are pleased with how 2016 is progressing. We are delivering organic sales growth within our targeted range and Colgate people around the world are working diligently through funding-the-growth initiatives and our global growth and efficiency program to deliver notable gross margin improvement. Our outlook for 2017, while still taking shape, is balanced in order to continue our path of sustainable growth into next year and beyond. Our innovation pipeline is full and we're excited about what is yet to come.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jessica, and Ian will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll first go to Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hey, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So Ian, Hill's organic sales growth weakened considerably in the quarter on a sequential basis. It's been a few years since we saw that level of growth, so I was just hoping you could give us a bit more detail on some of the drivers there, if you view it as more of a quarterly blip or the issues could linger. And also, any commentary around category growth and if you saw any slowdown in your channels in the quarter would be helpful, also. Thanks.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah. Happy to do that, Dara. I must say, it would be remiss of me if I did not repeat the fact that with the array of businesses we have and in the world we are doing business how pleased we are to sustain that 4.5% clip of top-line growth and continue to expand margin and invest in the business to drive that growth.","That said, you're right. As we said in the release and as John called out, the third quarter was challenging for the Hill's business. I would say, first of all, that structurally there is nothing wrong with the Hill's business. We have a very clear model which is driven by the recommendations we get for the Prescription Diet product, which cures ailments of pets, and then takes those pet parents to the Science Diet for maintaining a healthy condition; recommendation-driven, scientifically-proven with an innovation flow that is very, very strong for the business. So, not a portfolio or a structural issue.","I think it is fairly widely reported that there has been a slowdown in consumer purchasing at, what you might call the traditional retail outlets. The neighborhood pet stores and vets continue to grow quite nicely, but of particular note is the explosive growth we are seeing with online. And we see that both in the U.S. and we see that in Europe, and that is clearly a growth that we are very much after, driving Hill's into that online business; and we've seen some fairly dramatic sales growth, but we haven't yet kept pace with the growth of online.","So you see the traditional somewhat pressured. And while we're doing very, very well in ramping up our online business, we have a ways to go to catch the full potential of the business. So, our view is that we will see progress \u2013 sequential progress going forward and we expect to realize the full potential of that online channel as we move our way across the first half of next year. So I guess that's the way I would frame the Hill's business, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, and do you have a rough idea of what kind of share you have online versus the channels you are exposed to currently?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","On the Hill's business, as I suggested in my remarks, we are under-developed online; therefore, our share would be a little bit lower. There is tremendous pet parent reception to the Hill's products online, so as I said, we expect that to improve as we move through the balance of this year and across the first half of next year. But under-developed and an opportunity, and an opportunity we are going after with focus.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now go to Wendy Nicholson from Citi Research.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I just have a quick follow-up on that, if that's okay, and then a real question. But just in terms of the online strategy, is there a danger that you are being too selective? And what I mean by that is, if you go on Amazon, there are only a few Hill's SKUs available, but there's a huge amount of Blue Buffalo and Iams and Eukanuba and whatnot. So when you say you're working to expand, are you expanding on something as oriented to mass as Amazon, because I know you were very careful about not going to the mass fixed retail channel? So that's my just follow-up.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah. I mean, if that wasn't a real question, I'm not sure whether I have to give you a real answer, Wendy. The \u2013 but I shall. The \u2013 I think the learning in this space starts with the consumer, and what we're finding is that the consumer is not just interrogating our online Hill's pet nutrition site for information about the pet nutrition products they may choose to buy for their pets, but they're also interrogating all of the websites out there, including the Amazons of this world. So our e-commerce strategy is to reach the consumers where they are learning about the brand and where we can educate them about the brand, which is a large part of the Hill's model. And that capability exists on all of the e-sites that are out there and, therefore, our e-strategy is broad in that regard. You will see the depth of our portfolio build and you will see a Hill's presence grow sharply online.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then, my second question, and I apologize, but just when you think about those charts that you've shown historically, per capita consumption and how it's been growing steadily in some of the really more emerging markets, are you seeing a tapering off of that given the macro? I'm trying to get underneath the volume slowdown and how much of that is a competitive activity or just how much are consumers in China and India and emerging Southeast Asia or wherever, just not shifting into the toothpaste category, specifically, maybe at the same rate that they had been historically? Thank you","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yes. Thanks, Wendy. Absolutely no basis to conclude that; none. And we continue to see people come into our category. Yes, we have in these emerging markets, as you have noted, taken pricing to offset the transaction impact of the foreign exchange, but quite interestingly in Latin America, for example, we now have returned to volume growth in that geography.","The China situation is very much a continuation of what we described on the last call, which is, again, a slowdown in the traditional purchasing behavior of consumers and a sharp increase in online purchasing, which has led to a destocking process from an inventory point of view that is underway. Our online business doubled, again, in China in the third quarter. Our quarter-on-quarter performance there improved and we expect, as we said on the last call, to see that improvement continue. So China is a particular circumstance that we described in terms of broad-based consumer behavior in the emerging markets; absolutely no indication that moving into our category or staying with our category is any way under pressure.","Operator","And we'll now go to Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Ian, just looking sort of countrywide, could you discuss the increase in local competition in markets like India and China and how you are working to address local competitors; and also, just update us, perhaps, on the UK, Russia. And it sounds like you're actually growing in Brazil and Argentina even though lots of other people aren't; so just a little bit of a look around the world, please.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","I think you left a couple of countries off there, Caroline. So to take your one question by point, we have talked quite extensively, I think, over the quarters about local competitors. They do continue to be there. We see them in Latin America, although the intensity of that local competition has eased somewhat. We see that in India and we have seen that in China; although, again, in China the principal local competitor market share has flattened for the last couple of quarters. I think the underlying trend there, as we mentioned on our previous phone call, is an opportunity to engage.","And this is really a global trend, I would say; think about Tom's in the U.S. But to engage more broadly and deeply in what you might call, generally, the natural space, and this is very much part of our innovation programming that we see going forward.","In Russia, we took some very swift action in the early days of the severe currency devaluation, both structurally, both pricing, in order that we could rebuild our margins and continue to drive the growth of that business where the market share continues to grow in Russia; and quite nicely, I would add. And in the UK, despite all of the post-Brexit doom and gloom, we \u2013 our business is okay in the UK. There's nothing I would call out of particular import in that country.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much. My question was on SG&A. There was a nice reduction this quarter year-over-year and I'm trying to understand where we stand in terms of non-advertising SG&A in terms of total potential to make that more efficient. And specifically, can you remind me how much of that would be in dollars and, if possible, what effect currency has had and continues to have on that reduction over the past few years, and particularly this quarter? Thanks very much.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","I think last time we spoke, Jonathan, you said I could call you Jon. So I'll call you Jon.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Oh, you can call me whatever you want, Ian. We're still on that basis.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","I wouldn't go that far.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","You don't know me that well, yet.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","I think the first thing we would say about SG&A is we were very pleased with the increase in advertising that we saw across all of our operating divisions in this quarter; funded, of course, by the progress we made on gross margin. You're right; we had a very sharp focus on the non-advertising SG&A expense. And of course, that progress was to be delivered by our global growth and efficiency program, and I would comment that that program remains absolutely on track. Of course, you do suffer a little bit of a deleverage in terms of the top-line from the foreign exchange point of view. So while our overheads are down on a dollar basis, the ratio is modestly up, basically in line with prior year because of that deleverage.","And I would also say that when we talked about the global growth and efficiency program, even though people sort of distill it as a restructuring, part of our reason for the titling of it was we are taking some of the savings that we are making and reinvesting in capability; for example, (30:34) capability in some key markets, e-commerce capability in other markets, and traditional advertising and sampling on certain categories and geographies. But you're right, it is our intention through the global growth and efficiency program, which has one more year to run, to continue to control \u2013 drive down if we can, but certainly be selective and choiceful about where we make the non-advertising investments in SG&A.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll now go to Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thank you. On the 2017 outlook, it's nice to see your expectation for a return to double-digit earnings growth next year. So what's your assumption of the macro environment underlying that versus looking at your innovation plan and anticipating greater market share improvement?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah. You know, Olivia, I would \u2013 we provide a 2017 guidance at this time as we do and have done for prior years, but it would be remiss of me if I didn't stress the fact that we are very much at the beginning of our budgeting process, whether that's on a GAAP basis or non-GAAP basis, and I don't think it would be appropriate to provide more color on 2017 at this stage. Obviously, as we usually do, we will come back more fulsomely in January and give you the update on the outcome of our budgeting process.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, and I look forward to that. Perhaps, can we talk a little bit about the pricing that you saw in Q3? Is that primarily continuation of price increases that you've already taken or did you take incremental pricing for this quarter?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","No. No, in some markets we took fresh pricing. You know foreign exchange in some parts of the world continued to be a headwind. We faced the transaction cost impact which we had to offset. And in some material streams, think fats and oils, there was indeed some upward pressure on the underlying cost of the raw material and we, likewise, took pricing to offset that. So, there was indeed new pricing in the quarter.","Actually, the one thing I will say about 2017, although I do think it's been said before, is that the innovation pipeline, as you intimated, that underlines the budgeting process we are going into is very strong.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hi, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. I want to pull a few threads together from our discussion, today, along two vectors. One is e-commerce, obviously, is not very new. And so, are you at risk at feeling \u2013 or are you perhaps even already feeling the same impact from being underrepresented on e-commerce for any other pieces of your business, given some of the volume challenges we've seen, so especially U.S, China, arguably Western Europe? So that's one question.","The other one is, I guess, more broadly and, perhaps, more importantly, just a question of sustainability, right? So \u2013 and I'm not talking about environmental sustainability, just sustainability of your numbers. It just felt like this past quarter was a little bit tougher. So, at lease versus consensus, you missed, it looks like, organic sales growth for all regions but two. You had some disappointments in South Africa; clearly Hill's, which you've talked about; clearly relying a lot more on inflationary pricing in Latin America, now a little bit more in Asia-Pacific; and then, the shares, at least from omission, look like UK might be share loss or flat, China similar, India similar, Mexico similar. So I just want your reaction to that. And I know you're going to be benign on that reaction, but really as an investor or as an analyst, what shouldn't give us pause about those types of facts looking forward? So, thanks for those two.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Sure, Ali; happy to do that. The answer to your first question is, no. We are not concerned about being underrepresented. We hear a lot of our competitors talk about e-commerce, how it is a significant trend and how the full potential of it hasn't been tapped. We are seeing our market share grow and we're very comfortable with the plans we have in place of that \u2013 we have in place, period.","In terms of our business, I guess it's kind of a question and a statement from you in terms of the second half. I think if you look at the macros that everybody entered the third quarter into, there were quite a few, shall we say, surprises on the downside. We have not been quiet about the challenges we have had specific to the Hill's business and we have not been quiet about the e-commerce effect in China, which we commented on in the second quarter.","Our market shares, if you take our global market share, it's up on a constant currency basis. It's up on a volume basis. We are seeing the volume in Latin America come back, even with incremental pricing. And our market shares are strong around the world and we have plans, market by market, that we will be going through for 2017 that we believe will give us the confidence to sustain that 4% to 7% top-line growth in these uncertain times and create the necessary margin expansion to deliver the bottom line.","So all I can really point to is the history of performance, the current performance in the quarter and the clarity of strategy and focus on delivery against that strategy, and then the execution of that that I think we have demonstrated for a while, notwithstanding comments over the years about penetration can't go up, per capita consumption can't go up, markets must slow, a whole plethora of so-called risks against the business which I think, across the company, we have successfully navigated and believe we can continue to do so going forward.","Operator","And we'll now go to Bill Chappell from SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","In the spirit of sneaking in two questions, one on 2017, I know it's in budget process, but any early outlook on where we stand today, what currency headwind would be to top and bottom line? And then, the other one just on the Europe business, I think there was commentary about increased promotional and advertising, I guess, a little more than we've seen the prior couple quarters. Anything going on there? Is it getting more competitive or is just timing of new launches or any more color there? Thanks.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yes. You know, Bill, it'll be easier, actually, because I'm only going to answer one of the questions.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Perfect.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","I think in terms of foreign exchange, that's the reason we go through the budgeting process. We will be extremely fulsome when we meet together in January.","In Europe, I don't think the European environment is a secret or a surprise to anyone. The growth is very muted. On aggregate, categories, if they're up, they're up modestly. More often than not they're flat, and in some cases they are down. And you see competitors who are perhaps overweight in Europe looking to make the most out of it. We manage that as judiciously as we can, as we have done in the past; so nothing that I would call out that is new and different in that environment.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","But something that should continue, I guess, going forward in terms of that level of promotion advertising?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","As it has done in the past, Bill. I mean, again, there's nothing new there.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thanks","Operator","And we'll now go to Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hey, Bill.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, what's the right way to build an e-commerce business for a consumer products company? Everyone talks about omni-channel, but it seems like you're going to have to displace an incumbent and annoy them if you're really going to build out the e-commerce business. So how do you manage that and the push back you're probably going to get from some of your incumbent retailers? And then, can you just tell us how your e-commerce strategy works? Like, is there a head of e-commerce at Colgate or is it embedded in the segments?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Well, I think you have to grow e-commerce businesses like any other business, for the long haul; and build them thoughtfully \u2013 build them thoughtfully. I think the principle that one starts with is that you must service the consumer where they are. And again, we are agnostic. If they prefer to shop online, we are just as happy to have them shop online with the e-commerce site of a traditional retail partner as a standalone retail outlet \u2013 e-commerce outlet. So we go where the consumer is.","And as we think about that, we have globally a central capability, which I would say is strategy and capabilities oriented, that defines our global strategy, the tools and techniques and approach that we will deploy around the world. But then, very much in the operating divisions, and specifically on the ground, we have e-commerce teams and we manage the finances of our e-commerce business on a standalone basis so we understand the investments and the return we are getting from that business.","So as you might imagine, for us it's planful and thoughtful and, of course, it is wrapped around by our overall digital strategy. And I would comment, you may remember the executive, Maria Elisa Carvajal, who presented at CAGNY last year about digital, she today is running our global advertising group; so taking that skill set and wrapping it around everything that we are doing digitally. But thoughtful, for the long haul, in service of the consumer, with the right global capabilities, and then a very clear on-the-ground focus.","Operator","And we'll now go to Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hey, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hello. I was hoping you'd talk a little bit about macro environment in Brazil, kind of category growth rates? And then, specifically, I think the two products that John called out in his script that are doing well in oral care would suggest you're holding on to share as consumers trade down to the more low-end of the category; so, just a macro picture and what you are seeing through your business as a result. And then, just at the risk of missing the chance for someone else to ask it, if you could run through the gross margin bridge it would be great. Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Well, I think the macros in Brazil, Lauren, are pretty clear to all. And I think as we look forward, we don't see a hockey stick bounce-back any time soon. Interestingly, perhaps for reasons of the change there, the foreign exchange has behaved favorably so far this year. The net effect on our categories has been to see a slowdown from a volume point of view, albeit a growth in local currency still around that mid-single digit area largely driven by pricing.","As we have said before about Brazil, our focus is on making sure whatever the category size is we are doing everything possible to stay connected with our consumer and grow market share with our consumer. And John mentioned those two new products. That's what we are focused on while having to take pricing historically as we have done, and I think we have said before that we fully expect the volume of our business to come back once that pricing has settled in. So we remain strategically committed to Brazil. We just think it's going to be a bumpy ride for the next little while.","And if you take the gross profit roll forward for the third quarter, you take the prior year at 58.8% gross profit, pricing was 1.1 points favorable in this quarter. Restructuring and funding-the-growth savings were 2.2 points favorable. And the headwind of material prices was 1.8 negative, and a large part of that was related to transaction costs. The other on the quarter was a favorable 0.1 and that gets you to the 60.4% and the 160 basis points increase.","Now, when we provided our results for the second quarter, you know, we made the comment that our gross profit expansion for the first half of this year had been 150 basis points and, at that time, we said that we expected \u2013 or suggested that you might want to look at the second half as being a similar 150 basis points. Obviously, this quarter was 160 basis points, so the way we would frame the year to go is to say that in the fourth quarter we would expect a sequential \u2013 as it has been for the last three quarters, a sequential improvement in the absolute gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter; sequential from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to close out the year. So we would say that's the way you should be thinking about gross profit.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for the question.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, I want to pick up on that gross margin bridge. When you do the calculations on the numbers you just laid out, it implies that year-to-date productivity in COGS dollars is running around $211 million, which is about $50 million shy of your year-to-date run rate in the last couple of years. So question one on gross margins is \u2013 with fading productivity, is this just timing-related? Should we expect it tick up or would you \u2013 rounding out year two of the most recent productivity program, is the savings winding down?","And then, on inflation, inflation stepped up as a percentage of COGS, I think running around 4.4%, which is above the sub-3% rate for the first half. It's a bit surprising given FX. We would've thought the transaction drag to be abating, but I do note that it's typical with cadence for you historically. For some reason, inflation is lower in the front half and higher in the back. So I guess, on cadence, why is that the historical pattern? And is this nothing more than a replication of a historical pattern or should we underwrite the acceleration of inflation as something you're going to have to contest with on the forward? Sorry, a lot's there.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yes, there is. Starting from the end and coming back to the beginning, I think you are right to say that as foreign exchange lessens, the transaction impact lessons. And if you go back over the quarters we have reported, we are seeing that. But the other aspect of inflation is related to some of the commodities that we had mentioned in world markets where the underlying cost of the material is actually going up, and that is partially offsetting the benefit of the lesser transaction cost.","Now, you know, as we get into our budgeting process and without guiding for 2017, we have so far not seen anything on the horizon from an underlying commodity cost that is a significant headwind. So our going-in position, to be validated as we go through the process, is no immediate underlying commodity issues and you've seen the forward projections on foreign exchanges yourself. So I guess that would be the answer to the second half.","On the funding-the-growth, I wouldn't get obsessive about the year-to-date this year. Our funding-the-growth program is very much in the company. This is not exactly a linear predictable thing in terms of all of the projects we have, some bigger than others. Interestingly, our pipeline for 2017 is fuller than it has been in some prior years, so I would not say this is a slowdown to be expected going forward.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Iain Simpson with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has our next question.","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)","Thank you very much. You're probably bored of talking about them by now, but just on those adjusted gross margins, Ian, thanks very much for the breakdown you've already given. I just wondered if you could remind us how much, if any, tailwind you've got on the gross margin level from the deconsolidation of Venezuela.","And a second much broader question, channel shift is clearly causing some disruption in both Hill's and China. I just wondered if there were any other areas you'd highlight where we're beginning to see channel shift occurring and maybe we should keep an eye on them for the potential for business disruption in the coming quarters. Thank you","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yes, I think e-commerce is \u2013 digital, in general, is a transformational trend in business, in general. But I think in terms of our businesses, what we are seeing is that that business, which is to say Hill's, and that geography is particularly leading edge. You can rest assured, as we answered to an earlier question, that our focus on e-commerce is a global one. And we are experimenting vigorously, even where e-commerce markets may be nascent, to try and drive as aggressively as we can; so, nothing I would particularly call out. And in terms of the gross margin, you're right. Venezuela is in there.","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)","Thank you. Have you quantified the benefit from deconsolidating Venezuela at all, or any sort of indication?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","No, we haven't, Iain. There was a lot of clamor before the deconsolidation about the contribution to the top-line. Since the deconsolidation, that has gone away and now the clamor is on the gross margin; and, we had likewise resisted providing that single country breakout. We don't provide single country breakout information, and in 2017 it will all be behind us.","Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)","Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Sure.","Operator","And we'll now go to Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you for taking the question. I know we've spent a lot of time on the call talking about Hill's, but I was hoping to just follow up. Beyond some of the channel shifts that you're saying, has there been any change in the competitive landscape in that particular business, specifically within the developed markets? And subsequently, have there been any notable \u2013 maybe the price gaps have been shifting relative to what you're seeing with Hill's versus the competition? Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","I would say the broad answer to that question, Erin, is no on both. I think, again, if you take it from the point of view of strategy, our strategy is to partner aggressively with all e-commerce channels, because that's how the consumer is shopping. So \u2013 be they e-commerce sites with traditional retailers or standalone. So if you take that definition, there are no new competitive players out there that we perhaps are not already engaged with. And, obviously, we have clear pricing strategies for our brands. Retailers are the ones who ultimately dictate what the shelf or online price is, but we are quite disciplined about the price movement of our business and I wouldn't call out anything unusual in that regard. No.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hey, Steve.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks. Hey, so it was discussed earlier, but pricing this quarter was, again, really strong in Latin America and Africa\/Eurasia, but I wanted to come back to it because it's the first time in a while that the magnitude of the pricing that you've delivered has outpaced the magnitude of the FX headwind you faced, if that makes sense. So I'd just love to get a better idea of to what extent you feel you can continue current pricing as you play catch-up and price away the inflation that you've been absorbing over the past year. Or conversely, if we should expect pricing now in those regions to more quickly decelerate, especially as some currencies, like you mentioned Brazil, have recently trended more favorably. And if it does retrace lower, do you feel the consumer environment is healthy enough to \u2013 for you to see an offsetting uptick in volume? Thanks.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yes. You know, I think as we entered the year, we felt that volume would be a larger contributor to our growth than in prior years. As we worked our way into the year, we found foreign exchange continued to bedevil and we were, of necessity, forced to take pricing to protect our margin and rebuild the margin, which would \u2013 after three years of that gross profit being flat, to rebuild that gross profit so that we could invest in the business. And as I said in response to an earlier question, we've already begun to see some of that transaction impact lesson as foreign exchange lessons, but then we have been faced with some underlying increase in commodity prices, particularly in fats and oils, and that has led to pricing in selective markets.","All of that said, there is nothing that we see that suggests that faced with either underlying commodity pressures or foreign exchange that goes in a different direction than everybody is expecting, we believe we still have the capacity to take pricing to protect the gross profit and that the consumer continues to stay with the brand \u2013 the brands through those pricing actions. So we don't have that concern, Steve.","Operator","We'll now go to Mark Astrachan from Stifel.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, and good morning for the \u2013 at least the next couple of minutes here.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hey, mark.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I went to ask about long-term sales algorithm sort of a different way. If end demand or global adoption of oral care isn't changing, as you said earlier, but had at least in the near term slightly weakening, that would seem to put some increased pressure on personal care and home care to perform better. I guess, given that, could you talk about trends in those two categories? I know you likely won't sort of give specifics about it, but could you talk about whether you're gaining or losing share in those categories, call it, over the last 12 months or 18 months, how you think about spend given it seems competition for those businesses is increasing these days?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah. Well, actually, I'm not sure the premise of the question is right, because we still think there is terrific potential for sales growth in oral care as defined today and defined more broadly, which is how we do think about it. And the pet nutrition business, which as I said in response to an earlier question, we don't see anything structurally wrong with that business apart from dealing with reaching the consumers where they are shopping. So we don't think it puts more, 'underlying pressure' on the other businesses.","As you know from our strategic prioritization, after oral and pet comes personal; and we have some great brands, as you know. We have some terrific successful innovation, whether it's on Palmolive, whether it's on Sanex, which we have talked about before, all of which have been successfully deployed in existing geographies and all of which have legs to transfer to other geographies. So we'll continue to advance all four of our businesses behind the strategy we have for each, the innovation we have for each and the support we have for each in the respective markets, but we don't think there's an underlying \u2013 because of one quarter's slow down on organic from Hill's, we don't think there's an underlying weakness in oral care or pet nutrition that needs to be structurally addressed by acceleration in the other businesses.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Could you at least talk about, directionally, whether you're gaining or losing share in those categories or maybe just sort of how we should all broadly think about it, because the disclosures, while yearly, aren't given on a quarterly basis?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","We do fine in those businesses. I'm not sure what a market by market litany of share would actually give to the quality of assessment. So the businesses do well.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions. I'll turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Ian M.

This call is being recorded, and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.","John Faucher ","Thanks, Paula. Good Morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations.","Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website.","Joining me this morning are Noel Wallace, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. I will begin with some thoughts on our performance before discussing our updated 2019 guidance. We'll then open it up for Noel's Q&A session.","The third quarter marked a further step in our plan to return to sustainable organic sales growth. Throughout 2019, we are focused on innovating around the core of our business, driving growth in adjacent segments and expanding our availability in faster growth markets and channels. Along with higher levels of consumer-facing spending, these strategies are paying off in broad-based growth across our businesses.","Q3 marked the third quarter in a row where we delivered a combination of both volume and pricing growth on an organic basis. Volume was up in every division, and pricing was positive in every division, except for one. Our revenue growth management strategies are driving pricing growth as we focus on premium innovation.","On a geographic basis, we saw organic sales growth in five of our six divisions. Importantly, we returned to organic sales growth in Asia Pacific, including delivering organic sales growth in the Greater China region. We drove a good combination of developed market growth, plus 3.5%; and emerging market growth, plus 6%. And from a category standpoint, we again delivered organic sales growth across all four of our businesses: Oral Care, Personal Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition.","In order to drive this growth, we continue to invest behind our businesses. Total advertising spending was up nicely in the quarter. In particular, I would point to Hill's where a significant increase in spending over the past few years behind our purpose-driven marketing has been a key driver of the organic sales growth.","We were also pleased to close the Filorga transaction on September 19th, continuing the expansion of our Personal Care portfolio into skin health, although we point out that Filorga's results from the acquisition date through quarter end were immaterial to our results of operations and were not included in our Q3 results.","On the sustainability front, we received recognition from the Dow Jones Worldwide Sustainability Index, taking the lead in our industry sector for the first time. Back in September, Noel discussed our new recyclable toothpaste tube. We are currently in production and it will be on shelf under the Tom's brand in November.","Moving to our Q3 results. Our net sales grew 2% in the quarter. We delivered 4.5% organic sales growth, with 3% unit volume growth and 1.5% favorable pricing. This was partially offset by foreign exchange impact of minus 2.5%. On a GAAP basis, our gross margin was even with Q3 2018. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it was down 20 basis points year-over-year. Pricing was a positive 70 basis point impact to gross margin in the third quarter, while our productivity programs drove a 240 basis point benefit. This was offset by a 310 basis point drag from raw materials inflation, which included foreign trend -- foreign exchange transaction costs.","Other, primarily mix was unfavorable by 20 basis points. Our stronger growth in emerging markets relative to our developed markets business put some slight pressure on our gross margin. On an absolute basis, advertising investment was up 7% year-over-year.","On a percent of sales basis, advertising was up 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and advertising spending, our SG&A expenses were up year-over-year in the third quarter on an absolute basis, but down as a percent of sales, as we were able to offset higher compensation and other costs with savings from our productivity programs.","On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share of $0.67 were up 12% year-over-year in Q3. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018, acquisition costs in 2019 and a charge related to U.S. tax reform in 2018, diluted earnings per share were down 1.5% to $0.71. Our free cash flow through the first nine months of 2019 was $1.9 billion, which was up 3% versus prior year.","Taking a quick look at the divisions. North America net sales grew 1.5% in the quarter, driven by 1% pricing growth and 0.5% volume growth. There was no FX impact in the quarter. Our performance in e-commerce where we continue to see strong share growth and other non-measured channels, was partially offset by declines in food retail. We also remain very pleased with the performance of our skin health businesses, Elta MD and PCA Skin. Our focus in North America continues to be on the premiumization of our Oral Care portfolio through innovation.","Colgate Total SF and Colgate Optic White drove pricing growth in the quarter, and we have further innovation to come in the next few quarters, particularly on Optic White. Europe posted a 5% decline in net sales, with organic sales flat and foreign exchange minus 5%. Growth in Northern Europe behind the relaunch of Colgate Total and our whitening brands, was offset by weakness in Western Europe, where the retail environment continues to be difficult. As with North America, we expect significant premium innovation to drive improved price mix going forward, as we have a full calendar of naturals innovation in the first half of 2020.","Latin America net sales were up 3%, as 4.5% volume and 3.5% pricing were only partially offset by 5% negative foreign exchange. Our 8% organic sales growth was broad-based, as we saw organic sales growth in every hub for the third quarter in a row. While Brazil benefited from the year ago comparison, which included some impact from the trucker strike, the underlying business remains solid and pricing was up nicely, driven by premium products like Protex Face and Colgate Total 12.","Net sales in Asia Pacific were up 2.5%. Volume growth was 2%. Pricing grew 1%, while foreign exchange was minus 0.5%. Organic sales growth of 3% was our first positive result in six quarters. Importantly, we delivered organic sales growth in the Greater China region in the quarter, driven by improvements in both volume and pricing.","While the China improvement in the third quarter was ahead of our expectations, we remain laser-focused on executing our plan to return the business to sustainable profitable growth through improved go-to-market capabilities, China-specific innovation and improved brand marketing. Asia-Pacific growth was led by toothpaste, particularly our naturals portfolio and Colgate anti-cavity toothpaste.","The Africa\/Eurasia division delivered 5% net sales growth in the quarter, its best result in several years. Organic sales growth of 6% consisted of 4% pricing growth and 2% organic volume growth. FX was a 2% drag on net sales growth, while our newly established joint venture in Nigeria was a 1% benefit to net sales and volume growth. The organic sales growth in Africa\/Eurasia was consistent across all hubs and we are particularly pleased with our strong performance in Eurasia in the quarter where our focus on faster growth channels like discounters is paying off.","Momentum on our pet food business continued in Q3, as Hill's delivered 8.5% net sales growth and 10% organic sales growth. Hill\u2019s' 6.5% volume growth was their best results since 2006. Pricing was positive at 3.5%, while foreign exchange was negative at minus 1.5%. Our core innovation strategy continues to deliver robust growth in North America and is now beginning to pay off internationally as we rollout the Science Diet relaunch around the globe.","In August, Hill's partnered on NBCUniversal's annual Clear the Shelters Pet adoption campaign in the U.S. This year's campaign was its most successful ever, with over 160,000 pets adopted over the course of the campaign, an increase of 57% versus last year's program. Hill's earned over 9,000 displays, which helped drive the strong U.S. volume growth in the quarter.","Moving on to guidance. We continue to expect net sales to be flat to up low-single-digits. We have raised our organic sales growth target to plus 3% to 4%, with the full-year growth rate roughly in line with year-to-date growth. We now expect our full-year gross margin to be down slightly on both a GAAP basis and excluding the items referenced in the earnings press release. We do expect gross margin to be up year-over-year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter. We would expect advertising as a percent of sales for the full year to be fairly consistent with the year-to-date level. We now expect our full-year 2019 tax rate to be between 24% and 24.5%, both on a GAAP basis and excluding the items referenced in the earnings press release.","Our previous guidance was for 25% to 26%. This change includes the recent reduction in corporate taxes in India. As mentioned on the Q2 call, we will moderate our share repurchase activity for the next several quarters in order to return to a leverage ratio more in line with our ratio before the Filorga transaction. Based on current spot rates, we expect the GAAP earnings per share to be down low-single-digits for the year. Excluding the items referenced in the earnings press release, we still expect earnings per share to decline mid-single-digits for the year.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel for the Q&A. Paula?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. First, we'll go to Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","So, Noel, question on the gross margin and for John as well. How do we think about what caused the weakness in Q3 in gross margin sequentially from the last quarter and what changes, if anything, to drive the positive inflection in Q4 and into next year? Thank you.","Noel Wallace ","Sure. Thanks, Steve. So yes, we're disappointed with the gross margin in the third quarter. A couple things that happened that we weren't expecting. Obviously, the sales mix, as John outlined, with more growth coming with emerging markets had a softening impact on the margin line. This significant growth we saw on the Hill's business, which quite frankly was extraordinary. We're very pleased about that. Obviously, the mix more toward Science Diet versus prescription diet, obviously, compressed the margin a bit. Raw materials were slightly worse than we were expecting as we went into the quarter, as was foreign exchange, slightly worse than we were expecting as we went into the quarter.","So overall, a couple surprises that came through. We're focused on the premiumization. We're focused on accelerating, funding the growth through the back half -- through the fourth quarter, excuse me. And obviously, getting the mix right across the regions and that's where we'll focus our attention going into the fourth quarter. So, we're confident we'll see fourth quarter margins rebound as we finish out the year.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman ","Okay. Thank you. I was curious if you could talk a little bit about trends in North America. And I know Nielsen data clearly does not tell the full picture of your Oral Care business. But then seeing the results this quarter, it feels like we're still very much more price-mix heavy than volume heavy. So if you can talk a little bit about how that Total relaunch is progressing? What you're now seeing in terms of repeat, and if it -- maybe a thought that the pricing has gone possibly a little bit too far on that brand? Thanks.","Noel Wallace ","Thanks, Lauren. Yeah, let me talk broadly on Colgate Total. Obviously, we're really pleased with the relaunch. Our shares are up on a global basis versus where they were pre-launch. As you know, we took a 10% price increase on that business globally. Particularly as it relates to the U.S., we took a 20% price increase on that business. There has been some elasticity that we've seen come through. Our share is down about three-tenths of a share point versus where we were before we started the relaunch. A little bit disappointing, we expected it to be flat to up. We're in the midst of looking at our messaging and ensure we get that corrected as we continue to accelerate investment behind that business moving forward.","But pleased given the significance of the price increase that were slightly down, but more importantly, we'd like to see that turn around as we get some of the go-to-market and some of the marketing plans more sharp in the balance of the year. But globally, pleased, as I mentioned, the fact that we've gotten a 10% increase and we're growing share is a real progress for us. And we'll continue to put the investment behind that business as we move through the balance of this year and into the first half of next year.","It's consistent with our -- with our strategy to get the core businesses moving and we'll look to relaunch some other core businesses in 2020. We will start to outline that as we move into the first quarter press release. Some of the excitement that we have on some of the innovation coming down that, that will come with more pricing as you would expect and more premiumizations. All-in-all, I think we're pleased with Colgate Total overall.","The U.S. was a bump this quarter for sure. We were expecting a little bit more. It's been a tough promotional environment in the U.S. Other channels, non-tracked channels continue to do well, but not as well as we had in the second quarter, so a bit lumpy in that regard. We're very focused in the U.S., specifically on premium innovation and getting that right as we move into 2020.","Our revenue growth management principles that we're starting to embed across the entire commercial organization, we see the discipline coming behind that. And we're quite optimistic that we'll see gross margins continue to improve as we move through the balance of 2020 and we'll see the shares come back as we start to put the premiumization strategy in place.","Operator","And moving on, we'll go to Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","So tremendous top line performance in pet again this quarter. I guess the question for me is how does that compare to -- how does that compare to your plan coming in and how does it influence your thinking, if at all, going forward? Relatedly, when do you think you might see more of a profit inflection in that business, commensurate with the top-line momentum?","And then if I could tack on a follow-on to Steve's Strycula question at the open. And I hear you on the puts and takes on gross margin in the quarter. But just as a follow-up on that, how might this quarter influence your thinking about realistic gross margin objectives looking into 2020? Because your 2019 represents, I think, the fourth time in about -- fourth time in five years that Colgate has come into the year targeting material gross margin improvement only to finish effectively flattish or down on the year. And I get the macro pressures. But I also see there is a recurring trend. So just how do you protect against being kind of overreaching again in 2020 and having to course correct midyear? Thanks.","Noel Wallace ","Thanks, Steve. Let me get -- address Hill's first. Obviously, an extraordinary quarter for the Hill's business. The Science Diet relaunch, which is largely driven by the U.S. right now, we're in the midst of rolling that out through the rest of the world. So, we're quite excited about what that will bring moving forward. But the U.S. had just an exceptional quarter, particularly behind Science Diet. I think everything that we've been talking about in terms of driving the core, increase in the advertising, getting the pricing right on that business, getting the go-to-market and new channel distribution right. In fact, we were up 14% in farm and feed in the quarter and that just is a result of increased focus on some of these emerging channels.","Our e-commerce shares grew eight-tenths of a share point. Our pet specialty share grew eight-tenths of a share point. So, all of this bodes well for sustainable growth moving forward. We see the continued growth in the pet category.","Prescription diet has a significant amount of innovation coming in 2020, and we'll see that continue to play through the business. That obviously plays out in a much higher margin for the business. So the gross margins will improve as we move forward. We were surprised a bit, again, on the gross margin and the raw material increases that we saw on vitamins and other agricultural products in the quarter. The business has taken price increases at the beginning of the quarter, behind both the Science Diet business and the prescription diet business in order to recover that and build gross margins moving forward. So on Hill's, very pleased. It's sustainable. It's broad-based. And we've got the good news coming in terms of international expansion of SD and some good innovation coming on prescription diet. So all bodes well there.","On your margin question, obviously, coming back to the core of our strategy, which is driving the core businesses with price increases in innovation, getting adjacencies right. Obviously, we're very pleased with how the portfolio is shaping up around skin health and the significant margin accretion over the long-term that will bring to our business and the growth that will bring to our business. The adjacent segments that we're going into, particularly around products with natural ingredients, particularly around sensitivity and gum around the world will bode well, channel expansion into pharmacies where we under index.","Likewise, we have significant expansion opportunities in that channel, which will drive improved gross margin moving forward. So listen, we're disappointed. We know our history has been about consistent gross margin improvement. We are laser-focused on delivering the productivity through the P&L to make that happen moving forward. And I think as you see, the top-line continue to grow, which we've been focused on throughout this year. You're going to see the gross margins come behind that as we move through 2020.","Operator","And Jason English with Goldman Sachs has our next question.","Jason English ","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. I appreciate it. I'm going to build off of both of those points, real quick on pet. I see your incredibly strong numbers and congrats on that. I also see Nestle strong numbers on its legacy premium brand coming out the U.S. It does beg the question of whether or not we're seeing a broader market movement, pivoting back away from grain-free to some of the products you're offering and Nestle is offerings as well. I'd love it, if you could comment on that, particularly in the wake of the DCM concerns out there?","And then coming back to gross margin real quick. I hear you on the mix components, but I'm nonetheless really surprised when we delve into North America and see 220 basis points of gross margin compression. Despite sort of an easy comp, sequentially your margins eroded a lot more in that market. Inflation pressure stepped up a lot, which seems to defy the broader cost curves we're looking at. And frankly, it leaves me a bit confounded. And I love it, if you could delve deeper there and just to illuminate what's happening there so we can better understand it?","Noel Wallace ","Sure. Jason. Let me take the Hill's question first. Obviously, DCM has had an impact. I mean, I think there has been a return particularly to products like ours, which are very science-based and there\u2019s tremendous trust that we built over the years behind our brand. And as John mentioned, really moving a lot more advertising to our purpose-driven advertising I think has created great credibility and resonates with the consumer and the pet owners. And you've seen that translate into growth.","Obviously, we're very premium priced. The broader market, which is, obviously, you see some of the competitors move into grocery. We think that's also afforded an opportunity for us to continue to differentiate ourselves, which I think talks to more long-term sustainability for that business moving forward. And the innovation pipeline, as I mentioned, is rich and robust. And they're bold on the pricing. So, I expect that business will continue to be -- perform very well for us.","Now specifically on North America margins, obviously, very disappointed with what happened in the quarter. Both volume and pricing was a little below our expectations. Mix worked really against us in the quarter, both from a channel standpoint, from a sizing standpoint and from a category standpoint. So, we had all three moving against us in the quarter and we need to address that.","And the team has put plans in place for the fourth quarter to get that turned around and ensuring as we move into the budget plans for 2020, that we address that. Manufacturing costs, likewise, were a little bit higher. That was the surprise. We're all over that, and we'll address that as we move into 2020. We expect Q4 to be up in North America. There will be some continued headwinds as we get the channels and the sizes are sorted out in terms of where we see the business. But likewise, I think, as we've seen across the total business that we'll see margins improve in the fourth quarter.","The other areas, we're seeing lifts on promotion are not delivering what we expected. Obviously, a slightly more competitive environment with some of the smaller brands in the category. And I think as we continue to accelerate our spending, particularly in digital where we can gain, I believe an advantage, we're going to see that, hopefully, translate back to bigger brands growing faster. So, those are the components. We're on it. We're not pleased at all with it. And likewise, as we go into North America as we continue to accelerate the skin business, that will bode well for margins over the longer term.","Operator","And moving on, we'll go to Wendy Nicholson of Citi.","Wendy Nicholson ","Hi. Just following up on that. First, on the skin care business, you've got three acquisitions. It sounds like you're pleased with each of them. It sounds like that each kind of fell a different niche. But can you comment on sort of any further appetite there? Do you feel like you kind of are where you want to be in skin with those three different businesses?","But then my bigger question first, really just a follow-up. My bigger question is, you talked about maybe expanding the sort of relaunch initiative or program like you have with Total and Hill's this year, into some new categories next year. So bottom line, I'm wondering will operating margin go up next year? I care less about gross margin. I care more about how much you plan to spend on marketing? Thank you.","Noel Wallace","Thanks, Wendy. Yes, on your second question, we're not going to guide yet on 2020 as we get into the first quarter. We will give you deep transparency in terms of how we're thinking about margins and operating margins. But overall, if you take where we've been historically, I think you can interpret that we would obviously like to see all those moving in the right direction. Specifically, on the skincare, as you said, we're really pleased. I just returned from a two-week trip around the world meeting with some of the Filorga people, welcoming them into the Colgate family both in Europe and in China.","And I was deeply excited from what I saw from a quality of talent standpoint, from the plans they have in place, from the growth they are delivering and the significant gross margins that they have on those businesses. The plans are solid. They're focused in terms of areas that we believe we can win in and where they believe they can win in on the Filorga business. So, I'm pleased they\u2019re not trying to stretch themselves into different areas. They're very focused on the pharmacy channel. They are very focused on online and obviously building their travel retail business out, which is exciting.","On Elta and PCA, again, terrific growth in the quarter for the business and we're now looking at the 2020 plans in terms of how we want to expand those businesses, which will be exciting. Obviously, the margins allow us to have a lot more flexibility as we move forward and the growth in the category looks terrific. So overall, we're quite pleased with what we have. Never say never, but our focus is to continue to accelerate the growth on those businesses from a top-line and a bottom-line standpoint.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.","Robert Ottenstein ","Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if we can return to Oral Care. You mentioned that you were very pleased with the Colgate Total relaunch. I was wondering, first, if you can give us a sense of how much kind of global sales are up for that franchise? And then perhaps go into a little bit more detail globally on how you're doing with therapeutics? How are Elmex and Meridol doing? What markets they've been gaining traction in and maybe how much those are up? And then touch on naturals, particularly in countries that there have been issues and opportunities in China, Russia, and India? Thank you.","Noel Wallace ","Yes, we won't comment specifically on the sales numbers. I will tell you that the toothpaste organic growth in the quarter was the highest we've had in six quarters, which is terrific for us. We saw the growth obviously accelerate as we roll Total across Latin America. Mexico and Brazil, our two largest markets, we've had significant success on the rollout of Colgate Total in those markets. Our premium share of the toothpaste segment in both Mexico and Brazil is up.","The shares on Colgate Total in Brazil are up about 1.5, in Mexico about 0.5. So, they look terrific and driving, obviously, more of our business into the premium space. Overall, the shares look good on Colgate Total and we're pleased with what we're seeing. Relative to the second part of your question on pricing, the pricing -- I can't remember what you asked me, Robert?","Robert Ottenstein ","On Elmex and Meridol, and then also on the naturals?","Noel Wallace ","Thank you. Thank you. Yes, Elmex, as you've heard previously, we launched it in Latin America, specifically in Brazil. That business is doing well. We launched it in the pharmacy channel across both toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouth washes, are seeing great growth on toothpaste, seeing really good growth on toothbrushes. Mouthwash has been a bit soft.","Likewise, we launched in China online. We've generated about a six-tenths of a share point in China on that business, which given the number of brands online, that is a good result for us. And we launched it in the NAMET region, the Northern Africa region. And that continues to do well. The other area was in Turkey with Meridol, which I think we talked about a little bit in the second quarter call how pleased we are with the performance of that business in Turkey that is taking us -- taking the business to market leadership with the success we've had behind both Meridol and Colgate. So overall, we're pleased with that and we're in the midst of thinking about the key markets we'll expand in 2020.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys. So, I just have one kind of broad question, taking a step back a little bit. And we see kind of among your peers the kind of the anomaly with a little bit of difficulty -- certainly relative difficulty taking pricing, particularly with such a big innovation rollout with Total and commodities should have been allowing you to take prices. But it was tougher for you than others. Why do you think that is? Is there particularly different category competitive dynamic? For example, Sensodyne's parent company going public in the next couple of years. And I guess related to that, you've in the past have been pretty adamant about saying that you are investing enough and 2019 is kind of one year, reinvestment year rather than a multi-year investment year. Does anything you've seen so far -- again, the category competitive dynamic, ROIs done on the promotional spend, you mentioned a moment ago. Anything at all that gives you pause on the assertion previously that this isn't a multi-year reinvestment phase for Colgate? And I guess, underlying that whether you're going to have to increase reinvestment even further into 2020? Thanks.","Noel Wallace","So, let me take the pricing question first, Ali. We are really pleased with the pricing on a -- we've had -- on a two-year stack, we've had four quarters of sequential growth on pricing, so it looks terrific for us. And I think in an environment that we compete in today, which is certainly very competitive around the world to get that pricing through not only on Colgate Total but across our franchises is terrific. The focus on the core business, bringing real value to consumers into the trade and delivering increased prices through that, we believe is working and that will be the continued strategy moving forward.","Your second point on advertising and investment, listen, we need to continue to investing behind our business and we need to continue to accelerate share growth across the world. We've got a robust pipeline of innovation coming. We're going to continue to support that. We've got big core relaunches coming that we will support. But obviously, getting the gross margin going and continued productivity across the P&L is where we are laser-focused on right now. And that's how we'll construct the P&L for 2020 in terms of how we look at using operating margin, both from a gross margin and the [BO] standpoint to help fund the advertising that we'll need to drive the top-line.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong ","Great. Thanks. Good morning. First, just on the Optic White innovation North America. I would imagine that that's smaller than the Total relaunch. So, can you talk about other things that you're planning to do in the market to help offset the higher base? And then just a follow-up on the advertising. You've been increasing advertising spend for four consecutive quarters now. Organic growth has been steadily improving. But -- like where or how are you going to improve return on your spend because you have some markets and brands that have really taken off like Hill's and you said you were going to improve in China and you did, but then North American growth has now decelerated. So, is there a need to potentially increase investment even more aggressively from here or what's going to improve the ROI on that? Thank you.","Noel Wallace ","Sure. Thanks, Olivia. So on the North America question, they've got a great pipeline behind Optic White in terms of some of the innovation coming, which will include premiumization. As you can imagine that, likewise, we'll be looking at premiumization around the world on Optic White. In fact, we have introduced a 20-pound toothpaste behind Optic White in UK to give you a sense of the boldness of how we're thinking about some of the premiumization strategies.","Likewise, when you take the trend towards natural ingredients in the U.S., you'll see expansions across the Colgate portfolio as obviously a step up on our Tom's of Maine business as well, which we think will be important in terms of driving more premiumization in the North America business and driving more share growth. Relative to pricing and what we need in advertising around the world, listen, let me come back to revenue growth management and how we're trying to embed that across the world, across the commercial organization.","We talked about it a bit. But as I travel, I'm getting more encouraged by the fact that it's taking on deep commercial ownership. So historically, we would take pricing and the directive for that came out of the marketing organization. Now, we're taking our GM across the entire commercial enterprise and holding everyone accountable for delivering pricing opportunities moving forward, not just the marketing folks. So, this is going to be shared responsibility to really go after how we drive ASP, which will ultimately bode well, I think, for the margin. And the spending that we'll need around the world to continue to fund the opportunities that we have.","So, on the advertising and the P&L dynamics for 2020, we will come back to you in the first quarter and give you a lot more clarity on how we're thinking about things. The return on investment, we'll see really coming through as we continue to focus on these big core businesses, which we need to get turned around. And that's where we're going to get the best return on investment, putting a lot more support behind data analytics, particularly in the digital space where we have the ability to really cultivate learning in terms of what's working, what's not. And that will obviously improve our ROI as we move forward.","Operator","And Kevin Grundy with Jefferies, has our next question.","Kevin Grundy","Noel, question on North America and specifically the competitive environment currently and looking forward. So in a context overall, there is a consensus view that industry participants have been relatively rational from a pricing and promotion perspective over the past 12 months with pricing that was put into place in the fall. But as the industry starts to cycle this pricing and with commodity headwinds now less onerous than they have been, it would be great to get your updated thoughts on the promotional environment and specifically the potential for competitive intensity to pick up your, potentially, the detriment of the profit pool. So, any thoughts there would be helpful? Thank you.","Noel Wallace","Yes, I think the environment has been more rational, to be sure, around the world, particularly in North America. I would say the one exception would be Brazil where we've seen some odd pricing in some of the categories, which just doesn't make any sense. But specifically, as it relates to North America, we've seen -- obviously, a lot of our competitors are working together with the trade, everyone is looking to drive category value. And that's what we need to do. We need to ensure that our innovation is premium. We need to ensure that it is driving category dollars and that's where everyone wins in that regard.","We've seen certainly over the last six months to nine months a little bit of pickup in some of the smaller brands, the trade picking up some of those and pushing those. So in the long-term, my view is the big brands, as they get more dialed in on digital, they get more dialed in on how they do data-driven marketing, you'll see opportunities for the big brands to continue to increase the residents and the relatability that we have with consumers. And that's what's key as we compete against some of these smaller brands.","So overall, a rational competitive environment, a little bit more competition from smaller brands. You see a -- the promotional lifts, not as high as they used to be. But I don't see sales on promotion increasing, which is a good news. So, we need to get the innovation right and the premiumization right in North America and we'll be off to the races.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust .","Bill Chappell ","Just a little bit follow-up on Mexico in particular, but all of LatAm. We've certainly heard from some of your peers and multinationals that there is some slowing there. And so, I guess, maybe what you're seeing for the key market? And then also your ability to -- in line with all the rest of the questions today -- take price as we go into next year with that in mind?","Noel Wallace","Sure. So, let me take the two big markets, Brazil and Mexico. I'll take Brazil first. Brazil, obviously, up versus where we were last year, a little slowdown in the third quarter but the consumer continues to be a pretty robust there. Our business was up double digits in the third quarter. Obviously, a slightly easier comp versus where we were with the trucker strike, which partially hit us in the third quarter last year. But again, as I look at Brazil, and quite frankly, Latin America, good pricing, good volume, following good pricing that we took in the second quarter of 2019. So after aggressive pricing, we saw volume come back very nicely across the region. And we think that really bodes well for the underlying health of Latin America, specifically Brazil looks pretty good.","Mexico, on the other hand, a little softer. We saw a little softness in the quarter versus what we've seen in the first half of the year. I think there is some uncertainty in terms of politically and economically where things are going there. Our strategy is the same. We're focused on premiumization. As I mentioned earlier, the total business is performing exceptionally well in that market. We're pushing naturals, natural ingredients into the portfolio as well. We've seen that as a significant ASP premium to the market. We are pushing sensitivity in that market. We have seen some nice growth on that as well. So overall, it's a premiumization strategy across the region. But as we see some of the markets slow, specifically Mexico, we will dial that up.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in. If you can speak a little bit on Asia Pac, it showed the sequential improvement on the headline but not on a two-year stack. But particularly on the volumes, I think you kind of -- you inflected volumes there and you accelerated. Is that related to the -- can we read into the China destocking and improvement that you called about in the second half? Is that how you see? Is that according to plan? Anything you'd call out on China or Asia Pac in particular? Thank you.","Noel Wallace","Sure. Thanks, Andrea. Yes, we're pleased. Obviously, as John mentioned, with Asia, it's a little ahead of our expectations. We saw growth across every one of our hubs. It was broad-based and strong in terms of volume and price. And we feel that the momentum we have across Asia will continue. The particular call out was China. Obviously, a journey to get here, and we feel the strategies we've put in place in terms of our go-to-market changes, our portfolio changes, how we're working across the different retail environments, particularly online and the structural changes that we made in that organization are all starting to pay off, as we saw China deliver its first positive organic since Q4 of 2017.","So again, it's been a while to get there, but we feel we're in a very good place and we'll continue to see that growth accelerate as we move into the fourth quarter and as we look at the 2020 plans, we would certainly hope to see that business continuing to grow. We realize that a lot of our competitors are getting significant growth out of China, so this bodes well that we continue to see our business accelerate and the strategies that we've put in place are starting to work.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go to Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Two questions, I guess. One is just on Hill's. Maybe talk about how you're thinking about sustainability? Maybe was there any benefit from incremental channel fill from some of the new product launches in the U.S. in particular and just kind of how you're thinking about that?","And then back to gross margin, I guess I'm a little surprised. You're surprised at what happened in the quarter. You talked about taking pricing on Hill's early in the quarter, so you had some idea there. It seems that there was going to be some pressure. North America was the category that had the -- geography that had the most pressure kind of in your backyard. So, when we were on the phone at the end of July, I mean, how much of this did you know at that point? What kind of visibility, then do you have at this point to tell us that you expect improvement in 4Q and going forward?","Noel Wallace","So, let me talk about the sustainability in the Hill's business first, then we'll talk about pricing and margins again. Obviously, on Hill's, that business is hitting on all cylinders right now. They're expanding our presence in store, I think because the trade sees the sell-ins of the brand and how important it is to consumers in terms of how we're positioning the brand itself, and the messaging and the benefits that come with that. The pricing has stuck. The pricing you mentioned, Mark, was not in the second quarter. We've just taken pricing in the fourth quarter. So at the end of September, we took additional round of pricing on both our Hill's Science Diet business as well as the prescription diet business.","So, that will hit us more in the fourth quarter, as we see the benefits of that coming through the P&L. We're in the midst of rolling out the Science Diet business globally. We've started in Latin America. It's moving into Asia in Japan, as well as Europe. And we've seen the early indications are like we've seen in U.S., so that bodes well for the sustainability of that business moving forward.","What I also mentioned earlier is that we have really dialed up our innovation and are focused on the prescription diet part of the business, which is, you'll start to see those plans unfold in 2020. And we're certainly confident that, that business is going to continue to drive good results. Obviously, the quarter was exceptional. I'm not suggesting we're going to see double-digit growth in the fourth quarter or 2020 but we will see good strong growth as well as margin expansion as we move into 2020.","Listen, on the mix issue, it was surprise for us, Mark. If you look back historically, we've always had positive or no impact on mix relative to our business. We saw some geographic issues. We saw some category issues in the quarter and we didn't anticipate that as we moved in -- as we moved through the second quarter discussion. As we moved into the quarter, it looked fine. As we went through the balance of the quarter, it got a little bit more challenging.","And so we're on that. We are addressing that and have the right discussions with the teams moving forward. We, obviously, are a little bit more FX-ed that came through the P&L, than expected as well. That was a surprise to us. We were all hopeful that given the strong FX hits that we had last year, that we would see a more benign environment that picked up in the quarter. The good news is that's dropped back and we see spot rates coming back today. And we're hopeful that those spot rates will hold. But the surprise there was both mix and FX, and as I mentioned earlier, some of the raw packing materials that we saw come through the P&L as well.","Operator","And I'd like to turn it back to our presenters for any additional or closing comments.","Noel Wallace","No, thanks. Again, I appreciate the questions. We're on the gross margin discussion. 90 days through the quarter, we'll get that addressed moving forward. Obviously, the top-line sequential growth looks terrific for the business. It's broad-based across all of our categories, as well as both emerging and developed markets.","As we look to the first quarter, we will come back to you with, obviously, a lot more specificity in terms of guidance for 2020. Let me again thank the 35,000 Colgate people who have worked so hard to deliver that sequential growth in the P&L, which looks terrific. And we look forward to continue discussions as we move into the fourth quarter and first quarter call. Thanks so much.","Operator","And it does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Today's call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgate.com. Just a reminder, there may be a slight delay before the question-and-answer session begins due to the web simulcast.","At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Bina Thompson. Please go ahead.","Bina H. Thompson","Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our First Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, and these statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements. So for information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements on Forward-looking Statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We will discuss organic sales growth, excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. We will also discuss gross profit, gross profit margin, SG&A, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, excluding the impact of certain items described in the press release. And a full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted in the For Investors section of our website at www.colgatepalmolivecom.","We're very pleased with the way the year has started out, continuing the momentum with which we finished 2012. Our organic sales growth was robust, up 6%, and even more satisfying considering the strong organic sales growth of 6.5% in the year-ago quarter. Our worldwide market shares are up across all oral care categories. An improvement in gross margin has allowed us to support new and existing products with increased advertising while still delivering a healthy bottom line.","Macroeconomic challenges continue to present themselves, particularly in the more developed parts of the world and, of course, more recently in Venezuela. But despite that, our business is strong both from a P&L and a balance sheet standpoint, with excellent cash generation. Our global growth and efficiency program is on track. Just this quarter, we announced several initiatives.","First in Europe, we are creating an oral care center of excellence by moving our consumer innovation center, our category management group and our consumer insights group all to Basel, Switzerland, where they will be combined with our professional affairs and technology group already based there. As you know, Basel has been the headquarters for our GABA business, so this newly formed organization will be able to benefit from GABA' s long-standing expertise in the areas of professional affairs and technology.","Also announced this quarter is further progress in the area of Colgate business services. Applying our learnings from our existing center in Warsaw, we will be establishing a global center in Mumbai and a regional center in Mexico City, and we will be migrating additional financial functions to all 3 locations.","As you know, another element of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is to expand our commercial hubs. Just this quarter, we announced our intention to hub Romania with Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and the Baltic countries to create the Central Europe East hub. The hub center will remain in Warsaw, Poland. And this hub-ing will allow us to be more efficient, drive smarter and faster decision-making, strengthen capabilities on the ground while improving our cost structure. And of course, as we generate savings from these projects, we can provide funds for reinvestments to sustain our growth opportunities around the world and especially in the fast-growth emerging markets.","So let's turn to North America. We're very pleased with the strong results in North America. The strong organic sales growth of 5.5% was a good balance of 3.5% volume growth and 2% pricing because, as you know, pricing excellence is a key focus for us around the world. We told you about a number of new product launches last quarter, which has contributed to the strong results and which helps drive our oral care shares referenced in the press release. Our shares are also up in body wash and in fabric conditioners. And as you know, in the U.S., we only sell fabric conditioner in Hispanic markets, where it has now reached a national share of 16.3% on a year-to-date basis, up almost 1.5 points from the year-ago period.","We're very excited about a significant launch in this quarter of Colgate Total Mouthwash, our second entry in the U.S. in the mouthwash category after Colgate Optic White Mouthwash. This is a very exciting opportunity to offer a complete regimen solution under the Colgate Total brand. The new mouthwash offers a number of benefits: 12 hour protection even after eating and drinking, kill 99% of germs, fights formation of plaque and gingivitis and has no burn of alcohol. Trade reception has been very encouraging, and the product will be supported by a very robust integrated marketing campaign with both in and out-of-store activities. Our off-shelf displays are at record levels. And along with Colgate Total toothpaste and toothbrushes, the complete regimen is being backed by a compelling new claim: improve your mouth health in just 2 weeks.","You may already be aware that we've engaged Kelly Ripa to be our new spokesperson for the Colgate Total brand. Kelly has extremely high appeal among consumers, and our ad with Kelly as the face of Colgate, which aired in February, tested extremely well. She will be an integral part of our launch for Colgate Total Mouthwash as well.","In other categories, we will be launching spring and summer seasonal hand soaps under the Softsoap brand in both foam and liquids. Consumers enjoy decorating their homes with these fun designs, which provide everyday specialness and variety. New product activity will, of course, continue as we go through the year.","Turning then to Latin America -- I'm sorry, turning then to Europe and South Pacific. We're also pleased with the modest growth in this region, given the extremely challenging macroeconomic conditions across Europe. Countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal are experiencing negative GDP growth and high unemployment. But we do see a few bright spots, Germany and the U.K., for example, where GDP is growing. Given this environment, it is critical that we provide the consumer with value-added products that meets their needs, and this has indeed been happening.","A number of new products were referenced in the press release across categories, which contributed to our good results in the first quarter. Our regional market shares are solid. Our leading toothpaste share of over 33% and manual toothbrush share of over 22%, both on a year-to-date basis, are even with the year-ago period. Market shares in battery toothbrushes and mouthwash are up year-over-year. Market shares are also up in underarm protection and in fabric softener, where we reached a record 26.4% on a year-to-date basis.","More new products will be launched in the second quarter. In toothpaste, we'll be launching a number of new products across our sub-brands. In the whitening category, we are launching Colgate Max White One Luminous, a toothpaste with Smart Foam which whitens teeth all around. Under the Max Fresh brand, we are launching Colgate Max Fresh Maxi Clean, which penetrates between teeth for an intense brush of clean.","We told you in the fourth quarter about our first-ever launch in the rechargeable electric toothbrush market. Colgate ProClinical was introduced in the U.K. in September of last year. This quarter, we launched in the Nordic countries and in Germany under the elmex brand, and we're quite encouraged by our results so far, with good support from both the trade and the professionals.","GABA continues to perform well, especially in Italy, where sales of GABA products are up double digits year-over-year. To help continue our strong results, we're launching 2 new products under the elmex brand: elmex sensitive professional mouth rinse with effective and lasting relief for tooth sensitivity; and elmex erosion toothbrush, which provides superior clean while still being gentle on tooth enamel.","In personal care, we are launching new body wash products under both the Palmolive and the Sanex brand: Palmolive Mediterranean Moments, which nourishes your skin and delights your senses; and Sanex [indiscernible], which helps restore the skin's natural moisturizing level.","As you know, home care is an important business for us in Europe, and we will introduce new products in this category as well. One interesting one leverages the consumer preference for natural and traditional ingredients. Ajax authentic cleaners with freshness of Aleppo soap and sweet almond oil.","So a lot of activities support this business.","Now let's turn to Latin America. We're particularly pleased with the strong organic sales growth in Latin America, given the challenges we happen to face in Venezuela. Market shares are strong across the regions. In addition to increases in manual toothbrushes and mouthwash, our shares are up year-over-year in both underarm protection and bar soap.","In bar soap, we are at a record year-to-date share of over 32%, up almost 1.5 points year-over-year. And we are now the market leader in 9 countries in the region. Both our Palmolive and Protex brands have contributed to this strong result.","In the first quarter, we did a relaunch of Colgate Total in Brazil and Mexico and will roll this out to other countries in the region in the balance of the year. Part of this includes a compelling new marketing campaign based on the fact that Colgate Total 12 continuously protects you from bacteria for up to 12 hours. And we'll have more innovation in oral care in the third quarter.","In the second quarter, we have some exciting activity across personal and home care. In Mexico, we just introduced 2 new underarm bundles. The first is for men: Mennen Speed Stick Neutro Power, which provides protection that doesn't interfere with a man's fragrance. And for women, we launched Lady Speed Stick Pro 5-in-1, which offers 5 benefits for complete protection: dry, fresh, soft, no irritation and no white residue. Our share of the Mexican underarm market is approaching 20% and increased 120 basis points on a year-to-date basis.","In Brazil, we are launching Palmolive Naturals body-cleansing Luminous sensation soap, with hydrating Argan oil and oil complex to help soften skin. Our bar soap share in Brazil increased 110 basis points on a year-to-date basis, which put us behind the market leader by less than a point. This new product should help further boost our market share.","Also in Mexico, we launched Axion oat with vitamin E dish-washing liquid, which combines the proven performance of Axion with the natural ingredients oat with vitamin E. Our market-leading share in the dish category is almost 50%, up 290 basis points year-to-date.","Turning then to Greater Asia\/Africa. This part of the world continues to exhibit strong top line momentum, with organic sales growth of 10%, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic sales growth. Macroeconomic environment across the region is for the most part quite buoyant, and our categories are growing mid to high single digits. Market shares are strong around the region. In addition to the countries referenced in the press release, our toothpaste shares are up in Russia, South Africa and Turkey. In fact, in Turkey, with a year-to-date share of over 30%, we have now taken marker leadership for the first time.","Shares are strong in toothbrushes as well. In India, our market share of almost 41% is up 320 basis points year-over-year, further widening our gap with the nearest competitor. In Russia, our year-to-date toothbrush share is now over 50%, up 160 basis points as a result of successful new product launches. And in Turkey, our year-to-date toothbrush share is up 130 basis points to 29.3%.","Our mouthwash business continues to grow nicely as well. In Russia, our market share is up strongly to almost 26%, driven by the launch of both Colgate Plax Tea and Colgate Optic White. In China, our mouthwash share is over 33%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, again, driven by successful new product activity.","And we'll continue our new product activity in the second quarter. Colgate Total Pro Gum Health toothpaste, introduced into the Indian market in the first quarter where our market share is up 110 basis points, over 53%, will be launched in China. Colgate Optic White toothpaste, which has driven share in Thailand, is now being launched in India and Vietnam.","And in the toothbrush category, we will continue the rollout of Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal toothbrush across Asia. The tapered toothbrush segment is the fastest-growing segment in that category. Charcoal resonates very well with Asian consumer and is widely used in consumer goods throughout the region for its renowned antibacterial property.","So turning to Hill's. As expected, Hill's organic sales growth in the quarter was very modest. And as we told you on our last conference call, our expectation is that this business should return to volume growth in the second half of the year. Our confidence is buoyed by the excellent early performance of 3 initiatives here in the U.S.: a complete relaunch of our Science Diet line, the launch of our naturals product and the introduction of Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic.","Sales of our new Science Diet are tracking well and acceptance and shelving by the 2 largest U.S. pet retailers are excellent. We supported this relaunch with media starting at the end of February on national TV, and that media support is continuing in the second quarter, supplemented with digital media. In addition, we will be implementing a sampling program, along with a Vets Know Best tour, capitalizing on our strong veterinary endorsements. And as a result, we have seen an increase in consumption at both PetSmart and PETCO in recent weeks versus year ago.","The new Ideal Balance is performing well and we've achieved 100% distribution of all items in the superstores. The transition to natural shelf is taking place and should be completed by the end of this quarter. As you would expect, this also is being supported by a fully integrated marketing campaign through TV, digital media and high-impact displays in the store.","Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic is meeting with success as well, both here in the U.S. and in Canada. And in addition, we launched it as Metabolics in Japan, where it exceeded budget [indiscernible]. This complete line of great-tasting dry food, wet food and treats ensures safe, easy and healthy weight loss without making the pet parent feel like they are depriving their pets. Weight problems in dogs and cats are common here and overseas.","Social media has been playing a clear role in driving awareness of the product, as well as brand recommendations. Many veterinary clinics have been advertising it on their websites and Facebook pages with photographs of before-and-after examples.","So these launches do bode well for continued strength in the business, particularly as they roll out in other markets.","So in summary, we are pleased with how we have started off the year. Our organic sales continue to be strong, and our market shares are healthy around the world. Our clearly enunciated strategies are being well executed by Colgate people around the world. And in addition, our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track. So while we are mindful of difficult economies in some countries, we think we have the right plans in place, coupled with the strict financial discipline to continue to deliver solid results as we go through the year.","So Melissa, that's the end of my prepared remarks, and I'd like to open it up now to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Alice Longley from Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","My question is about the impact of the devaluation of the Bolivar on Latin American margins and then, overall, on your bottom line. If you could just tell us how many cents you took off the bottom line aside from the onetime charges, we know what those are, but the effect on the bottom line aside from that in terms of cents and then also margins in Latin America.","Ian M. Cook","Well, thanks for the question, Alice. I think we framed early on the impact of the devaluation. As you say, there is the onetime charge from the remeasurement of the balance sheet, and then we have said that the ongoing quarterly impact of the devaluation on the impact on EPS would be between $0.05 and $0.07 a quarter. And that has been the impact in the first quarter. Now when we focus on gross margin, why don't I perhaps take this opportunity to run through gross profit reconciliation and put it in the context of the full year. So for the first quarter, prior year gross profit, 58.2%. And we benefited this year from 60 basis points of pricing, no benefit from restructuring thus far. You will remember, we expect the restructuring benefits this year to come in the second half. Funding the Growth continued to be very, very strong, 140 basis points of benefit, the beginning of exactly the same curve that we enjoyed last year in 2012, a material price negative of 180 basis points. Now if you break down that material price negative, within that, there is 120 basis points of negative that has to do with the impact of the devaluation in Venezuela. You pick up 20 basis points essentially of mix and we end up with the 58.6% margin -- gross margin that we have this quarter, up 40 basis points. And to put that in a year context, we came in the year saying that we thought our gross margin might expand between 50 and 100 basis points. But we said very clearly in CAGNY after the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, that we now expected in 2013 our gross margin to expand between 30 and 70 basis points, and so that 40 basis points gain benefit in the first quarter is exactly within that range.","Operator","And our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ian, your emerging markets business has held up well despite comments from a number of companies that emerging markets are slowing not just in household products, but across CPG in general. Are you seeing any consumer spending pressure in emerging markets and particularly in Latin America, given concerns seem to be cropping up there over a Brazil slowdown, and issues spreading potentially out of Venezuela and Argentina? Can you talk about Latin America specifically? And then why do you think your business has held up better than peers in emerging market so far?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, Dara, well, we continue to be quite pleased and bullish on the emerging markets. And in our categories, the data we have seen in the first quarter would support that. If one focuses on Latin America, our category growth rates continue to be in the high single digits. And if you talk about Brazil, our business in Brazil was up 17% on an organic sales basis. If you go around the other emerging markets, the category growth rates are increasing very, very nicely. And we see in the Greater China region, our organic sales up just under 10%. In Russia, you see us low double digits in terms of growth. The Latin American number that you have already seen, and I have mentioned Brazil. And even South Africa was up double digits on an organic basis. The sentiment, I'm just back from Southeast Asia, and when you look at the data and you talk to consumers, one gets the same optimism and confidence in the future that I got the last time I was in that part of the world. Our market shares likewise in these emerging markets continue to be quite strong. Brazil, our toothpaste share now up just under 72%. Our market share in Russia, approaching 33%. Our nearest competitor is flat at 15%, that 33% is up 1 point. China, we are at about 35% market share, and our nearest competitor is down under 18%. We're up 1 point. They're down 2.5 points. So I think both in terms of the consumer, their consumption and our ability to grow and then, on top of that, our continued share progress, we feel good about those emerging markets.","Operator","We'll now take a question from John Faucher from Morgan Stanley -- I'm sorry, JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In terms of looking at the pricing results, a little bit of a dichotomy here, but I really want to take a look at the North American results where the pricing came in better despite the fact that volume really sort of accelerated against the difficult comps. So I'm wondering, a lot of companies, it seems like we're seeing no elasticity as pricing growth decelerates a little bit. You're not getting the volume pickup. Can you talk about sort of changes in pricing and where you're seeing elasticity net out in your different categories and regions?","Ian M. Cook","To your pricing question, I think, as Bina said, we have and we continue on a journey to make pricing a core competency of our company so that we can best understand the sensitivities, the elasticities at how we manage pricing in the mix of all the marketing variables that we are managing around the world. And we put a lot of pricing model attention to where we take pricing, what specific variance, what SKUs in those variance, how we take that pricing to try and minimize the impact on volume. And I think we're very, very pleased with what we have been able to accomplish, particularly, as you say, in North America where we have managed to take price without prejudicing the volume growth of the top line. And clearly, that is both an objective and, hopefully, a capability that we can continue to build in the out years.","Operator","The next question will come from Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I would like to touch upon Hill's. I would expect -- would have expected volumes to pick up a little bit more, given that you are launching 3 new lines. Basically, is it an issue that is -- because of volume mix, that the price points are lower and that's why we are seeing the decline in volumes? And what gives you the confidence that they are going -- that volumes are going to accelerate, given that you have very strong competition in the natural segment?","Ian M. Cook","Thanks, Javier, for the question. I think the answer -- and we appreciate everybody's exuberance and enthusiasm that the volume pickup would come sooner. But the answer, I think, is the same as the answer that certainly I gave most recently at CAGNY, what I think many of us have been giving over the last several months. The 2 big initiatives that we have are the relaunch of Science Diet with the more natural profile. As Bina said in her prepared remarks, that product is now fully in distribution. Media started at the very, very end of February, so essentially March. And the sampling and trial program for that business is really commencing now. To the heart of your question is our response directly to and within the natural segment, and that is captured by the Hill's Ideal Balance line. Again, as Bina said, we have completed distribution. And 2 major retailers, remember, we have a limited distribution profile for this business, are PetSmart and PETCO, and their shelf set adjustments are basically going in place right now. And the media on the Ideal Balance line basically started right now as is the sampling program and the consultants in-store behind the product. As we said at CAGNY, a, our consumer testing, both the pet parents and the pets love the product. We know the packaging and advertising engages and communicates. And the support we are getting from the retailers, the pet stores and the vets behind these 2 significant initiatives is very strong. That's what gives us the confidence. And to repeat what Bina said, we remain convinced that this business will return to volume growth in the second half of this year.","Operator","And now we'll go to Chris Ferrara with Bank of America for the next question.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can we talk about that 17% number you just threw out there on Brazil. That was pretty big. I guess, Ian, could you maybe break out what the drivers of that were, especially as you lap it in the first full quarter of Luminous in Brazil and Mexico? And then, I guess, as sort of a follow-on, can you just talk about the pricing environment in Brazil? Because we've been hearing some stuff. Obviously, there's a change in tax structure. The government's been increasingly concerned about inflation. So just any color on that would be great as well.","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Again, and I think we have articulated this many, many times on these calls, our focus is on innovation-led growth. To the extent that we can make that premium innovation-led growth, that the  consumers will accept, we do. And that most certainly applies to Brazil in terms of a line extension on the back of the Optic White product, continued innovation in oral care and across our other businesses. And you're right, Chris, that is after dealing with the removal of a tax on product, which lowered pricing to both retailers and to consumers and created a little bit of temporary disruption in the marketplace for a couple of weeks. But it is really engaging with our consumers through marketing, where we are using increasingly marketing mix modeling to decide how we best engage with those consumers and deploy our funds accordingly. And it is innovation behind the full portfolio of products that we have in Brazil and then, of course, beyond the ground execution and by a very experienced management team in Brazil not just with the modern trade, but all the way through the down trade in that large and complex country.","Operator","Ali Dibadj from Bernstein has our next question.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just had a quick follow-up on pricing and then the real question. On pricing, it looks like the ratio between kind of your reported pricing as opposed to the mix element, which is in your volume obviously from innovation and stuff -- but from a pricing, the ratio between that and currency in Latin America has as almost always been quite close. But past couple of quarters, it's not been that close. And why, just to understand a little bit more kind of continuing on the theme of pricing, is that really all Venezuela? Or are you seeing things from competition or retailers or consumers or some of these macro fears that kind of put that ratio out of whack? That's kind of the clarification. But the real question to me is, I think you're a good company because essentially trounced all your peers in terms top line growth. But what we're also noticing for you and others, that it's just getting tougher to grow, so more expensive to grow. And I'm trying understand how much of that is short term, so macro issues in the U.S., macro issues in Europe versus long-term kind of secular drivers related to these categories or related to a tougher competitive environment that will be with us for quite some time. So how do you guys think about this both internally and because from a data externally, it does look like the ROI is getting tougher for everybody?","Ian M. Cook","Well, thanks for the one question, Ali. Starting with your clarification, it is exclusively in Venezuela. The rest has to do with difference in timing of when we choose to take pricing in Latin America or at any other emerging markets, so nothing structural or fundamental there. I would challenge the secular notion and I would challenge this inevitable creep of cost of doing business theory. I would start by saying, you will know well that our return on invested capital is fairly elevated, certainly, compared to our peer group and to the S&P 500. But I guess our philosophy starts with the consumer as it should do with all packaged goods company. And the theory that as marketers, we are paid to create innovation, the consumers feel they got a value paying for. And from our point of view, we seek to make that value a premium for a premium benefit. We adjust access to our products by sizing and the pricing related to sizing, but we don't. And we have never subscribed to the notion that price promotion is a way of sustainably growing business. We respond to it where we need to, but we have always put a very large premium on innovation and engaging with consumers around that innovation. What we have been doing over several years is recognize the fact that you can engage with consumers very well and build brand equity very well at the retail level. And using our marketing mix modeling, we are deploying a lot of in-store techniques that maybe we weren't deploying 10 years ago. And some of that funding comes from broader commercial spending, which you don't see captured in the below-the-line advertising. So we are putting increased money in that space as well. And the affordability comes from the benefit of premium-ization, our sharp focus on Funding the Growth and the choice we made in the fourth quarter of last year to reorganize with our Global Growth and Efficiency Program to make sure in perhaps a medium-term choppy world, we were generating adequate funding to make sure we could sustain the top line growth of the company, which on this call we would reaffirm for this year as being between 6% and 7% from an organic point of view. So it's essentially a focus on premium-ization that the consumer values and a relentless focus on Funding the Growth and now our Global Growth and Efficiency Program to provide the funding that drives top line and also bottom line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson from Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two small questions, I think. But number one, Bina, you called out the customer development initiatives in Hill's, and I understand what that is because you had all the new product activity going on. But in Asia, specifically, what is that, why is it accounted for in SG&A as opposed to gross margin? And is that a function of more competition? And then just a housekeeping item, with the relaunch of Total in Brazil and Mexico, can you just remind us how big Total is as a percentage of your oral care portfolio? And when you relaunch Total, how meaningful can it be in terms of incremental market share? I think you relaunched Total in Europe maybe a year ago. So is that a big deal or maybe you can frame that?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, the issue on customer development in SG&A is increased sales capability on the ground in emerging markets, most especially in Asia, a choice made to make sure we can continue to build world-class distribution in those countries and not simply have the product present, but to make sure that we have the product visible and organized on the shelf in the way we would want our brands to be presented. And as regards Total, we don't give that level of segment detail, but it is a big business. And there is concerted effort behind Total here in the U.S. as a complete equity as we bring the mouthwash to the marketplace in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joe Lachky from Wells Fargo Securities.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess I wanted to kind of take a step back, Ian, and get your opinion on how you see the vision for your company evolving over the long term. And I guess you've got really strong execution in your current markets. And I guess in the near term, I see a strong runway penetration, market share opportunities, riding category growth in your current markets. But how long can you ride that trend within your current markets, I guess the fear being you reach saturation in those markets or there's a slowdown in developing market growth rates? And then the second part of that is -- and what's the next step beyond that? And this maybe like a 10-, 15-year type vision. But how do you see the product portfolio evolving? Are there any new markets to enter? How do you keep that growth going in the long term?","Ian M. Cook","Thanks, Joe. I guess this sort of saturation notion is kind of overblown from a theory point of view. We still have lots of growth opportunity in our existing oral care businesses, penetration in some markets, per capita consumption in other markets. And we intend to mine that vigorously, certainly for the next decade and more. Around that, we have the opportunity to expand existing businesses that we have that may be pretty nascent to those categories in some of these emerging markets, think liquid body cleansing, think underarm, we can bring to these markets at the right time with the distribution prowess we have in these markets and continue to expand our portfolio quite, quite meaningfully. So I think when you get below the sort of 20,000-foot theory of it and get into the planning detail of actually making a vision concrete and agreeing what it is we should focus on and get done, we still think there is enormous growth. And remember, if you take a 25-year view and take category definitions that are oral care, personal care, pet nutrition and home care. Within personal care, we got into the underarm business by acquiring Mennen. We got into the liquid skin cleansing business in the U.S. by acquiring Softsoap, that we expanded our footprint in body cleansing in Europe by acquiring Sanex. So even within the category definitions we have, once we've taken every one of them global, there is still the opportunity to broaden our representation in segments of categories in which we do business. Oral care, by bringing Total to the U.S., we just established a global position in mouthwash. And we're just beginning that journey on powered toothbrushes. So there is still, we think, a very bright future for the categories that we have today well beyond the time frame you mentioned, Joe.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason M. Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess just going back, I got the context of your 2 pillars of growth hitting the 6% to 7% organic sales and obviously returning back to 10% EPS growth. So as you see the next wave of restructuring cost savings, how do you ensure that you have the right level of reinvestment in there to kind of meet both objectives? So I guess I'm talking a little bit more about the advertising side. And just as this quarter you hit kind of that 11% level, which I think is closer to the highs that you've had, can you just maybe walk through what are some of the factors as you look at that reinvestment rate of the savings that should be coming through and helping you over the next couple of years?","Ian M. Cook","Thanks, Jason. Well, clearly, we take a very strategic view on how we choose to reinvest that money. Frankly, we did that before we embarked upon the program. And we will be making, together as a management team with the involvement of our board, some choices in terms of where and what the significant aspects of strategic investment will be. When you bring it down to the notion of advertising investment, yes, we have taken it up absolutely and is the ratio in the first quarter. And we said and we stand by the fact that we plan to do that in 2013. I repeat the point, because I think it's important to register it, that with the capabilities available to companies like ours today, both analytically and in-store technique wise, we are quite consciously doing more and more at the store level to engage with consumers because the ability to do that in a very effective return on investment and executional way is significantly greater than it was 5, 10 years ago. And so the investment choices we make when you just talk about advertising will be yes in the traditional advertising engagement areas, which you will see below the line, but also in the so-called gross-to-net trade spending, which kind of comes off the top line, but is nonetheless investment funding that we deploy to grow the business. And I think you can rest assured, at least I hope you can rest assured, that as a group here, we will be doing the right thing in terms of Global Growth and Efficiency, plus our ongoing Funding the Growth programs, to make sure that we fund the growth while delivering a return.","Operator","And now we'll go to Bill Chappell from SunTrust Bank.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit more about just what you're seeing in especially Western Europe, I mean, in terms of consumer trends? Is it steady state? Are we bouncing still along the bottom? Are you seeing any signs of hope or any uptake as we move to the back half of the year?","Ian M. Cook","We're seeing wild exuberance, Bill, in [indiscernible]. No, I would say, certainly, the way we have planned this year and the way we have thought about our strategic planning over the next 5 years, we are still assuming low growth in Europe. We think that's the prudent thing to do, low single-digit category growth in our case. You do -- if you want to sort of then go to the next level of detail, you do see some buoyancy or greater buoyancy, obviously, I think, in Northern Europe compared to Southern Europe. We were quite pleased that our Southern European businesses basically performed at the same level that they did in the fourth quarter of last year, and we did not see a further deterioration. But I would say that we are talking about a low growth environment certainly for the next strategic cycle. If we are proven wrong and there is greater buoyancy, then that will be terrific. But we're not planning on it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I did want to go back to North America for a second because I thought it was particularly impressive. This quarter, you guys seem to hit the trifecta, if you will. The volumes were up very nicely, pricing was very strong and you also had pretty good margin expansion. I think you mentioned earlier to a question that pricing is becoming a core competency for you. But if you look at volumes, your 2-year stack volumes in North America were as high as I've seen them in quite some time. So if you could give us a little more color on what drove the volumes, was that pantry loading or trade load and what drove the margins as well?","Ian M. Cook","Well, I think a few things to say. Number one, and Bina already referenced it, we saw some nice share growth across a broad array of categories, which means we were growing faster than the rate of category growth. That was one thing. Secondly, the timing of promotional events that we had in the first quarter of this year was different than the first quarter of last year, which you may recall was really the expansion of Optic White. And thirdly, we have begun to build distribution of the Total Mouthwash that we referenced in our remarks. And as far as the second quarter is concerned, I'm pleased to say that we have started off maintaining the pace that we had in the first quarter. So we feel good about that.","Operator","And Ian Gordon with S&P Capital IQ has our next question.","Ian J. Gordon - S&P Equity Research","I wanted to ask about your EPS guidance. I know it's early, you only have one quarter under your belt, but you did come in at the high end of the 5.5% to 6.5% growth target for the year. Currency looks to be a little bit more benign for the rest of the year based on today's rates. The comparisons look balanced, a tad bit easier. Hill's should ramp, and you have the restructuring savings starting to flow through. So what's the missing piece and why shouldn't we expect something maybe a little bit north of a 6.5% dollar growth?","Ian M. Cook","Well, Ian, I think you have to kind of go back to pre-Venezuela and coming into this year. When we came into this year, we talked about EPS growth double digit on a dollar basis. And many people at the time -- frankly, even with the restructuring savings, which are relatively modest this year built in, people felt there was too much optimism on the top line and questioned our ability to deliver that. When the Venezuelan devaluation occurred, I think we were quickly, very clear about the impact. Obviously, the onetime balance sheet revaluation, you know well, and we shared that the EPS impact would be between $0.05 and $0.07 a quarter. And we kind of reaffirmed the math this quarter in saying that, that would translate to a narrow range of 5.5% to 6.5% increase. And we stand by that for the year.","Operator","And now we'll go to Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So Latin American margins, do you think they bottomed this quarter? And the reason I ask that is I think the inventory, the expensive inventory that was flowing through in dollars probably goes away. So is there any reason to believe that this isn't kind of as bad as it gets in terms of Latin American margins?","Ian M. Cook","I think the opposite of that, Bill, we have been through these things many, many times before, devals, price controls and the like. And I think it would be fair to say that our expectation is that we would begin to rebuild margin going forward, yes.","Operator","And our next question will come from Michael Steib from Credit Suisse.","Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a small point for me, Ian. Why was pricing negative in Asia?","Ian M. Cook","It was to do with pricing adjustments, Michael, that we took largely in Africa relative to some uncompetitive market positions.","Operator","And our next question will come from Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","It's our understanding that you may have another major mass toothpaste innovation, new product breakthrough type thing coming. Do you want to give some more information about that? Our understanding is dentists may start to be educated on it this summer. And so when would be the launch, potential launch of it? Would it be late this year or next year? And then just a clarification on your interest expense line. It had become an interest income, net income 2 quarters ago, in the fourth quarter. Going forward, will that now revert to being interest expense? And would $5 million to $10 million per quarter be a good rough estimate for that of interest expense?","Ian M. Cook","The answer to your second question is yes. The answer to your first question is we are always actively pursuing, as I mentioned earlier in talking about the innovation point, innovation that brings real benefit to consumers and adds value. And on the assumption we do meet with these professionals in the middle of the year, we'll be glad to have one of them talk to you.","Operator","And Lauren Lieberman from Barclays has our next question.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Wondering if you could talk a little bit about Europe just in terms of margins actually. Because the margin performance is obviously great, and so you're getting really good cost savings there, leverage on no volume growth. So talk about where these savings are coming from and even before you've really gotten going on this latest restructuring program?","Ian M. Cook","Well, the benefits come from a more benign commodity environment. The benefits come from our traditional Funding the Growth savings programs and obviously the continued introduction of innovation, which we seek to be premium, which is, therefore, accretive to margin. And as you rightly suggest, Lauren, and as Bina mentioned very clearly I think in her prepared remarks, and as we suggested we might, a lot of the structural work that we will be doing around the world has begun in Europe for obvious reasons.","Operator","Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A question on Venezuela. Can you help us understand what the new mechanism, the auction mechanism, how it's likely to work and what you know about it at this point?","Ian M. Cook","We continue to work with the government in Venezuela to get approval for CADIVI funds for the importation of product and has started the year quite nicely, in fact, in that regard. The new auction market mechanism that is replacing SITME, whilst we will work with it, we understand so far that the tranches of opportunity in that market are basically at about $2 million. So whilst we will look at it, I think in the main, we will be staying with the CADIVI process.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a quick one. On the advertising spend, it was up both absolutely and as a percent of sales in the quarter. So you're presumably approaching about 11% of sales. Is that a level kind of where you see some plateauing going on and potentially some leverage going forward? And the incremental spend that you are doing there, could you just talk a little bit about the focus? Is it more oriented towards new products in developed markets or more investment behind your emerging markets?","Ian M. Cook","Yes is the answer, Jon. It really is all of the above. I mentioned earlier the increasing focus we have on marketing mix modeling in terms of both our engagement marketing with traditional consumers and indeed our trial and awareness generating advertising for 4 new products in the developed countries. As you would expect, we are moving some of that investment into digital in terms of it being a strong engagement vehicle. In the emerging markets, more traditional vehicles continue to remain both affordable and effective. And again, as I mentioned earlier, and we think about the advertising going forward, don't forget that we are also putting a focus on what we call commercial spend, which is this trade spending, which is allowing us to do programs at retail, which are not just engaging and persuasive to consumers, but also help to build our brand equity and loyalty over time. So we are managing all of those things. We do this not on a ratio basis, I have to say, Jon. We do it from the ground up, market by market against what activities we have in countries as we get into each planning cycle. So the ratio is an output, and the split between the traditional advertising and what we do on trade spending is an output of that planning rather than a set ratio going into the planning.","Operator","And our final question will come from Mark Astrachan from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm trying to get a sense of operating margin progression. So it was up a lot in all segments, not including Lat Am and Pet Nutrition. Ian, I think in Lat Am, the margins are still down, excluding Venezuela currency-related devaluation. So is there something inherently different on the cost front, whether wages, inflation or spending, that makes Lat Am different from the others? And then also how should we think about progression in those markets, like Europe or North America, where margins improved nicely?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. As you know, we don't talk about operating margins going forward, Mark. But I can say, from a gross margin point of view, we stand by that 30 to 70 basis points and the EPS that we have guided to that drives from that. And Latin America, I mentioned on the margin roll forward, that within the walk-through on gross margin, there was a negative of 120 basis points year-on-year for the world based on Venezuela and, therefore, Latin America. And that said, we still increased our gross margin by 40 basis points. So the Latin American gross margin is entirely to do with Venezuela, entirely. And it is our thrust, geography by geography, as you know, to expand our gross margin around the world and then to make choices as to how we invest the funds that flow from that. So given that the Venezuelan impact on the world was 120 basis points, you could imagine the impact in Latin America.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Ian M. Cook","No. Thanks for all of you on the call. Thank you very much for your questions. And as always, a big thank you to the Colgate folk around the world who get done what it is agreed we're going to get done. So thank you.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today.

Today's call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Just as a reminder, there may be a slight delay before the question-and-answer session begins due to the web simulcast.","And at this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Bina Thompson","Thank you, Nancy, and good morning. And welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, President, Chairman and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements and these statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance.","Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements. So for information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements on forward-looking statements.","And this conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results compared in accordance with GAAP. We will discuss organic sales growth, which is net sales growth excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures.","And we will also discuss gross profit, gross profit margin, SG&A as a percent of net sales, operating profit, operating profit margin, net income and earnings per share on a diluted basis, excluding the impact of certain items described in the press release.","And a full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted in the For Investors section of our website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","We are delighted with our results for the first quarter. As we exited 2013, we said we were excited about continuing our momentum and that has indeed happened. Our organic sales growth was at the high end of our target range of 5% to 7%, on top of strong growth of 6% in the prior year and with a good balance between volume and price. In fact, our pricing increase of 1.5% was against the highest level of pricing performance of any quarter last year and we expect this good performance to continue.","In light of precipitous declines of currencies versus the dollar during the quarter, we are pleased that our gross profit margin was even with last year\u2019s level. While we had forecasted an improvement year-over-year, lack of growth was primarily due to the transaction costs associated with the aforementioned currency headwinds.","However, our Funding the Growth Program is as robust as it has ever been and as you know, an integral part of our company culture. So as we are able to take pricing as we go through the year to offset the sudden currency moves, we expect to see our gross margin improve each quarter.","We are particularly pleased about the savings being generated from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. As we told you when we announced the program in the fourth quarter of 2012, we felt it would serve us well as we entered turbulent times and indeed it has.","We also said that the bulk of the savings would be reflected in overhead expenses and in the first quarter we delivered a 30 basis point reduction in overhead spending, which allowed us to increase our advertising as a percent of net sales to support what continues to be a very robust pipeline of innovation around the world. Our balance sheet is solid with strong cash generation, as well as excellent working capital control. So, a good start to the year, which bodes well for the remainder of 2014.","So let\u2019s turn to the divisions starting with North America. We are particularly pleased with the solid organic sales growth in North America. This growth of 3.5% was against 5.5% in the year ago quarter, which was the strongest quarter for 2013.","A full array of new products across categories contributed to the results and as referenced in the press release, we grew our market shares in manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, dish liquids, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners.","Colgate Optic White toothpaste is continuing to grow share from 2013 behind new products, strong marketing campaigns and more impactful claims. In February, we began to ship an uberpremium priced toothpaste line, expanding on our original Optic White whitening toothpaste.","Optic White Platinum Whiten & Protect, a new product in the line, adds stain prevention technology to the whitening power of the original Optic White formula to help maintain whiter teeth.","In addition, we relaunched Optic White Dual Action as Optic White Platinum White & Radiant, which contains extra polishing brighteners to add shine. An impactful media, print and shopper campaign to support the Optic White Platinum launch emphasizes whiter teeth in just one day by using the entire Optic White regimen including the Colgate Optic White Toothbrush + Built-In Whitening Pen.","Along with these new toothpastes we introduced Colgate Optic White mouthwash with Whiteseal technology. The new formula combines stain prevention with the whitening power of Colgate\u2019s original Optic White Mouthwash, along with a significantly enhanced taste profile.","The launch of Colgate Optic White Toothbrush + Built-In Whitening Pen, which we told you about last quarter, has been very well received. In March, it achieved an 8.1 share and has been driving almost the entire manual toothbrush category growth year-to-date and as you would expect, we have continued strong commercial support planned for the remainder of the year.","Regimen approach has served us well with our Colgate Total franchise. Colgate Total mouthwash launched in May of last year behind record retail support has been driving overall category growth.","Trial and repeat levels are outpacing other competitive launches, contributing to an overall mouthwash share of over 6% on a year-to-date basis, up from the year ago period. And we have also reinvigorated the graphics on our Colgate Total toothpaste line and have increased our professional marketing efforts with dental office sampling and detailing aids, as well as advertising in dental and scientific journals.","As I said, our market share in dish liquid was up in the quarter. Driving this in part was the launch of Palmolive Dish + Sink which helps eliminate odors to freshen the air around the sink as you do dishes. A strong marketing campaign only began in April but we saw excellent results right after our launch.","As you know, our business in the Hispanic market is very strong and a number of years ago, we launched Suavitel Fabric Conditioner, the leading brand in Mexico, in the U.S. In first quarter this year we launched a new variant, Suavitel Fast Dry, with a breakthrough patent-pending formula that softens clothes and contains moisture wicking polymers that allow fabric to quickly shed water so that clothes dry 30% faster.","This has contributed to an all-time high national fabric conditioner share of 17.5% in March, with over 1% coming just from this new product. More new product activity is expected for the third quarter of this year which you will hear about soon.","Turning now to Europe\/South Pacific. We are very pleased with the organic sales growth of 1.5% in this region, strongest growth in five quarters. Innovation played a key role in the results and from a macroeconomic standpoint, we are cautiously optimistic.","While Southern Europe still remains a challenge, it appears that Northern Europe is showing modest signs of recovery, now market shares increased in many Oral Care categories, up in toothpaste, battery toothbrushes and electric toothbrushes.","We are very pleased with the launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer, biggest innovation against cavities since the introduction of fluoride more than 50 years ago and we are off to a good start, after only six weeks in market in Denmark, we have achieved a 3.8 share, after two weeks in Norway a 3.2 share and after two weeks in Portugal a full point. In Australia, our latest four-week share is 5.4%. We will continue to rollout this product across the region.","We told you last quarter about the launch of Colgate Max White One Optic toothpaste. This quarter we have re-launched our Colgate Max White One mouthwash with an advanced stain prevention system to seal out the stains and seal in the natural whiteness and as you would expect, this is being supported by a full integrated marketing campaign in synergy with the toothpaste.","Also launching this quarter is Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal toothbrush, first developed in Asia, which has 17 times slimmer tip bristles with charcoal for better cleaning between the teeth and along the gum line.","An interesting opportunity for us in the personal care category is the entry into the kids\u2019 body wash category, where we currently have no offering. This subcategory is growing around 8%, outpacing the overall category growth of 2%.","And bundle to be launched in the second quarter, uses playful graphics to appeal to children and a mild natural formula with a Pediatrician Approved claim to appeal to their parents.","A seasonal launch expected to provide additional distribution is Palmolive Sensacao do Brazil. This line of shower gels seizes on Europeans passion for football and the resulting interest in Brazilian culture heightened around this summers World Cup, combination of unique fragrances, natural ingredients and attractive graphics should deliver heightened impact in store.","Our Home Care business in Europe is strong, leading brands such as Ajax and Soupline. Under the Ajax brand we are launching Ajax all Uage Gel, one cleaner to clean your entire house. The formula has a concentrated efficacy and the bottle has a versatile press and dosage cap.","Turning to Latin America, momentum continues across the region with another quarter of double-digit organic growth, consistent flow of innovation allowed us to maintain our strong leading shares in tooth paste and toothbrushes.","And our mouthwash market share was up half a point year-to-date behind successful launches such as Plax Tea Fresh and Plax 2 in 1 market shares increased as well in fabric conditioner, hand dish and liquid cleaners.","In Brazil, our year-to-date toothpaste share remained over 71%. As you know, this was one of the lead countries for our launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Neutrazucar toothpaste.","Shipments started in October of last year and our 2014 share year-to-date is 2.2% with the most recent lead at 3%. Our leading Brazilian toothbrush share reached a record 33.1% on a year-to-date basis, fueled by good performance in our premium end of the business.","Our Brazilian bar soap business achieved a record market leading share of 26.5% on a year-to-date basis, new products in both the Palmolive and Protex lines have helped achieve this result.","In Mexico, we saw a standout performance in our underarm protection business with our year-to-date share increasing 30 basis points to 19.6%, the highest in almost a decade. We told you about the launch of Men\u2019s Speed Stick Stress Defense deodorant last quarter and we have more innovation slated for the second quarter.","In fact, new product activity is planned for the second quarter across categories throughout Latin America. Building on the insight that many consumers think about toothpaste as taking care of their teeth and not the rest of the mouth, we have launched a new integrated marketing campaign to support Colgate Total which explains its benefit of protecting all areas of the mouth to give 100% confidence.","In the whitening category, we are launching Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothpaste with the benefit of three shades whiter teeth with the same whitening ingredient dentists use. And, of course, we will continue the launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste across the region.","In Personal Care, we are launching Protex Omega 3 bar soaps, liquid soaps and shower gels.

Its formula, with vitamin E and mother of pearl extract, helps show your natural skin tone while blocking sweat.","And, in the Home Care category, we have taken an idea from a Palmolive launch in the U.S. market. In Latin America, using the Axion equity for hand dishwashing liquid, we launched Axion Good Bye Odors. Residues from dishes and sponges can cause bad odors and this new product eliminates the bacteria that may cause these odors.","Turning now to Asia. Organic sales growth in Asia continues to be robust, increasing 7.5% in the quarter. New products supported by an increase in advertising have driven the top line growth and market share gains. Across the region, we increased our market shares in manual toothbrushes, mouthwash and shampoo.","In India, our toothpaste market share is up 60 basis points to 53.8% on a year-to-date basis, even in the face of heightened competition. Our toothbrush shares there are up as well, up 140 basis points to 44.5% year-to-date. Strong communication and trade plans have helped drive these results.","In China, we remain the market leader in toothpaste by a wide margin at over 34% year-to-date.

Organic sales growth continues to be robust in this region. As mentioned in the press release, some of the strength came from Russia even in the face of all the turmoil in that country. Our innovation in this region continues to drive growth as elsewhere.","In the toothpaste category, innovation in Russia has helped us to maintain our market leading share of over 32% year-to-date. Colgate Altai Herbs toothpaste was launched there recently. Altai is a region of Russia known for its herbal remedies. As a companion product, we also launched Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash, which has driven our year-to-date mouthwash market share up almost 2 full points to 27.6%.","Our shower gel market share across this region is up over a point and a half year-to-date. In Russia and Turkey where we launched Palmolive Gourmet Spa, our year-to-date market shares are up 2 and 3.6 points, respectively, to 23.1% and 39.1%.

We are very pleased with the continued solid results in our Hill\u2019s business, both domestically and overseas. An important driver here in the U.S., as you know, has been the launch of Hill\u2019s Ideal Balance, and that continues to meet with success. Consumption at the super stores is strong and growing up 50% year to date over the prior year and has been helped by a wide array of innovation in the naturals category.","In February, we launched 11 new dry variants, nine wet and three treats in both dog and cat. For dogs, Ideal Balance Slim and Healthy and Ideal Balance Active, for cats, Ideal Balance Indoors, Ideal Balance Hairball and Ideal Balance Slim and Healthy. To support this innovation, this quarter we will continue with not only media but in-store support in the superstores with impactful pallet displays as well as coupons offered by brand ambassadors and nutritional consultants.","Our Hill\u2019s Science Diet business is strong as well. An interesting new marketing campaign is being implemented as we speak at PetSmart, Paws for Health. Based on the shopper insight that pet parents know they don\u2019t take their pets to the vet as often as they should but it is important to them to do what they can to ensure the pet has a longer healthier life. In-store consultants educate pet parents about the importance of preventative care for their pet and drive awareness and provide trial sizes of Hill\u2019s Science Diet products in the LifeCare product grouping.","Our Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet business is also doing well.

The proprietary processing technique and natural ingredients produce a therapeutic food for dogs and cats with delicious appearance, and superior efficacy.","So in summary, we are very pleased with the way 2014 has started out. The momentum we saw as we exited 2013 has continued in all regions of the world.

We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go forward throughout the year.","And now, Nancy, I would like to turn the call over to you to start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Good morning.","Ian Cook","Hey, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","So, first, just a clarification, Bina mentioned you expected gross margin improvement each quarter this year. Are you still expecting 75 to 125 basis points for the full year and then, the real question is your toothpaste and toothbrush market share momentum looks like it\u2019s slow this quarter. The toothpaste year-over-year share change was the worst we\u2019ve seen recently. So, I was just hoping for more detail on what\u2019s driving that performance, particularly which geographies and your view on if the share losses will continue going forward or if that\u2019s more temporary factors in Q1?","Ian Cook","Okay, Dara. Let me -- before I get to the gross margin, let me put the gross margin position in sort of a broader context and underscore a couple of the points that Bina has already made. First, we are very pleased with the first quarter\u2019s topline performance and we would reaffirm our target range of organic growth for the year at between 5% and 7%. We think that is going to be a very strong range, particularly as our categories remain range bound in Europe, growing at between 1% and 2% and similarly so in North America. And in our emerging markets, we see category growth rates slowing slightly from 6% to 8% range previously to now 5% to 7%.","And the things we think will continue to drive that organic rate of growth are in innovation and of course the advertising, which was up absolutely and as a percent of sales this quarter and we expect it to be up absolutely and as a percentage to sales for the year. Now very importantly, of course, Dara, as you correctly point out, is the gross margin and what our expectations are for gross margin during the year. We are still comfortable with the gross margin expansion of between 75 and 125 basis points.","But obviously given recent foreign exchange volatility, which we have to react to and our, we would say that our margin expansion will be at the lower end of that range more in a 70 to 100 basis points band. Our funding of the growth program remains strong and I think some were little bit questioning our ability to take pricing in Latin America in the fourth quarter. And I think you see in the first quarter what is the usual sequence in these events, which is there is a lead lag between the foreign exchange impact, particularly when it is, as precipitates as we saw in this first quarter and you will see pricing continue across the balance of the year.","And all of that led us to reiterate our EPS guidance of 4% to 5% on a dollar basis for this year or double digit currency neutral. And I\u2019m reading some of the earlier notes this morning.","Let me just walk through that reiteration. I think most of you will remember that in our release at the end of January, when we announced our fourth quarter results, we expressed growth of EPS in line with the consensus of external analysts\u2019 estimates at that time and then in February, February 18th to be price, we made our disclosure and announcement on Venezuela and indicated from that proposition that the Venezuela impact would be between $0.11 and $0.14 to EPS on the year with the first quarter at $0.03 to $0.04.","And then of course today, we disclosed that the first quarter was $0.03 and we expect the rate going forward to be at the same $0.03 per quarter, $0.12 on the year, consistent with the prior range and at that 4% to 5% a dollar and double-digit currency neutral rate.","To come to market share, a couple of comments on toothpaste. First of all, the shares that we talk about are dollar weighted, that\u2019s the way we collect the data and aggregate it. And in Venezuela, we have an extremely elevated market share. We are still trying to find the three Venezuelans that don\u2019t brush with our toothpaste. So given the currency moves in Venezuela, about a third of the share decline that you highlighted, the 1.3 points is simply mathematical to do without dollar weighting.","The other two geographies of an operating nature are the U.S. and Mexico as we have said before, and we said that our innovation and some adjustments to our marketing program to meet the competitive promotional activity we saw in both of those markets would be taken and they have been taken. And I think in the U.S., some of you had already commented on the more recent consumption and share data that the toothpaste progress for Colgate is good. We continue to see that in the near-term weekly data and we expect that to continue going forward. Same actions have been taken in Mexico and we expect to saying forward progress to strengthen our share in the 80 range. And in addition, in Mexico, we have just this month introduced the superior anti-cavity toothpaste, which has been highlighted has done very well, everywhere we had launched it.","Toothbrushes are affected by the same Venezuela calculation. Indeed, the modest 30 basis points decline you highlighted there is entirely driven by the Venezuela mathematical calculation. All of our divisions are either flat to up in market share with the exception of Africa, Eurasia where we are responding to in South Africa and Russia, specifically local market activity which we fully expect to be reversed over time. So no, we do not expect or plan for those share positions to continue as you laid them out.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go next to Steve Powers with UBS.","Steve Powers - UBS","Hi, Ian. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Hi, Steve.","Steve Powers - UBS","I guess it was another solid quarter as you say of organic growth, 6.5%, overall and especially, 10%, in the emerging markets. How do you think about that relative to some of the outsized inflation that we are seeing in certain markets, especially in Latin America? If you agree with that characterization, especially in Argentina, Venezuela for example, how do you estimate that is adding to your organic growth, or conversely do you believe it\u2019s really not that additive given the degree of volume and mix trade-offs in those same markets? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes. I would say if you look at the underpinning volume in Latin America for example, we view that as very healthy. When you talk about outsized inflation in Venezuela, remember that is true from a macro point of view, but bylaw in Venezuela, we are extremely restricted on availability to take pricing across most of our business. So I think we are very pleased with the progress. We view it to be real substantive and we see it continuing.","Operator","We\u2019ll move to the next question with Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson - Citi","Hi, good morning. I don\u2019t want to be a dead horse on this pricing in Latin America thing, but that\u2019s my question too. And the question is, historically when there has been currency question in Latin America, the pricing you could able to take on an annual basis I get that there is a [lie] (ph), but on an annual basis it\u2019s pretty much close to a 1 offset. And my question is, if you look at the 6% pricing you got in the first quarter versus the 16% currency headwind, how much of that is Venezuela, how much of that is just timing? I mean, if we are going to see, let\u2019s call it in mid-teems currency headwind in Latin America, can you take anywhere close to that pricing ex-Venezuela because I think everybody is just nervous that maybe the competitive dynamic is preventive you from taking as much pricing? If you can answer that, that would be great.","Ian Cook","Okay. Well, the answer is no, it\u2019s not driven by competitors. As I said, when we posted just over 2% pricing in the fourth quarter, I think that question was raised that you now limited in terms of your ability to take pricing. And the answer is no, we are not. And I think the first quarter demonstrated that in quite a healthy way remembering we are not able in the first quarter given the move of some of the exchanges to take the pricing as quickly as the exchange takes the cost up for transaction reasons.","And in Venezuela, you frankly have to take Venezuela out of the equation because for the majority of that business, we are unable bylaw to take pricing. But we have demonstrated in the past and I think with Venezuela to one side, as far as the rest of Latin America is concerned, we have demonstrated an ability to price, to offset the foreign exchange. Indeed, in the more recent term, the Brazilian exchange is turn a we bit positive, but our plan would be as it has been in the past to be able to offset the transaction impact to foreign exchange with the pricing and funding the growth.","Operator","We\u2019ll move to the next question from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Actually again I am sorry to get you around this issue. I'm looking at Asia and Eurasia where the currency impact substantially has been, certainly we were the expecting and I guess there was deterioration towards the end of the quarter. Do you expect to be able to get pricing in those markets as you move through the year?","Ian Cook","The answer is yes, the answer is yes. We will be able to take the pricing in those markets. One has to say exactly as you said Caroline that the precipitous make sure of the currency moves in some of those geographies. I come back to everyone\u2019s estimation of the year, I'm not sure I saw anybody planning on the Crimea and the impact of Crimea on the Russian Ruble.","So some of those moves were really quite precipitous but we have the capability to take pricing. We had done so in some geographies already and we have plans and indeed are right now taking pricing in some of those markets to address the headwind of transaction. So we continue to have pricing capability. There is just a natural lead lag in terms of how quickly you can practically respond particularly when the foreign exchange has moved so quickly.","And I think in the world that we are in, our ability to plan for gross margin expansion are between 75 and 100 basis points a test to that capability.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Hi, thanks.","Ian Cook","Hi Chris.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Hi Ian. I guess I wanted to ask you about the slowdown you just cited in developing in emerging market and a point I guess is not a huge deal considering what we've seen elsewhere. But can you talk a little bit about, is that isolated to any specific geographies and what do you think is driving that specifically besides maybe the obvious sort of macro situation and maybe just that. And then also why do you think you can gain more share than you have been and sustain the top-line growth rate in the face of the slower market relative to say what your thought couple of quarters ago?","Ian Cook","Yes, I guess Chris. We're talking about fine differences here. We wanted to indicate that indeed we have seen a little bit of a slowdown. Other comments I have read from others suggest sharper than we have seen certainly in our businesses. I think it traces to the macros finally. In these cases, there is nothing untoward that we have seen so far in terms of consumer behavior. And I think our 5 to 7 range fits very nicely even with that slowdown. So I don't think it puts any more pressure on our desire, need or ability to build market share.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move next to John Faucher with J.P. Morgan.","John Faucher - J.P. Morgan","Thank you. In looking at your sort of how reported top-line growth will track over the course of the year and given the seasonality of the business, it's a little tough given the first quarter performance to get to the low end of the range from a gross margin standpoint. So can you walk us through sort of sequentially how we should think about just progressing through the year and sort of what the big changes are from Q1 to the balance of the year. Are there just efficacy from the additional pricing, what have you? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Okay. I can\u2019t resist John. I thought you were one that was questioning whether we could deliver the gross margin expansion. Well, I think -- let me say so you can come back to me at the end. Let me start with the traditional roll forward just that we have that as a starting point and then I will try and answer your question from there. Obviously, it's flat, so the star point was the same 58.6 as it is this year.","We picked up half a point from pricing. We picked up 1.4 from our funding the growth and a little bit of restructuring, material prices was a headwind of 2, a large part of that as we have already discussed was transaction. There was a modest 10 bps from other leading us to the 58.6.","So I would say the three main buckets of progress for the year quite obviously are pricing where we expect to get more pricing and therefore more contribution to the gross profit, funding the growth along with a little bit from restructuring and you know that our funding the growth tends to build over the year. And that would be the second major aspect of building our gross margin. And by talking about 75 to 100, all I was trying to do was to frame coming off the high-end of the range, we are not suggesting a 75 increase in gross margin.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merril Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merril Lynch","Thank you, I appreciate it. One quick question on housekeeping. Is it fair to assume the net interest expense will be similar to Q1, the Q1 rate going forward or whether any anomalies caught this quarter? And then on Hill's, I noticed that the margin was up for the first time in the last five quarters. And in the press release, you did state a number of puts and takes but one of them was lower ad spends. So was is just a function of comping against how you spend in a year ago as she prepped for the new line or if there shift in timing of spending or do you think there are just not a need to spend as much behind pet as you did before. And if that\u2019s the case, the change -- does the changing of hands for IMs, change your thought process in any way on that? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Changing, of course, I guess who I am. But on your housekeeping question on net interest, the net interest expense we think we'll go up on the year. We'll probably be in the 35 to 40 range for the year largely due to changes in our capital structure as we have taken on some longer term debt at very attractive rates, planning ahead to world where rates are likely to increase. So yes but plan fully as part of readjusting our capital structure.","Hill's is timing. Bina talked about some of the innovation on the Hill's business and the spending, we'll readjust. First quarter was strong last year because the timing of the innovation was earlier. So now we're very committed to our Hill's innovation flow which is very strong and frankly doing very well in market.","Operator","We'll move next to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Hi guys. So just a quick clarification and then a core question. The clarification is want to give you the opportunity of selling Venezuela to the side. And just if you could tell us what volume and organic growth would have been in Latin America ex-Venezuela? And then the other question, so you say the EPS growth of 4% to 5%. In fact, I think the same has since February at least for the year. Is it still above consensus? And I know you guys and the background of your team does a really good job of taking of our models and looking at it. And I'm trying to understand if you guys have a perspective on where you think consensus is too high, is it just currencies or are there other things that you would like to be pointed to?","Ian Cook","Yeah, well thanks for the opportunity to separate LatAm growth from Venezuela. But I shall politely decline that. We don't break it out in that way. I would say that we think, if you think about where Venezuela was three, four years ago as you well know it is substantially smaller portion of our corporation than it was then. And the Latin American growth, we think is very, very strong overall.","In terms of the second point Ali. Yes, you're right the 4% to 5% as we try to reemphasize at the beginning of the call has been where we have been. And there is nothing in that reiteration of guidance for the year that reflects anything other than foreign exchange and I would clarify and say that is the foreign exchange that analyst reacted to in January of the year with the Venezuela change which by the way I think makes our Venezuelan reporting more conservative than some who has stayed at the 630 rate.","And the -- it remains double-digits in terms of the EPS growth in local currency terms and in fact for the year looking forward after Venezuela, we see the currency impact for the year at around 5% which was pretty much where we had it before hand. So there is no incremental currency it nearly reflects actions taken through February of this year. So it is entirely currency related. There is nothing else.","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Hey, good morning.","Ian Cook","Hey, how are you?","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","I'm good. So the cash balance is massive, right. It's also like two equity done historically. Are you guys -- what\u2019s the plan about the cash because certainly you don't need your working capitals getting better. There is super cash generated, I know you talked about, rates going up and locking some fixed rate debt. But is there a use for all that cash.","And then second part of the question is well that in the same part of same question but the second question, is there a plan or way to get Venezuela profitable again. I know I lost money this quarter but is there anything you could do either structurally or strategically to get that turn positive again. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes. The cash balance entirely timing, entirely timing. It\u2019s related to when we took the debt. It will be washed out as we go through the year debt and cash will get back in balance. Net debt will end up in the same place. So nothing strategic, nearly timing.","With Venezuela, it is as you say modestly, it was very modest, negative for Venezuela in the first quarter. And obviously, we are in very constructive dialog with the government of this time about the need for relaxation of the pricing laws and for some pricing in order to make business in Venezuela profitable again. And we are hopeful that those discussions will lead to a productive outcome and that outcome of course, which has been our usual model and the rest of Latin America allows one to offset the gross margin pressure and see that translate through on the bottom line.","So those are the issues. You know, of course, that the first quarter was hit particularly by the historical one-time hit and that will come out across the balance of the year anyway. So we\u2019ll be in a better position than we were in the first quarter but the step change would be driven by pricing.","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Good morning, thanks.","Ian Cook","Hey.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","How are you? The question on or the comment on the sugar. I always get the name wrong but the cavity protection toothpaste that you are rolling out. The comment that you\u2019re moving more throughout Europe and maybe the Australia, are there plan to meet from the near term to go to U.K., Germany, France, some of the bigger countries, it may in next quarter to. And is it contributing to the overall European growth at this point or is it still really too small?","Ian Cook","To answer the last part of the -- actually you don\u2019t have to get the name right Bill, you just have to buy it.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","I get you.","Ian Cook","Yeah.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","That sort of trouble.","Ian Cook","In terms o Europe it is too early. We can say that in countries like Brazil, Turkey, Australia as Bina said that it is added to share nicely. We are expanding in Mexico as we\u2019ve said. You will see continued expansion across Europe and some of the other emerging markets, you could expect to cross the balance of the year. So we\u2019ll be moving quite broadly with this product, the reaction seems so far quite positive.","Operator","We\u2019ll take the next question from Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.","Michael Steib - Credit Suisse","Good morning. My question relates to raw material cost. I noticed that in most regions there were essentially a headwind to margins in the quarter, except in Europe where there were tailwind. I wonder is that all due to currencies or there other differences for example in the portfolio compensation as well. And then related to that, do you expect a similar headwind from raw material cost for the remainder of the year?","Ian Cook","Well, let me react to both. I would say what we saw in the first quarter was indeed largely driven by foreign exchange, which is why we saw such a positive progress in Europe. I think training raw materials overall, we\u2019re expecting for the year, raw and packing materials to increase by between 1% and 2% for the year. That\u2019s raw and packing for the year. And as I have mentioned earlier, our ability to deliver the gross margin expansion that we are planning is going to be driven by pricing, which we have already to a certain extent and we\u2019ll deliver going forward t5o offset that foreign exchange impact on raw and packing material.","Operator","We\u2019ll look at next question. It comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Hello. Good morning, everyone. I had a couple of questions, one on the restructuring. It seems like it was a big chunk this first quarter about 40% of what you plan for the year. Does it mean that you are taking it faster pace and originally plan in order to navigate this issue of a currency. And the other question has to do with Hill\u2019s. Certainly, very good performance, to what extent that has to do with the changes in planogram that (indiscernible) did or shall we continue seeing that at least for another quarter where we\u2019re going to see a strong growth from Hill\u2019s. Thank you.","Ian Cook","Thanks, Javier. No, there\u2019s nothing particular about restructuring in terms of -- it's just timing, our full year, full program ranges remain the same, both at the cost and the benefit, and we don\u2019t manhandle the restructuring to try and address foreign exchange issues. I think the point we made when we announced it was it would simply give us some agility and flexibility knowing that given the volatility of foreign exchanges, and therefore cost quarters might be a little bit lumpy.","Indeed, I\u2019m here which you are correct have here in the US. We had some quite meaningful planograms resets, which have been positive, which underpin the increase that Bina talked about a little bit earlier. And we continue to feel good about seeing our Hill\u2019s business go forward mid -single digits organic as we have spoken before. And the reason selling the planogram reset is good, but we\u2019ll get to the planogram reset is the quality of the innovation and trial generation that you can create for that innovation. And as we have said before, we think we have a very rich innovation pipeline now, which is moving to the market.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move to Alec Patterson with AGI.","Alec Patterson - AGI","Good morning.","Ian Cook","Hey, Alec.","Alec Patterson - AGI","Hi. So just quickly on the 75 and 100 basis points. I think I am crystallizing this into, it\u2019s predominantly moved to lower end because of currency. In other words, the other component, pricing and you have been planning all along. Commodity costs that are basically dollar commodity base were on pack. And then anything from funding the growth productivity haven\u2019t changed.","Ian Cook","Correct. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning, folks.","Ian Cook","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Thank you for allowing the question. Two quick ones. First, a quick housekeeping question. Can you quantify how much the advanced customer shipments in Japan contribute to that growth this quarter? And then other question is back here to home North America, we\u2019ve been seen solid growth both on the measure data as well as clearly into reporter results today. Well, we sliced and diced the measure data around 70% of gross been coming for mouthwash. Market share up year-on -year but running stagnant to kind of flat line sequentially at 6. Two months from now you\u2019ll start rolling over that 7% share you got on the initial search, trial building. So how should we think about growth on a go forward? What are the initiatives that can maybe get mouthwash and other like higher or that can kick some of the categories into higher growth notes to drive more contribution for them?","Ian Cook","Thanks, Jason. On mouthwash as you know, I talked about the toothpaste change in momentum. Obviously the toothbrush business share up over 41 is terrific. That of courses is the second largest category in oral care. Mouthwash, we are pleased where we are. Two things will continue to grow our business in mouthwash. Number one, innovation and the variants that come with that innovation which we have seen, we will continue to see. The second is interesting in the U.S. is always packaging sizes in terms of retail environments. And consumer purchasing habits, you will see more of that as the year unfolds.","And most importantly, trial-generating devices, we know the repeat rate of the businesses is high. We know that it takes over two years to build your trial curve and we will continue to be putting money behind that. So we have a great product. We can add to the product and we\u2019ll be focusing on building trial. In terms of Japan -- no, we don\u2019t breakout at the country level.","Suffice to say on Japan, I think it was Ali on the last call was questioning the trajectory of that business. We\u2019ve had some folk in Japan only a couple of weeks ago. We\u2019re going through a thorough review of that business and there is confidence I would express that notwithstanding the pull forward, that we have our Japanese business now for Hills on a solid footing and a positive underlying trajectory and we will see that in the coming quarters.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Ian Cook","Thanks, Nancy. Well, thanks all of you for your interest in the company and your questions. And thank you to the Colgate world for delivering the results that allow the questions.","Operator","That does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation."],"6264":["Colgate-Palmolive Co. (NYSE:CL) Q1 2017 Earnings Call April 28, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","John Faucher - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Ian M.

Welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive Company First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings release and the most recent form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, also available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables eight and nine of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead.","John Faucher - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Thank you, Sherlon. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO, Dennis Hickey, CFO, Victoria Dolan, Chief Transformation Officer and Corporate Controller, and Elaine Paik, Vice President and Treasurer. This morning, I will start off with some general commentary on the quarter, will then go into further detail on the divisional performance, and I will finish up with some color on our outlook for the rest of 2017.","As Ian said in the Press Release, Q1 was challenging, and from an organic sales perspective it fell sort of our expectations. Overall, we saw continuation of the sluggish market environment we highlighted on our 2016 year-end conference call. Several of the issues we highlighted on our call in January improved as expected, including the impact of the Indian demonetization. That said we did see some additional headwinds this quarter, which I will detail as with we go through the divisions. Despite these headwinds, there were several positives in the quarter, particularly in terms of earnings growth, gross margin expansion, and operating cash flow growth.","Taking a brief run through the P&L, our net sales were flat in the quarter with organic sales up 0.5%. Our sales growth continues to be led by Latin America, which saw 9% net sales growth and 7.5% organic sales growth in the quarter. Organic sales growth in emerging markets was 3%. Organic sales were down 2.5% in developed markets. Volume was down for the quarter offset by positive pricing. Our gross margin expansion continued in Q1 on top of strong expansion in 2016. Our gross profit margin expanded 50 basis points on a GAAP basis and 70 basis points excluding charges from the 2012 Restructuring Program. We saw solid benefits from pricing and Funding the Growth.","Our advertising spend in the quarter increased 1% on a dollar basis and was flat as a percentage of sales against our strongest advertising quarter last year. Versus our full year 2016 advertising to sales ratio, our advertising to sales ratio in the first quarter 2017 was up 120 basis points worldwide with an increase across every single division. We still expect advertising spending to be up year-over-year on both a dollar basis and as a percentage of sales for full year 2017. Given that Q1 was a high quarter mark for our advertising to sales ratio in 2016, the year-over-year increase in 2017 will be more weighted towards the balance of the year.","On a GAAP basis, we delivered high single digit EPS growth. Excluding charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program in both periods, our diluted earnings per share in the first quarter 2017 was $0.67, an increase of 6% versus first quarter 2016.","Cash flow performance was very strong in the quarter driven primarily by our growth in net income and continued improvement in our working capital performance, particularly on receivables and inventories. Over the course of the quarter, we reduced both our receivables and our inventories by more than one day versus Q1 2016. Our operating cash flow was up 13% year-over-year, while our free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx grew by 14%. We returned $678 million to shareholders in the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. This was almost a 20% increase versus Q1 2016.","And now we'll move to the divisions. We'll start off with North America. As other consumer product companies have said, Q1 was a difficult quarter in North America. In particular, we experienced challenges in our hand dish business and saw consumption weaken across the vast majority of our categories, particularly in the United States. Combined with inventory reductions in retail, this led to a 5% decline in net sales and a 5.5% decline in organic sales. Volume was down 5% in the quarter with pricing down 0.5%. A restaging of our hand dish line led to some market share losses in the quarter. This restaging involved switching out SKUs which temporary limits our ability to promote the brands and has led to an increase in competitive activity and market share erosion.","We believe this transition, which is almost complete in the mass channel and will be complete in the food channel in the second quarter, positions the hand dish business well for future growth through increased shelf space and more effective consumer promotion. With the completion of the reset later this quarter, and new advertising already in the market, we think this business is well positioned to rebuild market share.","On the rest of our U.S. businesses, our market share performance has generally improved sequentially over the course of the first quarter after a drop in late Q4. In particular, we have seen sequential improvement in our oral care share performance in the United States. The sequential improvement in our toothpaste share performance has been aided by continued growth in our premium portfolio. Tom's of Maine continues to gain share. Our Q1 launch of Colgate Optic White Radiant in the U.S. which is being supported with the robust integrated marketing campaign including significant TV and digital advertising support, has also aided our share performance.","We also launched Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Smart White in Canada another premium offering. The toothpaste category in North America and around the world continues to premiumize, and we are seeing success with innovation at higher price points. Year-to-date our mouth rinse market shares are up year-over-year driven by the Q1 launch of Colgate Total Advanced Health Mouthwash. When a consumer shakes the bottle, they combine the freshening and germ killing layers to reduce 24 times more bacteria than ordinary non antibacterial mouthwashes.","Now we'll look at Latin America. Latin America continued to be a key driver of our growth in our portfolio, both on an organic sales and a net sales basis. Our net sales growth of 9% was driven predominantly by pricing, as volume was flat and foreign exchange provided a 2% tailwind. We continue to see growth in volume in Mexico driven by strong share gains in toothpaste. Year-to-date our Mexican market share in toothpaste is up more than 200 basis points to 82%. We have seen share growth across most of our toothpaste brands led by Colgate MaxFresh, Colgate Triple Action Extra Whitening and Colgate Anticavity. Mexico has also seen strong share gains in mouth rinse and bar soap.","In Brazil, we maintained our leadership in the toothpaste category during the quarter with our year-to-date market share of 72.1%. Share performance was more mixed across the rest of Latin America. However, we expect this to improve going forward. We have several new product launches scheduled for the second quarter and we believe this additional activity along with our increased advertising investment year-over-year should result in more consistent share gains.","Now we'll move to Europe. We are hardened by the sequential improvement in our volume and organic sales performance in Europe this quarter versus Q4 2016 which came despite some continued impact from our distribution issue in France. Europe net sales were down 5% in the quarter with organic sales down 0.5% and a 4.5 percentage point impact from foreign exchange. This represents an acceleration of 300 basis points on an organic basis versus Q4, driven by improvement in volume trends as volume was up 0.5% in the quarter versus negative 2% in Q4 2016.","Net sales trends improved by 250 basis points sequentially as the improvement in volume was offset by slightly greater negative impact from foreign exchange. Encouragingly, for the quarter we saw sequential improvement in the UK and France from Q4 2016. Our volume in the UK was up nicely, and we improved our pricing on our base toothpaste business. In France, as expected, our business is still down year-over-year, but the rate of decline has lessened. As we discussed on our last call, we experienced the loss of some distribution in France. We began shipping again to that customer during Q1 and this should help improve our sales trends in France over the balance of the year.","We also recently launched the Colgate Naturals oral care line in France. This product sells at a notable premium to the rest of our portfolio, which allows us to generate positive mix. We will be launching the Colgate Natural Extracts line in other European markets later this year. Other first half launches for the European division include Colgate Enamel Strength toothpaste, the Colgate 360\u00b0 Advanced Toothbrush line and the restage of our Sanex Zero% line.","Now Asia-Pacific. Net sales in Asia-Pacific were down 3% year-over-year driven mostly by the negative impact of foreign exchange. On an organic basis, sales were down 1%, a modest improvement versus Q4. For the quarter, volume was down 1% and pricing was flat. The primary challenge in this region was weakness in our China business where we saw significantly greater than expected retailer destocking due to the continued category shift from brick-and-mortar retail to e-commerce.","While brick and mortar market shares in China were down year-over-year, we continue to see significant share gains online in China. This quarter we achieved e-commerce share leadership in China behind the Colgate and Darlie brands. Going forward, we also expect to benefit in China from the national launch of our Colgate Naturals oral care line, which Ian talked about at CAGNY. We conducted a test launch of this product in one retailer to validate the brand positioning and size of the opportunity. Based on the positive response to this test, we believe we have a premium concept that works and that we can roll out throughout China.","Our Indian subsidiary has seen signs of recovery from the impact of the liquidity crunch in Q4. Urban consumption is back to normal. Rural consumption is still reflecting some lag effect as the wholesale channel has not completely bounced back. The Philippines also posted volume growth in Q1. Our toothpaste market share was up to 63% year-to-date, plus 110 basis points driven by market share gains on Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Sensitive. Along with the Colgate Naturals launch in China, Asia-Pacific should benefit from continued rollout of Colgate Total Pro-Breath Health toothpaste and Colgate SlimSoft Advanced toothbrush.","Africa\/Eurasia. The Africa\/Eurasia division showed notable improvement in Q1. Our year-over-year growth in net sales, organic sales and operating profit all accelerated sequentially from Q4 2016 despite the continued impact from the distributor changes in our Sub-Saharan African business. The sequential improvement in volume performance was driven by South Africa and the North Africa\/Middle East region. We're encouraged by the results from our new price tiering strategy on our base toothpaste brands in South Africa, which allows us to maintain household penetration, drive revenue growth and generate additional funds for advertising, all while driving margin expansion.","Our advertising spending in Africa\/Eurasia nearly doubled year-over-year in the quarter on a dollar basis. A notable oral care new product in the Africa\/Eurasia division for first half 2017 is Colgate Total Pro Visible Action toothpaste which is being launched across most of the division. On the Personal Care side we have launched Palmolive Luminous Oils shower gel. Both products will benefit from significant advertising support.","And finally Hill's. Hill's delivered 0.5% net sales growth for the quarter, driven by favorable foreign exchange. On an organic basis sales were flat year-over-year as the decline in volumes was offset by favorable pricing. Volume in the U.S. was down, driven by continued weakness in the U.S. pet specialty channel. We are making progress in regaining shelf space and promotional activity in pet specialty and continue to expect improved performance as we further align our strategic priorities with our top accounts in this channel. Our e-commerce growth continues to outpace the category as our e-commerce business nearly doubled year-over-year in the first quarter. Also our Prescription Diet business in the U.S. is growing nicely, driven by strength in the vet channel.","Outside the U.S. we saw organic growth in Europe driven by our online business and consumption is up across almost all of our European markets. Our emerging markets business saw strong growth in both net and organic sales in the quarter. Hill's should continue to benefit from the recent U.S. launch of Hill's Science Diet Youthful Vitality, which is specially formulated for dogs age seven years and older to help fight the effects of aging.","And now we'll turn to our outlook for 2017. As stated in our press release, we maintained our guidance of flat EPS on a GAAP basis and low single digit EPS growth on a non-GAAP basis. However, given the organic sales weakness in Q1, we now expect organic sales growth will be modestly below our historical target of 4% to 7%. Based on current spot rates, we expect net sales to be up low-single digits for the year with a slight negative impact from foreign exchange. We still expect gross margin expansion at the high end of our 75 to 125 basis points long-term guidance range. We will continue our intense focus on productivity. We have a strong pipeline of Funding the Growth cost savings programs for 2017. Furthermore, in the last year of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we continue to identify incremental opportunities to drive costs out of the organization.","Our new organic sales outlook is based on an assumption that our category trends in the U.S. will improve versus Q1, but that growth will remain below the rates we saw in 2016. We expect sequential improvement in organic sales as we proceed through the year. There are several reasons why organic sales should improve as we go through the year. Our category growth rates in the U.S. have improved since the fall-off in February. We believe the performance of our U.S. hand dish business will improve as we finish the transition to our new SKUs. As we mentioned in the divisional sections, many of the headwinds that we saw in Q4 have lessened in Q1 and should be even less of an impact going forward. Our benefit from new products should accelerate as we deliver a broad array of innovation throughout the year, and the benefit from our additional sustained advertising investment.","Finally, I have one housekeeping announcement. Due to scheduling conflicts, we will be issuing our Q2 earnings release and hosting our conference call earlier than normal this year. Our Q2 earnings release and conference call will be on July 21. Finally, let me clarify that the operator meant to refer to table 6 in our earnings press release in her opening statements.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Thanks, John. This is Ian. I thought that I would make a few summary comments on our position going forward specifically around top-line growth and I thought I might do that in a couple of ways. Obviously, when we provided our fourth quarter results, we identified some challenges that we were working through. And John has spoken to them, but I thought I would summarize them in one place and then comment further on the additional challenges we have faced this first quarter and why we expect to make the sequential progress that we have talked about.","So if we go back to the challenges identified in the fourth quarter, the India demonetization, the consumption is clearly recovering and is expected to continue to strengthen across the balance of the year. In terms of France, the shipping has recommenced with that customer. In fact, we are already seeing a short-term market share uptick and, again, that redistribution should benefit our sales across the balance of the year.","For our U.S. pet distribution, we are making good progress in regaining promotional activity across all of pet specialty, commencing in the second quarter and again expected to influence the balance of the year. And as John mentioned, e-commerce with that business continues to grow at an extremely strong rate, and pleasingly for us over half of the e-commerce business for Hill's is subscription which talks to the loyalty consumers have with that brand.","And finally, the fourth, Africa\/Eurasia, clearly we've seen notable improvement. The distributor changes are behind us although, of course, we will face that comparison through the third quarter of this year.","And then turning to 2017, in the first quarter there are two I would talk to. Much of which has already been said relative to North America and more specifically the U.S. business around consumption weakness, particularly through February, the related trade inventory reductions and, in our case, some dish share loss related to our transition of the complete portfolio and vulnerability to some promotional activity that we were unable at the time to respond to.","That transition will be complete in the second quarter with a more competitive product formulation, more competitive sizing and pricing, and trial-generating advertising and promotion is beginning. And so we think when the transition completes, we are well positioned to rebuild share. On our other businesses, as John commented, market shares have generally improved from the fourth quarter with specific improvement in oral care and category growth itself has improved since the decline in February.","China, I guess a tale of two cities in a way. Continued strong focus on the high growth area, which is ecommerce and where we now have share leadership between the Colgate and Darlie brands. But as John commented, some short-term value share loss in the brick-and-mortar outlets. Now, as I have said before, if one takes the long view over the last eight years, our company market share is actually flat at around 32%, and it is the two other principle multi-nationals who have lost share to the local brands. But short-term we have seen a value share decline. Interestingly, our volume share in China, short-term, is up, and that talks to the opportunity with our new innovation Naturals at a premium price point in order that we could convert that leadership volume share into a higher value share with more premium innovation, which is where that local marketplace is going to.","Moving beyond the specific challenges, we do have a full pipeline of new products, increasingly at premium price points, well validated by the consumers, and we do have increased sustained advertising investment levels up absolutely and as a percentage of sales for the year with the real year-on-year benefit unfolding as the year unfolds. And we know our business is responsive to that support.","For the businesses where it matters, we have a relentless focus on growing share in e-commerce. We continue in the emerging markets to bring new users to the category and increase consumption with our 25 plus year commitment to oral care education. And we do have an opportunity that we are working hard to capitalize on of converting our volume share positions, which tend to be higher in market than our value share positions with the efforts we have behind revenue management.","We have, as we always have, a very disciplined focus on cash flow and returns, well-spoken to by John. All I want to focus on is our particular focus on productivity. We were pleased with our gross margin expansion of 70 basis points in this quarter and we still are committed to our gross margin expanding at the high end of our 75 to 125 basis points for this year and we continue to work hard to identify incremental opportunities to drive cost out of the organization in this last year of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program.","So to summarize, we are guiding for accelerated top-line growth starting in quarter two and that is where we are focused, accelerating that top-line growth. As I have tried to summarize, we understand and are on top of the challenges we're working through and we do have a strong, well-funded plan for the balance of the year and we will bring absolute focus to the execution of that plan.","So, Sherlon, that's my prepared thoughts and I would turn it back to you now to open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll have our first question from Bonnie Herzog, Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, hello.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hey, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, I was hoping you could drill down a little further on the lower sales growth in North America and give us a sense of the magnitude of each of the issues you called out including your portfolio transitions in home care, retailer inventory reductions and the further slowdowns in the category growth. And then separately, would you say that the retailer inventory destocking in the U.S. remains a headwind or do you think things are improving on that front? And finally are you still seeing softness in the U.S. in April like Procter called out? Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Thank you for the one question, Bonnie. We're not going to drill down further into the U.S. business. We thought we were quite expansive in calling out the specific areas that affected that business, two of them much covered by external press as the quarter unfolded and indeed, as we indicated during our CAGNY remarks. I will say that the inventory reduction pressure seems to be behind us and have abated. As John commented in his remarks, we have seen improvement in category consumption since the fall off in February, and while we don't have complete data for the month of April, I would say that continues to be positive but not sequentially more positive than March.","Operator","We'll go next to Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, Ian.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hey, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to stick to the U.S. also for a minute and just kind of taking a step back and giving us some perspective or a bit of the state of the union on your view of volume trends here, more from an overall category perspective. It's just \u2013 it's pretty shocking to see a 5% volume drop for you guys and understanding some of the inventory cuts and consumer spendings muted, et cetera, all of those reasons, it's still worse than we even saw if you go back to the downturn in 2008\/2009. And I don't think it's just you guys. Obviously, you can see it in the peer results, you can see it in the Nielsen data. So just any perspective on what's driving the volume weakness from a volume perspective? And you mentioned you think category growth improves in the balance of the year, but what gives you confidence behind that?","And then second, just on a related note, how do you adjust your strategies in light of that? And it sounds like promotion and advertising was clearly a focus a few months ago, but doesn't seem to be paying off to the extent it typically has in the past. So how do you kind of adjust the Colgate playbook that served you so well in the last couple of decades within this tougher environment? Thanks.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah, I mean, that's a very deep and complex question, Dara. If you look at that first quarter, much has been said about weather. Much has been said about tax rebate checks and other external factors. From what we can see, with some retailers the tax rebate checks did seem to have an impact. And that is clearly behind us and hopefully will not reoccur next year, but we did indeed see volume decline in several categories and obviously, that is a concern going forward.","As I said, we saw it pick up a little bit in March, continued to be better in April, although not at the March rate. We've been doing some custom work around the world, particularly in the toothpaste market to understand consumers' buying behavior and we're not seeing people stopping brushing their teeth. I guess, some of the data that is emerging, in some markets you have consumers who buy multiple packs of the product and store them in their bathroom and when times are uncertain work down their own bathroom inventory before they go back to buy at retail. Now, depending on the marketplace, the on average number of tubes in the home is around two, and with the purchase cycle you have on toothpaste that gives you confidence they're not stopping brushing. They're going to come back to reuse the product.","So we think, turning back to the U.S., that it's a combination of the external factors, which are behind us, and the consumer in an uncertain time just working down that home inventory. But we're not seeing their brushing behavior change which, I think, is an important thing.","And as John said, from a share point of view, the advertising and promotional activity we have had in the U.S. is producing results in terms of our market share growth as we came through the quarter. So we think that part of the go-to market is robust. It is our estimation that the consumer will come back to the marketplace because their fundamental behaviors have not changed. And I would say trial-oriented promotion is still important in terms of our innovation flow and even our base business. So I think what one has to guard against, consumers are clearly prepared for the right value they perceive in a brand to pay a premium price. And I think and we have said this before, pure price promotion toothpaste volume does not accomplish that objective over the long-term. So it still comes back to innovation and support behind the brand and the innovation over the medium term.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Grundy, Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, good morning. Ian, question on the gross margin guidance, which you guys are maintaining the high end of the 75 to 125 basis points, based on John's prepared remarks, but I guess a couple of observations. Number one, you came at the lower end in the first quarter and gross margin comps get a little bit more difficult. And then given the difficult trade environment which you guys are contending with, which shows up in gross to net, it would seem like that would be a part of the strategy to increase that sort of in the balance of the year. And understanding you guys have a strong history with Funding the Growth to offset some of this, can you help us understand that your ability to deliver on the high end, which would suggest sequential acceleration in gross margin improvement, particularly in this environment, which is very competitive, particularly in the U.S.? Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah, Kevin, sure. Let me do one piece of housekeeping as I go through this in terms of our gross margin for the first quarter and that is to give you the gross margin pricing roll forward on the year. So if we start with the prior year gross profit, which was 60%, we got a benefit from pricing of 90 basis points positive. So actually our pricing was up. We got a benefit from our Funding the Growth savings and our restructuring of 140 basis points exactly the same as the benefit we got in the previous year. Material prices were slightly more of a headwind in the first quarter than the fourth quarter or the prior year at 150 basis points. And then we had a modest 10 basis points negative of all other, which got you to the 70 basis points.","So fundamentally, on that gross margin, the disproportionate year-on-year driver was negative material costs which traced largely to fats and oils, which went up sharply. And as you've probably been reading in the business press, the crop this year has been particularly strong. And we have seen fats and oils costs now coming down which will, of course, lessen the headwind of the material costs over the balance of the year, which will be favorable to us. And if foreign exchange stays where it is, we will have less of the transaction costs impact hitting us from a gross margin point of view. And as you know from our history, the benefit of our Funding the Growth tends to increase as the year progresses sequentially quarter-on-quarter. So that's how we're seeing it. It's still allowing us to be competitive.","Interestingly, if you look at the pricing we have taken in the market over the years when foreign exchange was strongly negative, over the last four years of all of the markets in which we do business, the only two where the pricing we have taken is ahead of the CPI are Brazil and Argentina, which perhaps wouldn't surprise you. So we don't think we've stretched pricing too much and we have an adequacy of promotional and advertising activity over the balance of the year, I think, to stimulate our brands and hopefully categories.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Powers, UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. So I guess, taking a step back from the quarter for a moment, my question is really whether there's something bigger going on because it's very rare for Colgate to surprise so negatively on organic growth two quarters in a row. And obviously, as you say, you're not alone having heard from Kimberly-Clark, P&G and others. But some of the recent surprises do seem execution related, whether in France or Africa last quarter, pet before that, managing local competition and channel shifts in China, and now U.S. dish. So maybe a little more context around the U.S. dish surprise this quarter and why you didn't have more visibility to the sequential deceleration we're seeing today when you spoke to us at CAGNY and reiterated the intent to accelerate this quarter?","But then more broadly, why should we not be more concerned only about Colgate's results, but of the state of the broader consumer goods industry? Because maybe this really does all blow over in the next few quarters as it seems like everyone is assuming, but for now this seems like an abnormally impaired operating environment even relative to the warnings we heard throughout the quarter. So a little bit on your situation specifically, but then your perspective on the broader industry would be great. Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah. I guess, as you might expect, I bristle at the concept of executional issues. I mean, the reason I tried to go through the fourth quarter challenges in summary form this call was to try and put that in some perspective. Frankly, well, India demonetization was an issue that affected everybody, clearly external. From the customer point of view, we had several things going on, including some fairly tough discussions. And we're very disciplined in terms of how we manage our trading terms in order that we maintain the value that is in our brands.","And we're also very disciplined in executing to a strategy that we deem is serving the consumers that we ultimately serve. And in the pet nutrition business, that is the shift to ecommerce which we are committed to following. And in the European case, we wanted to be responsible about the trading terms for our brands. And we suffered in both cases. That has now dissipated but, candidly, faced with the same choices, we'd make the same decisions. So they were decisions rather than execution.","Africa\/Eurasia actually the same. We found the negative economic pressures in those countries put distributors under pressure and it forced us, from a credit point of view, to make a decision. And we did, and we are rebuilding from that. So I would put all of those in the context of decisions made with the exception of India demonetization. And candidly, faced with the same decisions we would make them again and maybe that's just in certain cases the trickle-down effect of the slowdown in world markets as it affects other partners that we work with.","Two aspects of the U.S. relates to the consumer and external factors, that is the trade inventory and the consumption weakness. The dish share matter again is a judgment. When you make these portfolio changes and basically change all of the SKUs in your line, you are frozen out of promotional advertising because you have to lock pricing through the transition period, you know you're vulnerable to promotional activity. Frankly, the promotional activity was at a much higher level than we had estimated. We still believe that making that change was right because we have a more competitive offering on the shelf in a more competitive array of packages and price points by channels of trade. And we expect that refreshed portfolio to rebuild over the balance of the year.","And China, our e-commerce position is good and our volume market share is fine. We just need to do more to leverage that volume share up and we hope the Naturals premium innovation with more to follow will be the key to doing that.","I think the fundamental issue here, Steve, is what are the underlying growth rates in categories and how do companies capitalize on those growth rates. As John said, from a U.S. point of view, we're looking at recovery over the balance of the year but not to prior year level. So our plans consider a slightly slower curve of return. And in the international markets, we are still seeing mid-single digit growth even if it has been more pricing than volume driven at this time and would expect to see that shift a little bit. So we don't think the fundamentals of the business are broken. We aren't seeing consumers changing their behaviors fundamentally, so we think it's a case of working through the short-term and the buying behaviors will recover over the balance of the year.","Operator","We'll go next to Faiza Alwy, Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hi. Good morning. So, Ian, I just wanted to talk about, as you think about your algorithm going forward and the 4% to 7% sales growth, and then at the same time you look at your Funding the Growth savings. Do you think that you're doing too much with respect to Efficiency savings? And do you think there needs to be a step change in reinvestment, whether it's on the digital side or more investment in frontier markets sort of recognizing the reality of activism threats, et cetera. But do you think you need to sort of fundamentally rethink the algorithm?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Well, thanks, Faiza. That's again a broad question. I must say we tend not to think in terms of algorithms. We tend to think more in terms of strategically growing the business and while the 4% to 7% remains our long-term strategic growth target, as we said in the press release, given the slow start to this year, we expect to be modestly below that range because of the factors affecting the first quarter.","We agree your point that brands respond to and we think our brands respond to investment in innovation and in advertising support, and that's why we are so committed to make that investment sustainably over the balance of the year which will affect the year more as the year unfolds. We're very committed to that. We're committed to it digitally. We're committed to it in advertising. We're committed to it in research and development to create an underlying pipeline of innovation that can fuel the business. We're committed to it with the formation of commercial hubs, which in some cases is giving us more resources on the ground to build our brands that particularly applies from a selling capacity point of view in the emerging markets. So we're committed to making those investments.","In some parts of the world where underlying growth rates are just slower and have been for several years, it is, I think, untenable to continue to operate the way you have because the business itself does not support the infrastructure servicing it. And we thought as we began our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we had a wonderful opportunity to use the power of SAP, which drives all of our business to move this commercial hubbing idea, which we had 15 years of experience in very effectively in Central America, move the idea of shared services to service subsidiaries and free them up to operate on the ground. I would add, business service centers staffed by Colgate people, not outsourced, to make us more efficient and free up cost and free up funds to invest in the business.","So I think we're very focused on this balance between how far can you go and what do you need to drive the business on the ground or to drive business digitally. And we certainly haven't shied away from any of those investments. So we agree your posture and we're working very hard to execute against precisely that.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason Gere, KeyBanc.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, thank you. I guess, maybe following up on that last question. Seeing the trends that you saw, I guess, in January and February and the guidance that you're providing, I guess, about advertising, I'm just wondering if there was any need to step up some of the, I guess I would say the SG&A investments in order to kind of drive, I guess, the back half type of growth whether did the advertising budget change a little bit more shift to digital. Any other investment capability investments such as addressing more on the online business versus the brick-and-mortar with the slowdown there. So just wondering, over the last couple of months has there been any type of step change in terms of how you're investing over maybe the next year or so.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Well, I would say, Jason, I think more reflective of underlying trends than necessarily January and February, we're definitely shifting more of our investment to digital, no question, and we have many, many good, in fact, terrific examples of that. And that will continue and in some markets, I mean Hill's, for example, it's a 100% of the investment. So we will continue to push digital from a social, consumer engagement point of view. We're driving e-commerce as fast as we can. We're staffing separate groups to do that. China, we're beginning to see the outcome of that in terms of market share leadership in that country on e-commerce. So step change not in response to January\/February, step change in terms of last year to this year and continuing to revisit the balance as this year unfolds? Absolutely. Absolutely.","Operator","We'll go next to Ali Dibadj, Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hey, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So remember when we all debated on these calls whether lowering advertising spend as a percent of sales and shifting much more to trade spend which has grown to about four times your advertising spend, and we were debating whether that would lead to slower growth in top-line and some market share issues, and I guess, I'm assuming you all remember that. In retrospect, do you think that had anything to do, has anything to do with the slowdowns you're seeing today in the top-line, especially when yes category growth has slowed? But there are some kind of dollar share loss challenges, market share kind of challenges out there that are persistent, whether it be Brazil, UK, France, maybe coming back giving Carrefour, or China, India, at least it's more challenging. Mexico, you've turned a little bit. So a little bit of the ad spend postmortem would be helpful.","And then as it relates to that, last time you were kind enough to give category growth targets, so North America 2%, Europe flat and emerging markets 5%. Clearly that didn't play out for the quarter, but could you update those numbers as you look forward for the rest of the year?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah, well, let me start with the second and in terms of the category growth. So for the emerging markets, in general, we're continuing to see mid-single digit category growth. And as I've said earlier, sometimes more weighted to price than to volume, but nonetheless in that mid-single digit range. As we have said before, the European environment is quite flat, and we would say 1% would be exciting for Europe. And I think, we've kept that generally flat view from a European point of view. I think, from a U.S. point of view, we had been in that 1% to 2% range for the U.S. business. And based on what we're seeing today, I think \u2013 before we were even thinking, gosh, we saw some months where it was moving beyond 2% and thought the exuberance of 3% might be on the cards, but I would say category growth in the U.S. you might expect to be to the lower end of that 1% to 2% range than beyond the higher end of the range. But we'll have to see how the year unfolds.","On the advertising discussion, Ali, I don't buy that. We continue to invest intelligently at retail. We continue to find ways. I was just in Europe the other week and saw some interesting ways we leverage the dermatologists with promotional activity at retail in France. There are many ways today that you can structure programs that are brand-building, not simply trade spending to build your brands. I agree with you and I think we were clear that we did not want to find ourselves this year in the position of reducing our advertising investment, our below the line advertising investment when faced with some of the surprises everyone has felt from foreign exchange, and we have made that commitment, and we will stick to that commitment. And that's something that will guide us going forward. But I don't think the Colgate advertising stance has affected the category growths. The category growths are what the category growths are.","Operator","We'll go next to Olivia Tong, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. First just one clarification. You mentioned both in the UK and Africa improving price on base toothpaste. Are you making any changes to opening price points in any other markets?","And then just bringing the focus back to the U.S. and sort of the step change there. I guess for, not just you guys, but are you and quite frankly many of your peers just tapping the market in a way that worked for prior generations, but with millennials forming households and this generation that grew up, like, Googling to do their homework and consuming everything on their phones and iPads. They're just not shopping and consuming the same way that prior generations did, they don't hold as much inventory in their house. They don't need to do that anymore, because you just yell at Alexa when you need to replenish something and it comes to your door within two days. And that convenience matters more and maybe in-store promotion doesn't have the same lift that it used to. And if that's the case, how does it influence pack size and innovation? And do you think that the industry, including yourself, is doing enough, because every generation will have differences relative to the prior one, but it does feel like this one is more of a step change than in the past because we've talked about how the retailers are holding less inventory, but what about the consumer too are? And it's not just because times are tough right now. Thanks.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah, well, thanks Olivia. I'm going to go home tonight and ask Alexa for sequential organic growth in the quarter. That would be very helpful. But to take your two questions. The opening price point idea. I think the thinking here, Alexa is that \u2013 Alexa. The thinking here is that we have an opportunity, as John said, to convert our volume share into higher value and that has \u2013 there are two elements of strategy to that. One is innovation that the consumer values that carries a premium price point that helps shift the portfolio over time.","The other is finding intelligent ways to group and tier brands in your base business to elevate value with pricing being a component of the value delivered. And yes, the two examples given are the U.K. and South Africa, but it is clearly something that we are considering more broadly than those two countries. On e-commerce, I don't think as you imply correctly that the sort of millennial effect or the new household effect relates to the first quarter category slowdown and this is highly variable around the world. I mean, you've got a situation in Latin America where I think it's over 40% of new parents are already millennials and frankly their shopping habits are not yet highly developed from a consumption point of view on the Internet, but they're heavily influenced by social engagement on the Internet. So we reach them disproportionately through social media, but they shop in the traditional outlets that perhaps even their parents shopped in, maybe some change from a physical location, but it's not yet Alexa online driven.","In the U.S., there is more of that shift. We see it most markedly with Hill's, and we like that. I mean, frankly if 50% of our e-commerce business is subscription that attests to the strength of the brand. And when you get to that kind of relationship with consumers is does that require new packaging, et cetera? The answer is yes, it does, and we have a terrific example on Hill's with Amazon where we worked to reshape the packaging in terms of protecting the product. In terms of using recycled material in the packaging in terms of that outer case being recyclable, which is something that the average pet parent that buys Hill's is interested in because it shares their value set. And so yes, when we move down that path, we indeed do all of those things and we're pushing hard. We are the leading company in oral care online in the United States.","So we're moving hard down that path but still, in aggregate, in our categories today, the Internet is not a significant part of the business, but we're well positioned to capitalize on it if that hits a tipping point just as we've capitalized on it in China where indeed it is growing much more quickly than it is in the U.S. So should that shift happen, I think we're putting the right resources in place to capitalize on it, but not a significant force yet.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Thank you. I just want to follow up with the Chinese destocking. I was just hoping that \u2013 John mentioned that it was basically due to the shift to online. So I was hoping to see if you can give us any color on how that is evolving, and when do you think that would be behind us? Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah. The way we think about it, as I said our volume share is up a little bit in China, which is good. I would say one of the other benefits we have in China, we have a multinational brand and we have a Chinese brand and I think that helps our market position in China, and strengthens our view going forward. This shift to e-commerce is continuing at quite a clip. So our current view is that it's going to be a couple of quarters before that's completely resolved.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And on that, Ian, if you can comment. You said about the commentary that Ali had asked on the category growth and, Ian, out of the 5%, could you give us a sense of how you'd be seeing for emerging markets going forward?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","I'm sorry, I missed the \u2013 emerging markets we did say 5%, yes.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It's still 5%. I'm sorry, yeah. Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yes, yes, I said that. Yeah.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","I mean, mid-single digits around that 5%. Yeah.","Operator","We'll go next to Jonathan Feeney, Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks very much. I guess it turns out a little bit of a follow-up on e-commerce and China. Can you tell us, Ian, if you can or give us a sense, how your volume share in e-commerce now compares to your volume share in brick-and-mortar. How is it different, like what's allowing you to gain share in e-commerce right now, like how are the competitive dynamics different, the things you have to do? And how does that market more broadly show us what development of e-commerce is going to look like in North America and Western Europe if it shows us anything at all? Thanks very much.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah, so the answer is we lead, but the leading share is below our brick-and-mortar share. That is often the case with e-commerce because e-commerce tends to carry a lot more brands in their list of offerings. So there's still opportunity to expand there. And my gosh, the what's different, I mean everything is different. I think the most fundamental way to say it is that you can't think of e-commerce as if it's a digital shelf. So you have to be focused on engaging with the consumer on the way to transacting with the consumer.","And there are many cues to good engagement, including how you show the product, including how you promote the product, including the ratings behind the product. So there are lots of touch points on the way to converting that engagement to sale. There are price points that work. And so we have teams that focus on all of that. The good thing with e-commerce is you get a real data flow in terms of the purchasing behavior of the consumer and you can react in terms of the way you go to market and offer your product to that consumer. And we're always trading ideas between what is working in the United States and how is the Chinese e-commerce business unfolding.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","And Ian, when all's said and done, will e-commerce, will a fully developed or a largely developed market whether China or anyplace else in e-commerce, in your opinion, wind up. I mean, can it be a more profitable market for Colgate?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","I would say the answer to that is yes.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Ian, just a couple actually specific questions on the quarter. First on the hand dish issues in the quarter. I mean, was that a surprise? I imagine you've restaged products before and seen competitive pressure, so I'm just trying to understand what was the disconnect in the quarter from what you were expecting. And then also on pet, you'd talked about weakness or John talked about weakness in the pet channel. Was that largely just in line with the channel or were there still some carryover from the issues you've had specifically with the retailers and some of your brands?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah, to answer the second first. Yes, there was the lingering overhang of the issue we talked about on the fourth quarter which, in thoughtful language, we tried to convey is in the process of being addressed and should start to see a benefit back as we move through the balance of the year. So the answer to that is yes.","I guess what was surprising about \u2013 two things about hand dish. Number one, it is rare that we restage an entire portfolio. But we felt from a competitive point of view that we not only had to make and wanted to make formula improvements to our product, but we wanted to completely reshape the sizing and pricing to compete in the different retail outlets more effectively. And with major retailers, you're given one window a year to do that. So either you do all of it in one go or you do one bit this year and then the next bit a year later in which case the sizing and pricing wouldn't harmonize effectively. So we made the judgment call to do it all in one go.","And I guess what surprised us was the intensity of professional reaction in that category. That category was actually down from a consumption point of view quite significantly, and the competitive reaction perhaps because of that decline was, I think, four times the normal level. And we were frozen on pricing because we were making the change, and so we took a disproportionate hit.","Now, I think the thing here now is to look forward and say that reset is almost completed. We have a better product, better packaging and sizing and pricing portfolio on shelf, and we have the trial building advertising and promotion just commencing, so we're looking to recapture that share with a better offering as we go across the year. So I guess that's the answer.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thank you for the color.","Operator","We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman, Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hey, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. So I want to ask a little bit actually about productivity. So what was in the press release, and I think in the prepared remarks you talked about the final year of the Global Growth and Efficiency plan. You're looking for further opportunities. I wanted to be clear if that was sort of further opportunities in the confines of that program end this year, or if that's also about looking forward as to what comes next and just some broad thoughts around opportunities to bring down SG&A levels? Thanks.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Thanks, Lauren. Yeah, I would sort of come at that from where you ended rather than where you started. I think what we are focused on is incremental opportunities to address SG&A, and obviously we would like that to impact the business consistent with our current Global Growth and Efficiency Program timing. If that intense focus reveals future opportunities that we should consider, then we will clearly do that and be transparent about that at the appropriate time, but it is really a sharp focus on how can we meaningfully impact within the confines of the current program.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, Ian, does that mean that this year the outlook is dependent on coming up with more SG&A programs to fund the advertising you already are planning on doing?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Absolutely not.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Or no.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right, so I want to be clear on is that that this year context and looking to do more.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah, in other words, this year context is looking to do more than is in our plan.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Sure.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, and good afternoon everyone.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Hey, Mark.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Wanted to ask about how you're thinking about monitoring responding to local competitors in key markets where, like, China you're seeing this becoming more of a source of competition. And then related to that, is there a category that as you look at those local competitors, you're more concerned about potential share change becoming better competitors. And it would seem from the outside looking in, it's oral care sort of the obvious one, so maybe you could talk about that a bit and sort of go from there?","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Yeah, I would say many have mentioned this, local brands have become more of a factor. Their effectiveness actually varies market by market. We have a space in Latin America, and they have ebbed from the sort of five share points that they got to. I guess, China would be the most obvious and I tried to address that in my China comment, which is to say I think because we have a portfolio that includes both a, you might say, local brand and Colgate that we're quite well positioned there and indeed have opportunity to take premium up. The way to meet local brands, at least so far in our experience, is you have to cover their positioning. And in the case of many local brands around the world these days, indeed as we are doing with Tom's in the United States, but many of them attack the marketplace with a kind of a naturals view, so whether it's India or China or other parts of the world, we have some naturals innovation that we are bringing to the marketplace.","It can be different market by market but the general idea is naturals and we think that is the weapon, remembering in China that Colgate has held share for the last eight years, that we think that kind of offering and shall we say China for Chinese advertising is the key to the local brand. So they will be there. Some have interesting concepts, and I guess the job of the marketer is to meet the interesting concept. And that's what we're trying to do.","Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.","Okay, so thank you. I understand that's the last question. Thank you for all of your questions and interest in the company.

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgate-palmolive.com.","Now, for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.","John Faucher","Thanks Ebony. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC including our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings all available on Colgate\u2019s website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in table 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website.","Joining me this morning are Noel Wallace, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. I will start off with some thoughts on our progress halfway through the year. I'll then provide some details on Q2 and our full year outlook. I will then turn it over to Noel for his thoughts and he'll open it up for your questions.","Halfway through 2019, we\u2019re pleased but not satisfied with the acceleration in organic sales growth. As Noel discussed earlier in the year, delivering on our organic sales growth target is our number one priority for 2019.","We continue to focus on executing against three key areas to accelerate growth: using innovation to drive the core, pushing into adjacent higher growth segments and expanding our availability in faster growth channels.","These strategies have helped us to deliver broad-based improvement in organic sales growth over the past few quarters with a healthy balance between price and volume growth.","For both the first and second quarters we've delivered organic sales growth across all four product categories: Oral Care, Personal Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition and in both developed and emerging markets.","Our first area of focus is driving the core through innovation like Colgate Total and Hill's Science Diet re-launches. We\u2019ve seen Colgate Total's global market share improved sequentially since the re-launch and we're seeing significant increases in pricing across key markets.","For Science Diet we\u2019re seeing share gains in brick and mortar, as well as in e-commerce in the U.S. We\u2019re just at the beginning of the international rollout of this re-launch and the initial retailer response has been positive.","Secondly, we are pushing into adjacent higher-growth segments like Naturals and Therapeutics. We are very pleased with the progress that our Charcoal launches are making around the world and we continue to expand elmex and meridol to new markets.","Our third focus is to expand the availability of our products around the world by focusing on faster growth channels like e-commerce and discounters which are driving much of the category growth.","Our U.S. e-commerce business continues to deliver growth well in excess of the category driving significant toothpaste market share gains in the second quarter and year-to-date.","Next we're pleased to share progress in gross margin expansion in the second quarter as our gross margin was up for the first time in five quarters. Our focus on delivering pricing through premiumization and revenue growth management is paying off both in terms of organic sales growth and at the gross margin line, and our funding the growth initiatives are having a strong year so far.","We are also very excited about the transaction we announced two weeks ago. We\u2019ve spoken over the past few years about our focus on skin health. The completion of our acquisition of the Laboratoires Filorga Cosm\u00e9tiques Skin Care business will provide us with a high margin, very high-growth brand with a focus on the anti-ageing segment.","Filorga had net sales of approximately $250 million for the latest 12 months ending June 2019. The business is also nicely profitable as it has growth in operating margins that are above our overall Personal Care margins.","As we said in the press release announcing the transaction, we expect no impact to EPS this year from Filorga, that excludes $0.01 of transaction costs. We expect roughly $0.01 of earnings accretion in 2020. We plan to finance the acquisition with a combination of cash and debt.","In order to pay down the additional debt more quickly, we intend to reduce our share repurchase activity after the close of the transaction. We expect this will reduce our 2019 growth share repurchase by around 10% from last year's total of $1.24 billion.","Finally, we made some real progress on enhancing our leadership on sustainability. As part of our 2025 target to make all of our packaging recyclable, we received the first-ever approval for recyclable toothpaste tube in The United States from the Association of plastic recyclers. This is a big step in our sustainability journey.","Moving to our Q2 results. Our net sales declined 0.5% in the second quarter. We delivered 4% organic sales growth with 1% unit volume growth and 3% favorable pricing. This was more than offset by negative foreign exchange impact of 4.5%.","On a GAAP basis, our gross margin was up 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it was up 30 basis points year-over-year. Pricing was a positive 100 basis point impact to gross margin in the second quarter, while strong productivity performance drove a 220 basis point benefit.","This was mostly offset by a minus 300 basis point drag from raw materials inflation, which includes foreign exchange transaction cost and other was favorable by 10 basis points.","On an absolute basis, advertising investment was up 3% year-over-year. On a percent of sales basis advertising was up 40 basis points year-over-year with increases on a percent of sales basis in every division. We still expect the greater increase in advertising spending on both an absolute basis and as a percent of sales in the second half of the year.","Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and advertising spending, our SG&A expenses were up year-over-year in the second quarter on an absolute basis and as a percent of sales.","As higher compensation, logistics costs and the cycling of some one time benefits in the year-ago period more than offset savings from our productivity programs.","On a GAAP basis diluting earnings per share of $0.68 were down 7% year-over-year in Q2. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018 and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018 diluted earnings per share were down 6% to $0.72. Our free cash flow through the first half was $1.1 billion which was up 2% versus prior year.","Now taking a quick look at the divisions. North America net sales grew 2.5% in the quarter as 2% volume growth and 1% pricing growth were partially offset by minus 0.5% foreign exchange.","North America Oral Care growth was led by our toothpaste business where the Colgate Total relaunch help drive significant positive pricing. Our Personal Care growth was led by our PCA Skin and Elta MD professional skin care businesses, which continued to deliver a very strong growth.","On the Home Care business Fabuloso continued its strong performance reaching its highest ever market share in the US. Europe posted a 5% decline in net sales with organic sales up 1% and foreign exchange minus 6%. We\u2019re seeing sequential market share implement following the Colgate Total relaunch in key markets like the UK, Spain and Italy.","On the Personal Care side, our Sanex physiological line, which brings pharmacy trends into mass channels, is driving incremental share and body cleansing. Latin America net sales were down 0.5% as 1.5% volume and 5.5% pricing were offset by 7.5% negative foreign exchange. For the second quarter in a row, we saw organic sales growth in every hub, including Mexico and Brazil.","The underlying category growth rates in Latin America remain modestly positive, which is an improvement versus 2018. Our focus on premiumizing our portfolio through the Colgate Total relaunch, additional Oral Care and Personal Care premium innovation and revenue growth management, drove the strong pricing growth across the division.","Net sales in Asia Pacific were down 4%, driven by negative foreign exchange of 3%, a 1.5% decline in volume and positive pricing of 0.5%. We showed improvement in organic sales growth in the quarter, led by better pricing growth. As expected, China remained drag on our results, with all of the other hubs showing organic sales growth.","We\u2019re encouraged by the performance of the natural toothpaste brands in India and Thailand, while our South Pacific business benefited from strong pricing for the Colgate Total relaunch.","Our results in China improved sequentially in the quarter, but remained negative, as we continue to focus on optimizing our distribution network. As we indicated last quarter, we expect more significant improvement in the second half of the year.","The Africa, Eurasia division delivered robust underlying performance in the quarter, with net sales up 0.5%, volume plus 3.5%, pricing up 6% and foreign exchange of minus 9%. The division delivered organic sales growth across every hub, driven by strong pricing. Significant investment in advertising spending over the past few years is paying off in improved growth across the division.","Our Eurasia hub continued its improved performance, led by Russia, with solid volume and pricing growth, aided by the Colgate Total re-launch. Our strong volume and pricing performance in Turkey allowed the Colgate brand to achieve all-time highs in market share and establish market share leadership. Our Sub-Saharan Africa business also delivered a nice combination of volume and pricing growth in the quarter.","Hill's continued to deliver in Q2, with net sales growth of 3.5%, volume growth of 2% and pricing growth of 4%, were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of minus 2.5%.","The turnaround at Hill's over the last 2 years shows that a combination of increased marketing support and strong innovation, behind a compelling brand purpose narrative, can drive growth.","While growth was led by North America, every hub delivered positive pricing and every hub, but one, delivered volume growth in the quarter. The international results are encouraging, since they do not yet reflect any impact from the Science Diet re-launch outside of North America. Europe grew both volume and pricing in the quarter, behind our new Prescription Diet Stews business and e-commerce growth.","Moving on to full year guidance, which excludes the impact of the Florida transaction. We continue to expect net sales to be flat to up low single digits and organic sales to be up 2% to 4%. Given our performance year-to-date, we would expect organic sales to be towards the higher end of that 2% to 4% range.","Based on current spot rates for the full year, we still expect gross margin to be up year-over-year on both a GAAP basis and excluding charges related to our Global Growth and Efficiency Program.","We expect the benefits of pricing and our productivity programs to offset an overall increase in raw material costs which include foreign exchange transaction cost. We would expect advertising as a percent of sales for the full year to be fairly consistent with the first half level.","We now expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be between 25% and 26% both on a GAAP basis and excluding charges related to our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018 and the charge related to U.S. tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018. Our previous guidance was for 25.5% to 26.5%. ","Based on current spot rates, we expect GAAP earnings per share to be down low single digits for the year. Excluding charges related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018 and the charge related to U.S. tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018 based on current spot rates, we expect earnings per share to decline mid-single digits for the year.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel.","Noel Wallace","Great. Thanks John and good morning everyone. I thought I'd open up with a few thoughts before we jump into the Q&A. Solid quarter to be sure. We're pleased with the broad-based acceleration in organic sales growth, particularly for geographic and category level and more sharply around emerging markets as we've continued to focus on accelerating that part of the world.","As we\u2019ve said in the past and you've heard me talk about we're really trying to drive faster growth differently and that really begins with a clear understanding of our categories, clear understanding of our consumers in our retail environments and how they are changing and how it shapes our efforts, how it allocates our investments differently, how we decide to innovate differently against those changes and informs the investment choices that we make so far through the first half of the year and moving through the back of the year as well.","Happily, you are seeing us pay off to our increased investments in our focus on driving the core through to better utilization as John mentioned. We\u2019re very selective on the adjacent segments that we're going after, Naturals particularly is important; the Premium Therapeutic is an area of opportunity for us; and most recently the focus that we have on Skin Health behind Elta PCA and soon as we integrate the Filorga acquisition that we recently announced.","Lastly on the channel acceleration and specifically our go to market approach and we're going after e-commerce where we've seen significant acceleration in the first half of the year as well as in pharmacy and discount stores.","Now while the shares in track channels are not where they -- where we like them to be, the first step is obviously accelerating growth across our business on a broad-based perspective and you're going to start to see the shares improve in the back half, but first we need to get the top line moving.","And as you well know generating significant share growth and organic growth in non-track channels which is obviously not picked up in the share results that you're looking at.","But we know we need to drive profitable growth and to do that we need to change how we think about driving productivity across the organization as well. Of course, we remain focused on those traditional efforts that we've done so well.","Our focus on finding the cost which is off to a great start in the first half of the year in particular an accelerated in the second half of the quarter. The due jab which is come to end in the balance of this year, but we are well focused on fully maximizing that as we move through the next six months of the year.","And our productivity lens really needs to move beyond just the cost-cutting efforts. We need to think about productivity, and how we really maximize and fully realize the capacity of all the Colgate people around the Colgate world.","And to do that, we need to change how we work: eliminating and streamlining processes getting to quicker decisions through the use of data and analytics, using technology across the enterprise to support our business more effectively.","You heard me talk about a little bit in the past on SAP, and how we're \u2013 now upgrading S\/4HANA and we're now looking to build global capabilities once again that will make us far more productive with a single global standard far more simplified and automated system, to allow us to get their decisions quicker, and allow us to find efficiency faster. All of these changes were importantly free up capacity of Colgate people to drive growth and do that on a more sustainable basis moving forward. So excited about the progress we're making, but as I said earlier, more work to do.","With that, I'll turn it over to you for the Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Dara Mohsenian","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Noel Wallace","Hey, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","So this is now your third skin care deal in the last couple of years here in the segment for a company that generally has been pretty to judicious with M&A in the past. And you mentioned skin care expansion is a priority last quarter.","So I was just hoping, if you could give us a better state of the union around your interest in skin care, is gaining a lot more scale in the segment of priority as you look out over the next 5 to 10 years?","And just help us better understand the strategy to succeed in the segment from a Colgate perspective particularly relative to some of the larger established competitors that seemingly you are spending a lot of money and effort already in this segment? What gives you the confidence that Colgate can prosper in Skin Care? Thanks.","Noel Wallace","All right, Dara. Thanks. Obviously, we're - let's start off with Elta and PCA which we talked about know a couple of times. We love the capabilities they're bringing to the organization, but underscoring that is the category itself. I mean, Skin Care is a significant category. It's growing at a cliff of about 5% to 6% globally. We know, it's highly margin accretive to us and we feel like the spaces that we are very thoughtfully selected to participate in are spaces that we can do well.","So we talked about Elta particularly as we relate to the fact that they're very derm recommended and the capabilities and that we can bring to that on PCA statistician driven and the endorsements that we can continue to drive there. And more recently with Filorga, obviously they are very strong in the pharmacy channel, which we think we can obviously bring significant value to.","We\u2019re being selective on the space as we go into, but continue to be very judicious on the acquisition front. These things kind of happen in stream so to speak and we're obviously building out a very strong skin care portfolio, but will continue to be very, very mindful moving forward, and how we continue to build that.","If I look at Filorga very specifically, we really love the brand. It's positioned extraordinarily well demographically, when you look around the world. 90% of its business is in anti-ageing and certainly the demographic trends that we see both here in North America and all around the world bode well for that business moving forward.","Antiaging within the Skin Care segment is the fastest-growing sub-segment within Skin Care. It's highly profitable to the business and accretive on a gross margin basis. Importantly, they got a really well-balanced management team with significant experience in Skin Care that we think will add real value to us.","And as I mentioned earlier, we like the profile of the channels, particularly the pharmacy growth where their premium price within pharmacy, which we think will add a lot of value to our pharmacy business around the world and they've got new expansion opportunities and emerging channels in the world. And last, I'd say geographically, obviously strengthen in Europe, but more importantly emerging strength in Asia, and particularly China.","So those are the reasons, we like Skin Care. We\u2019re going to be continued to answer your question to be very judicious and thoughtful about M&A. We feel we got really good one here and it's going to round out the Skin Care portfolio quite nicely.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you. Good morning.","Noel Wallace","Good morning.","Andrea Teixeira","Good morning. So can you please elaborate a little bit more on the funding for growth. I think you came in well in the gross margin level. And usually it's back loaded in the balance of the year. So my question is, if we should be seeing that probably slightly ahead of expectation and that funding bit of your overhead expenses on that one if you can tell us, I think its part of your SG&A came in a little stronger, because you're investing in these emerging channels that you just described for Skin Care? r is there anything that may have been heavier in the quarter?","And if we have time - if I can just squeeze in China if you could update us on the changes there and the distribution that'll be great? Thank you.","Noel Wallace","Thanks, Andrea. So let me quickly go through the margin forward which I think you heard John take you through. But in summary, we\u2019re obviously pleased with the pricing that we generate in the quarter up one point and funding the growth as you mentioned a little bit outpacing where we where at this time last year. And I think that's a result of more sharpened focused on the cost lines, specifically moving to the first half of this year.","And that bodes well obviously for the back of this year, particularly as we see hopefully lower transaction costs are coming through the P&L given we\u2019re lapping some of the significant deval that we had in the second half of last year, material prices were up about 300 basis points, so those are obviously offset with the strong pricing and a strong funding growth that we had.","So the outlook for the balance as John mentioned that, we expect to see our gross margin is up and we'll continue to be very sharply focused on funding the growth. And I think the efforts that we have around revenue growth management and premiumization of our bundles, particularly around the core bode well for the back of the year.","On the SG&A line, the biggest impact on SG&A in the quarter were result of the following: higher logistics cost, which we've seen as you know creeping into the P&L over the last six to nine months, a swinging compensation this year versus last year, where obviously the results were weaker in the quarter, and last year we had some one-time benefits that we're now lapping through the P&L.","Looking ahead, we obviously do not feel we got an issue of cost at SG&A line. We're very focused on maximizing the GGEP programs through the last six months of the year. More importantly, setting up some of the significant changes we've made around the company both structurally and operationally to ensure that they continues to yield savings for us as we move into 2020.","The other element of that is looking at what we're going to do with S\/4HANA, as I mentioned upfront significant structural change for us over the next 18 months, where we anticipate that will generate significant savings for us as we look to standardize, processes and systems around the world and find ways to drive more agility to the systems.","So, all in all, we think we're in a good place. The growth in SG&A was more one time. We think, we feel we got good control of that moving forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Hey, great. Thanks. Good morning all. So, as John highlighted, you've been hard at regaining traction in Asia and China specifically over the past several quarters. And it sounds like, you still feel optimistic about those efforts beginning to take greater hold in the second half.","But can you maybe help frame your expectations for us in a bit more detail, just in terms of what success would look like over the balance of the year in that region for you? Thanks.","Noel Wallace","Sure. It\u2019s progress specifically. Obviously, we've seen progress sequentially in the quarter from first or second. Asia came in slightly ahead of plan, but not enough to change the outlook that we have guided for the back of the year. Importantly, on Asia, all hubs were up very nicely in the quarter outside of China. And China was sequentially up in the quarter.","And so, as we've guided before, we anticipated that we'll continue to see that improvement through the back half of this year. And that's the plan that we're executing as we speak.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, I'm probably just trying to understand whether you think you're hitting the right balance investments versus topline and bottom line delivery. You guys see it much more granularity, but kind of from the outside -- certainly looks like SG&A expenses were up 195 basis points you just said that short term. We could tell A&P was only up about 40 basis points on a percent of sales year-on-year which is below what we had thought and certainly below we thought for the year.","And then meanwhile, you mentioned the global toothpaste share was down 40 basis points year-on-year, manual toothpaste share was down 40 basis points year-on-year become to continues to loose share in North America, I guess the U.S.; Mexico; Brazil; Russia; India; China. And to be clear, this is not tracked or untracked out of. This is just by our numbers in the release.","And then, you're getting to the EPS by better taxes, lowering the increase in A&P for the year and now seeing you're in a curtailed buybacks by 10% for these acquisitions in Skin care.","So it's - you put this mosaic together and I guess I'm struggling to see the clear vector that suggests that you're getting the right balance in terms of investment for the long term. So, or do you need to make more dramatic actions on cost savings or spend back or something else.","So, I'm just trying to get a sense of which of those mosaic pieces I should overemphasize versus are underemphasize to feel comfortable that the balance in investments is the right one? Thank you.","Noel Wallace","Thanks, Ali. So let's start with the story that we've been communicating externally which is that is to get an acceleration of topline growth back into the P&L. And the investment strategy to do that as you've seen, we've accelerated our investments and to be sure that acceleration is paid off in the first quarter and then acceleration in the second quarter.","And specifically in the second quarter you've see an acceleration across all of our categories relative to that investment. You've seen acceleration across all of our geographies ex-Asia with that investment.","So we're pleased by frankly with the focus that we put in a story that we\u2019re building throughout the organization, which is to accelerate top line growth through an accelerated Investment Strategy, you're certainly seeing that payoff.","We haven't seen the shares move, as you mentioned we started to see some of the accelerate as we move through the back half of the quarter. The total which is received a decent amount investment in the first half and will continue to receive investment through the balance of the year.","Our shares are up globally on that basis. And remember a big part of that was ensuring the investment help us generate the price increase that we executed behind that relaunch, which is on average we are seeing about 10% come through on total globally.","So the Investment Strategy to ensure that they had a successful launch we think is playing out. And as you heard from John, likewise on Science Diet where we've accelerated investment we've seen growth across all areas of the P&L and all areas of the business.","So again, from an investment standpoint, the story was more investment to generate top line growth and we\u2019re seeing that we take on a balance basis throughout the world.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for sorting me in. We\u2019ve obviously covered a reasonable ground already. I guess, I'd like drill in a bit deeper on Latin America. As already referenced in money to your market share by country Brazil and Mexico are two areas are excluded from your market share growth figures, yet Latin America has been sort of held up as the area where you reach to your innovation process. It's got perhaps the fastest speed to market a lot going on, you've been expanded channels.","Can you update us on the progress of that? And how\u2019s it maybe sequentially market share maybe building in these markets? And also still sticking Latin America, sorry really is a still long winded, this is also the area where going to your segment bridges you're seeing more sequential increase in overhead expenses and the increases is pricing in context of the FX pressure there. Can you give us a little more color on where that money is going in that market? Thank you.","Noel Wallace","Okay. A lot there. So let me step back on Latin America. Again, the focus strategy around core adjacencies and segments we think is really playing out in the quarter. And again, sequentially up on the first quarter, they've now seen two strong quarters of growth and very balanced growth at that relative to pricing and volume.","Good pricing coming through in the quarter as well, which is obviously driven by some changes that we made on Colgate Total, as well as our reacting to some of the inflationary pressures that we saw coming through the P&L in the back half of 2018.","Looking specifically at Mexico and Brazil, I think we're quite pleased and what we're seeing there. On Brazil, obviously, the categories look okay, slightly down in the second quarter, but on the half still up versus where we were last year.","We've seen some promotional pricing on the lower end of the franchise particularly around the Sorriso brand, which we talked about in the first quarter. That continued in the second quarter obviously a bigger dip in February on shares, but starting to see that slowly come back.","But more pleasingly was the launch of Colgate Total in both those markets has done very, very well, just getting out of the gates about a month and half of real clear readings on it in Brazil the share is up about 0.5 points on Colgate Total to at least from what I'm seeing a record high share for quite some time at $17.5. And likewise in Mexico, we're up over a point on Colgate Total, where overall shares are flat.","So I think the strategy that we're putting in place particularly on Oral Care and driving the core paying off, as I mentioned I think previously, they are pushing aggressively into new channel expansion in pharmacy with the launch of elmex that is driving incremental share in pharmacy as we speak.","And we're happy to see what elmex is doing and continues to grow month end and month out. And the launching into some new adjacencies as well across the division which is doing well. What I was particularly excited about in the quarter was every single operating hub group across Latin America. We haven't see that for quite some time at least consistently.","So again, I think the strategies there that we're deploying around the core adjacencies and segments are playing well. Good pricing in the second quarter, which will play out obviously with our Investment Strategy in the back half. And we're seeing more and more investment go in.","Coming back to certain extent to Ali's question, as we see Latin America accelerate, our Latin America has a lower advertising to sales given some of the cost of media in those businesses and that obviously moved its way through the overall company P&L. But again good plants in the back half with accelerated investment in that region.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks so much.","Noel Wallace","Hi, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","I wanted first to just follow-up on Brazil. I was actually focused a little bit more on volume just to comparisons, because I know that last year we had the Brazil trucking strike notwithstanding efforts is that a market share question.","But I was just curious about volume trajectory in Brazil. If there was any impact there from some of the pricing you've taken in terms of the slower build back on volumes specifically? And then I do have a second bigger-picture question. Thanks.","Noel Wallace","Okay. Sure. So yes, we did take pretty significant pricing in the quarter. And I'll remind everyone that the cadence volume and pricing that we had last year as you may recall most of the truckers strike out the impact of that hit us in the third quarter. So the comparisons get much easier for us going forward. We didn't have - while we did have a small hit in the second quarter last year, it wasn't to the extent that we saw it in the third quarter, which is where most of the impact came through the P&L.","In this quarter, our volume was slightly down, but pricing was strong. And largely driven by some of the price changes that we made based on some of the inflationary pressures that we faced in the back half of the year.","Categories continue to be okay as I mentioned earlier and we got a strong innovation pipeline in the balance of the year and investment to support that. So we feel we are in a good position to see continued acceleration, particularly given the comparisons get easier in the year to go.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Bonnie Herzog","Hi, thank you. Good morning. Actually, I wanted to circle back to some of your comments on your top line. I guess, I'm trying to understand your ability to sustain the improvements you've seen, especially as you head into next year and you have to let the innovation of the re-launches that you put into the market. And I know you're not going to give guidance for 2020, but could you touch on your ability to lap the innovation from this year?","And then, maybe how full year innovation pipeline is for next year? Also as we think about your spending levels that did increase things continue to improve will you continue to reinvest in your business a long-term or should we start to see some of these potential upside sort of the bottom line? Thanks.","Noel Wallace","Thanks. Specifically on the topline next year is no different than any year in the sense of that we continue to be focused on ensuring that we have won the right level of innovation to continue to drive incremental value in the market that we're focused on driving category value which is extremely important.","You heard John talk a little bit about the success we're having behind revenue growth management and the discipline that we're deploying across the world to ensure that teams are thinking very differently about how to drive value back into the category which ultimately drives better topline growth for us and our trade customers.","And then likewise as we look at some of the adjacencies geographic expansion opportunities we have each year being very deliberate about how we go after those. And so next year we'll be looking at some category expansion opportunities into new markets, we'll be looking into new agencies, and we'll be looking to support new core businesses as we mentioned which is going to be important part of our growth strategy moving forward to ensure every 12 to 18 months, we have a significant core business that we're putting investment behind to ensure that the incremental innovation we're getting behind adjacencies and channel expansion indeed comes on top.","In terms of getting gross margins up and our focus there, I think we're starting - we're really happy with the fact that we've seen gross margin acceleration this quarter. That is the function I think of again sharpened focus on finding the growth, but more importantly, the pricing that we have taken on the revenue growth management aspects that are coming more a day in and day out in terms of how we manage the business.","As we look at the back half as we see more benign inflation environment, particularly around foreign exchange, we expect that to continue to bode well for the gross margin line which will all of the investment that we need in the business to continue to accelerate that topline growth on a sustainable basis.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, thanks very much. A couple of things. First of all can you disclose how much the distribution expansion for Elta and PCA contributed to your organic sales growth? Second quick thing just in terms of the comments you made, Noel, about how the channel market share data hasn't looked as good as you expected to, but actually the North American shipments looks pretty good this quarter.","So, my question is do you have sense or is there any there could be excess inventory in the trade? In other North American growth have to slow as the market share is kind of catch up with your shipments?","And then my last question is with Justin having left the company as you kind of look at the management structure as you settle as new CEO, do you think is there going to be a new Chief Growth Officer? Are there other changes in sort of the management structure contemplated or is this just a typical Colgate succession planning all that kind of good step rolling through? Thanks.","Noel Wallace","Great, Wendy. Thanks. Let me go one by one. Specifically, we don't disclose and break out obviously PCA and Elta within the context of the U.S. I'd say the growth was balanced. We had growth across all of our core segments in the quarter in the U.S. specifically Oral Care, Personal Care, and Home Care, as well as on the Hill's business as John mentioned, and obviously PCA and Elta continue to have a good quarter in that regard.","Relative to the management structure question, obviously, as you well know as well as anyone we have a deep bench of tremendous leaders across the organization. With Justin's departure, we\u2019re looking to obviously continue to develop our organization for people in new roles and responsibilities and we're in the process of making that happen.","We've made some recent changes, which I'm really excited about, which elevated the responsibility of [indiscernible] specifically and move some new people into new roles across the organization and all that I think bodes well for practically the strategy that we're trying to execute moving forward. So in that case all good moves and very qualified bench of people to choose from in that regard.","Relative to your question on inventories, I know that came up last time as well, I think from Ali, there is no inventory issues in the U. S. And we've had nice growth and untrack channels as you know particularly around the toothpaste business, Colgate Total way over in indexes and club, had a good quarter on club, having a good growth in some of other track channels e-commerce specifically.","We saw significant share growth on the toothpaste business in the quarter, so all that obviously rolling up to a stronger organic delivery in the quarter for the North American business.","Operator","Our next question will come from Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Strycula","Hi, good morning. My question is after three recent acquisitions, it appears that you're slowly stitching together a global premium skincare business with the clinical focus. So how do we think about the leadership and integration strategy of these businesses and one is in primarily France and China versus other assets in the U.S. How it is being integrated? What\u2019s the leadership structure?","And then if you could give us any more texture separately on the oral care business in China, you mentioned some improvement sequentially. But where are we in terms of milestones and repairing that business, maybe some qualitative talking points? Thank you.","Noel Wallace","Sure. So listen as we have learned in many of the successful acquisitions that we\u2019ve made and we've been very prudent in approaching these acquisitions in this way and that is to ensure that we respect and admire the independence of these organizations. And from that perspective we will continue to run independently as we learn the business and more importantly understand how we can leverage some of the best practices across our entire skin care portfolio.","So today Elta, PCA and Filorga are run independently, but that being we have a team of people here in New York as we\u2019ve done through our other categories, ensuring that we are looking holistically at the business, leveraging the synergies that we see across the three different businesses. And more importantly from a growth opportunity ensuring that we\u2019re sharing best practices across the three businesses to sustain accelerated growth moving forward.","And as we go through the due diligence of each of those acquisitions, we very much put that in the back of our mind, how are these going to help the other businesses that we have. Not only on the skin care side, but obviously on the Colgate portfolio side as well in terms of transferring best practices.","And that's something historically and culturally that we've done really well across the company. And that is to share the learning. And there's a tremendous sense of humility when we go in and make an acquisition to respect the depth of the management team what they've accomplished and to ensure that we listen and learn, but provide the scale and the efficiencies to them, so they can continue to drive top line growth.","On the China question, it is moving exactly as anticipated. It is slightly ahead of schedule relative to some of the pickup that was on the quarter, but a lot of work to do. And we\u2019ll continue to see momentum build in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter this year based on the plans that we're executing as we speak.","Operator","Our next question will come from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Javier Escalante","Back to China again. So basically this improvement if you can basically split it between acceptance of the price increases as you took last year versus if is it elmex that is gaining traction online or is it that the destocking that is [indiscernible] And I have a more longer-term question after that. ","Noel Wallace","Thanks Javier. It's all of the above. Obviously as the go-to-market shifts happen so dramatically across specifically China over the last nine months, we needed to rebalance the inventory in the market and that is well underway and we've seen improvements in that respect. The elmex launch continues to do well and -- as it widen its distribution both across different e-commerce platforms and a rollout in Watson as well.","So all in all, it's all those elements, the pricing likewise holding particularly on the 360 franchise that we took in the back half of last year, but it's all really trying to get the portfolio right the go to market strategies changes, right, the distributors strategies implemented as well. And all that is on schedule as I mentioned.","Operator","Our next question will come from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks, good morning. Noel two-part question, if I can. First one just gauging the success of the Colgate Total rollout in the U. S.. Some of the Neilson data we see, suggest the brand is down about 0.5 point. I think the hope was to take some share from Sensodyne. Sensodyne seems like the market share trends are accelerating there. Maybe talk a little bit about of your gauging success so far with the product rollout to date?","And then I hope, I can throw another one here. John spoke to the company superior results in the online channel where you're gaining share. And of course we've seen skin channels with the company is probably not where it hopes to be at this point from a market share perspective and bleeding little bit of share in Oral Care. Why do think that is? And maybe you can speak tactically what you need to do to address that? Thanks for those.","Noel Wallace","Sure. So again on Colgate Total, if you look globally where we are right now, the share is up, close to 0.5 point on the business. And that obviously considers the fact that we're down about 20 basis points in the U.S. which is on a weighted basis weighs very heavily into that 0.5 points growth that we have globally. So we're very pleased with where we are.","Specifically on the U.S. recognized that we took a 16% downsizing on that product. So we're looking for the purchase - the recycle - excuse me, the purchase frequency of the brand to accelerate share moving forward. You're not going to get the price acquisition immediately moving through the consumption and therefore the share that will over time accelerate as we get the frequency of repurchased to accelerate.","So all in all, we\u2019re pleased with where we are particularly pleased with the fact that we generated about a 10% increase globally on that business which is one of the more significant increases that we've seen on that franchise and over a decade.","And that bodes well, given that we have a sustainable spending on that business in the back of and we continue to rollout and some of our bigger baskets, particularly Latin America we just got under way towards the back end of the quarter.","So all in all we are pleased. Not pleased with the track channels and despite the fact that we are growing in un-track channels really well, we need to get track channels growing again.","So a lot of coupon activity in the first half of the year. We saw some share erosion on the base business in the first quarter which we're obviously trying to play a little bit of catch-up, but we're not going to chase some of this coupon driven activity that we're seeing.","We want to ensure that we continue to move the franchise towards the premium end both on Colgate, Total with the launch of the Naturals and with the launch of some of the Whitening SKUs that we're putting into the market which will hopefully drive more incrementality moving forward. So more work to be done to be sure, but pleased over where we are with total re-launch.","Operator","And our next question will come from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Bill Chappell","Good morning. Thanks. Hey, Noel just kind of big picture on emerging markets it certainly sounds more optimistic about kind of how things are trending. And I guess, the question is we saw the similar type optimism 18, 24 months ago, and then it went south for not just you but for everyone.","I mean, is there a way to kind of talk about how this time is different? Or if it's not different so far are you just kind of cautiously optimistic in kind of what you see on the horizon?","Noel Wallace","Sure, Bill. So I'll let me - again we talked about Asia quite extensively, so I won't get into more specifics, obviously a good growth outside of China and the plans in place to see China continue to make progress in the back half of the year. I haven't talked a lot about Africa as you remembered that was a real headwind for us over the last couple of years, a completely focused on the fundamentals in those markets and some terrific execution by the team on the ground.","We've seen a real acceleration in that business moving forward pleasingly Russia doing quite well Eurasia, Turkey likewise doing quite well where we achieved market leadership very recently in the toothpaste category in that market. So again Africa we think doing quite well and the fundamentals will bode well moving forward.","Latin America, largely driven by some of the economic and political changes that we saw over the last 18 months and we'll be cautious on Latin America moving forward. So particularly in Brazil and Mexico, where you've seen political change, and new leaders in their first year of their administration we'll see how that unfolds. There's always uncertainty associated with that. But the categories was slightly down in the second quarter on the first half as I mentioned earlier up versus where they were last year.","But the fundamentals I think we have in Latin America around again the core, the adjacencies and the channel work that we are doing we think will continue to bode well through the back half of this year and the comparisons particularly Latin America \u2013 America favor us as we look to the back half.","Bill Chappell","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Nik Modi","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So just two little quick ones.","Noel Wallace","Hey, Nik.","Nik Modi"," Noel, maybe you can - hey, how are you? Good morning. Maybe you can just talk about your definition of skin health? And I'm just curious, if your definition longer term would extend outside of Queens [ph]? So that's the first question.","And on the second question is really on FX. I mean, obviously its created tons of havoc over the years for all multinational companies. Coca-Cola provided some thoughts about how they expected to be a benign year in 2020 and I was hoping maybe you have some thoughts from your treasury group on have you guys are thinking about FX as you think about the next 12 months?","Noel Wallace","Sure. Let me take that FX question first. Obviously, we saw an acceleration of FX in the back half particularly Latin America and Eurasia.","And we're expecting a slightly more benign environment obviously given those comparisons, but we can't be certain. There's obviously a lot of political instability and lot of rhetoric going on around the world.","So I would hate to sit here and tried to predict exactly where FX is going to go. I'll remain cautious but we think it will be certainly better than what we experienced in the back half of last year. Specifically, as it relates to skin health, it's a big category. Obviously, there's a lot of different spaces to it. We like Elta and the sun care business. It's got a great skin cleansing business which is close into what we understand.","PCA is uniquely positioned in the categories in which they compete. We like those. And the recent acquisition of Filorga obviously on the antiaging, we like that space a lot specifically one because of the economics of the space and the premium nature of it, but more importantly, as you look at the aging consumer everywhere in the world that will continue to be an expanding category for skin health.","So, while we're being selective on where we go in. We want to ensure that we have great brands with great go-to-market and great management teams and that's kind of how we've looked at skin health, but obviously, the three are we believe are well-positioned where they compete and complement each other the longer term really well.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thanks. I wanted to talk about the U.S. You alluded to a couple of efforts to improve performance in track channels, so little bit more detail there on how these initiatives help specifically in track channels?","But also you continued to do significantly better in non-track, so is there any reason to expect that that relationship will change as you put more focus on track channels, presumably you're not driving growth in track by shifting between the two?","And then just one quick thing on SG&A. Obviously, higher comp logistics you talked about, but some of it, it sounds like restoring sort of more normalized levels of comp, but is there anything in terms of like the investments that you're making hiring more people building out capabilities and systems and things like that? Thanks.","Noel Wallace","Okay. So, let me try to address the first question there which is on track channels and untrack channels and how we think about that. First, we take a step back and ensure that as I mentioned upfront that we're really understanding the changes in the omnichannel environment and those changes happen very quickly relative to where the growth is coming from and how consumers are shopping.","So, we\u2019ve invested a lot more time and effort to ensure that we have a much sharper strategies around our go-to-market for ensure that we are putting resources, spending, and innovation against of the standards that we think are going to continue to accelerate.","Particularly as it relates to the U.S., obviously, great growth in the first half of the year on e-commerce, our share up about 140 basis points, split between both Colgate and Palms and that's a function of one understanding the route-to-market and the route-to-purchase from consumer and getting innovation and the execution right in that channel.","We talked about pharmacy channel around the world being one of the faster-growing channels that we see globally and we put plans in place to execute that both from a resource standpoint.","And what I mean specifically by that is how we allocate our sales organization to growing opportunities and likewise from an innovation standpoint and from a portfolio standpoint where we've launched elmex, particularly in the very select geographies where the pharmacy channel is outpacing the market and where we're under-indexed in terms of share.","So again, Olivia, we look at it very holistically and our channel strategies are allocated based on where we see the best growth opportunities. And when I talked a little bit upfront about how we're thinking about growth differently and how we are driving growth differently, it's ensuring that we're looking at each of those channels very exclusively in terms of our go to market, specifically as it relates to the innovation required to be successful. And we're starting to see that play off as we see the acceleration, particularly in non-track channels moving forward.","On the SG&A, I think you hit it all already, but the last point you made is an interesting one in the sense of as we look at allocating resources and driving productivity across the organization, it really is ensuring that we are putting people in places that want to go to drive more accelerated growth for the company.","So let's take their of digital and analytics and predictive analytics and making sure that we are putting resources in those areas because, we believe that will bode well and drive more sustainable growth and efficiency across the P&L moving forward.","So, it's a shifting of resources in that line. The SG&A acceleration you saw in the quarter was not a result of adding more people, it was a result of the specific areas that I articulated earlier.","Operator","And our final question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Mark Astrachan","Thanks and good morning everybody.","Noel Wallace","Hi Mark.","Mark Astrachan","Two questions. One on Filorga. If you can just comment on what the growth rates have looked like trailing 12 months may be expectations on a go-forward basis. And on Pet Nutrition, so a large competitor reported similarly strong topline results this morning. I guess it seems like category growth rates not to take anything away from your performance have accelerated.","So I guess I'm curious, what you think is driving the acceleration? How much is it priced versus underling category demand and what do you think a reasonable long-term growth rate would be from a category perspective?","Noel Wallace","Thanks, Mark. So back on Filorga, obviously, all I can disclose at this point, the acquisition hasn't closed is that we're very attracted by not only the growth rates of the category itself, but the growth rates of Filorga and the potential for continued growth in geographic expansion moving forward. And will disclose more information as we bring that under the Colgate family.","Specifically, as it relates to the premiumization and the dog food category and the pet food category, I mean good growth we've seen a bit more stability in pet retail especially among PetSmart and PETCO, but still somewhat challenged that continued acceleration of e-commerce where we\u2019re seeing nice growth in that business.","And I think importantly, as we are seeing share growth around -- in the U.S. around the signs diet relaunch, which again included obviously significant packaging changes, significant reformulations, new campaigns and accelerated investment which will all intended to help support and drive trial, but more importantly justify the price increase that we took on the business which we had done in quite some time.","So, all in all, we think the plans we have in place on hills. The fact that we've expanded distribution into some new channels and we got a terrific piece of advertising working for the business will bode well as we look to expand the Science Diet relaunch internationally in the back half.","Operator","And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to John Faucher for any additional or closing remarks.","John Faucher","So let me quickly close, as always, let me thank the entire Colgate family of people out there that have done such a terrific job again delivering sequential growth in the quarter. I remind everyone we\u2019re in the third quarter, get back to work. And thanks everyone, have a great weekend.","Operator","Again ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"6141":["Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 25, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Bina H.

Today's call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgate.com. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Bina H. Thompson","Thanks, Brian. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, and these statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements. For information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement on Forward-looking Statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We will discuss organic sales growth, excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. We will also discuss gross profit, gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, excluding the impact of the one-time items described in the press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","So we're very pleased with the continued strong momentum in our business in the third quarter. Good organic sales growth coupled with an excellent increase in gross margin have allowed us to increase investments behind our business as well as to grow our bottom line. Market shares are strong around the world. On a year-to-date basis we're up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, bar soaps, body wash, deodorants and fabric conditioner. Our pipeline of new products is as full as it has ever been, which bodes well for continued share gains.","Our balance sheet is solid, and cash generation is strong. We continue to successfully implement the strategies with which you are all familiar, engaging to build our brands, innovation for growth, effectiveness and efficiency and leading to win. And we believe our tight focus on a limited number of categories continues to be the right approach for Colgate. This has allowed us to deliver consistent results.","Now while our strategies have not changed, the external environment is increasingly changing and at a fast pace.  To help ensure continued strong results, today we announced a 4-year global growth and efficiency program. And this is truly a global program affecting all areas of the business, which is expected to help us deliver sustained profitable growth over the long-term.","We believe that these changes will help ensure the long-term success of our business in today's fast changing global marketplace. We've chosen to undertake them at a time when the business is strong to leverage our growth momentum so we continue to deliver on both our near and long-term targets, while increasing investment to strengthen our market-leading positions and commercial capabilities on the ground.","As a reminder, our key areas of focus are not new to us but rather a continuation of what we've done successfully in the past. The global growth and efficiency program represents a truly global effort to expand upon successful initiatives previously implemented in select regions, focusing on the areas of commercial hubs, shared services and global supply chain and facilities optimization.","Reflecting on 2012, when we initially gave constant dollar guidance, we were experiencing and projecting extremely volatile foreign exchange markets. That has proven to be the case throughout 2012 in all regions of the world. By managing the business on a constant currency basis, we ensured that commercial funds stayed invested in the local businesses. So as we look ahead, we see the exchange market as being somewhat less volatile and more in line with historic patterns. So while our global budget process is still in the initial stages, as Ian said in the press release, we expect to return to double-digit earnings per share growth on a dollar basis in 2013 in the 10% to 11% range. Our target for organic sales growth for 2013 remains 6% to 7%, and we expect to see increases both in gross profit and advertising.","So let me now briefly share some third quarter highlights in the division, starting with North America. We're particularly pleased with our North American results. Despite a deceleration in category growth throughout the year, we achieved positive volume and pricing in the third quarter. The volume growth was also notable as compared to the strong year-ago quarter, in which we launched Colgate Optic White toothpaste. As referenced in the press release, our oral care shares are strong. The launch of Colgate Optic White enamel toothpaste in the U.S. has helped to increase the share of the Colgate Optic White franchise with a share of over 6% in the most recent period. And we told you last quarter about the launch of Colgate Optic White mouthwash, which complements the toothpaste and toothbrush and offers a full whitening regimen. The launch is doing well, and the mouthwash has over 2% share.","Increased investment behind our Colgate Total franchise, along with a very successful Seeing is Believing marketing campaign, also contributed to our success. And we have some very exciting new products along with some new marketing campaign slated for the first quarter, which you will hear about at a later date.","So let's turn to Latin America. Very good market share progress drove our strong results in Latin America. Year-to-date, market shares are up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, bar soaps, fabric conditioners, dishwashing liquid and liquid cleaners. As referenced in the press release, we reached another record share in toothpaste at 79.3%, up 120 basis points from a year ago. Now this increase was achieved in spite of competitive launches in a number of countries. Colgate Luminous White toothpaste, which was launched a year ago in Mexico and Brazil, is now selling across the division and accounts for almost 4 points of our overall toothpaste share.","Our leading toothbrush share is at 42.5% year-to-date, up almost 2 full points from the year-ago period. And as in other developing markets, we have product offerings at all price points, and both our premium-priced and mid-tier brushes are contributing to the share gain. In mouthwash, our market share is up 4 points to 37% on a year-to-date basis, and we've achieved leadership in Argentina, Venezuela, Central America, Paraguay and Uruguay. In bar soaps, we've consolidated our leadership position up over 2 points to 32%. Protex is the leading brand, and the launch of Protex's Vitamin E as well as a strong hand washing campaign has contributed to its success. Palmolive is the #2 brand across the region, also benefiting from innovation.","Turning then to Europe. As you know, the macroeconomic situation in Europe is quite challenging. Category growth is slowing, and consumer confidence levels are low. But despite that, our oral care shares are solid. In toothpaste, our year-to-date market share is even with the year-ago period, and our shares are up in manual toothbrushes and mouthwash. So even in this tough environment, we've successfully launched new products. We found that the consumer is willing to pay a premium for a clear benefit such as whitening or gum health. Across the region in September, we relaunched our Colgate Max White One Whitening toothpaste along with an accompanying toothbrush and mouthwash to provide a full whitening regimen. The distinctive red packaging, the same as for Optic White here in the U.S., really does stand out on shelves. Persuasive in-store presence is a critical component of an integrated marketing campaign, particularly in a more developed market, and early results for this bundle are very encouraging.","Now we're also very excited about our launch into a completely new category, electrically chargeable toothbrushes. Our lead market is the U.K. The product was introduced in early October at the British Dental Trade Association Conference, the largest U.K. trade event with over 10,000 delegates attending, and the reactions were very positive. As you know, professional recommendations play a very important role in this category. And in addition, we introduced the product at Booths, the first-ever platinum launch for Colgate. 50% of the category sales are through this one retailer. Advertising is now on air, and although we don't have scanner data until next month, the initial reception has been excellent.","Greater Asia\/Africa. As in other divisions, successful new product launches have helped increase market shares. Across Asia, our toothpaste share is up 40 basis points on a year-to-date basis. In India, both premium and mid-tier offerings have driven our share up 250 basis points to over 53% of the market. The share gains are across the country in both urban and rural markets. And in China, our share continues to grow. We're up 140 basis points to 33.7%. We continue to grow our mouthwash business across the region. Year-to-date, our market share is up almost 3 full points to 19.3% with increases in almost every country. Both Colgate Plax Fresh Tea and Colgate Plax Fruity Fresh have contributed to the share gains, along with the Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief mouthwash to accompany our Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief toothpaste in the developed markets of Hong Kong and Singapore.","And Hill's. While Hill's volume declined in the quarter, positive pricing allowed for another quarter of organic sales growth. A number of initiatives faced through [ph] the end of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 should benefit the business. On the Science Diet side of the business, we'll be relaunching the Science Diet line at the beginning of December. The new Science Diet Dry Offerings will contain natural ingredients with meat or high-quality protein as the first ingredient, and no chicken byproduct or artificial colors or flavors. New packaging design will make it easier for the pet owner to find the right product. In fact, our studies show it reduces the time it takes by about 30%. There will be 3 new shopping categories that should reduce shelf clutter: Life Style, Life Stage and Life Care. Ideal Balance, which provides natural ingredients in perfect balance and contains no corn, continues building momentum with third quarter 2012 volume in the U.S. up 19% over the second quarter of 2012. A very exciting new Prescription Diet product is Prescription Diet metabolic. And this is the first weight management food with proven and real-world results. 88% of dogs and cats lost weight in 2 months at home, and it's also clinically proven to avoid weight regain following a weightless -- loss program. It comes in Dry, Wet and Treats for dogs as well as cats. This product will start shipping in the first quarter of next year starting with the North American market and Japan.","So in summary, we're pleased with the continued momentum in our business and look forward to a strong finish for the year. And as you heard, Colgate people around the world are winning on the ground, delivering strong results and increased market shares. And our new global growth and efficiency programs for sustained growth announced today should help us to continue to deliver strong results in 2013 and beyond. That's the end of my prepared remarks.","Brian, now, if we can open it up for questions, that would be terrific.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Hey, did you say how much of the restructuring program is going to be reinvested versus how much you think will flow down to the bottom line?","Ian M. Cook","No, we didn\u2019t, Bill. And at this stage -- first, let me take a step back on the whole program because this has been the output of well over a year's study. As I think you have seen from the release and Bina's comments, we've taken a view here that is strategic for the long term, while benefiting starting in 2013 to build the kind of structure and skills we think we will need to compete effectively in this fast-changing world over the next 5 to 10 years. And important to say that we're really expanding structures and capabilities that we know very well how to handle; hubbing that we have been doing in various parts of the world for over 15 years. Our shared service center pioneered in Europe at about 5 years. And of course, in terms of manufacturing and sourcing, we started the year -- the millennium with something like 85 factories and have worked that down over time. And I think as you saw with the 2004, 2008 program, we have the focus and ability to get these programs executed without impacting the continued flow of the business. Now as to how we will use the funds generated by the program, if you take the near-end view, what we're really saying in 2013 is that we intend to continue the pace of organic top line growth in a world that has more slowness to it than not at the 6% to 7% range and expect to return to double-digit EPS on a dollar basis. How we allocate the second half benefits we'll get next year will depend by geography and by program, and that will be the same view we will use in the out years. But if you look at 2013, the commitment is really to the double-digit earnings per share growth on a dollar basis while maintaining that 6% to 7% organic top line growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nik Modi with UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you just give us any perspective \u2013 Bina addressed the kind of Western European environment being sluggish, but can you talk about the other market, especially Latin America, kind of what you're seeing from a market growth standpoint? And then just a quick follow-up question on minor housekeeping. Venezuela, do you believe you can still deliver the dollar kind of 10%-plus even if we get a deval in Venezuela next year?","Ian M. Cook","So let me take them in the order you asked them, Nik. If you look at our world and by our world, I mean our categories by geography, as we have said before, in Europe we see low-single digit category growth, very low, in the 1% to 2% range, closer to 1% than 2%; and in some cases, negative. In North America, we see category growth rates in that 1% to 2% range. And in the emerging markets, we continue to see category growth rates at high-single digits, that would be the 8% to -- the 8% to 9% growth rates. And we continue to see that right through the latest periods of data available to us. And having just come back from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar, I would say in these high growth geographies, consumer optimism is still high. So you see it in the numbers, and you feel it on the ground when you're interacting with consumers. Venezuela, obviously, there is a lot of speculation about Venezuela. Clearly, there would be 2 components to any devaluation were it to occur. One would be the one-time impact on that monetary assets, which would be a one-time event as it was before. And then to answer the heart of your question, it's really going to come down to the ability to take pricing in the country or not, and I think it would be highly speculative to say what that position might be at the time. Hopefully, the governmental view in terms of making product available to consumers would be to allow pricing to facilitate bringing raw materials. And remember, we make 85% of what we sell in the country, providing employment with bringing raw materials into the country. If we see a devaluation with no ability to take pricing, that is going to be painful for everybody operating in the country and would weigh on our ability to deliver the double-digit dollar EPS growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ian, on -- the Hill's business top line performance continued to be disappointing and that seems in contrast to some of the hope you would have that the new products would reinvigorate the business and help with the market share issues in the Naturals segment. So I just want to get an update there. And also, can you give us some detail in the Ideal Balance launch in terms of its incrementality and repeat rates and some perspective on potential growth for the division in 2013?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. The -- it's a tale of 2 cities. Ideal Balance is doing well, as Bina said. Trial rates are high and repeat rates are high, and we know we're bringing in about half of the new users from other Naturals products, but it's not big enough to shift the entire business. So as we have said before, the second half what we need to do and will do at the end of this year, as Bina said, is to reformulate and repackage from a design point of view our base Science Diet line to contain ingredients that natural users want and shout out those ingredients on our package. And so while we expect to continue to see organic growth this year, I think as we have said before, we expect to return to positive volume growth in 2013 behind the continued growth of Ideal Balance and more importantly, from an overall business point of view, that upgrade of the entire Science Diet line.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Sarah Miller","This is Sarah Miller filling in for Bill this morning. My question is on -- it seems like there's kind of been cost initiatives and some smaller restructuring programs over time, but this program seems like it's kind of a little bit different, and I'm just wondering if there was a certain genesis behind the program, what could have brought it to light now and just the drivers behind that.","Ian M. Cook","But let's talk about the program. The other programs you\u2019re talking about were really opportunistic actions taken to lower our structural cost at a time when we got a one-time gain from divesting a small business. This program, which is a global growth and efficiency program, is obviously more strategic in nature and, as I said earlier, is the result of over a year's study, thinking about how we should best organize ourselves, how we should best invest behind growing the business for the next 5 to 10 years. So it's genesis, to use your word, with a strategic genesis and the content is really taking around the world structures and capabilities that we have had in place in some geographies for a long period of time have validated, know they work and know how to get them done. So this is moving our global structure to a place that we think will make us sustainably competitive for the next 5-plus years. That was the genesis.","Operator","And we'll go next to Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question is a follow-up on that. And if I look back over history, I thought you're -- kind of once was a day that Reuben really prided himself and a big point of what made Colgate so special was that programs like this were sort of considered part of doing business every day, and Colgate never used to take extraordinary charges and that was something that really distinguished the company. And I wonder if something has changed culturally because these are huge charges. And obviously, everybody cares about pro forma earnings and I get that. But still on a GAAP basis, your earnings will not have grown for an awfully long time given the magnitude of the charges. And so I guess number one -- maybe that's just a statement about how difficult the macro is. But number one, can you talk about that philosophy? Should we start to think of Colgate as a company that's going to take big charges every 5, 7 or 10 years, something like that? So it's a little bit of a different story. But second thing, when you talk about how difficult the external environment is, can you tell us is that 2\/3 of the macro and the consumer and the economic environment and 1\/3 of the competitive situation, or is it the opposite? I mean, what is making the macro more difficult so that you'd take such big charges now?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Well first of all, Wendy, I take exception to the point that we have not done these things in the past. We have a record of having taken significant restructuring activities not every 3 to 5 years, but usually in an 8- to 10-year cycle. And again, as we tried to say earlier, I mean, your question searches for an underlying problem that forces the action to be taken now, and we don't view it that way. We view it that the world is certainly fast changing and volatile. We view it that we want to prepare ourselves to continue to deliver that sustained growth both on the top line and the bottom line over time. And we believe we have enough validation and the capacity to get this done in a compressed period of time to make us better able to compete in the world for the longer term. So that was the thinking behind it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And I had to hop off for a second, so I hope we haven't addressed this already. But just looking at Latin America, certainly versus what I have expected, it was a little worse than I've been hoping for, particularly the top line, and appears -- there's been a market where you've been beating, I think, what everybody thought was possible on sales, both volume and pricing, and that seemed to slow. And I know you've pulled on great margin performance, but can you talk a little bit about the environment there and -- if there's anything that's changing, or is this slowdown relative to the very strong double-digit growth over the past 5 quarters? Is this a one-off?","Ian M. Cook","Well, the -- you got them.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I was looking at the organic growth rate.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, yes, as am I. The answer is, I guess, twofold. Number one, if you look at the year-on-year comparison, the first 2 quarters were up against lesser performance in 2011, and the third quarter comes up against mid-teen, double-digit growth rates in the back half of 2011. And we still think that in that context, 9% is good. You heard from Bina that the share performance is good. Clearly, Venezuela is a little bit of a drag as you would expect, but the other geographies are performing extremely well, and Venezuela is to plan. So I don't think there's anything untoward. We have fairly consistently said that we think high-single digit, low-double digit is the kind of level you should expect from that geography.","Operator","And we'll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just really quick. The path work that you've done on the shared service center in Europe and the hubbing of regions, I guess I was wondering if you could remind us how much of that in the past was funded through restructuring or one-time charges to get that in place, or if it was done just in the course of operations and over time?","Ian M. Cook","It varied. In the early days, we definitely ran it more through the income statement because we were moving quite slowly, giving ourselves the confidence that the hubs would give us what we thought they would give us, which is better capability to win on the ground at the same time with lower cost. Some we have run through prior restructurings. And in this case, now having it in geographies -- in most of our geographic regions, we're taking it in a charge because we think we can deploy it more quickly than the 15-plus years we have had hubbing in place.","Operator","And our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Sorry for going back to the restructuring and the savings data. First, I would like to understand whether -- and it's the same question, when is the confirmation whether the saving programs are going to be on top of beyond Funding the Growth or you're replacing it? And in the case that it's not replacing it, that is on top and beyond Funding the Growth, if you step back, you have -- this would be your third layer of savings. You have first, Funding the Growth, which is about $600 million. And then you have supply and demand synchronization, which is another $100 million. And then you're going to have another $45 million in savings because of this restructuring in 2013. So that is about $745 million in savings. This is over 4 points of margin expansion. And the question has to do -- can the organization -- can manage so much pressure to generate and take so much cost out of the system? Is -- kind of, I guess it has to do with the reaction to the timing of the restructuring and how ambitious all these 3 savings programs on their own merit are?","Ian M. Cook","Okay, Javier. Well actually, now that you've given me the introduction to the Funding the Growth, why don't I just do the customary walk-through on the gross profit margin, which would save that question being asked relative now to the third quarter, obviously the prior-year gross profit was 56.8%. We picked up a 1.1 point benefit from pricing, a 2.2 benefit from Funding the Growth savings, again, in line with the curve of last year. Material prices were a negative 1.8 points, and then there was minor pickup of 0.3 from other, which is the walk-through to the 180 points improvement. Now coming back to your broader strategic question, I guess you have to break these things into 3 different component elements. Funding the Growth is a program we have had in place in this company for many, many years. And whilst it is comprehensive, it -- by which I mean it doesn't just touch gross margin, a large part of it is gross margin, and that program will continue because it is part of the culture of the company, because it is part of our year-on-year savings program. Synchronizing the supply and demand, again, is really squeezing waste out of a process, which is eliminating redundancy and doesn't bring pressure to the business. The new program, again, is not predominantly a margin benefit. It, when you look at it with hubs, with shared services, with reduced facilities, is going to hit more in the SGA area. And that's what we have been talking about for quite a while, which is -- with the slowing growth in the world in general, lowering structural cost is an important part of how to organize the company. Again, it will require a changed management. I think we have demonstrated with the prior programs we have conducted that we have the focus to do it. And the content of the program, the hubs, the shared service centers and the facility and manufacturing facility rationalization, these are all things we know how to do. We have validated them before, and we believe now is the right time to do it from a position of strength and readying us for the future and balancing what we believe we need to do to sustain top line and bottom line growth for that future.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Most of the bigger picture questions have been asked. So I mean -- maybe you could just talk a little bit about the promotional environment. I think it was only a quarter ago that we heard one of your competitors, kind of talking about some of the, I guess, offensive spending that was out there for trial building, that there might be a little bit more defensive spending coming about. So just, I guess, really focusing on Western Europe and North America, how your outlook has changed maybe over the last 3 months? Anything there just coinciding with maybe some of the more tempered global market views on those regions.","Ian M. Cook","Yes. I must say thus far, nothing of -- nothing meaningful for me to say in terms of change. We continue to see promotional emphasis from folks. And in North America, we've just been pleased in our ability to continue to generate both price and volume in the third quarter. But no significant change in that environment.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I first wanted to really praise the preemptive restructuring announcement. I think it's good you're doing it now and you're responding to the headwinds instead of waiting like the company used to do. However, I want to get a sense of what I think is kind of the positive returns on the restructurings are around 3 things. Like the first, the 30% return over several years is actually relatively low given your history. So 2004 restructuring, I think, was a 50% return, just quick, quick math. And it was even higher for previous ones. So it feels like you're just kind of squeezing the lemon too much, and are you? Secondly, is -- this is kind of what you need to do to grow double digits in 2013. So what should we infer about what your view is on the global marketplace going forward? Understanding that's changing, but what does that really mean? And then third -- and pardon me for this, I apologize. But if you put it altogether, as you think about your long-term growth, isn't Colgate just being a little bit stubborn? And by the way, maybe other competitors have done this, so you joined the crowd, but a little bit stubborn about double-digit EPS growth? How are you going to convince us that you're still a double-digit EPS growth company on a sustainable basis because you're doing a big restructuring to just get there? And to be fair, again, I'm not sure anybody in this sector is really double-digit EPS grower sustainably. So a lot in there, but a lot in my head in thinking about this.","Ian M. Cook","Well, as usual, Ali, thanks for the single question. I guess in the end, the double digit is going to come down to performance. And of course, you and others will track that as you track that. But to come back in sequence, number one, we do not think we're squeezing the lemon. In fact, the rates of return we got on prior restructurings were in that low- to mid-30% level, and this is entirely consistent with that kind of benchmark. We view it as again, to repeat, what we need to do to reorganize our company to compete effectively, perhaps compete stubbornly, over the medium to long term. We believe and have validated the structure of hubs where for smaller countries, you can bring big country capability, which arms the folks on the ground with the tools they need to continue to win by growing market share and volume on the ground. We believe in shared services centers because we have done it with our IT organization 10 years ago. We know it works. We did it 5 years ago in Europe and Poland. We know we get immediate savings. We then get second order savings as you simplify your process. And then, you get third order savings as you bring additional functions and capabilities through the shared service centers. And in the manufacturing and facility space, that is a continuation of a journey that we have been on for over 15 years, all of it facilitated by SAP and our growing capability to use SAP. So it is a strategic view about how we need to organize. So turning to 2013, that wasn't the way we viewed it. The way we have approached 2013 is to say that we expect to grow the top line of our company by 6% to 7% organic, which we think stands up to any comparison and at the same time, deliver double-digit dollar earnings per share growth in that 10% to 11% range. And we will deploy the savings we get from the program by geography, by activity, as we see necessary. And we think reaching this new organization structure as we get to 2016, 2017 will position us sustainably to deliver consistent top line growth and that double-digit bottom line growth, and the folks will see the measure of it then.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just have a point of clarification. On your outlook for next year, 10% dollar EPS growth, what's the base we should be using? Is it the 2012 reported EPS, or is it the currency neutral? And then my real question is on the restructuring. You've said that you'll reduce the headcount by about 6%. Could you tell us what the timing of that is? And also, how many facilities will be changed or touched or closed during this process?","Ian M. Cook","To answer your first housekeeping question, Connie, it's the reported EPS. As to the second question, in terms of when the headcount reductions will take place, the answer is no. Those plans have not yet been finalized or communicated, and that would be premature. And in the case of the facilities, I think it would be fair to say that by the time we finish the program, we will have 10% fewer facilities approximately than the 54 we have today.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo Securities.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was just wanting to talk about your overall strategy, I guess in dealing kind of specifically with competition in emerging markets. And given your strong share in many of these markets, how do you specifically defend share of, like, say, rural areas or the high-frequency stores where you guys are prevalent in? And do you do anything differently, I guess, in your execution? I asked this within context of a major competitor in a major Latin American country, making a push into these rural areas.","Ian M. Cook","Yes. The most important point in all of this, Joe, is the consumer, and we should never forget that. And you'll find in many of these high-frequency stores, you can be there, but they're so small that you can't. You're not self-selecting the product. The shop owner is giving you the product that you ask for. And if you go to these stores, whether it's in India or in Latin America, Brazil, Mexico, the product they'll be asking for is Colgate. So that would be one. Number two, we would have the broadest assortment of toothpaste products available in those stores, and we have for many, many years had sizing and pricing that is particularly really tailored for those stores to acquaint to cash and pocket, cash outlay, what the consumer can afford. But the heart of it is loyalty versus presence. And the important thing in the high frequency down trade stores is the consumer loyalty that we have, which in many cases, despite the push, will not see new entrants distributed because the shopkeeper doesn't have any demand for the product.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Chris Ferrera with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about SG&A for the quarter. So it was up, I guess, 60 basis points. It's a little bit of a different result than what we've seen over the last, I don't know, 6 or 7 quarters, so it's a little higher. Is there anything unusual going on in that line item in the quarter? And then on advertising, do you feel like we're at kind of a good rate of growth on the advertising line?","Ian M. Cook","Thanks, Chris. No. And the overhead is not really -- part of it is the non-cost of goods transaction impact rolling forward, and then it's the timing of some benefit expenses. So a timing issue, not a structural issue. And advertising, yes, we're quite happy with the advertising level we have. I've said for quite a time now, in some parts of the world, even though we don't focus on it, there are a lot of programs that are managed through the so-called gross to net, the trade spending dollar which leads to in-store activity which, in today's world, particularly in the developed parts of our world, is where engaging with the consumer is very, very important. But in the traditional A&P that you see, yes, we're quite happy with that level. Frankly, with the stream of innovation we have coming into next year and as we go through our budgeting cycle, we'll be looking to take that up.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Your organic sales growth was 5% and yet, you're still guiding to 6% to 7% for next year and holding to your longer-term targets there. Why were you below that this quarter, and why should we expect that to get better next year? And then also -- and should we see an improvement in the fourth quarter? And then, tied to this, I know you said that you're seeing your categories slow some, and you gave us what you think -- how fast you think your categories are growing in Europe, emerging regions and North America. Can you tell us how fast you think -- given the weighted average, how fast your categories are growing globally and how fast were you thinking the categories are growing? So in other words -- so we can see the magnitude of the slowdown that you're seeing.","Ian M. Cook","The -- thanks, Alice. The -- if you look at the 9 months, we guided to 6% to 7% organic for this year. I remember when we did, some said that was too aggressive. If you look at the 9 months, with the third quarter coming up against a tough comparison last year, our 9-months organic growth is running at about 6.5%. And I would tell you that we continue to guide for the full year to the 6% to 7% level. As regards to the category growth rates, I kind of went through them before, high-single digits in the emerging markets, which are about 53% of our business and low-single digits. I characterized Europe as 1% to 2%, nearer 1%; and the U.S. as the same 1% to 2%. But there's really been no change in those category growth rates, so that has what -- that is what has driven the business next year, and that is what we expect to continue to see next year. And what gives us the confidence is the continued flow-through of our innovation pipeline into 2013 and the effectiveness of many of the marketing programs that we have and, of course, the return to positive volume on the Hill's business.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sorry to belabor all of this. I guess -- as we look at this, I'm trying to figure out 1 of 2 questions here. The first would be is simply -- is this simply a cost of doing business going up this year right in terms of running harder to stick with the, let's say, the 6% to 7% growth because the cost of doing business has higher advertising or what have you? Or is this simply sort of a reflection that the old model of delivering operating leverage doesn't work anymore? Okay. Where it was categories grow x, you gain a little bit of share to grow y and then just sort of automatically deliver leverage. And I don't -- I agree with you if that's the case that it doesn't work anymore. So I guess where in the P&L are we seeing that breakdown? Is it just the higher raw material costs? Is it the inability to take as much pricing going forward? Or is it again something on the SG&A? So hopefully that question makes sense.","Ian M. Cook","I'm not sure. So let me try and answer it in the same spirit that it was given, John. I guess if you break the program down into 2 bits, the why are we doing it bit and the why are we doing it bit really strategically is more about how we think we should be best organized to manage our business for the medium to long-term. To repeat, we believe in the power of hubs and we validated it. We believe with the technology available to us today and the servicing ability of shared service centers, and so we are expanding it. And we have the ability to further reduce our facilities sourcing our global business. So for us, these are the right things to do. And the why now, the why now is we believe the company is in a strong position. And this is the ideal time to expand structures that we have had in place for a long period of time. I think it would be fair to say, when we talk about a fast-changing world, that we have seen a slowdown in category growth rates, particularly in the developed world. And if you take a jaundiced macro view, is there going to be spillover of that into the emerging markets. So we still expect that 6% to 7% organic growth. We still expect to grow market share, but you're doing it in a world where the rate of category growth, particularly in the developed parts of that world, have slowed. And therefore, as we have said for some time, we believe re-basing the structural cost is an important part of how we go about managing our business.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could give a little more commentary on Hill's. It seems that for, I don't know, kind of a few years now, we've been hearing about sort of a sluggish growth and then changes or tweaks to some of the marketing strategies. And now we're hearing Science Diet relaunch and everything. But it's just -- it's hard to get a grasp of exactly what's going on. Is it something in the channel -- like, is the channel shifting from the specialty channel more toward regular retail channels, or are you losing market share? Like -- can you just give a little more color what's going on, please?","Ian M. Cook","Sure, Linda. First of all, we'll split out Hill's business into 2 parts. There is a Prescription Diet business. Those are diets that are specifically for pets with health issues that are prescribed by vets. We have a 70% recommendation level, a 70% market share and that business is fine. As we have been saying for a time, we have been unable, unsuccessful thus far in competing in what has become the fastest-growing, quite large segment in the category, which is the Naturals segment. We had offers there, a product called Nature's Best, but the consumer had a disconnect with this idea of Science Diet and a Natural's product and the trial and repeat rates were low and we withdrew the product. Our first step into that category was the product we have talked about, again, for a little while, which is Ideal Balance. And Ideal Balance is what it purports to be, which is it doesn't give up the heritage of Hill's Science, but it's just it's balanced with the ingredients that a natural -- a Naturals user would want. And that's working for us. It's working for us in terms of the trial we're getting, in terms of the business growth we're getting and in terms of the new users we're bringing from the Naturals segment. It's not big enough to turn the whole business. And in fact, I'm just hearing about the Science Diet relaunch now. We have been saying for a while that we were working to completely relaunch our Science Diet business at the end of this year, which across the line would therefore give the consumers the ingredients they would be looking for. And that, as it works its way through 2013, we think is going to complete the job and get the business back on to a positive volume track. So the proof of the pudding will be in 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Sorry if this has been asked, I just jumped on recently. With respect to the efficiency program, the press release indicates clearly there are ample opportunities through the structural cost through it. But also, you called out the benefit that should enable you to help drive your market share position and support sustained sales growth. To what degree might you reinvest some of the benefits you've outlined here? And if so, where would those investments most likely be directed?","Ian M. Cook","Well, Jon, yes, the -- you know the areas we are focused on. We actually called out 4 areas of investment of those funds. And the first obviously was innovation and brand building. The second was enabling technology and analytics, and we have been talking for a little while about -- it is our belief that analytics is a new area of discriminating competence for companies like ours. The third would be continuing to explore and expand our use of digital engagement with customers, with consumers, with suppliers. And finally, continuing to strengthen our capability in the emerging markets to underscore the distribution, the in-store visibility that our products have in those parts of the world. So again, we'll be doing it on a case-by-case basis, by activity, by country as we work through this. But they are the 4 principal areas of potential reinvestment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So one follow-up or just a housekeeping question. From an input cost standpoint, anything you call out, particularly for next year, in terms of how you think it progresses and what your assumptions are for oil? And then, on the restructuring program and cost savings, broadly if you would think about it longer term, how does this compare, or how does this change your assumptions for gross margins as far as your long-term targets are concerned more specifically? And then obviously, if you could give us some color on the SG&A piece beyond what you've laid out, that'd be helpful. Otherwise, I understand that you probably won't.","Ian M. Cook","No. So let's answer that quickly, no, I won't. The -- but getting to your questions, frankly again, we're at the preliminary stages of our budget. But the preliminary look would be in the -- from a cost point of view would be in a 1% to 2% range. That's kind of consistent with what we have seen this year. So that would be the macro view and that would be with oil at an assumed 110, and it would also assume a bit of a headwind from corn, which obviously affects our Hill's business. From a gross margin point of view, we continue to hold the same, plus or minus 5-year goal of getting our gross margin into the mid-60s. So that continues to be the way we think about it. And of course, the 110, coming back to the oil, is obviously the brand, not the West Texas.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Ian Gordon with S&P Capital IQ.","Ian J. Gordon - S&P Equity Research","Just on housekeeping. So the FX impact on sales was a negative 6%. Was it the same on EPS? And then just can you dig into Europe a little bit? I think this was the first quarter in a while where organic volumes were down. So what's changed there? Was it the competitive environment? It doesn't look like it was a year-over-year comparison issue.","Ian M. Cook","The -- coming back, the -- as we've said several times before, the impact of foreign exchange on the top line -- I'm sorry, on the bottom line is greater than the impact on the top line. So we faced a headwind of around 8% on the bottom line relative to foreign exchange. And in terms of Europe, Europe has always been a difficult environment. The -- candidly, for the last half a dozen quarters, organic growth has run negative in Europe and so the third quarter is no different than that. Obviously when you look at Europe, there clearly is a difference between the North and the South where in the Iberia's, the Italy's and the Greece's, you are seeing lower category growth rates.","Operator","Next, we have a follow-up question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So Ian, we've obviously [indiscernible] disagreed a little bit about Hill's in the past. And then it sounds like the changes you're making are very much in the right direction, but they're bigger changes than at least what I thought you guys have thought about before and again, that's good. But I'm trying to figure out the costing of it. So look, corn meal costs a whole ton less than corn let alone than chicken or meat. You need to market this. You need to get perhaps different distribution, or at least get shelf space back and take your other things off of the marketplace with discounting, et cetera. So can you give us a sense of the costing of this, and what we should expect from a run rate on your margin in this business given that these are higher cost inputs?","Ian M. Cook","Well when you look at the business, you know that the gross margin of Hill's is quite attractive to us. You are correct that moving to these formulas does bring with them a cost. But again, I come back to the overall company and say that, that is baked into our thinking in 2013 and beyond. And again, we're looking at the top line of 6% to 7%, and we're looking at that bottom line EPS growth of 10% to 11%, and the impact on the Hill's gross margin is easily manageable in that framework.","Operator","And next, we'll go again to Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","My question was answered.","Operator","We do have one follow-up question from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Two things. Is it possible -- this is a follow-up to the Hill's question. Is it possible that you'll change the pack size for Hill's and make them smaller as a way to address the higher cost and price this smaller pack size as the same as the bigger ones now?","Ian M. Cook","The straightforward answer, Alice, is no. The Hill's issue is not a pricing issue, it's a formulation issue in this particular case. So that's where we need to focus.","Operator","And as we have no further questions in queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any further or closing remarks.","Ian M. Cook","Okay. Well, thanks for all of you calling in. It's good to have the opportunity to talk about the business today and our plans for the future.

Just a reminder, there may be a slight delay before the question-and-answer session begins due to the Web simulcast.","Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, Bina.","Bina H. Thompson","Thanks, Kathy, and good morning everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","We\u2019re pleased to exit 2014 with organic sales up 6% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, which was the strongest quarter of last year. Our market shares were strong around the world as you will hear in a moment. As always, innovation has been critical to our success we\u2019re excited about our pipeline looking forward to 2015 and beyond. In many markets, macroeconomic challenges persist and of course, foreign exchange has been and will continue to be a considerable headwind as translation alone is projected to impact EPS in 2015 over 10% at current foreign exchange rate.","That makes us even more pleased to be able to deliver continued organic sales growth and positive results on the bottom line. While our gross margin was down in the quarter due to very significant transaction costs, we believe that we will see an improving trend as we move through 2015 with a more benign raw material cost environment and pricing taken to offset the impact of rising transaction costs related to foreign exchange.","Our funding-the-growth program is as robust as ever in our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track. Generated in 2014, related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we are over a $100 million after-tax and above the top end of our projected range. Overhead expenses are down in the quarter due to tight controls in all divisions and savings from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program.","Our total commercial spending also increased into both existing and new products. We think we are well poised to meet the challenges we face as we enter 2015. We believe our strong balance sheet and solid cash generation should keep us in good stead. So turning to North America, we are very pleased with our progress here innovation is contributing to organic sales growth and we have more plan for this year.","In the fourth quarter, in the U.S., our market share increased year-to-date in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes and was even with the prior year in mouthwash. Results are strong across our portfolio in toothpaste. Our Colgate Total toothpaste share remains over 10% supported by a graphic refresh, relaunch of Colgate total events whitening and the boost provided by our companion Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash. The Colgate Optic White franchise is also doing well as the superpremium is driving instrumentality with its year-to-date toothpaste share up from 5.3% to 5.6%.","And as you know, we also launched Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste and toothbrushes in the second half of 2014. It's off to a strong start and our overall toothpaste share is up 1.4% in the three months after its launch as compared to the three months prior. In the mouthwash category, our year-to-date share is up more than 4 points, while our two major competitors full-year shares declined with excellent result from Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash.","Our fabric conditioner business continues to perform well both for the full-year and the quarter, our market share is up over 4 points to a new record, close to 20% of the overall market and as you know, these products are primarily sold in Hispanic markets. Now, as you would expect, we have more innovation slated for 2015 with a full grid plan for the first quarter.","In toothpaste, we are launching Colgate Optic White Expressway toothpaste. This innovation provides whiter teeth in just three days simply by brushing with best results after four weeks of brushing as directed is Colgate\u2019s fastest whitening toothpaste and it\u2019s enamel-safe for daily use.","In the mouthwash category we\u2019re launching Colgate Total gum health mouthwash it provides advanced gum protection for 45% stronger healthier gums versus the non-antibacterial mouthwash.

And on the value side we\u2019re launching Ajax all-in-one dish liquid which has a new formula with 10% more cleaning ingredients than before.","And to further our success in the fabric conditioner category we\u2019re launching Suavitel fragrance pro with the proprietary scent system which provides five times longer lasting fragrance compared with using detergent alone. As well as Suavitel fast dryer sheets which helps close dry 30% faster than using detergent alone. Turning then to Europe South Pacific, we enjoyed another quarter of organic sales growth in this region with a slight acceleration in volumes in the third quarter. Our commercial hubbing activities part of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program are now complete and were implemented with very little disruption in fact in the quarter we're virtually all new hubs delivered positive organic sales growth.","Innovation is critical in this part of the world and it continues to contribute to market share growth in a number of categories. Our market shares across Europe are up year-to- date in toothpaste, manual toothbrush, battery toothbrush, mouthwash, liquid hand soap and dish liquids. Of note all categories of our Sanex business has grown market share year-to-date, shower gel, liquid hand soap and underarm protection.","Our launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus sugar acid neutralizer is now complete across the region with excellent share results in a number of markets. One of our first launch market Denmark posted a 4.1 share in the most recent period and two larger more recent launch markets, the UK and France have already achieved 1.5% and 2% shares respectively in the most recent periods.","Building on this success in 2015 we will continue full marketing support for the toothpaste along with a further rollout of a companion toothbrush and mouthwash. As I just mentioned, our Sanex business is performing well and recent exciting new product activity to support further growth.","Launching in the first quarter is Sanex advance, Sanex's first body care regimen developed with a leading dermatologist.

The Sanex Advance Atopiderm bundles for extra dry atopic skin contains skin identical lipids and emollients to help restore the skins protective barrier, sooth itchiness and control hypersensitivity, helping the skin to keep functioning normally.","The Sanex Advanced Hydrate 24h bundle for very dried dehydrated skin uses Ceragly Activ technology in a shower gel and lotion which has a pseudo-ceramides and glycerin to maintain the skins\u2019 protective barriers by locking in the moisture. And in addition, will be launching Sanex in Poland, a new geography which will provide incremental new business for us.","Turning then to Latin America, business across this region is solid, organic sales growth accelerated from the prior two quarters in 2014 and while volume increased a modest 1% versus the year-ago period, this was on top of a very strong increase of 10% in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Toothpaste shares are strong across the region, in Mexico our most recent share is 80.8% up 80 basis points in the year ago period. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection has achieved a 2% share in the most recent period. In Brazil in December our toothpaste share reached 72.1% for the month, the highest share in the past 18-years. This is in spite of a lot of competitive activity. Our manual toothpaste business is performing well.","In Mexico, we achieved a record share of 45% in the latest leading, while for the first time our major competitor dropped below 40% share. Soap was across all retail environment, self-service stores, pharmacies and the indirect trade. We reached a record year-to-date share in Brazil as well with good growth in the superpremium segment with a 32.4% share of the market the number one position.","In bar soaps we\u2019ve strengthened our leadership position across the region of half a point on a year-to-date basis to 29.7% with the most recent lead at 29.9%. Innovation in both the Palmolive and Protex equities has contributed this success. And in the Home Care category our year-to-date regional market shares have increased in fabric conditioners of 50 basis points to 51.6% and in liquid cleaners of 70 basis points to 36.3% and we have more exciting new products plan for 2015 across all our categories.","In the first quarter, specifically where excited about a new subcategory in the Protex Body Cleansing category, feminine intimate wash. Protex is a brand that's recognized as an expert in skin protection and is positioned to transfer readily into the intimate soap subcategory. It will be launched with a fully integrated marketing campaign including our products website and endorsements from a well-known journalist. Primary placement in-store will be on the intimate shelf with secondary placement on the soap shop to attract attention from loyal Protex users.","Turning then to Asia, we\u2019re pleased with the acceleration of organic sales growth in this region as we indicated would happen last quarter. And as referenced in the press release we saw good toothpaste market share gains in a number of countries. In India, our market shares increased to 54.4% up 30 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Colgate Active Salt toothpaste developed especially for this market where salt promotes antibacterial efficacy increased 70 basis points to over a 5% share.","In Malaysia, our year-to-date share is up 30 basis points to just over 73%. Anticavity segment now comprises almost 27% of the market and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste launched last February has a 3.2% share year-to-date with the most recent lead of 4%. In manual toothbrushes, our regional share increased 20 basis points year-to-date to 30.2% with eight out of 10 countries reporting stable positive growth.","In India, our share reached a record 43.2% up 120 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Innovation under the Colgate Slim Soft equity has been particularly successful. And our regional mouthwash share increased 120 basis points year-to-date to 23.1% with the most recent period at 24.6%. Looking forward in toothpaste, we will be relaunching both our base sensitivity line as well as the Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief line.","In addition, we will be adding Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent. This new product has a unique calcium and amino acid complex which repairs the root cause of sensitivity preventing the pain from returning. In India, we will be launching Colgate Active Salt with neem. The neem tree in India is known for its antibacterial properties. In certain markets we will also introduce a line of Kids toothpaste for children aged two to five, a segment currently somewhat underdeveloped which presents a great incremental opportunity. New in the mouthwash category will be Colgate Plax Bamboo Charcoal and as you know Charcoal is also why reviewed as an ingredient to fight bacteria.","Turning then to Africa\/Eurasia, this region continues to deliver strong organic sales growth despite some macroeconomic challenges in the countries such as Russia. Our regional toothpaste share is up 10 basis points to 32.4% year-to-date. And despite difficulties in Russia and the Ukraine our year-to-date share is up 10 basis points to 32.9% in Russia and up 170 basis points in the Ukraine to 28.2%. We have also seen good share increases across Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa. In manual toothbrushes, Colgate 360 and Colgate Slim Soft have helped increase our share in Turkey, up 30 basis points year-to-date to 28.7%.","In South Africa, we are up 380 basis points year-to-date to over 38% of the market. And across the region our mouthwash share is up 30 basis points year-to-date approaching 20%. Colgate is the number two mouthwash brand in Africa\/Eurasia. You may recall, we told you about a new product in Russia Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash. That has contributed to 210 basis point increase in our Russian mouthwash share to 27.5% year-to-date.","We also have a good market leading shower gel business in this region. Our year-to-date share is up 120 basis points to almost 22%. Russia, Turkey and South Africa have all reached record shares. We told you on previous calls about our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line with enticing coffee, chocolate, vanilla and peach fragrances. That innovation has been one of the drivers of the excellent share performance. And innovation this quarter continues. To support our relaunch of our Colgate Total toothpaste portfolio, we have initiated a new integrated marketing campaign around the idea of the incredible mouth.","The idea is that Colgate knows that your mouth is incredibly weak, which is why Colgate developed Colgate Total to protect 100% of your mouth not only your teeth. To continue the momentum in our shower gel business, we are launching Palmolive Tiger freshness for men. You may recall we\u2019ve had great success with Colgate Altai Herbs products toothpaste, mouthwash and body cleansing. Outside is a region in Russia known for its herbs which are believed to have curative properties. Similarly Tiger is the northern forest characterized by pine bruises and larches covering much of Northern Eurasia. This new product offers a freshness and cleanliness of the legendary [tiger] in your shower.","Finally, we are pleased with Hill's continued good organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter particularly when compared to a strong 7% growth in the year ago quarter. Innovation has driven good results across our Science Diet, Prescription Diet and Ideal Balance portfolios. For the Science Diet portfolio, nutritional consultant shopper engagement at superstores and sampling of our new salt savory treat here in the U.S. has helps drive sales.","In Europe, Hill Science Plan Perfect Weight has been supported with secondary displays in-store and in-store weighing area and on shelf dynamic cleans to explain the product benefits. Here in the U.S. Hill\u2019s Ideal Balance has gained share in both the wellness and natural segments and consumption of the product in superstores was up strongly versus the year ago period.","In Europe, the product contained excellent trade acceptance in the UK and Germany two large pet food markets and receive support with promotional activities and secondary placement. And our prescription diet metabolic line continues to meet with success. To build on that, this quarter we're launching prescription diet metabolic plus.","32 million pets have obesity related concurrent conditions. This is the first and only dual efficacy therapeutic pet nutrition food. It will be available for weight loss plus mobility for dogs, and weight loss plus Urinary Stress for cats. The product will be available in both a dry and stew format. And we\u2019re also very excited about the new global packaging redesign across the prescription range.","With more consumer friendly packaging and new better tasting formulas, the bundle is designed to create a stronger emotional connection to strengthen our leadership and innovation credentials and improved taste reception that's rolling out across the US, Canada and some of the high-growth markets in the first quarter of 2015 and Europe in the second quarter.","So in summary, we believe our solid results for the quarter are a good indication that we have effective strategy. And we believe that this consistent strategy has stood as well for many years. We know it well. Staying close to the customer and consumer, innovating everywhere becoming more effective and efficient and on going leadership development. We believe our objectives on the ground have the tools to make the right decisions balancing price and volume supporting innovation in-store and out increasing market share all this is winning on the ground.","We in our competition are like are faced with choppy times, volatile swings in currency and macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world. So we believe it\u2019s a simple consistent focus well understood by every Colgate person that makes the difference.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Q&A. Kathy.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audiences. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll first go to Steve Powers from UBS.","Stephen Powers","Hi, Bina. Ian good morning.","Ian M. Cook","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Powers","Maybe just a few little things to kick things off of we could first could you just start up by providing the gross margin bridge for Q4 and maybe talk a little bit about how those drivers are expected to trend into 2015, any changes in margin improvement or organic growth expectations for the year versus last quarters outlook would be great. And then maybe drilling in could you also provide a little update on volume and sales trends in China and Brazil specifically, it looks like things improvement is expected in China, but you were still battling through some inventory issues in Brazil. I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s a fair read and just the expectations on how you expect momentum to trend from here. Thanks.","Ian M. Cook","We\u2019ll see, I think as Bina said at the end of her prepared remarks, I guess we live in a world these days where focus is really important, but so is agility and I think you saw in the fourth quarter the agility and the balance I guess between volume and price as our 6% was composed of volume growth in all divisions in pricing increases largely in the developing world.","So if we take that to the gross profit row forward and you go back to the prior year gross profit 59.1, we benefited from 1.4 points of pricing, as you can see a step-up from the prior three quarters between our funding the growth and restructuring, we had something like 280 basis points of benefit and then faced a headwind in terms of material prices of some 4.3 point of which two points for the quarter was transaction and then they were 20 basis points negative of some other minor changes which gets you to the 58.8% gross margin.","Interestingly, although we are where we are if you were to go back to the October conversation we had and our expectation for the full quarter of gross margin to be even with prior year, if you just stripped out the exchange deterioration since our October call, in fact for this quarter our gross margin would have been at prior year level. What we manage to do by moving quickly on pricing was to offset the dollar impact of the foreign exchange but not yet the ratio impact.","So that\u2019s 2014, when you go forward into 2015, I guess you have got a few things in terms of our view on gross margin, our view on gross margin for 2015 is that we will expand it between 50 and 100 basis points on the year. Now that is going to progress through the year from the first to the fourth quarter. We get a benefit in 2015 of course, from the current oil prices which we expect to work through towards the end of the first half next year and of course commodity materials which our forecast would say more or less flat year-on-year and these are benefits we haven\u2019t seen in prior year.","We will continue and indeed already have take pricing particularly in those emerging markets where we have to meet the transaction impact of foreign exchange, because that\u2019s what translate into the operating earnings. We will of course be focus on our funding the growth program which again should benefit in 2015 from a more benign cost environment and of course we have our restructuring program. So, as we begin 2015, we feel good with the expansion target of plus 50 to 100 basis points on gross margin stepping it way up through the year.","Now when you come back to the topline of the company, I think the fourth quarter played out organically pretty much the way we expected it. We see the destocking in China behind us and that\u2019s why we see that the 6% organic there and indeed organic growth in the country itself. In terms of Brazil we said that we would still be working through the destocking in the fourth quarter that would be completed in the fourth quarter and then we would move into 2015 and indeed that has been the case.","But if you step back and kind of take a look at where is the consumer we continue to see for our categories that in North America category growth, and again I am talking our categories, is between 1% and 2% as we said on the last call it is edging widely up to the upper end of that 1% to 2% range. Europe continues to be more even between 0% and 1% and across the emerging markets we continue to feel comfortable with the mid single-digit local currency value growth rates for our categories. So that\u2019s the environment we see in 2015 with China and Brazil now behind us.","Operator","And we will move on to our next question from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian","Hey, good morning.","Ian M. Cook","Hi, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian","Ian, pricing accelerated pretty significantly sequentially in Q4 and was a big driver of the organic sales growth acceleration in both emerging markets and globally, so I just wanted to get an update on your view of the competitive environment here, and your ability to sustain that level of pricing going forward with a lower oil costs and flat commodities overall. Or even get more pricing with some of the incremental FX pressures you are seeing. And then also in Q4 on a related note, how much of the Latin America price increase was related to Venezuela and Argentina? Thanks.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, I think we have demonstrated fairly consistently and ability to deliver pricing to offset the transaction impact of foreign exchange. I think we demonstrated that in the fourth quarter and we expect to continue to price as we have already done in some parts of the world. So pricing will be a factor in growth and in our gross margin expansion plans for 2015 and we believe as we indeed already have, that we will be able to realize that, and I go back to the fourth quarter and say there was a fairly meaningful step up in pricing in those emerging markets and yet we still had a balance between volume growth and pricing growth.","Now, when you turn to Latin America, the need for pricing again is driven by foreign exchange and if you look at Latin America, overall, we took pricing in the fourth quarter and you see pricing up literally across the geography, from Mexico through Central America, our Indian group, Venezuela, Brazil, and the Southern, so we took pricing across the board in Venezuela as we told you on the last call, we, along with our two principal multinational competitors and the large local player down there, on price controlled categories, got approval to increase pricing and so we, along with everyone else, increased pricing in Venezuela and that will roll forward into 2015.","But again, you look at Asia, you look at Africa, Eurasia, we're taking pricing in all parts of the world that are affected by foreign exchange.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move to Chris Ferrara of Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara","Good morning.","Ian M. Cook","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Ferrara","Ian, just a follow-up on that, look I can appreciate that you don\u2019t want to breakout exactly what Venezuela pricing is but I think the question on lot of people\u2019s mind is just look the Latam segment pricing and the resilience of volume even our tough comp was very impressive that was very impressive. But I think what we\u2019re all trying to figure out is as it relates to the sustainability of it was Venezuela and Argentina a disproportionate driver of that right in other words can we feel comfortable with the assumption that you guys were able to hold volume very well across the segment broadly and the numbers aren\u2019t necessarily skewed by Venezuela and Argentina.","Ian M. Cook","Clearly, we got more pricing in Venezuela, because we had no pricing for an extended period of years. So the answer there is clearly yes as it was for everybody else that we compete with in that country. I think the more pertinent question is our ability to maintain that pricing and continue to increase that pricing going forward and our view is that, yes, we can. And again, I come back to the fourth quarter, having taken pricing we did see volume growth in all of our divisions.","Now of course, that step in Venezuelan pricing will ease off as we work our way through 2015, because Venezuela is much more episodic than many of the other markets. So the answer is yes. And again, back to the consumer behavior, we continue to see our categories hold in the emerging markets at mid-single digits. And remember, as you will see when we file our K for us 2014, Venezuela continues to represent about 3% of the company\u2019s worldwide sales and only about 1% of the operating margin.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Good morning, thanks. I wanted to ask you about consumer consumptions levels, do you think that the current gross rates that you are posting are inline with where consumer consumption is right now. And on top of that how do you think about your inventory levels at retail. And then I also want to touch a little bit on the elasticity of demand in your categories because in the past you said that consumers understand pricing due to FX but at what point does that equation start to potentially breakdown because this quarter you obviously saw a big acceleration in price and volume really didn\u2019t accelerate all that much, but can you help us understand the analytics, just make sure you don\u2019t potentially go over board on pricing and what you consider too much, like if volume decelerates to the point where you are seeing negatives which you consider that to go too far and clearly I\u2019m painting specially about Latin America. Thanks so much.","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Well clearly Olivia, as I\u2019m sure all other companies do, we do considerable work to balance even the short-term volume impact at the pricing we take. I come back and say we sold volume growth in all of our emerging markets even with the stepped up pricing we took in the fourth quarter, so we think we have a handle on it and we think again, remember the types of products we are selling that we can take the pricing necessary to offset the foreign exchange impacts and continue to maintain that balance between volume and price and indeed volume slows a little bit when you take the pricing, but then that balance comes back.","Look, on retail inventory you may remember, we were the first to talk about the destocking in China and I think we\u2019ve tried to be very transparent about what we saw unfolding in the marketplace is the China destocking is behind us and I said on the last call that we expected brazil to work through in the fourth quarter and it has done. We track not only retail inventory, we track inventories with all of our distributors country-by-country and we have parameters that actually relate back to the return on invested capital the distributor gets in terms of the inventory levels that they would hold.","So we have a very clear view on that inventory and we have a very sharp focus on making sure that it is not at least by our actions out of balance. What we saw in Brazil and China was a marketplace destocking because of the slowdown in the category. So I think you can feel confident that we have very much control on that inventory. And remember as we talked about when we went through those sub-prime years in difficult times, products in our categories if you will become the simple luxuries that consumers can afford. So the behavior of using these products does not go away when times get slightly tougher.","Operator","And next we have John A. Faucher from JPMorgan.","Ian M. Cook","Hey John.","John A. Faucher","Hey Ian, how are you?","Ian M. Cook","We\u2019re good. Thanks.","John A. Faucher","Excellent, so just wanted to follow up and some of the guidance commentary in terms of I think you said that or Bina said rather that the 10% is the translation number. So can you talk a little bit about that the transaction pieces little bit different now given what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the move in the euro and some of the other more developed market currencies, which obviously are negative? So can you talk about sort of how much of the transaction piece maybe you are not going to cover and can you get pricing in developed markets to cover some of this transactional pieces. Is that a possibility, even or that something where you basically say you know what we are going have to yet that impact given where the market is right now? Thanks.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, thanks John. Let me just complete what Bina said I mean so when you think about foreign exchange as a headwind, yes, the translation impact is 10% on the bottom line. On the topline we see it going to be about 7% and 7.5% on the year. So that just gives you the breath of that. In terms of the transaction impacts, that is embedded into our guidances on gross margin being up 50 to 100 basis points. The transaction impact whether it\u2019s the balance sheet aspect of payable in the short-term or the more substantive foreign exchange impact on raw materials imported finished goods.","In the medium term that hits the gross margin squarely and if you don\u2019t recover that you can\u2019t deliver an operating return, so all of our guidance is assuming our ability to offset that transaction impact. Now remember, offsetting that transaction impact is not just a function of list price increases in any given marketplace. It could be benefited from mix, it could be benefited from different types of promotional activity, but elevate the ASP we have the benefit of our funding the growth program we have the benefit of the global growth and restructuring program that we have underway.","And as I said, at the beginning the benefit of a more benign commodity environment especially in the area. Now if you look at Europe and North America list price increases are difficult to accomplish, but you saw in Europe terrific margin expansion this year. So there its going to be some of the other techniques, but I think are going to continue to drive gross margin. Most especially funding the growth efforts, the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and what we can do with our promotional efficiencies as we go forward rather than list price increases, but that's the way we plan the year, John.","Operator","And next we have Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Altobello","Thank you, good morning.","Ian M. Cook","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Altobello","Just want to shift gears a bit to SG&A I want to put the 50 basis points of overhead savings in some context. It seems like it\u2019s a bit of an out layer compared to the last few quarters. First of all what was the FX impact on SG&A in the quarter and how sustainable is the 50 basis points you saw on the fourth quarter and how should we think about advertising next year came down about 60 basis points in 2014 it was down both absolutely as a percentage of sales. So I am curious how are you thinking about that as you are shifting dollars and advertising to promotion in 2015? Thanks.","Ian M. Cook","Well, let me start with the advertising, Joe. So as we have said for quite a considerable time, the advertising is a combination of what we all grew up with which is the traditional media and promotion and we have always balanced that in terms of the traditional with the in-store activity that we undertake during the year. So if you look at the balance, in fact, in the quarter, our total commercial investment was up as it was for the year. Interestingly many of our competitors in many large markets around the world eased back on their traditional advertising spend. So in many of those markets actually our competitive pressure was actually strengthened.","Now as we think about 2015 in terms of that traditional bucket of advertising and promotion, we are planning for that to increase absolutely and as a percentage to sale. And as we have always done we will continue to balance that as the year unfolds. So we feel very much that the advertising is where we needed to be. And I think candidly Joe, when you look at the results in the fourth quarter, we got a 6% organic growth rate and delivered a pretty robust bottom line.","And of course is that kind of sustainable top and bottom line growth that we are focused on, relative to the overhead Forex is that much of an impact. We continue to expect to make progress in terms of overheads, because the global growth and efficiency program is largely focused in that area rather than gross margin this time around. And again, as Bina said, we were ahead of delivery of that program in 2014 and we will continue to make progress in 2015.","Operator","We will now move on to William Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz","Hi, good morning, Ian.","Ian M. Cook","Hey, Bill.","William Schmitz","Hey, so I am just trying to figure out the organic top line guide I mean you gave market growth rates, is that going to be your growth as well. Because like if I wait sort of 45% developed, 55% emerging assume that, develop pieces 1% to 2% and the emerging is 5% to 6%. I kind of get you like 3% to 5% range, is that the right way to think about that or do you think you\u2019re going to continue to gain market share in the growth asset in the markets.","Ian M. Cook","We\u2019ve been quite pleased with our market share progress Joe and caller says Joe, Dale everyone is Joe and obviously we had some new businesses that we're entering whether it\u2019s the intimate product, whether its new markets with Sanex and indeed some of the new geographies we have around the world like Nigeria, like Iran, like stepping up our position in Bangladesh, but we continue to be comfortable with that 4% to 7% range that we have talked about which we think adequately reflects the volatility that is in our world.","You know if you take 2013 as a year a full-year, we came in about 6% if you look at 2014 now as a full-year we came in organic growth about 5%, so we think that 4% to 7% range remains reasonable and indeed that is what we are planning against. And I\u2019m sorry about the name slip up.","Operator","And next we have Michael Steib of Credit Suisse.","Michael Steib","Good morning Ian.","Ian M. Cook","Good morning Joe.","Michael Steib","My question relates to the U.S. environment really, you said that you have category growth is edging towards the upper end of the 1% to 2% range, yet pricing in your categories continues to be down due to the promotional activities. Given the commodity cost tailwind, even if its marginal that you are going to experience next year, do you see that promotional environment remain at broadly similar levels going forward, or should it get - intensify from here?","Ian M. Cook","Well I think Michael that our assumptions is that it will continue pretty much as it has been, when you look at 2014 you might say that some of the \u2013 shall we say naked pricing pressure has come off, but we definitely saw in the North American environment couponing both in terms of the number of coupons dropped, and you know that\u2019s a large part of U.S. promotional activity and works its way through the income statement and price that couponing volume and couponing values both stepped up substantially in 2014 and we expect that will continue in 2015. Now in part coupons create trial for new products, so that\u2019s quite healthy, so you will see some bumps I guess quarter-by-quarter because of that. So we are assuming that competitive environment in our categories at least will continue as we\u2019ve seen it per haps with more emphasis towards cuoponing.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move to Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty.","Good morning. I was hoping that you would discuss some metrics that have improved in the areas where you have completed the move to your new hubbings?","Ian M. Cook","Okay, I think we \u2013 the new areas really will back up, I mean we have had hubbing operations in parts of our world for a long period of time and I think we talked about that relative to Latin America when I talked about the groups we had there in the activity we took that, the next big tranche if you will hubbing has been Europe and in that environment we have both accomplished and delivered the savings and the efficiency that we were looking for and now the market level activity begins and the next like of that journey.","Now will be to get the accrued benefits of having hubs now with shared service centers and I guess frankly most importantly of all with that focus and the ability to sharpen our investments behind the businesses as you saw in release and in being is commentary market shares in our principal categories are up. And that in a slow growth European environment is ultimately what all depends I think our ability to continue to deliver organic growth in that part of the world, which when you think about why we prioritizes Europe first from the global growth and efficiency point of view was the objective of the exercise.","Operator","And next we have Bill Chapel with SunTrust.","William Chapel","Good morning, thank you.","Ian M. Cook","Hi, Bill, good morning.","William Chapel","In [indiscernible] walk through as we look at oil kind of dropping to where it did in the fourth quarter, how that works through your P&L over the next 12 months, I mean in terms of big diesel or just straight oil or resin, I mean and maybe percentages if you can \u2013 we see 50% of the benefit by the first half or do we really not see it until the second half. Just trying to get gauge of how it really influences the business and how long it takes to influence the business?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, well you know as you\u2019ve heard for many there is a lead lag things in life have a way of going up quicker than they come down. If you take oil the most immediate benefit you get tends to be in freight because that price is quite quickly and so we got a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter very modest and we expect that to benefit of starting in this quarter in 2015.","When you talk about the flow through benefits of the resin impact and the other material impact that will start to benefit us towards the end of the first half partly related to it working through the system, partly related to our own inventory levels, you have to work those through before you get the benefit which is why we make the point that as we build to that 50 to 100 basis points gross margin improvement, it is going to build across the year, because the commodity benefits will really start flowing in the second quarter.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Phil Astrachan from Stifel.","Ian M. Cook","Hi, Mark.","Mark S. Astrachan","Hi, how are you doing everybody, good morning. I wanted to just ask follow-up to that last question, just where are you budgeting oil for 2015 and then just you\u2019re shifting gears, could you talk a bit about your thoughts on share gains that you've seen from some of your euro-based competitors over the last three to five years. And your views on sending off some sort of incremental spend that they're going to have given current exchange rates as well as potentially reversing some of those share gains that you had or sort of just broadly have you think about a more able-bodied competitive landscape from some of those companies?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, we - in terms of the oil we actually budgeted oil at about $60, so obviously if it says that the current level we will pick up a little bit more, we\u2019ll have to see how all of that works through across the year. In terms of European-based competitors, if you mean from a foreign exchange point of view, we're all managing in a world. And we all have different parts of the world and we all have growth ambitions in those different parts of the world.","We have, we think being quite responsible with the benefit of Global Growth and Efficiency Program in Europe and making sure that our commercial investments, including traditional advertising and promotion, are appropriate for both the European category growth rates and the competitors we meet in Europe. If we see things change, and we think we need to be more responsive back to this notion of agility and balance. We will take the appropriate action. But right now we are quite comfortable with our European growth. And with our investments stands there relative to both the categories and our competitors.","Operator","And next we will go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ian M. Cook","Hey, Ali.","Ali Dibadj","Hi, guys how are you? So just a couple of quick follow-ups and one is and I'm sorry you might have said this but I jumped off for a second if you could quantify actually Ian the Venezuela impact on your growth rate because even that\u2019s you know 3% of sales that we said price mix as best as we can tell you put that together it might be 0.50, two points of your six point growth. So if you have [indiscernible] if you could say that again and I do want to go back to this ad spend begin down 8% below 10% for you which is something into 2009. And its point I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unique to you guys. Lot of the companies in the sector are kind of that your point balance the above the line versus the below line ad spend. And the list of the brand, so I am trying to get a sense from you because I [indiscernible] one quarter, right so. So the list of the brand as you go forward and how do you think about that gross to net versus pure ad spend and what the right balance is?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, well know even if you did drop off Ali, we didn\u2019t provide that information on Venezuela and we won\u2019t now, that the point I did make relative to Venezuela in the Latin America, is that we took pricing across Latin America in the fourth quarter, in the case of Venezuela, yes, it was episodic as we said in the third quarter it would be, because haven\u2019t had pricing for several years that same episodic benefit also benefited our principal multi national competitors who got the same government approvals on key categories for them at exactly the same time we got out and indeed the local competitors was granted pricing as well.","So everybody benefited from pricing in Venezuela. But the point to make is we took pricing across the board and then environment, where everybody was getting pricing our global growth rate was indeed 6%.","In terms of the advertising yes you are right, one has to be conscious about the brand health as we call it. I will say that the kind of model that perhaps the many of us grew up with where what was accounted foreign trade spending was inherently bad and only the so called below the line spending was good. I think those days are gone, I think ones ability take Hispanic consumers in the U.S. that you can reach with in-store activity that may have a component of price, but might be much more driven by a coupon that has regionally dropped at high population areas.","These kind of techniques are now available and they weren\u2019t available before and you can measure them, you can execute them, retailers can handle different configurations to put them at work with a consumer, but coming back to the brands, we do, do tracking work and our tracking work around the world shows that if you take our Oral Care business around the world, the health is very, very good of those brands.","So by all means we track it, sometimes from a short-term point of view if couponing or other activity steps up, you have no option at least in part to participate, but I think we\u2019ve been one of the loudest voices at least I hope so in saying that we much prefer to compete in an environment of innovation with marketing support than price promotion, but we don\u2019t see a weakness in brand health that is something of course we have and we will continue to track.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman","Thanks, good morning.","Ian M. Cook","Good morning Lauren.","Lauren R. Lieberman","Just two things. One was to follow-up on this conversation about in-store spend versus traditional advertising. Is it fair then to summarize kind of the environment you are seeing right now to say that in the regions where you have had more in-store spend, more promotion, its not necessarily because of negative flair ups in the competitive environment, it\u2019s a little bit more choiceful on how to best reach the consumer for a given activity that you guys have slated or is there in fact a kind of step up in the negative promotional environment currently?","Ian M. Cook","I would say it is more the formal Lauren, and these are techniques that with our Colgate business planning and so on that we have learned to be efficient with, so its choiceful, but you know I also have to say take in environment like the United States, there is no question that that couponing environment has become more competitive and we have correspondingly become more competitive in that environment, but if I took an overall stance, I would say as we have been saying for a time that it is choiceful with techniques that we think not only reach the consumer, but actually strengthen the equity of our brands overtime.","Operator","And now we will move on to Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante","Hi, good morning everyone.","Ian M. Cook","Good morning Javier.","Javier Escalante","My question has to do with detachment of a restructuring program. There was expanded to the saving target to up to $390 million, assumes to me that only a third of the savings has been accrued up to now. So I would like to understand how much of savings will accelerated in the next couple of years in order to hit the $390 million target and if you could help us understand what kind of activities are going to happen is this more hubbing like the one that you did in Europe or is it manufacturing facilities being up and up and in Asia help us understand physically what activities are going to take place that are going to help the savings to ramp up in the next - these two years? Okay thank you.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, well, the first thing to say Javier the program is very much on track indeed has Bina said our performance in 2014 was up. If you look at our so far savings against the total we are running about half accrued. So its not a third and if you look at the activity going forward yes it is in the same areas that we had very much spoken to in the beginning.","So it is the hubbing, it is what we are doing with our facilities and it is the expanded use of the Colgate business service centers and we are very excited by it, because we think as we have now seen in Europe not only does it bring you the immediate term savings, but it makes you operate smarter and faster and in a more efficient manner. So we like it, not just as a Global Growth and Efficiency Program, but because we think it ultimately gets this organizationally to a better place from an operating point of view.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Ian M. Cook","Hi, Caroline.","Caroline S. Levy","Good morning Ian and Bina, thanks. I\u2019ve got a question about Russia and another on Mexico. On Russia, I guess if you have to describe it as pretty chaotic and I'm just wondering how much of your pricing you were able to take in the fourth quarter and how much you think you still need to take and whether you think demand will drop off quite meaningfully. And secondly on Mexico, both Kimberly and Procter have had very difficult years trading in Mexico and they to some extent blamed the higher consumer tax. Are you seeing any slowdown in demand or did you see any slowdown, do you see any pick up what\u2019s going on in Mexico for you guys?","Ian M. Cook","The Mexico hasn't changed for us. We certainly didn't see a 20% decline there nor did we see a 20% decline in China. So no that environment hasn\u2019t really changed for us. Russia for us is still a relatively modest part of our business between 1% and 2%.. Chaotic may be overstating it that it is indeed difficult. And it is likely to become more difficult. We have lived this before at the end of the 80s. And indeed the senior executive that lived within is living it again now.","And so that we know the actions to take from a structural cost point of view and we are taking those actions and of course we are taking pricing, and we are transferring funds and we are watching closely distributions and wholesalers. So, we are very much managing Russia from a containment point view. But we\u2019re close to our businesses. So we believe we have a good handle. And interestingly shares were up. So maybe cold but there up.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","All right, thank you guys for squeezing me in.","Ian M. Cook","Hi, Jason.","Jason English","Even got the name right.","Ian M. Cook","Yes.","Jason English","I\u2019ve got a couple of follow-up questions.","Ian M. Cook","Good question, Joe.","Jason English","There we go, there we go. All right, now it seems right. One on the promotional dynamics on P&G conference call they referenced expectation of 400 basis points of margin gains constant currency or even currency loaded out of Brazil and India. Hard to see how they get that without pulling some of the money to put in the market back out so are seeing the promotional intensity ease in those markets.","And then secondly gross margins I just want to walk through a little more on, more deeply on the answer to the question earlier, your signaling sort of neutral commodities maybe even a little bit of favorability with oil so does study hold line on price, continued productivity, you do the math on that even if you assume that transactional headwinds become more substantial than they were this quarter. Its still hard not to see a path at least 150 basis points of gross margin expansion. So what am I missing there?","Ian M. Cook","About 50 basis points. I think if you take India and the promotional intensity, actually India from doctor\u2019s point of view was never particularly intense in our categories, now if you look at India, you know Bina I talked about the market share, we're approaching 55 and the competitor in question has about a 0.7 shares. So and our business there continues to be quite strong. In terms of Brazil, I would say yes the promotional intensity has dropped off a little bit in Brazil, which is a good thing.","On gross margin Jason and I\u2019m sorry with the glib response, but the gross margin is really one of phasing because as I tried to explain earlier we think that gross margin expansion is very much going to build across the year, because although we see the headline lowering of commodity costs and certainly oil the work through of that from our inventory point of view to its effect on resins, bottles, et cetera will take some time to be seen.","And on the flip side the transaction impact, you know when ForEx goes to Guinea that hits you straight away whether it\u2019s the stuff you have to pay and your payables whether it\u2019s the dollar denominated raw materials that replace that what you are now having to pay for. So that\u2019s immediate and the win back on the gross margin take a little bit more time. So I do think we\u2019ll next year in a strengthened position gross margin wise, but it really is all to do with phasing. So I believe these were all the questions we have.","End of Q&A","Operator","Yes sir.","Ian M. Cook","Okay, so well thanks very much for catching up with us today and a special thank you all the Colgate folks that make it happen. Bye-bye.","Operator","And with that ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's call. We would like to thank you for your participation."],"6347":["Colgate-Palmolive Co.

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.","John Faucher","Thanks. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are, Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Henning Jakobsen Chief Financial Officer.","Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website.","Ian Cook","Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. ","As you read in our press release earlier on, for us the second quarter was indeed a challenging environment. As you know, rising commodity costs and volatile exchange rates put pressure on our P&L. And we are sometimes questioned if we're responding with an appropriate sense of urgency. ","I will say that our plans and programs for the balance of this year and 2019 all will develop with urgency in mind. As a company, we focused on being smarter and faster in everything we do and working to build agility throughout the company and of course with our partners to deliver results.","Today, I'll focus on three areas that I think exemplify the steps we are taking and then I will close with some specific comments about pricing.","The first area of focus is making sure we are connecting with consumers in traditional advertising vehicles and increasingly digital vehicles with engagement materials that are compelling and pervasive. And also making sure that our products are available for folk to purchase wherever they may shop. And as you all know; the retail landscape is changing dramatically, and we have made and continue to make changes to address that.","In our traditional channels, we've expanded our focus on formats where we feel we have incremental opportunities for growth, like this counters and pharmacy. We've also been aggressive in gaining access to new avenues of distribution to expand the availability of our products. ","Not surprisingly, a primary area of focus is e-commerce which while only mid-single digit percentage of our overall sales is a key growth driver and particularly important for some key businesses.","For example, in the past year, we've seen increased e-commerce availability for our Hill's Prescription Diet brand, which has enabled us to gain market share in the therapeutic segment while still ensuring that we maintained a strong relationship with the veterinary community. Through learning from EltaMD, we are expanding cross-border distribution into China for Colgate-Palmolive brands from other geographies all through e-commerce. ","And this provides us another platform to build out at e-commerce business in this crucial market on top of that B2B and B2C platforms. This channel flexibility is an especially important tool in our efforts to preimmunize our portfolio in China and grow market share.","As most of you know, we also recently took an equity stake in the direct-to-consumer company Hubble. Our collaboration with Hubble provides expertise in the digital channel and the platform for us to launch several incremental direct-to-consumer offerings, providing us with the ability to enter new segments.","We launched our connected toothbrush in Apple stores in the U.S. earlier this year. And this month, we are launching in Apple stores across Europe. And while we\u2019re just beginning this journey, a journey that Hubble will also be able to help us with, we think connected health is a significant long-term opportunity for us in this digital world as we look to integrate consumer behavior, the profession and other interested parties to improve health outcomes across the world, and you\u2019ll be hearing more from us on connected health in the future.","And finally, our recent acquisitions of EltaMD and PCA also give us and entre into thousands of spas, dermatologists and aestheticians across the U.S. with the potential for further product and geographic platform and a base on which to continue to build our ambitions in skin health.","The second area I want to discuss is about providing consumers with what they want to buy as we focus on their changing tastes and of course that speaks to accelerating innovation across our portfolio. And we have a broad strong array of planned innovation out of the balance of this year and next.","Let me talk today about one of our key innovation initiatives, Naturals, especially, but not only in toothpaste. Rest assured, we will be back to you on other important innovations when we are ready to make them public. ","On Naturals, we are making progress in our rollout across the world. We\u2019re now in 44 markets with the Naturals offering. And we expect to launch in an additional 32 markets by the end of the year. In toothpaste, we\u2019ve launched Naturals in every hub in Asia and broadly across Europe. We will launch in Latin America and Africa Eurasia through the balance of the year.","Importantly, these products sell at a meaningful premium in almost every market which will help deliver positive mix. Market shares are growing and repeat rates are strong, giving us the confidence to invest in generating more trial in the future.","Importantly, through our consumer innovation centers, which are based in the markets they serve, we\u2019re able to customize these products for local tastes. While Naturals is a global trend, each market has its own interpretation whether it\u2019s ingredient-based like Swarna Vedshakti in India or more of a specialized Naturals product like our Tom\u2019s of Maine in the U.S. and Canada.","And Naturals is not just about oral care, in personal care, we\u2019re seeing significant success in the free form sub-segment with Sanex Zero and Palmolive Nutritionist [ph] is a line of natural products across our personal care categories in Mexico and Brazil that is being rolled out across the rest of Latin America. And even in Pet Nutrition, we\u2019ve just launched our new Hill\u2019s Bioactive Recipe line, which is seeing a very strong response from some of our pet specialty partners in the U.S.","In Oral Care, we\u2019re also very focused on competing more effectively in the Premium Therapeutic segment of the category and have recently launched the elmex brand in two entirely new markets with the full line of products. This marks the first geographic expansion of this brand outside Europe. ","As I mentioned at the Bernstein conference, elmex has been launched as an e-commerce exclusive brand in China. And as we mentioned at the Deutsche Bank conference, we have also launched elmex into pharmacies in Brazil.","The third area of urgency, I will touch on briefly, is one I think, you know well, the streamlining of our structure and building new capabilities. We talked about the benefits of having before and we continue to utilize our health structure, the raw innovation out more quickly across the divisions while adjusting our cost structure accordingly. ","And we have also realigned our entire supply chain structure and streamline processes like our work approval and the creation of SKUs. ","Colgate business service centers, as you know, we have three serving the world while fully deployed are still rather new and we continue to believe there are future opportunities to build further capability while lowering costs, even more. ","Speaking with capabilities, we are rapidly building our revenue growth management tool, which will help us better partner with the trade to increase our average selling price with less reliance on pricing only coming from commodities and foreign exchange. ","Finally, as I said, I\u2019d like to talk from the subject of pricing this year, which is obviously a challenging area for our company and our industry right now. ","As you can tell by our gross margins performance and by the performance of many of our peer companies, raw material inflation is putting pressure on gross margins, accounting for a 320-basis point headwind to our gross margin in the second quarter of this year. ","It's important for us to offset this pressure with productivity and pricing as we do not want to reduce our brand support to offset these headwinds. ","Taking pricing as we know in the first half has been in the phase of a challenging, competitive promotion environment in many markets and works for, in several of the emerging markets low inflation. ","Obviously, the news in commodity pricing and foreign exchange will drive that underlying inflation. So, as we move into the second half, we have already put pricing in place in many markets around the world, particularly in emerging markets. But also, in some developed markets and at Hill's. ","Given the current promotional activity, we may not see competitors follow immediately and we may intent to remain rational. But, we also understand the need to protect our market shares. ","At this point, we're only expecting a modest sequential improvement in our pricing for the second half of the year, but along with our productivity programs which have started strongly, we believe this will allow us to improve our gross margin performance over the balance of the year. ","So, while the environment remains challenging, we\u2019re working with focus adjacently and real urgency to improve our results, consistent with our long-term strategies. We will continue to invest behind our brands, deliver consumer led innovation with compelling communication material and drive productivity up and down in the income statement. ","And now, I\u2019ll turn it back to John.","John Faucher","Thanks, Ian. ","We delivered net sales at 1.5% in Q2. Volume grew 1.5% including the negative 50 basis point impact versus our plans from the Brazilian trucker track. Our recently acquired professional skin care businesses, EltaMD and PCA skin contributed 100 basis points to volume growth. ","Pricing was flat year-over-year, as we found little incremental pricing in our categories and higher levels of promotions. The recent strengthening of the dollar negatively impacts our net sales and profits. And the result to one exchange which had been a positive impact for several quarters was neutral to net sales growth this quarter. ","At current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind to net sales growth in second half of the year. ","On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was down 90 basis points year-over-year. Within the impact of our global growth and efficiency program, it was down 140 basis points year-over-year. Our strong productivity savings led by our funding the growth initiatives were unable to completely offset the higher raw material cost Ian mentioned. ","On an absolute basis, advertisement investment was up slightly year-over-year in Q2. On a percentage of sales basis, advertising was even with Q1 and with the year ago period.","Excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program, the remainder of SG&A expense was down slightly year-over-year in Q2, absolutely and of the percentage of the sales. As an increase in freight and logistics was more than offset by a reduction in overhead expenses.","We estimate that for the balance of the year, the impact from higher freight and logistics costs will be similar to the impact we saw in Q2. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share of $0.73, were up 24% year-over-year in Q2. Excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program, and the benefit from a foreign tax matter, diluted earnings per share were up 7% at $0.77.","We estimate that the Brazilian trucker strike had a $0.01 negative impact on our earnings per share, versus our expectation at the time of the first quarter conference call, movements in foreign currency on a translational basis reduced our earnings per share in the second quarter by $0.02.","Now, we\u2019ll go to North America. Net sales in North America increased 8% in the quarter, with our recent professional skin care acquisition is contributing 5.5%. The North America division closer to third great quarter of organic sales growth with organic sales growth of 2% driven by a combination of volume and pricing growth. In the United States, our positive pricing was driven by our oral care business, led by toothpaste and manual tooth brushes.","Our market shares are flat or up in 8 of our 12 categories in the United States with strong gains in manual tooth brushes, liquid hand soap and cleaners. In Q2 we continue maintaining leadership in the market, although our share is down year-over-year as we have seen aggressive couponing in the category.","Latin America had a difficult Q2 as we saw a negative impact from the Brazilian trucker strike and weakness in Latin American currency versus the U.S. dollar in the quarter. Latin America net sales declined 7% in the quarter as volumes down 1%, pricing is down 0.5% and foreign exchange was negative 5.5%. We estimate that excluding the impact of the Brazilian trucker strike our volume would have been up low single digit to the division.","As we discussed at an investor conference in June, our market share performance in Latin America remains very strong. Year-to-date our value shares are up in six of nine categories in Latin America including all three oral care categories.","In Brazil, our shares are up year-to-date in five of six categories including the 70 basis points increase in toothpaste market share driven by Colgate Total visible health. Our market share performance was more mixed in Mexico, where we continue to see higher levels of promotional activity particularly in toothpaste, bar soap and dish soap.","The key issue in Latin America remains the lower levels of inflation in our categories, we are optimistic that the combination of raw material inflation in recent weakness in Latin American currencies versus the dollar should lead to a more favorable pricing environment.","Moving to Europe, net sales in Europe grew 6% in Q2 while organic sales declined 1%. Volume growth of 2.5% was offset by slightly negative 3.5%. Our oral care market shares continue to improve in Europe with our toothpaste share up year-to-date in the division particularly in France where our market share continues to rebound.","Moving to Asia Pacific, net sales in Asia Pacific were up 1.5% in the quarter with foreign exchange driving the growth as organic sales were flat. Oral care organic sales were positive offset by a decline in personal care. Asia Pacific pricing improves sequentially and was up year-over-year as we look to drive pricing growth to offset raw material costs inflation.","Our volume growth was impacted by our pricing actions, particularly in Greater China, where we expect that impact to moderate in the second half of the year. Our e-commerce business in China continues to grow at a rapid pace and gain market shares driven by our continued efforts to preimmunize our portfolio. ","We saw sales growth in India in the quarter with a combination of both pricing and volume growth behind the line of the Shakti Ayurvedic toothpaste and the benefit of easier comparison from the implementation of the goods and services tax in Q2.","The Africa Eurasia division reported net sales growth of 1% in Q2 as solid organic sales growth was partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange driven by weakness in the Russian ruble and the Turkish lira. ","Encouragingly, we saw volume growth of 2%, Our first quarter volume growth in the division since Q1 2015. With a volume growth across every hub. Pricing remain positive at plus 1%.","Last quarter, we mentioned the launch of our 12-gram sachet in Africa as part of our program to drive household penetration and per capita consumption in an emerging market. This quarter, we will add a 3-gram sachet in Sub-Saharan Africa. And we\u2019ll finish up with Hill's, ","Hill's delivered 3.5% net sales growth in the second quarter, volume growth of 1% was led by the United States while pricing was up 1%. On Science Diet, we\u2019ve seen market share gains in the specialty chain on the U.S. as we benefit from the movement of several specialty brands into mass gen.","Now, we\u2019ll turn to our updated outlook for 2018. As stated in our press release, we now expect net sales to increase low single-digits in 2018 as we incorporate the recent strengthening of the dollar. We still expect organic sales to be up low-single-digits with growth in the second half above that in the first half. ","Our second half plan does not include any recouped volumes from the Brazil trucker strike as it remains to be seen whether this volume will return in the second half or if the trade will look to keep inventories at this current lower level.","On a GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to be flat year-over-year in 2018. Excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program, we expect gross margin to be down modestly. The continued increase in raw material costs, including the impact of transaction of foreign exchange is the primary driver of our revised gross margin guidance. ","We continue to expect that advertising will be up year-over-year on an absolute basis and at the percentage of sales to the full year versus 2017 driven by a year-over-year increase in the second half.","Both on a GAAP basis and included in the impact of our global growth and efficiency program and the benefit from the foreign tax matter we still expect our tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27% in 2018 but we now view the bottom of the range as more likely. We expect the GAAP earnings per share to be up double-digits for the year excluding charges related to the global growth and efficiency program the one-time provisional charge resulting from U.S. tax reform in 2017 and the benefits from the foreign tax matter in 2018. We now expect earnings per share growth to be in the mid-single-digits again incorporating recent moves in foreign exchange.","And with that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Today\u2019s question and answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning.","Ian Cook","Morning, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","So, it\u2019s helpful to hear about the sense of urgency, but I think many of the points you made today on e-commerce innovation et cetera have been in place for a while. I guess it sounded like the biggest changes may be less pricing in the back half and originally expected but it doesn\u2019t feel like any of these points are radical changes that would necessarily result in a material improvement in market share organic sales growth. ","So, just at a very high level as you think about managing the business, have you thought about more drastic actions here to drive a reinvigoration perhaps lowering pricing in some areas not just moderate increases, but making bigger adjustments so investing a lot more behind the business in some of the areas you mentioned so Philips on those two specific areas would be helpful or any other areas perhaps that are missing that you might have pondered here?","Ian Cook","Yeah, I guess Dara I obviously don\u2019t convey urgency well. And yes, we have been talking about naturals as one of our innovation areas for a while I think what I was trying to demonstrate is that our urgency is not only to get established where it is and where it is it has been doing quite well as I said from a share point of view and from a repeat point of view importantly but we are accelerating the expansion of that line of products around the world and have organized ourselves so that our speed of implementation across all geography is now accelerated in other words more urgent.","And when I say things like a sharp and focus on discounters and pharmacy I mean a sharp and focused clearly these were environments we always did business in, but we have increased our strategic focus on them, because we think they can and will give us incremental growth. And of course, e-commerce, yes has been around for a long time.","But we are challenging ourselves on how we can really make sure that our e-commerce growth is faster than the growth of the category, so we build market share which implies new techniques hence Hubble, hence taking products in our portfolio and selling through marketplaces in China direct on e-commerce which were things we had not done before and indeed transfer elmex to pharmacy in Brazil is a new initiative with the urgency.","Now, behind all of that, we have adjusted a lot of our marketing programs. Let me use China perhaps as an example. You know that our market share in China on a value basis has been under pressure and the primary reason for that has been the explosive growth of the super-premium segment in that marketplace. So, what our volume share was holding up relatively well, our value share was penalized by a mix in our portfolio that didn't address the shape of the market.","Now, we've approached that in two ways. One way, we have talked about is the dare to love toothpaste that was created in five months to be introduced locally at a super-premium price. The second is the Naturals line of products that we have moved within China also at a super-premium price. ","And as I just mentioned today now, elmex coming in at a super-premium price. So direct to consumer through the important as you know, particularly in China e-commerce market. But we also in China through a very strong relaunch of the biggest business we have in China in toothpaste took a very bold price move supported by the question you're here to relaunch to tear up the pricing of our largest business in that marketplace.","That pricing is now established. It is at the shelf in retail, it changes the mix of our portfolio in China favorably towards more premiums and now we can drive not just the new innovation, but we can drive our largest business at a different price point which will give a top-line benefit of course, and a value market share benefit. So, all of those things have been put together within the last year and I think going forward change the shape of our portfolio in China.","Investment wise, we believe that the investment level, we have maintained for this year is strong and appropriate. We are flat at the half year-on-year maintaining at a good level and expect to be up for the balance of the year given our shape of innovation around the world. And as we continue to advance our plans, we will of course, decide which opportunities we believe at most potential and structure our investment behind them to make sure we get the maximum trial of the innovation we bring to market. We are generally seeing improved quality of communication vehicle both digitally and on the traditional media. So, we're very happy with the engagement vehicles, we have behind our business.","So, urgency, yes. Panic, no. Finding the right balance in conveying this is obviously difficult at this time, but we are being dramatic and reevaluating as the small example I gave all aspects of our business as we move forward here.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey guys. I think just pulling some of the threads together from your prepared remarks, you answered just now. To me overarching maybe longer-term maybe shorter-term question is if and when do you guys need to really do a rebase of margins and earnings. ","Your top-line continues to decelerate further, you don't need to compare market shares as best as we can tell down over 150 basis points again this quarter. Globally, it doesn't seem at least for the first half of this year, you found anything worth increasing the advertising spend on. ","And I guess cadences, but you don't feel like that's an increased advertising spend with those results. Gross margin at this sloppy [ph] level seems to be a struggle. I mean each of the reason that seems like are spending more overhead. And you mentioned surely great places you have to invest in right to be fair like skin and health like commerce, like naturals, like sharper focus on some of the brick and mortar retailers.","So, do you think that the company put off when it has been overearning, and these are rebates here. And perhaps if you know what does your new COO know well as think about our rebase as well?","Ian Cook","Well, thanks Ali. I must say the way you paint your question of course leads to a certain conclusion at a point in time. I trying to take them in turn. I think I answered the way we are thinking about innovation and growth going forward. ","And we feel confident that the innovation profile and portfolio we have going forward is compelling and we will invest behind it. The clearly in terms of gross margin right now the overwhelming impact and which came very sharply was both in commodity costs and in foreign exchange and the transaction impact of that on those commodity costs. ","And as I said, we are going to have to price in addition to our strong product inventory programs to see that gross margin recover. Much of the pricing is already announced and out there. And our ability to effectively price in the marketplace I think has been demonstrated already and will hold up in a more inflationary environment going forward.","And you know well in some parts of the world, we have had to react to intend promotional activity which we have not judged was rational, but we have reacted to and in the U.S. where our share has been under pressure, the share of course has popped back up as we have met the couponing pressure out there in the marketplace.","So, we think the spending is appropriate. We think the innovation is sound. And we think we selective M&A that we have made, and which of course remains an aspect of our strategy has been wise and have added value. And where we to do more we believe they will continue to add value as part of our portfolio. ","So, I would not say overearning, and I would say that we have been very focused on meeting these challenges, as they have risen, and we have been putting in place a very close strategy to meet them in the marketplace geography by geography around the world. ","Now, as to know, John [ph] became the president quite recently, as that, of course is part of the longstanding succession process that we would have been running perhaps with the last decade and like all of the senior leaders in Colgate now already has a strong voice in shaping our action for this year and in the - for 2019 and we will develop a plan, we believe will drive the topline with quality innovation and we will spend what we need to spend to get full return on that innovation in the best interest of the company and all stakeholders for the long-term.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Powers","Great Thank You. Good morning. To build on your pricing comments, I'm assuming one pocket of improvement will be the increase pricing that you expect to get in Latin America. I really want to understand the confidence there because the lack of pricing year-to-date in that market, the negative pricing in the quarter really stands out, not just against your history, but against what we\u2019ve heard from peers this season. I know the country and category mix is different, but Coke and Pepsi saw very robust pricing in Latin America for example, Kimberly Clark and Unilever, they\u2019ve arguably struggled more similar to you, realized price, but each of them at least called out sequential improvement Q1 to Q2, whereas your pricing seems going in another way. ","So, I guess, why do you think you\u2019ve been different, what gives you the confidence that things get better from here and I know you mention rising input cost in the worsening effects that those should help, but I guess my question there is that really a good thing, because I'm assuming in dollar terms your outlook is still lower. So, it\u2019s not pricing in real terms, as I see it, but maybe you can steer me a different direction there. So, just comments on Latin American pricing would be great. Thanks.","Ian Cook","In terms of pricing in Latin America, our brands so high have very good pricing power. You remember, the story last year, where we took very, very significant pricing in the first half which eased off in the back half of the year. So, we're up against a very strong product year comparison and the Latin American pricing was I mean essentially flat. ","That said, the foreign exchange pressure that is clearly there requires offsetting from a gross margin point of view and for the key Latin American markets pricing has already been announced and is making its way to the marketplace. ","So, I don\u2019t think we will need any resistance in taking the pricing in Latin America and we\u2019ve a very strong innovation plan. So, I think the year-on-year comparison is telling as a competitive activity, I recall mentioning on the last quarterly call in Mexico which we have now begun to meet to a certain extent. But that said, the pricing in Latin America is announced, is in the plan and it is moving to the marketplace.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Nik Modi with RBC.","Nik Modi","Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping, you can just provide some perspective around competition and specifically, what Glaxo is doing in the sensitive toothpaste market and then the local competitors in the emerging markets maybe you can call out areas where, there is some catch up be done whether it will be a local innovation or insights. And then on P&G in terms of what you\u2019re seeing from them in the marketplace right now, as we\u2019ve been hearing, they've been pretty aggressive, pretty broadly in oral care.","Ian Cook","Well, thanks Nick and first of all I think it would be fair to say as we categorize the first quarter the comparative environment from several quarters but certainly a couple of the companies you mentioned in your question have been quite elevated and I mentioned on the last quarter that in some cases we did not judge the activity to be sustainable or sensible and we did not mentioned in other cases to defend their market shares, we have reacted in order to meet that competitive activity and of course that has a predictably immediate effect on recovery in our market share. So, it is our objective to remain rational in this space and prefer to drive growth in the company through innovation and marketing rather than short term unsustainable promotional activity, but we will need what we have to meet.","In terms of the local brands the topics are the ones that we have discussed before largely China and India and - in China it would take all of the court and list all of the local brands in China there are a couple of important players. And we choose sponsors in China that I think I described in quite a bit of detail is the process of the premium segment which we had reacted to in the manner I outlined before and an acceleration of this naturals innovation done differently in China than in India. ","In India, I will say that the - product that we have introduced is growing quite nicely, we believe it is an adequate foil to the local brand there as I repeat as I mentioned is at a very strong level. And the market shares are moving up on an ongoing basis indeed in the modern side share is already up beyond 3 percentage points. so, we know the product will be affective in the market place and we will remain commitment to put advertising behind it.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey good morning folks. Thank you for allowing me to ask some questions.","Ian Cook","Hi, Jason. How do you feel?","Jason English","I guess I'm going to pivot off of sort of market competitive dynamics instead ask a question on margins, you resort a lot of cost pressure this quarter, the 320 basis points drag on GMs sharp uptick from the first quarter. Two questions on that. First, what drove such a meaningful acceleration in your weight of inflation from the first quarter to the second quarter, it doesn\u2019t really seem can grow kind of what we see in the spot market out there?","And second there is always this rather strange and not quite intuitive cadence or seasonality to your inflation rate where every year it seems to build through the fourth quarter drop off in the first quarter then once again ramp beyond. Should we expect that same ramp this year in other words should we expect inflation drag to get even bigger as we progress through the remainder of the year?","Ian Cook","Yeah, good questions Jason and obviously areas we spend a lot of time focusing on as we construct our activity for the balance of the year and thinking about it in terms of setting up 2019. ","It really is as simple as a very sharp run up in commodity costs both on the first quarter and on the second quarter of the previous year and the effect of the very sharp run up in the U.S. dollar and therefore foreign exchange negative for us in the transaction costs of those raw materials and based on things about effectively drive the gross margin. Now, let me just take a little bit longer to describe the composition of the second quarter.","So, if you go back to the second quarter of last year, our ad gross margin was at 16.7%. As you know, pricing gave nothing to gross margin in this quarter. Funding the growth up 170 basis points was a good start in line with last year as you know our curve tends to build across the year in terms of our funding the growth and then as I said in my prepared remarks and you just echoed the material prices hit us by 320, 10 bps of other and that takes you to the current year gross profit.","So, that\u2019s the swing and I can sort of dimensionalize it even understanding that oil takes time to work its way through the system. But if you take the price of Brent first quarter of last year, first quarter of this year it was up 23%. If you take the second quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year it was 47%, a 12% sequential increase quarter-on-quarter. And it's not similar pace of change that created the impact.","Now, our current plan effectively sees that level of impact continuing for the balance of the year. So, we don\u2019t expect that current stock rates and with what we know about commodity prices, that curve will continue to lie obviously our funding the growth curve does continue to rise as the year unfolds and as we said there will be a benefit from modest movements in pricing which allow us to build a plan that sees gross margin begin to recover across the back half of the year.","But I wouldn\u2019t\u2019 say there is a little predictable cycle which seem to come all the time usually for us the impact on gross margin is all about commodity price move and foreign exchange move and as you know the foreign exchange move is instant.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you, everyone. So, good morning. I have the\u2026","Ian Cook","Good morning Andrea.","Andrea Teixeira","Good morning. Clarification and also one specific question. So, no the clarification about just reinvesting the business and the funding for growth. So, have you delayed some of the discretionary spending given the headwinds and commodities and price increase which I believe it was more massive than anyone anticipated. ","So, I know you kept outlook of local market investments above sales, but I was just wondering if how we should think through the balance of the year and that could actually be a way for you to reach that mid-single-digit EPS guidance. And on the specific question, if you can elaborate on the competitive dynamics and destocking Mexico.","I understand that in most of the destocking is probably lapping that from the third quarter for last year and you said in the pricing announcements which I was a bit confused were implemented in the third quarter, so we\u2019re implemented in Mexico now, but you are facing a tough comp from last year when you also implemented a price increase that do not fix. So, what makes you confident that this time you're going to have the pricing seeking this time around. Thank you.","Ian Cook","Thanks, Andrea. Delayed discretionary spending and you've talked above the line. So, few things to say I guess, you probably saw that our SG&A was down year-on-year. And the SG&A was down notwithstanding as John said an impact of increased logistics costs which we carry on overhead.","That means that our overhead ratio was down meaningfully year-on-year. and that traces to the global growth and efficiency program that we have had which you're seeing as through the hobbling and business services and some discrete activity change the shape of our organization and reduce overhead cost.","So, in that sense, we have been very focused and quite urgent about making sure we get the benefit of that to run through overhead and run through the SG&A. Therefore, in terms of discretionary, yes, we are being very cautious on discretionary income, discretionary spend.","In terms of the above line, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this idea of revenue growth management which includes everything from taking risk price increase on the face of the invoice to negotiating ultimate promotional activity in partnership with the retailers in a way that is more efficient and yet as productive for both of us.","So that's that is yes, an area of focus for us, but nothing unusual. I mean to this point about are we not doing things that we think are important to do for the ongoing development of the company absolutely not. So, where we think it's appropriate to invest we are.","I would say on Mexico, that the destocking will be behind this at the end of this quarter. The issue in Mexico had more to do with stepped up competitive activity, which we did not need instantly, because we didn't think it was rationale but to some extent we have now adjusted our plans to meet. ","And the pricing in Mexico is announced that moving to the marketplace as we work our way through the third quarter. In the context of foreign exchange, it is quite traceable to cost impact but because of the transaction impact. And we feel that compared to the peak increases of the first quarter and second quarter last year overall as a lesser level. And we think we'll stick in the marketplace given the inflationary pressures now resurging across Latin America including Mexico.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. Good morning.","Ian Cook","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","Good morning. I just had a quick question on pricing. You mentioned you've already put it in place in several markets. So curious to hear what you're seeing so far in terms of the impact on your volumes or possible downtrading within your categories especially relative to past increases.","And then there has been a lot of discussion about stepped up private label penetration from some of your peers. So just curious to hear how much of a risk do you think there might be from retailers stepping up investments in private label across your categories if any. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yeah, in many cases Bonnie with the new pricing, they are announced and moving to the shelf. So, I don't yet have historical data to tell you about the impact on volume. I will make the point as I said in my prepared remarks that the pricing we are taking in the second half of the year of meaningful to the structure of our plan is not significant in the absolute.","Our experience in Latin America is that there is usually a short-term volume impact as much in the retail equation as with the consumer. And I don't see why this time would be any different.","If we turn to private label pleasingly given the nature of our categories at least all pets and personal care given the emotional engagement, those categories have with consumers given that, particularly with a toothpaste, if you're going to put something in your mouth or your kid's mouth, if you want to trust that brand. ","We have seen private label development around the world, probably most developed in Europe, but still low single-digits negligible in the United States, and in the emerging markets almost a nonexistent because our consumers have serious doubts about quality of certain products in those marketplaces. So, we're very attentive to it. We track it all the time. But so far, given the emotional connection with the product category and our brand in that category. It has not been a significant factor.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good morning.","Ian Cook","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","Good morning. First, a cleanup question on category growth rates. Can you just provide the EM, DM and overall category growth rates relative to the half a point of organic sales growth in the quarter? ","And then the larger question is just sort of your level of confidence on this strategy. And specifically, the three key factors you touched on Ian to start the call and your level of visibility and sort of the tangible glide path in terms of when Colgate can return to the 3% to 5% organic sales growth. Do you feel comfortable with the low-end of that range looking to the back half of this year?","Is that something you feel comfortable looking at the next year? So, any commentary there would be helpful and then just one last piece and if just to summarize the earlier response, because I think it's important. It sounds like you believe, you can get back to improve levels of growth with current investment level. So that is in the absence of the, sort of proverbial earnings rebases. I just wanted to make sure, I heard that right. Because I think it's important. So, thank you for those.","Ian Cook","Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Kevin. Well, if I look at the category growth rates, I would say that the U.S. continues to grow around 2%, which is, well your full year compare to some not so distant history. ","The European environment continues to be very tempted, overall between zero to one. Latin America had slowed, because of that lower inflation. So, the rates which have been the mid-single-digits sell off to low-single-digits. ","We expect those to come back, the volume is there we expect those to come back with the pricing in the second half, which we expect to see across the markets. And Asia, Africa, you would say in the mid-single-digit perhaps 4% there. So those are the categories.","Now, in terms of the strategy and what I mentioned this morning. I mentioned some stuff this morning. The stuff I mentioned this morning were areas that we wanted to emphasize on this call. Those three areas don't embody, the company's strategy overall. ","And so, we revisit this all the time and you can rest assured that one of the key areas of revisiting has been and we'll continue to be on a regular basis what we are doing to accelerate growth. And that involves all of the senior leadership in the company.","And every time we do it that leads with the sense of urgency that we have that leads to specific actions that we start to deploy immediately. And I think to this point even though we have made quite a lot of changes within the confines of the overall strategy we have. We are confident and driving towards returning to that 3% to 5% growth rate. ","I think that for this year, we guided the organic growth for a balance of the year and the full year low-single digits. That will see a step up from the first quarter, but I would not state that the organic growth will be 3% for the third quarter. I think we will be looking at our 2019 plan to return solidly there for that year with the innovation we see in the plans that we will put behind the business.","Now in terms of that improved growth. That improved growth is the strategy we are deploying. Increased investment will be there in the second half of this year. And as I said earlier, we will do what is right to support the growth ambitions we have in 2019 consistent with that strategy reflecting the quality of innovation and marketing programs we believe we have. ","And with the balance of responsibility to all stakeholders in the company in terms of what the shape of that ultimately looks like. But you're right I was not implying that this company is actively thinking of a so called rebase.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Strikhalo [ph] with UBS.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good afternoon. Quick question on to dig into Jason English's question on the gross margin piece a little bit more. Ian how should we think about the down modestly for the year given this trajectory of commodities. Just thinking about the third and fourth quarter and rising inflation it feels like it 50 basis points down year-over-year a modest range. And can you kind of unpack how much transactional was await to the gross margin degradation in 2Q. Thank you.","Ian Cook","Yeah, so to answer the second point. Transaction cost in the second quarter was about 50 basis points of that 320. And I think I mentioned in response to an earlier question that the overall impact of material costs both commodity and transaction we expect to run at around the same level as the second quarter of this year. ","So, we framed - what we framed purposefully. What that requires with the run-down I gave earlier on the second quarter and the additional contribution of pricing in the third and fourth, it assumes a build back an increase of gross margin across the second half of the year. And frankly I would modestly at modestly. And I guess I would leave it there?","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Thanks. Wanted to focus more on the ... ","Ian Cook ","Olivia sorry., I'm not picking you very clearly.","Olivia Tong","Can you hear me now?","Ian Cook","Yeah, I can, yes.","Olivia Tong","Well, perfect.","Ian Cook","Yeah, can you hear me? It sounds like an ad.","Olivia Tong","I want to focus a little bit on the non-Colgate oral care brands as you start putting a little bit more focus on that part of the portfolio elmex for example. How does your approach changed because the product is different, some of the retailers are different but is the customer different and how do you change your marketing strategies accordingly and do your existing retailers that carry the Colgate brand would they be interested in that as well and does the potentially presents an opportunity for you?","Ian Cook","Well, I think you capture a very important point Olivia. We have since the years of acquisition actually expanded elmex to several important European markets given its premium nature we have usually saw season in pharmacy because that is part of the business sold of the development of the brand. ","And then ultimately move into broader retailer distribution without damaging the pricing strategy integrity called the business and I would say based on our European experience that our retailer partners be the pharmacy or broader market place are very attracted by an additional brand in the Colgate portfolio knowing the quality of that product alongside Colgate and in fact it\u2019s targeted at different uses, so it\u2019s incremental for us and incremental for them.","Now in the markets I mentioned we are starting in China direct to consumer from an e-commerce point of view and in Brazil to pharmacy which is a very important category of retailer segment for high end therapeutic products and that\u2019s where we will start always with elmex. But I think if the European experience plays out the same way in these markets you put indeed expect overtime us to broaden the aperture of sales for elmex and I think we would get the same support and positive result that we have seen in Europe.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Caroline Levy [ph] with Macquarie.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Good afternoon. I know it\u2019s run very longer just very quickly inventory destocking on a global basis Ian could you just touch on whether you think this remains a significant risk that as retailers margins are under pressure we\u2019re really going to see this wave hit the U.S. and other markets as well more substantially do you think it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be talking about a lot of in the next few years and if there are any markets where it has had a substantial impact already?","Ian Cook","Yeah, so we have talked before about inventory destocking impacts in various market places I guess most especially in Mexico and China and there is always going to be at the edges a rebalancing of inventory as the mix of retail environments shift particularly where e-commerce is a factor. ","But I would say going forward, this is likely to be a more of an emerging market issue why, because another distribution in those markets is indirect distribution and you are reaching customers through distributors and wholesalers and when they get shy of events they see in the market place they tend to stop buying in the moment and wait until they see signs or they recovery in whatever trade sector they service.","But to your implication that could we see this coming to North America I think when we track our inventory levels with our major customers in North America honestly, we have seen a general decline in inventory levels held by the more sophisticated customers down into the most single lease and if you went back a decade it would have been double-digit weeks. And I think with all of the technology available to us today with the simplification of portfolios and efficiency in supply chain some of the levels we now add in the U.S. with the most sophisticated customers, I would say a baseline operating level. ","So, a significant piece of volatility in that regard, I think is unlikely, I think, both parties will be working to find efficiency, but, I think, it will be a continual gradual progress.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thank you. Ian, I was just curious about them the longer-range things that you mentioned. Because I think the dynamics and the things you\u2019re doing in the short-term and medium-term to improve results, whether its pricing or broadening distribution, e-commerce. These will just, we\u2019ll have to see play out, but I was really intrigue by both the mention of committed health and also still the professional skin acquisition, as you know it is not news today. ","It's different for I think Colgate to be exploring two vectors that are arguably really quite new, right and it would be let alone one. But to be looking into kind of two areas that are a bit, a step away from the core. ","So, can you just talk about that, I mean, I guess capabilities from a corporate standpoint to be exploring new avenues and really how aggressively you're going to go after these things, would be one. ","And then two, what you read into or not at all about your views on kind of the growth potential of the core business. There is different perspective on what the growth can look like with what your current footprint outside of these two areas that you mentioned?","Ian Cook","Okay, Lauren, Thank you. The answer of those connected health and skin traced to strategy and we think that they are important place for the future. From a personnel cap point of view, we have laid our territory, where we want to establish and build a position in skin health, true skin health. And that requires determologist, requires a portfolio that the professionals in that space will recommend and if there is opportunity to build organically with the two assets we have today and as I implied earlier, it is also a nice platform upon which we can build, should we say choose other assets externally as that would shift that generalized strategy of skin health. ","Interestingly, some of the thinking we have on our base business around recommendation and endorsement, translating and apply very, very well. We obviously learned a new areas of skin applications and skin science which we can trickle down to our base businesses like Sanex and Palmolive, but we can also now move up in terms of clinically demonstrable healthcare delivery. ","We think that\u2019s a good space, that we think that with population trends in the world is a long-term growth space with pricing advantage and margin advantage for the long-term and once people used these products like the suntan lotion from Elta for a particular skin condition to protect them from the sun, I hate to use the word for skin care product, but little over stick ability, because people will stay with the product that gives them the benefit they are looking for. ","And the connected brush, what we see and have seen for a while is that the combination of behavior and data can be a powerful way to build the businesses going forward. And, if you think about where data is going, the ubiquity of it, the miniaturization of it. The depths of what it can provide as AI starts to play a role. ","The toothbrush is a wonderful vehicle to be an informed advisor to a person using that product. And never mind, if you can translate that same benefit in emerging parts of the word to a manual offering for example. And so, we think, this is the step into the future. We think it will take time to build. We think the capability we can bring from an information point of view to consumer will grow. We think Apple is a terrific partner in terms of the technical reputation that it brings to the buying consumers and so happens with the colors are in the [indiscernible] colors which is good red and white. So, a scenario we are committed to and we see as building.","I think in terms of the core business, we continue to believe there is vitality in the categories in the categories in which we do business. one of the structural changes we have embarked upon which revenue growth management talk to the specific action in China talked to in terms of clearing up the business, recent there is rich opportunity to take our big businesses and in addition to the new product innovation bring meaningfully signed typically supported innovation to our bigger businesses with the corresponding value increase both perceived and asked to a consumer and with that can grow the top-line of our base sustainably into the future.","So, there is all the questions we have today, I thank everybody for participating on the call and we look forward to catching up with you later in the year. Bye-bye.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s conference, thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.

Today's call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgate.com. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Bina Thompson. Please go ahead.","Bina H. Thompson","Thank you, Cameron. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, and these statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements. For information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We will discuss organic sales growth, excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. We will also discuss gross profit, gross profit margin, SG&A, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, excluding the impact of certain items described in the press release. And a full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted in the For Investors section of our website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","We're pleased with our solid fourth quarter results. Our momentum is excellent in many areas of the world, both developed and developing, and we think we are well-positioned to deliver stronger results in 2013. On a global basis, our market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, bar soaps, body wash, deodorants and fabric conditioners. And as you will hear as I review the divisions, innovation has played an important role in increasing market shares, and we have a very robust new product pipeline as we enter this year to help to continue this growth.","As Ian said in the press release, we're encouraged that we achieved our objectives in 2012 in the face of currency, competitive and macroeconomic challenges around the world. For the full year, our organic sales accelerated in almost every division from full year 2011. The exception was Latin America, which even so delivered another year of double-digit organic sales growth despite significant challenges in Venezuela in the fourth quarter. In particular, a labor slowdown in our factory, coupled with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, negatively impacted organic sales and gross margin in the fourth quarter. In fact, worldwide organic sales growth in the fourth quarter would have been almost 1.5 points higher, excluding the Venezuelan results, and gross margin worldwide would have been 50 basis points higher.","As Ian also mentioned, our global growth and efficiency program is off to a good start. And as we told you on our last call, we expect after-tax charges this year between $185 million and $220 million, with after-tax savings in the range of $30 million to $40 million. And consistent with what you would expect, we anticipate realizing these savings later in the year. Of course, our ongoing Funding the Growth savings program is continuing to deliver considerable savings as well to allow us to invest behind our full range of new products. In 2012, the program added 2 full points to gross margin line, which helped offset increases in raw material costs. And it provided savings at the SG&A line as well, and we expect this to continue into 2013. From a cash perspective, we had another good year, continuing to pay increased dividends and buying back stocks to deliver more value to our shareholders.","So let's turn to the fourth quarter division results, starting with North America. We're very pleased with the continued momentum in our North American business. Our organic sales growth of almost 4% is very strong for a developed market. And pleasingly, our categories are growing, and we are growing ahead of them. On a year-to-date basis, our market shares are up in 7 categories, even with the year-ago period in 1 and down in 3. Importantly, our year-to-date market shares are up across oral care, fueled by a continued stream of innovative products. In fact, our year-to-date increase in toothpaste share of 1 full point is the largest in 10 years. Our new product pipeline is full, and we are excited about some of the new products launching this quarter.","In toothpaste, 1 new product is Colgate Total Zx Pro-Shield Plus Sensitivity, which has a triple active formula that provides multi-benefit protection in addition to maximum sensitivity relief. Consumer research shows that almost 50% of sensitivity sufferers do not treat their pain with sensitive toothpaste because the price is too high or their product does not have all the benefits the consumer is looking for. Colgate Total Zx helps protect against sensitivity, helps prevent cavities, fortifies enamel and fights plaque and germs.","Second new toothpaste is Colgate Optic White Dual Action, formulated with the same level of effective hydrogen peroxide as Colgate Optic White toothpaste, plus the addition of sodium acid pyrophosphate to whiten and shine. The extensive integrated marketing launch campaign will incorporate new claims, whitens and shines, whitens more than 3 shades and results start in 1 week.","An exciting new toothbrush launching this quarter is Colgate 360\u00b0 Total Advanced Floss Tip. This superpremium priced toothbrush has tapered bristles for a deeper reach below the gum line, resulting in a superior yet gentle clean.","In addition to oral care, we have a full new product lineup in both personal and household care. And one interesting example is our new line of antibacterial hand soap under the Softsoap brand, which is, as you know, the leading liquid hand soap in the U.S. Consumers, particularly during flu season, are very concerned about hand washing, and this new antibacterial soap with moisturizers leaves hands feeling soft and has an active ingredient, which effectively helps eliminate bacteria. So we're encouraged as we enter 2013 that our North American business is off to a good start.","Turning then to Europe\/South Pacific. As with North America, our European results were solid, particularly in light of the very difficult macroeconomic conditions in that part of the world. Organic sales increased and were slightly ahead of overall category growth. And year-to-date, our market shares are up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouth rinse, body wash, deodorants and fabric conditioners.","New product activity is the key to growing in these highly developed markets, slow-growing markets, and we have a full slate for the first quarter and beyond. And here are just a few examples. Colgate Total Pro Interdental, a toothpaste which continuously fights plaque even between teeth for a healthier mouth; Colgate Plax Complete Care and Advanced and Complete Mouthwash for a healthy mouth with 12 benefits in 1, including 12-hour antibacterial protection, enamel strengthening and the ability to kill germs up to 99%.","We are revitalizing both our elmex and Meridol toothpastes with new, modernized packaging design with specs and claims. You may recall, these 2 brands were part of the GABA acquisition and have especially strong shares in the Germanic countries. In this quarter, we will be expanding both brands into the mass market in both France and Belgium. Heretofore, they have only been sold in the pharmacy channel in those markets.","In personal care, we are relaunching our experiential Palmolive body wash ranges with new design, new variants and a new advertising campaign: unforgettable shower experiences for your body and mind.","Our Sanex deodorants are being launched under the new bio response concept with a new modern design and new variants accompanied by a new claim, fights odor-causing bacteria while respecting the skin's natural bacteria flora. Sanex is also introducing Sanex Zero kids body wash, with a mild formula with fewer chemical ingredients to keep your child's skin healthy. This new product has been approved by pediatricians. So a lot of activity across the region, which bodes well for 2013.","Turning then to Latin America. As I discussed earlier in my commentary, difficult conditions in Venezuela affected this division. Business in our other subsidiaries is very good, and year-to-date market shares are up across the region in toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash, bar soaps, dishwashing liquids and fabric softeners. And deodorants are at last year's levels. And as elsewhere, new products have been critical to our success in this region.","In Brazil, where we have our highest toothpaste market share in the last 15 years, 71.4% year-to-date, both Colgate Luminous White and Colgate Total Professional Gum Health have contributed to these good results. In fact, in the month of December, Colgate Luminous White alone achieved an 8.3% share. In Mexico, our year-to-date toothpaste market share is 81.8%.","In toothbrushes, our year-to-date share across the region is up almost 2 full points. In Brazil, we maintained our market-leading position of over 30%, and in Mexico, we continue to close the gap with our nearest competitor. Three years ago, the gap was almost 8 points, and in the most recent period, it's narrowed to 1.5 points. Year-to-date, our share is at 42.3%, up 80 basis points year-over-year and was at 43.4% in the most recent period. In mouthwash, new products across the region such as Colgate Luminous White and the relaunch of Colgate Plax have allowed us to narrow the gap with our nearest competitor from 29.3 points in 2007 to just 3.4 points in 2012 on a year-to-date basis. And we're excited about more innovation coming in the first quarter. We're relaunching our Colgate Total Pro products with a new campaign which emphasizes the 12-hour antibacterial protection for a healthy mouth.","Under the Mennen Speed Stick brand, we're launching Mennen Speed Stick neutral power with all the protective benefits that the brand is known for but less fragrance that will not interfere with colognes or aftershave. Under the Protex brand, we have driven our bar soap shares for the variant called Deep Clean, which deeply cleans sensitive skin to remove dirt and bacteria that can cause pimples. We're now introducing a shower gel with the same positioning. And as you know, Fabuloso was our market-leading, highly fragrant, all-purpose cleaner. We're launching a new fragrance, Chamomile Explosion, capitalizing on the consumer's belief that chamomile is a natural ingredient to be used to care for the family. These are just a few examples of what is to come throughout the year in Latin America, and you'll hear more about innovation as we go forward.","Turning then to Greater Asia\/Africa. Strong results continued in the fourth quarter to finish off an excellent year for this region of the world. As referenced in the press release, volume growth was led by some of our major subsidiaries, including Russia, India and China. Despite concerns over a slowing economy in China, our categories there are exhibiting good growth, and we've benefited from that. Our toothpaste market share there is up 120 basis points year-over-year to 33.5%, consolidating our #1 position in the market. We've had particular success with new products in the premium segment of the business.","Our mouthwash shares are up 240 basis points year-to-date to over 34% of the market, fueled by the success of Colgate Optic White mouthwash launched in this quarter. In India, our year-to-date toothpaste market share reached yet another record, up 230 basis points to 53%. And as with China, premiumization is driving our success with higher-priced products such as Colgate Total, Colgate Max Fresh and Colgate Sensitive. Our Indian toothbrush share is up 220 points to 39.5% on a year-to-date basis, with the latest reading at 40.9%. Our leading market share is now 1,480 basis points ahead of our nearest competitor from 880 basis points at the start of the year. In Russia, our toothpaste share increased as well, up 50 basis points on a year-to-date basis. And as elsewhere around the world, we will continue our launch of new products in 2013.","Launching in China is 360\u00b0 Pro Gum Health toothpaste. Gum problems are the #1 oral condition suffered by Chinese, and 360\u00b0 is our biggest premium sub-brand in the China portfolio. Formulated to relieve gum problems in just 3 weeks, this China relevant new product will be supported by a complete integrated marketing campaign.","And in the toothbrush category, tapered bristles are the fastest-growing segment in Asia. This quarter, we will be expanding our Slim Soft equity with the launch of Slim Soft Charcoal, which deliveries a deep dental clean with a charcoal bristle. So we think we're well-poised in this part of the world as we enter 2013.","And Hill's. As referenced in the press release, Hill's launched a number of new products in 2012. As we look to 2013, the new product pipeline is full, and we're very excited about these new items.","As some of you may have heard already, we are in the process of relaunching our Science Diet line. The objective is to modernize and enhance the shopping experience with improved packaging and placements and to improve the perceived signs of quality. Formulation will be of 100% natural ingredients with quality animal protein first and no byproduct, and we'll have significant taste improvements.","Our new integrated marketing campaign, \"What Vets Feed Their Pets\" has already gained strong customer support. As part of the plan, we've added more nutritional consultants and direct store coverage with enhanced display plans. And in addition, we'll have materials and samples in the vet clinic.","Secondly, we are repositioning Ideal Balance as an authentic natural proposition. We will expand into all key segments, dry, wet and treat, and remove wheat and soy from all products. And as with the Science Diet relaunch, we've added nutritional consultants and increased direct store coverage.","In the Prescription Diet line, we are now shipping prescription diet metabolic in the U.S., Canada and Japan. Other regions will follow in the second quarter, and we expect to complete a full rollout by the end of this year.","Obesity in both dogs and cats is one of the biggest disease conditions globally. Prescription Diet metabolic is the first weight management food which -- with proven real-world results, as well as being the first offering for easy, flexible weight loss success without deprivation. In early trials, 88% of dogs and cats lost weight in 2 months at home. This new product has been very well-received by veterinarians, many of whom are recommending it to their clients.","So in summary, for 2013, we're looking forward to a strong year of investment and volume growth and continued acceleration in our market shares worldwide. Our leadership team is committed to winning on the ground with superior execution behind an ever-increasing flow of innovative new products. We have a full pipeline of new products, spanning all price points to enable us to succeed in developed and emerging markets alike. And we look forward to sharing our results as we go through the year.","That's the end of my prepared remarks. Now Cameron, if we could open it up for questions, that will be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian at Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Ian, it sounds like Venezuela clearly had some massive sales and profit declines in the quarter given the impact you quantified on the corporate results. Can you give us more detail on exactly what's occurring there, how long you think those issues will linger? And then also separately, on the same subject, can you discuss your ability to hit your double-digit EPS growth guidance in 2013 if there is a devaluation in Venezuela and how managing through that situation might be different than past devaluations just given the price controls in place?","Ian M. Cook","Clearly, questions on Venezuela, given what we have already said, are entirely appropriate, and I will answer it in a moment. But I do want to underscore what Bina said when you think about our company in total. We delivered at the low end of our organic sales for the year, 6%. We delivered 8% dollar EPS growth year-on-year, absorbing a 6% headwind from foreign exchange, which means that we delivered our currency neutral earnings per share growth. And we expanded our gross margin at the low end of our expectations given Venezuela. And more importantly, we believe with strategic initiatives that we have been deploying for several years continue to be effective. We have a global growth and efficiency program now in place behind a very strong innovation stream to continue to grow our business going forward. But yes, indeed, in the fourth quarter, after our last call and based on the uncertainty between elections and inauguration, we did see a slowdown in our Venezuelan business, as you say, partly due to uncertainty at retail level and partly due to the slowdown in our factory. As Bina said, our global organic sales would have been up 150 basis points if it were not for that. Indeed, our emerging market sales would have been up some 300 points from the 6% you saw in the results. But I can tell you that after considerable dialogue and collaboration with our workforce, with support from local government ministries, we enter this year with our operations in Venezuela basically back to historical levels, and our top line progress has bounced back to the levels pre the event and consistent with our thinking about Venezuela for this year. Now as we discussed on the last call, when I said that a significant devaluation in Venezuela, along with price controls would weigh heavily on our results, we were quite straightforward in our release in saying that the double digit in dollar terms of guidance was absent a macroeconomic devaluation in Venezuela. And that continues to be our view. Now clearly, there are many different scenarios there, and in some ways, it's not just the management of the devaluation, which, as I have said before, would take just over $0.5 billion of monetary assets there and reduce them by whatever the devaluation level is. But the effect is potentially larger in terms of what does happen in pricing and what may happen in terms of social or other macroeconomic actions. And our view on that, as it was the last time, and we have many years in Latin America and other parts of the world experiencing these kinds of things, is that we would, as we were before, be very prompt and fulsome in becoming public in terms of how we would react to the devaluation and whatever comes with it, should that time come. Now while that is out there, you know well that in terms of the way our business is being managed in Venezuela, we have made the business much more simple. We are focusing on our SKUs. We are making cash decisions wisely. So we are managing responsibly, understanding that we are in businesses and geographies for the long term. So that would be, I think, a confidence in the overall company, I hope confidence in our ability to manage Venezuela, a statement that what we went through in the fourth quarter has corrected in January. And that we will deal with any macroeconomic event in Venezuela swiftly and advise people accordingly.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Nik Modi with UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Ian, if you could just kind of walk us through -- as the year unfolded in 2012 and as you kind of look into 2013, how is the competitive environment involved? I mean, has it gotten much more intense in a sense that more promotions, maybe some of the advertising money is going into promotions? And are you seeing it kind of accelerate here as a lot of your global competitors have been obviously restructuring and have some more money to play with, plus commodity cost has been about a lot tamer? Just curious on your view. And as you think about the back half of the year, where do you think that's headed, as many companies have gross margin upside to kind of reinvest?","Ian M. Cook","Well, I think, Nik, we have been sort of generally clear that despite or regardless of what many people have been saying about the level of competitive activity, we have seen it and we continue to see it, and we continue to plan that it will be at the levels that we have seen for the last little while. And we, too, will see expansion of our gross margin. We see our material costs up about the same level as they were this year, which is around 1%. We still expect to see our gross margin expand next year within the 50 to 100 basis points level given our investment in the formulas at Hill's. And so that's what we think we will see in the ongoing operating costs from Venezuela. And we think we have -- from an advertising point of view, we're well-structured our plan. It is a plan that continues to confirm a 6% to 7% organic growth level. It continues to see the Hill's business with all of the terrific product activity behind it, turned volume positive, continues to see our advertising grow. And I would make a comment about advertising. As we have said for some time, many of us in going to school came out with a view that advertising was good and trade spending was bad. And I think we have been trying to say that in many ways, given the analytic tools available to us, the way one can execute at the retail level these days, a wise trade investment can be a terrific way of building a brand, engaging with a shopper at retail and getting them to that final purchasing decision on top of the traditional advertising and the social media and the other techniques that we use. So these things are all in a balance, and we build our plans accordingly. But essentially, the plan we have for 2013 assumes the continuation of competitive activity, adequately funds our innovation and we believe has the right balance between traditional advertising spending and that which we would execute and be able to measure the return on investment on -- at the retail level.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Could you talk about Hill's specifically? And the margin that you generate there has, for a long time, been so good and sort of above average for the company. And can you talk about kind of going forward what you expect from Hill's profit margin? With all the new product activity and the volume declines you've seen, is that not an area where maybe investment spending should go up? Or how much will Hill's itself benefit from some of your restructuring?","Ian M. Cook","Well, I think, Wendy, as we think about Hill's, frankly, we're quite excited. We think -- from an innovation point of view, we think we've got it right. We think we have been able to improve the relevance of our Ideal Balance product while not losing the strength of the Hill's scientific credentials. We think we've made a major upgrade in our Science Diet business for the U.S. We have packaging, we know works. We have advertising, we know works. We have clear selling communications for our consultants at retail to bring back consumers to the business, and we have invested in those consultants. And we have had very, very good collaboration with the PETCOs and the PetSmarts of this world in bringing these plans to the consumer. So by all means, it is an investment year for Hill's. And we are investing in advertising to convey the benefits of the products that will be coming to the marketplace, are coming to the marketplace now. And we believe we will see the volume of that business return into positive territory as we move across the year. And yes, we have made an investment in upgrading the formula in Hill's. Having said that, we are going to expand the gross margin of the company within our 50- to 100-basis-point range. And in the life of the plan that we have, we rebuild that gross margin investment on the Hill's business. So we're comfortable with where we are putting the investment funds, and we look forward to reporting the progress of the Hill's business across 2013.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo Securities.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just was wondering if you could describe how you're responding to the competition in Brazil, and maybe if you could let us know what category growth rates are in that country for oral care. And is net  the competition positive or negative for the category overall?","Ian M. Cook","Okay, Joe. Well, let me draw a little bit of a whirlwind tour, and I'll come back to Brazil. Take the big high-growth markets that everybody talks to, China, our share is approaching 34%. The competitor is below 19%, down over 3 share points year-on-year. Russia, our share is over 32%, and the competitive share has now drifted below 15%, continuing a 4-year downward progression.","Our share in Mexico, as Bina said, is about 82%. And the competitive share towards the end of the year is around 13%. And if we come now to Brazil to your point, our share is, as Bina said, the highest we have seen in 15 years. And the competitive share for the year is about 6%, and change in the fourth quarter based on Nielsen data is around 7%. We have seen category growth in Brazil. We have seen our market share growth in Brazil. And the growth rate in Brazil is pretty much at the same as it has been in all of our emerging markets, which is high single digits, low double digits. We have said many times that we believe the basis for growth in categories is innovation. And in Brazil, as you may know from our various comments on the subject, whether it was Sensitive Pro-Relief, whether it was Luminous and the other innovations we have planned, we are constantly looking to engage with the consumer through innovation rather than just price promotion. And we see that and plan for that continuing in Brazil and the other emerging markets around the world in 2013.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I just want to follow up in your comments on the relative value of trade promotion versus advertising, because advertising for us in terms of the information we get, it's obviously a fairly blunt instrument. One of the things that the investment community sort of focuses on advertising for is it can tend to be more of a leverageable expense, while trade promotion we associate is a little bit more variable in terms of having to put the trade promotion out there for the units that you get. So can you talk with us a little bit about sort of SG&A leverage in that context? And then the second question I have was just sort of a housekeeping thing which is, can you talk a little bit about the interest income line, which went from negative to positive in the quarter, and what happened there?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Well, let me talk about it holistically. I think from the trade spending point of view, I guess what it comes down to is the programming. I mean, if you looked at our advertising in the fourth quarter on a ratio basis, it was at the level -- it was down about 10 basis points as we said in the release. But overall, our commercial investment was up a multiple of that. And when we think about trade promotion, there are 2 aspects to it. One is pure price and the other is consumer spend, which can include price but it can include activity at the retail level. And think these days about anyone's shopping experience, particularly in the developed world, one gets messaging from the traditional media, engagement from social media and other \"word of mouth type\" messaging. And then what one encounters at retail, which is substantially different today than it was even 5 years ago. And we have talked from our side about Colgate business planning, about better understanding of pricing as a competence in our company and the use of analytics. And these things all tied together when you come to retail. We were able today to construct programs that may be built around price but are much broader than that at the retail level and are, as we call them, integrated communications that go from a television ad to the activity that consumers see at retail or the coupons that they might receive directly or indirectly. You can do good analytics on it. It's very targeted. And you can collaborate with retailers against it, and you can track to make sure that it is not damaging brand health but rather an additional component that is strengthening brand health. So that's how we think about it, and that's really how we deploy our numbers. We don't tend to think of it from a leverage point of view. We tend to build even our traditional advertising plans and the promotional plans, which go to retail from the ground up against the programming we have rather than a leverageable ratio going forward. Now as to your question on interest expense, this actually has been a very conscious and focal area for us this year and will continue into 2013. Obviously, as you have seen from our releases, we have taken advantage of a low interest rate environment here in the U.S. to structure debt at very low coupon levels, as you know and have also, which has been part of our capital structure planning, located some of that cash in overseas markets where we see deployment opportunities. And with that cash there, the investment returns we are getting are quite elevated. And so as we plan forward, and again, this was planned for 2013, we're looking at net interest expense being basically flat, with expense and income offsetting one another. So net income basically flat for 2013. Now in the fourth quarter of this year, obviously, we got a pickup, as you say, but of course, that was fully offset by the increase in tax rate from the fourth quarter of last year. So we view those as offsetting items.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So clearly, you're affirming the double-digit EPS growth for the year, x top [ph]. But I haven't heard you say directly the organic top line growth of 6% to 7%, which you said in the last conference call is still intact. So is that the target? Is it smooth throughout the year? And you may talk about Venezuela in that context. And I thank you for giving us more detail on what the organic sales growth and gross margin would have been, x Venezuela, in the quarter. But to be fair, would you mind elucidating what your organic sales growth and gross margin would have been, x Venezuela, over the past 3, 4, 5 years?","Ian M. Cook","Well, yes, I guess I would mind, I guess, is the straightforward answer. And the -- looking forward -- I thought I had said it earlier, but if I didn't, then let me say now that indeed, we do reaffirm our 6% to 7% organic growth for 2013. And the reasons are innovation stream, the return of our Hill's business to volume growth and what we believe is an executional focus that we have in all parts of the world but particularly in the emerging markets to make sure our distribution and our in-store visibility and activity truly engages the consumer. And remember, the Venezuela impact in the fourth quarter was a very unusual impact.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on Venezuela and then another question. On Venezuela, is there a catch-up that will happen in the first quarter with things back to normal in terms of when you see those sales materialize and boost organic growth? And then just the regular question is, on the new product launch this year, is it in roughly the same in terms of kind of revenue generation and timing as we're trying to model out?","Ian M. Cook","If I take the second question first, if you think about our innovation in total, I think the contribution to the top line from innovation in total will be around the same level as it was in 2013. Quite how it profile across the year, I must say, I don't have. And from a Venezuela point of view, it is -- and that will be around 7% to 8%, by the way, Bill. And from a Venezuela point of view, the first quarter, as I said, is back to historical levels, but I wouldn't think there would be a rebuild of any significance from a modeling point of view.","Operator","And our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I have a question, a follow-up on Brazil and basically in the context of also what is happening in Europe. As I understood it, you held up market share in Brazil this quarter, but do you see this 50% shipment growth that one of your competitor indicated early this week as a leading indicator of heavier competitive activity in the future as opposed to now? And in the context of the need of upping reinvestment in Brazil, I would like to bring up this issue of Europe where you had seen negative pricing pressure for 3 years. Is this because of your home care business, which is low in terms of strategically and financially in your ranking? And if that's the case, should you consider doing something more drastic in Europe, maybe divesting home care, if that's the core of why pricing has been negative for so long?","Ian M. Cook","Okay, Javier. Well, let me take your 1 question in the 2 parts it was asked, starting with Europe. At first, we were pleased with the organic growth we got in Europe, albeit volume-driven in the fourth quarter. Secondly, the -- a pricing negative relates to the European environment and has been that way for the same years you quoted. It is not especially oriented towards our home care business. You may recall that when we talked about our global growth and efficiency program, we very specifically said that we were in a world where growth rates in our categories was going to be driven by the emerging markets in those high single digits, low double digits ranges. And that the category growth rates in the developed world would be low single digits, and in Europe, definitely low single digits. And that therefore, that we wanted to go forward and lower the structural costs in our company that would increase our speed and efficiency and strengthen us for the longer term with these concepts, both hubs, Colgate business, service centers and, of course, more facility rationalization. And you will remember that one of the first announcements we had relative to that program was indeed relative to Europe. So I think we've been attentive to the world that we are living in. We like our businesses. We don't think we have a business problem, and we are trying to create structures that will make us strong, not just today, but for the medium term. Now relative to Brazil and 50% volume numbers, I seem to recall over the last 3 to 4 years, there have been quite a few plus 30, plus 22 types of volume numbers quoted. And our reaction would be you can see the market shares. We see the competitive activity in the country, and I think we have demonstrated, over the last several years, an ability to meet that competitive activity. We have said that over that period, a lot of it was price promotion-related. The latest entry now gives competition to the Luminous offering that we had in the marketplace already at pretty strong share levels, and you will continue to see our innovation at play in Brazil and other countries as we work our way through 2013.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason M. Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just want to, I guess, go back to the organic sales question, just some of the, I think, numbers that you threw out there. You talked about the innovation, I think, being 7% or so this year. Is that right?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. 7% to 8% sales for the year.","Jason M. Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So then with the 6% to 7%, I guess I just want to talk about the pricing element, like how you look at pricing this year relative to some of the maybe incremental promotion out there and then put into context when you look at last year the pricing that came through. Because half of that 6% organic sales was price, what was the kind of impact that you saw on volumes? I'm just trying to reconcile the numbers to get comfort with that 6% to 7% that you've laid out.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, I think, Jason, as we think about pricing, again, take the more strategic perspective. We called out back-to-school 2 areas that we were going to, over time, build competence in. One was pricing and the other was analytics. And to a certain extent, they go hand-in-hand. And we have definitely been focused on that and trying to find the right balance between pricing and volume. So this year, as you say, it's been about half and half price and volume in terms of that 6% organic growth. Next year, we are looking at pricing that's going to be in the 1.5% to 2.5% range, reflecting our capability in that area. About 1\/3 of that is going to be rollover pricing from 2012. The balance will then be a volume and, again, back to the reasons for the confidence in the volume, the turnaround of Hill's from a negative volume to a positive volume business and the growth we have in the emerging market and the innovation stream that we have behind our businesses. So this is built up from the ground up, and we feel reasonably comfortable with where the plan sits.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can we get some more color on sort of the mechanics of the restructuring program, like when the savings are going to come through, where the big buckets are? Maybe I missed over the last few months, but maybe great to just get some color on sort of if you got anything to date and when you're going to see sort of the big uptick in the savings.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, well, the -- I think we spelled out the savings we were expecting this year and the onetime charges we were expecting this year, so savings in the $30 million to $40 million after-tax range and onetime charges for this year in the $185 million to $220 million, this year being 2013. So that's what we are looking at. Now the buckets, I think of the buckets that we frame the program with when we started. They will be this notion of \"hubbing\" or they are operating units around the world so that smaller operations can benefit from greater capability in the hub center, the Colgate business services center that we have talked about for quite some time out of Warsaw in terms of the operating efficiency and related savings that you get with that and the rationalization of our facilities, largely manufacturing, which you started to hear about in Europe a little bit earlier. And in terms of the timing of the savings for 2013, as Bina said, as you would expect, it will come more normatively towards the back half of the year. And so by deduction, you can see that the majority of the savings will come in the out years, and we will talk about progress on those out years as they become concrete.","Operator","And our next question comes from Christopher Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Ian, can you talk, I guess, a little bit about the innovation stream? I guess one of the things that I think some investors are a little bit concerned about is just the ability to lap what look like a pretty aggressive new product flow in 2012. And I think you had a number of what you might describe as platforms like Optic White and Luminous White that really impacted '12. So as you move to '13, that 6% to 7% organic growth rate, obviously, that's a big number considering the innovation pipeline last year. So I guess can you talk a little bit about, a, what does that pipeline look like in '13 relative to '12 with respect to your number of kind of big hit innovations? And I guess put that in the context of what your growth rate looks like.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, well, again, this year, we delivered around 6% organic growth. And next year, we're talking about the same 6% to 7% range that we had for this year. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect innovation to deliver about 7% to 8% of the sales in 2013. We think the pipeline is strong. Unfortunately, for the question you're asking, some of the products that are coming to market have not yet been announced, and it would be remiss of me to provide competitive advantage. But we have a very good, we believe, process in place from an innovation point of view. We have talked about it many times. We have external linkages. We have innovation centers around the world. We have long-term innovation groups. We have a strategic group that needs to try and accelerate capital investments and other investments that might be required to accelerate an innovation. And we have even done some of these rapid innovation models as we have talked before in some of our emerging markets to identify innovations that are directly for those categories. So we think we have a process in place that will give us an innovation stream as productive as 2012. And remember, in that organic growth for 2013, the innovation that is now coming to market from Hill's is going to, we believe, turn that business positive from a volume point of view. And, of course, that's an important factor not to forget either.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","You might have answered this at the beginning of the call, but if we look at margins in Latin America and Asia, in both those regions, they were down year-over-year, while they were up a lot in the U.S. and Europe. The first question is about in the emerging regions. If you were to take Venezuela out, I know you commented on the gross margins, but would operating margins have been up and the same is true for Asia, Africa or similar questions. With competition rising, do you expect margins to go up or down ahead in those 2 regions?","Ian M. Cook","We don't comment going forward, Alice, on operating margins. Clearly, given what we said on the gross margin, the operating margin in Latin America would have been higher in the fourth quarter of 2012, had it not been for Venezuela. So that is indeed true. And, again, for 2013, we have said that we plan for our gross margin to increase by 50 to 100 basis points, and we have reaffirmed the top line at 6% to 7% organic and the bottom line at 10% on a dollar basis, x a significant deval or macroeconomic event. So that's where we are on the margin. We were very pleased with the pricing we've been able to get relative to margin. And, obviously, in the U.S., you have the comparison between the fourth quarter of 2011 when we were investing at very elevated levels to introduce Optic White from where we are this year, with that innovation still driving share growth in the U.S., I would add.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","[indiscernible] has the gross margin buildup for the quarter, you could go through that?","Ian M. Cook","I thought you'd never ask. So if you take the fourth quarter, we have the prior year gross profit at 57.7%. Pricing added 0.9 point. Our Funding the gross savings came in strongly at plus 2.8 points, 280 basis points higher than prior year, although 2012 followed the same profile as last year. And material prices were a negative 2.9 percentage points, and the majority of that was the operating costs in Venezuela, as we have said earlier. So with no other changes, then that roll forward therefore gets you to the 58.6% in the fourth quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I have a housekeeping question and then a real one. What's the normalized contribution in Venezuela to sales and earnings? So if here you would exclude the fourth quarter disruption. And then could you also explain the big increase in North American operating margin? Is it sustainable or were there some onetime factors that caused it to go up as much as it did?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Let me take your second point first. The operating margin, as I said, in North America was a reflection of the fact that in the fourth quarter of 2011, we had very elevated investment behind the launch of Optic White, and of course, we didn't cycle that this year. I wouldn't project out at the fourth quarter level in North America going forward. Now relative to your second question, I think we said, Connie, that Venezuela represents about 5% of our sales, and that is what we provide.","Operator","And our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I just want to understand. Ian, if you could help. What has -- what took you by surprise in Venezuela? Because I do get the sense that you weren't expecting quite as severe volume hit or cost hit. And what has changed as you look at the first quarter?","Ian M. Cook","I guess there was incredible uncertainty after the election and in the lead-up to the inauguration. But I would say the biggest factor was the labor slowdown in our facilities, and that was something that took us time in conjunction with our local management, in conjunction with our workforce and with support, as I said, from government -- appropriate government ministries. And we have resolved the labor slowdown that we had basically in the November, December months. And in January, as I said a little bit earlier, our factory in Venezuela, where we make about 85% of what we sell, is back up running at normal historical levels. And, of course, the sales have bounced back meaningfully from the November, December levels of last year as we have product to supply the market. So it really was that, and the correction is as I laid out. And I think if you read some of the general press, as we have tried to say in our release, I don't think that was -- at that particular period, was a situation unique to Colgate, but that really was the issue.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alec Patterson with RCM.","Alec Patterson","Ian, just quickly, I was curious. The interest expense, sort of the cost of financing initiative that you talked about earlier, if you do unfortunately have a Venezuelan devaluation, would that dramatically change the ability to generate strong interest income?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, many things would be affected. I think, Alec, that would.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","One quick question and then a follow-up to that. Double-digit earnings growth, is that still 10%- to 11%-type range?","Ian M. Cook","Yes.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up. So I'm just trying to reconcile 6% to 7% sales growth to that number. So...","Ian M. Cook","Yes, sales growth, yes.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right. So benefits from 3 restructuring programs, budgeting oil last time at $110. So obviously, it's lower than that, the interest expense benefit share repurchase. I guess where are the incremental spend or where's the incremental spend going? If you could maybe help us sort of reconcile those 2 numbers, the sales to earnings, that will be helpful.","Ian M. Cook","If you're trying to get at the top line, where is the incremental spend going to drive the 6% to 7% top line, well, it's going into commercial spending, which is to say spending we do directly with retailers. It's going into traditional advertising. It's going into innovation. It's going into overhead of SG&A because we will, in some locations, be strengthening our on-the-ground capability. So it really is geography- and project-specific. Yes. And so that's where it's going, but remember that the restructuring savings in 2013 are in that $30 million to $40 million after-tax. So it's a relatively modest number compared to what has yet to come.","Operator","That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Ian M. Cook","Well, thanks for your questions. Thanks for joining us, always a pleasure.

For informational","purposes, recast historical geographic segment and geographic sales growth information","conforming to the new reporting structure has been provided within this morning's 8-K and the","For Investors section of Colgate's website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","So now let's turn to the divisions. Starting with North America. We are pleased with another solid quarter in North America. Our U.S. and Canada businesses, including our Tom's of Maine and professional businesses, contributed to good growth. Innovation across categories helped drive market shares and, as referenced in the press release, market shares increased on a year-to-date basis in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners.","Our oral care franchises are strong. In toothpaste, our leadership position year-to-date through","June of 35.7% has increased to 35.8% in the latest read. New products supported by impactful","marketing campaigns and in-store activity have been critical to this success. Colgate Total Daily","Repair toothpaste, our most recent addition to the Colgate Total equity, is driving growth in the","super premium segment, with year-to-date shares increasing from 3.7% in 2015 to 4.3% in 2016,","increasing our overall Colgate Total share by 60 basis points. In addition to equity drivers such as engaging media and in-store and online support in the second quarter, we linked Colgate Total to National Women's Health Week.","Colgate Optic White is performing well with a full portfolio including multiple toothpaste","offerings as well as whitening toothbrushes and mouthwash for a complete regimen approach.","Adding to the basic Optic White, Optic White Platinum Express White and Optic White","Platinum Lasting White variants was the recent launch of Optic White Platinum High Impact","White toothpaste. Our overall Optic White toothpaste share is at 6.3% year-to-date, and in the","second quarter reached 6.6%, up 80 basis points from the year-ago period.","Colgate 360\u00b0 Toothbrush continues to deliver differentiated and incremental innovation. In the","first quarter we launched Colgate 360\u00b0 Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush with spiral","polishing bristles and stain erasing cups. Market share for the Colgate 360\u00b0 toothbrush range has","grown from 13.1% in 2011 to 19.8% in 2015 and is up again this year, achieving 22.1% through","June.","Continuing the momentum for the Colgate 360\u00b0 franchise, shipping this month in the U.S. is the","new Colgate 360\u00b0 Total Advanced 4 Zone manual toothbrush. This revolutionary new","toothbrush features a high-tech, ergonomic design, and a tongue and cheek cleaner with longer","rubber nubs than any previous Colgate 360\u00b0 toothbrush. It's specifically designed to clean the four","zones of your mouth: your teeth, tongue, cheeks and gums. This launch is being supported via","comprehensive shopper activation in key retailers.","And in personal care, innovation in both liquid hand soap and body wash have driven share increases. In the first quarter we launched Softsoap Pure Foaming Hand Soap. The simple, gentle formula cleans and purifies and has 100% natural fragrance with no dye or alcohol. And we told you last quarter about Softsoap Luminous Oils body wash which comes in two variants: avocado oil and iris, and macadamia oil and peony. This new line has been incremental to our overall body wash share, and the macadamia oil and peony variant has been the number one Softsoap body wash variant at a major U.S. retailer for 13 out of the last 15 weeks.","Let's turn to Europe. Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties across the region, Europe delivered another quarter of positive organic sales growth. Toothpaste market shares remained relatively stable at 35.2% across the region. And we enjoyed market share increases in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap and fabric conditioners.","While toothpaste share was relatively stable across the region, we saw some good increases in","individual countries as referenced in the press release, with strength in both the Colgate and","GABA brands.","Now, you may recall we told you last quarter about the rollout of our toothbrush plus whitening pen","which has met with great success. Our regional overall manual toothbrush share is at 27% year-to-date, up 250 basis points from the year-ago period and over 10 share points ahead of the","nearest competitor. In France, one of the first launch markets to launch the toothbrush plus whitening pen, our overall year-to-date toothbrush share has gone to 25.5% from 18.2% in the year-ago period.","Our year-to-date body wash share is up 40 basis points from 12.7% to 13.1%, with gains coming","from both the Palmolive and Sanex brands. You will recall we recently launched a range of","Sanex products, including body wash, for dry and atopic skin. And in the bigger Sanex markets -","France, Spain and the UK \u2013 our overall body wash shares increased 100 basis points, 140 basis","points and 30 basis points, respectively, year-to-date.","Our fabric conditioner share year-to-date increased 150 basis points across the region from 23.3%","to 24.8%. And our largest market, France, saw growth of over a point from 47.4% to 48.5%, with the most recent read at 50.1%, and this in the face of continued stiff competitive activity. More innovation is planned for the back half of this year.","And as in other parts of the world, the toothpaste whitening segment is strong and growing at almost twice the rate of the overall toothpaste category. We lead in this segment with a 43% year-to-date share. So, to capitalize on the growth opportunity, we are relaunching Colgate Max White Optic with revitalized graphics and an improved formula which is three times more powerful for instantly and visibly whiter teeth.","A new GABA product is meridol Parodont Expert, a clinically-proven daily-use toothpaste","which increases gum resistance against periodontitis. This offering fills a gap in our portfolio.","And in personal care, we hope to continue the momentum in body wash with the launch of Palmolive Gourmet Spa, a unique concept which has been proven in other geographies. And as I'm sure you recall, this range of body washes has a high density creamy formula offered in Vanilla Pleasure, Chocolate Passion, Peach Delight and Strawberry Touch. New sleeve packaging provides a premium look, high quality satin finishing, extended communication surface and strong shelf impact.","Sanex is now launching Sanex Men, a unique positioning for the mass market, as it is the","first range of products, body washes, shampoo and underarm protection, which is truly","focused on men's skin health.","Turning then to Latin America, the strong organic sales growth of the first quarter continued into the second quarter. And, as you would expect, innovation contributed to these results across categories.","In toothpaste, our regional share year-to-date is up 80 basis points to a record 75.5%. In Brazil,","our share is at a record 73.3%, with the most recent read at 73.5%. In the highly competitive","whitening category, our Colgate Luminous White equity is doing well. The complete regimen","offering of toothpaste, manual toothbrush, toothbrush plus whitening pen and mouthwash has been supported by a new and strong marketing campaign, Designed to Make You Shine.","In Mexico, where our overall toothpaste share is back over 80%, Colgate Luminous White","toothpaste has achieved a record 9.1% share year-to-date, up 60 basis points over the year-ago","period. Our regional mouthwash share is also strong, up 30 basis points to 31.5% year-to-date.","In Brazil, the launch of Colgate Plax Ice Infinity has met with exceptional results and driven our","share up 170 basis points year-to-date to 35.2%. In the personal care category in Brazil we launched Protex Pro-Hidrata with macadamia oil, a line of bar soap, body wash and liquid hand soap offering moisturizing sensation as well as the antibacterial protection for which Protex is known. The bundle is incremental to the Protex equity, driving the Protex body cleansing share from 13.6% in December of 2015 to 14.6% in the most recent period, further establishing Protex as the leading antibacterial body cleansing equity in Brazil.","Our new product flow is continuing in the second half of the year. Launching now are two new","toothpastes. The first, priced at the premium range of the category, Colgate Total Professional","Daily Repair, creates a shield in 100% of the mouth surfaces that helps repair early enamel","demineralization and prevent teeth and gum problems.","The second, Colgate Triple Action Extra Whitening, should help drive share in the base business. Its exclusive formula with micro polishing particles provides extra whitening, it removes stains, works from the first brushing and restores the teeth's natural whiteness.","Along with the Triple Action toothpaste will be a companion Colgate Triple Action Whitening toothbrush.","To further build on our momentum with Protex, we are continuing the launch of Protex for Men","3 in 1. The product, which comes in liquid or bar soap form, delivers three benefits. Besides","eliminating 99.9% of bacteria, it actively cleans the body without drying out the skin, it prepares","the skin for a soft shave and it can be used as a shampoo leaving men's hair clean with a","masculine fragrance.","Turning then to Asia\/South Pacific. Results were somewhat muted in the region in this quarter on an overall basis with pockets of strength. For instance, in the Philippines, our toothpaste share increased over 200 basis points year-to-date to 62.6%, with the most recent read at 64.6%. Lower priced offerings such as Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Fresh Confidence as well as premium priced Colgate Sensitive contributed to the share gains. And to continue the momentum, we are in the process of introducing Colgate Fresh Confidence Bamboo Charcoal toothpaste in that market.","In India, our manual toothbrush share is up 200 basis points year-to-date to 45.7%. Colgate Zig","Zag Black has contributed to the share gain. And as you would expect, we have more innovation slated for the balance of the year.","In India, the consumer believes strongly in natural ingredients, and we told you last quarter about two toothpaste initiatives, Colgate Active Salt with Neem and Colgate Sensitive with Clove Essence. A third toothpaste launching this quarter under the Cibaca sub-brand is Colgate Cibaca Vedshakti. The positioning is a toothpaste packed with the goodness of natural ingredients to help keep dental problems away. In the toothbrush category, we are launching Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal Spiral. Charcoal toothbrushes have been particularly successful in this region, and this latest brush offers spiral bristles with charcoal.","Mouthwash is a small but growing category across the region. Our regional share is up year-to-date by 30 basis points to a record 28%. And to continue the momentum, this quarter in India we are","launching Colgate Plax Spicy Fresh, delivering spicy freshness without the burn.","Turning then to Africa\/Eurasia. Our business across the region remains solid despite macroeconomic challenges and continued currency headwinds. Our toothpaste market shares are strong. In Russia, our share is up 120 basis points year-to-date to 34.9%. Much of the growth has come from our mainstream businesses Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity protection. In Turkey, our share is around the prior year-to-date level at 26.8% but in the most recent period our share is at 28.1%.","And in South Africa, our year-to-date share is at 50.4%, up 10 basis points, with the most recent read at 50.6%. In South Africa, our manual toothbrush share is up 60 basis points to 38.6% year-to-date, with the most recent read at 39.2%.","Now, we've told you before about Colgate Total Pro Breath Health toothpaste, first launched in Latin America. This toothpaste with a new formula with ON 12 (15:34) complex that neutralizes bad breath bacteria while protecting 100% of the surfaces of the mouth will be rolled out across this region, supported by media and key visuals in store to communicate the benefits.","Similarly drawing from other regions, we will be launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent toothpaste, formulated to repair the cause of sensitivity and prevent further sensitivity from gum recession. A product developed for the Russian market is our new Colgate Altai Herbs Ginseng, which adds Ginseng, a natural healing ingredient, to the Colgate Altai Herbs toothpaste launched previously.","In the personal care category, we are relaunching our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line of shower gels","with improved graphics. And in addition, we have added two new variants, mint and coconut.","Turning to Hill's. As with the Colgate businesses, Hill's continues with solid results fueled by successful innovation. Launched now over a year ago, Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus continues to deliver outstanding performance. The complete range of dry and stews has been rapidly distributed across all regions and is now selling in 46 countries.","Building on the solid Metabolic Plus platform, in May of this year we launched Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Urinary Stress for cats with clinically proven nutrition for concurrent conditions of obesity and feline lower urinary tract disease. This launch was integrated into an overall focus on urinary problems which are very common in cats. The product is now available in thirteen countries across North America and Europe.","Dermatological disorders and skin issues represent the fourth largest therapeutic food category in","dollar sales for pets. In 2016 we have two major initiatives in this area: Prescription Diet Derm","Defense and an upgrade of our Prescription Diet z\/d. Prescription Diet Derm Defense is Hill's","first and only nutrition with HistaGuard Complex, formulated to reduce signs of environmental","allergy by disrupting the internal allergy response and creating a barrier against future episodes","in dogs. It is now in the U.S. and Europe and will be rolled out across the rest of the world.","The science was presented both at a Global Derm Symposium in April in California and at the World Congress of Veterinary Dermatology in May in France, driving awareness among key thought-leaders.","Our Prescription Diet z\/d upgrade has been reformulated to increase ingredients known","to support skin and coat and GI health. And in addition, we launched a small bites variant for the","rapidly growing small dog population.","Innovations across our Science Diet platform continue to do well. In addition to our Science","Diet Perfect Weight and Science Diet Healthy Cuisine, which we told you about last quarter, our","Science Diet Urinary Hairball Control for cats is exceeding original sales estimates in North","America. It's now the number one wet variant for Science Diet. In Europe we have an online quiz and game as well as videos for the product to generate interest and trial.","So in summary then, we are very pleased with how the year is progressing. Our organic sales growth is solid and our savings programs as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program are delivering a healthy gross profit margin increase. Around the world Colgate people are executing our focused strategies. Our innovation pipeline is full and we're excited about what is yet to come. So we look forward to sharing our results with you as we go through the balance of the year.","And now, Angela, I should like to turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Today's questions-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience. And we will take our first question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Wendy.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I don't think I heard, Bina, you comment on China, even though in the press release you mentioned volume declines. So could you talk about the magnitude of the volume declines in China, what the pricing environment was like? And maybe a broader question of kind of what's going on, is it to your market share? I know Procter has talked about the need to more premiumize the oral care category. Do you share that view? So sort of a specific on the quarter, how did China fare? And bigger picture, what's your take on China right now? Thanks.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question, Wendy. I guess overall I would start a little bit further back and say that in balancing all of the geographies and the headwinds we are facing in the world, we were delighted to post an overall 4.5% organic growth. Asia, as you saw, was more muted at 2% although with some highlights, as Bina has already discussed.","I don't think based on what you have heard over the last couple of weeks from other companies that operate in China that there are some short-term issues in that geography. So let me explain our analysis of what's going on, which we view as a relatively short-term issue as I will describe, and then I can come back and talk about market shares both overall and respective to China.","So first of all, in terms of what's going on in the marketplace, two things. Number one, as we entered the second quarter, the consumer consumption slowed quite sharply. It picked back up and as we look forward, we think that the consumer consumption in China for the balance of the year will continue to be around mid-single digits. But there was a slowdown entering the second quarter. That was compounded by a fairly large structural change that's going on in China, which is this shift of business from brick and mortar to online. Online's showing very sharp growth, indeed our online business doubled year-to-date in China. And both of those things saw inventory build with the wholesalers, in part because of backdoor selling from the brick and mortar retailers which distorted pricing in the market and built inventory with wholesalers.","Now, we have seen that before, as you know, and we are seeing it again and we are in the process of dealing with that inventory situation. And we think, as it was the last time, it will be fully corrected by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year but it will continue for a little while.","In terms of market share, we talked on the last call about market share in China. I would comment first on the world and I would say on the world that our market share in dollar terms, which is what we comment on in the press release, is modestly down. But that is all to do with foreign exchange mix. In fact, our market share on a constant currency basis is up, and our market share in volume terms is up around the world.","In China, our market share is beginning to recover in the second quarter, showing two periods of uptrend as the innovation that we spoke about the last time, which is premium innovation to your point, Wendy, is beginning to take hold in the marketplace.","So we don't think we're imbalanced from a portfolio point of view. The primary local competitor that we spoke about, Unimbyall (24:19), has been flat in market share terms for the past six periods. And we think our innovation flow is good. So for our business, based on the analysis we see, it is this temporal adjustment again of slowdown in consumption which has picked back up, but perhaps a more substantive shift over time move from brick and mortar to e-commerce. Again, if the consumption is mid-single digits, we will simply grow our business where consumers do their shopping. The consumption levels will not change.","So something to work through, but we don't think substantive. And we certainly don't think that we have a portfolio issue as we go forward.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I know you've commented in the past that you're kind of agnostic, at least in developed markets, about selling to brick and mortar versus online retailers. Does that apply as well to China or is there a margin difference between where you're selling? Thanks.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're agnostic.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We will now go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Want to drill a little bit into Latin America. And so, look, it's more than half of your emerging market business right now. So at about kind of 9.5% pricing that you took from that region, that's driving about 80%-ish, three-quarters, 80%-ish of your emerging market, 6.5% growth you mention in the release. And to be clear, you're not unique in that reliance among the companies that we cover. But I want to get a sense of the sustainability you see in that, especially as we saw some of your Brazil volumes get a little bit worse lately sequentially here. We see that Latin America is the only region, at least from the press release, that you increased ad spend on. Mexico is left out of share gaining. Kind of the list of countries, Mexico's left out after Latin America. So I want to get a sense of you about the sustainability of driving so much of your growth from that region.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, we're quite optimistic on Latin America, which may be a contrarian thing to say, largely based on the relationship we have with the consumers that buy our products.","Now, the Mexican market share is still north of 80%, which is a fairly respectable place to be, and we quoted the Brazilian share at now approaching 74%.","I actually wouldn't use the term relying on pricing in Latin America. I would more say that we have the elasticity to take the pricing with our consumer in order to offset the translation impact of costs driven by weakening foreign exchange. You know well from our history that while we see volume slow down as the pricing goes through, that that comes back over time. And our forward thinking on Latin America is that the volume negative will dissipate across the back half of the year.","And the important thing for us is to watch our market shares and, as I said earlier, our market shares are not only up country by country, but they're up on a volume basis as well. So people are staying with our product. If we don't face the headwind in costs, as we said coming into this year, you would see our forward business momentum be more volume driven than pricing driven. And indeed we still stand behind the comment that for this year, as we deliver within the 4% to 7% range that we are staying with, it will be more volume driven than pricing driven for the entire year.","So it is a response to the headwinds that we face to help generate the kind of gross margin expansion that you are seeing which allows us to continue to lift our traditional advertising, which I know you favor, and at the same time continue with the in-store work that we also believe engages with consumers. So we're very comfortable with our approach, and that comfort is based entirely on the enduring relationship we have with the consumers that buy our products in that part of the world.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","This was helpful. And the enduring relationship with consumers in that part of the world, it seems like you want to increase that through incremental advertising spend there but nowhere else, so in none of the other regions you see ad spend goes up, as far as I could tell, except for that region. So I'm trying to get a better sense of that.","And if you might be able to just give a little bit more granularity on Brazil. So are people trading down? What do you see happening now? We've heard some people saying it's bottoming. Just some perspective there. Thanks.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, as usual, thanks for the one question. On Brazil, I think we take the view, as many others have announced, that we see this continuing for the balance of the year. We have not seen trading down in terms of our portfolio. Indeed, we did not see that, you will remember, during the subprime period. And if consumers find themselves cash stretched, they tend to buy a smaller size before they come back to the payday weekend.","So I would venture to say more continued turbulence in Brazil for the balance of the year. We have long said that we did not think this would be a short fix. Again, our category growth rates continue in that mid-single digit range. Yes, largely driven by pricing at this time. But these foreign exchanges trends will eventually change. So that would be Brazil.","And in terms of the advertising, Ali, I think you have to watch our planning over a year rather than drill in to one geography in one quarter. We stand by what we say, which is that we are planning for our advertising for the full year to be up both absolutely and as a percentage to sales, and we will see how that unfolds over the balance of the year. Frankly again, even though this may continue to be contrarian, in some parts of the world where the consumers are particularly stressed, we are finding that the in-store efforts produce a better result with good brand scores and a good ROI. And we will continue to do that in a balanced way to build our brands.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","We'll now go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just for clarification, is your share online in key markets similar to what we can see in brick and mortars, or are there markets where there are disconnects? And then just in terms of price mix, following up on that, the price versus volume contribution obviously is still on back to price being a bigger contributor versus volume. So first, does mix have any impact in there? And then just sort of your thoughts on the second half in terms of the dynamic. I know volume a bigger piece than price over time, but just a clarification on that second half expectation. Thank you.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the online is interesting because what you see online often is that the share composition is very different. So for example in the U.S., we are the brand share leader online but, for example, our Tom's of Maine business has a disproportionately elevated share online which may trace to the demographics of the consumer. So you see our shares profiling strongly, but sometimes the composition of those shares is very, very different to what you would see in a brick and mortar account.","Relative to this pricing notion, I mean, our price was greater than our volume in this, the second quarter for the reasons that I have mentioned. You will remember our volume is a dollar weighted volume, so mix is not a factor in the discussion. And to repeat what we said to Ali, it is our planning that for this year in total, our growth, which will be within the 4% to 7% range we have been guiding will be more driven towards volume than price on a relative basis to last year.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. If could follow up on developed markets pricing, it's been pretty negative in developed markets, and in the case of the U.S. it's got more negative versus last year. And your main competitor seems to have a bit more of a sense of urgency in other categories. So what are you seeing on the competitive front that's causing you to keep promotional levels heightened like this? Thank you again.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'm not sure the pricing situation in Europe is unique to us. If you talk about North America, oftentimes this traces here to the couponing that you use to put behind your new innovations. So we all have our thoughts and plans in terms of innovation flows, which vary by company, but our pricing in North America, we think overall, we get a good organic growth out of it. So it really does trace more to the innovation flow and the couponing that builds trial behind that innovation flow. Hello?","Operator","With no other questions from Ms. Tong, we will now go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, Ian, just kind of a simple question. On share repurchase, just looking back, your average share count went down sequentially every quarter from 2006 until 2015, yet it's gone actually up for the first time both in 1Q and 2Q. So is there a change in thought of use of cash or share repurchase, or it's just more of a short-term event?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, there is not a change. We simply got behind ourselves. So for the year we are still talking about a gross buyback of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We fell behind, frankly, in the second quarter which is the net result of what you see. Therefore, what you're going to see over the balance of the year is that share repurchase pick up. And on a gross basis, it's going to be between $300 million and $400 million a quarter so that we realize the $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion range for the full year. So we're still holding to the full year and, therefore, there will be an uptick in the second half of the year to compensate.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And that's reflected I guess in the share count on the outlook.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Exactly.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now go to Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks very much for the question.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Is it John or Jonathan?","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","It's Jonathan.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","It's Jonathan. You can call me either, Ian.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Fine.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","When you think about pricing and volume, particularly in Latin America where you have such strong market shares, has anything \u2013 it strikes me as a conundrum companies like yourselves face that just at the time when consumers are feeling some distress in other areas from the currency movement, you're asking them to pay more for the products. Assuming a more neutral currency situation in the future, how much pricing opportunity of the pricing that's happening today is increased value add, increased value you're bringing to the consumer? And how much of it do you think that lasts into a more neutral currency environment, should we ever experience one again? But hopefully at some point in the next year or two. Thanks very much.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks, Jonathan. Latin America is an interesting part of the world. The shopping consumer in Latin America is perhaps one of most educated on the planet in terms of the vagaries of foreign exchange and what that means for a shopping basket. And the steps that we take are entirely driven by the currency. And if you talk qualitatively with consumers in Brazil for example, they can almost tell you what the price of the goods that they buy are going to be based on the foreign exchange moves.","I guess the good way to think about it is that our kinds of products, yes, you're talking taking pricing but you're talking taking pricing on an everyday product and at relatively modest levels on top of that. So it does not affect their loyalty to the brand over time. They have opportunities in terms of the different sizes we have to buy at different price points and therefore mitigate the cost impact from a cash outlay point of view, which indeed they do do. But interestingly, they don't even trade down within our portfolio. So if they're buying the premium end of the Colgate portfolio, they keep buying that. They don't trade down to perhaps what you might say is a more economical option within our portfolio.","So our kinds of products at the time these economies are going through what they are going through become the affordable luxuries that people continue to put in their shopping basket. So that's the way I would answer it, John.","Operator","We will now move on to Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Good morning, Ian. I'm trying to try in sneak two questions on two different tacks. The first one is just to clarify what you said earlier I think in response to Olivia's question. Did you say that mix was not a factor in your reported volume? Because I thought it was.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Mix is in \u2013 we have a dollar-weighted volume.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So it's in the volume.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. So it's in the volume. Okay. Okay.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In other words, it's not separate. She was looking for a separate contribution. That was our point.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And so just building on that, as you were discussing with Ali, as the volume improves sequentially as pricing subsides, just from a marketplace dynamic, do you expect more of a unit volume recovery or is it more of a resumption of trade-up?","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we'll get both. We'll get both. But the volume will recover and it will not all be trade-up.","Operator","We will now move on to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Could we talk a little bit about gross margins? I think maybe your \u2013 I would think maybe you're a little disappointed that no one's asked you about it yet given gross margins were up 190 basis points. So if you could run through the bridge for us. And then also just talk about how that impacts your view of the moving pieces for the balance of the year. I guess I'll have a follow-up once I know what the key drivers were.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I was going to ask you to repeat the question because I like hearing 190 basis points. So if we just do the traditional roll forward, the prior-year gross profit was 58.3%. We got the benefit, 110 basis points of the pricing. We had between funding the growth and restructuring \u2013 restructuring modest in gross profit, as you know, 190 basis points favorable. Material prices were a headwind of 110 basis points. Nothing in all other. And that gets you to the 60.2% which is the 190 basis points.","Now, as we think about that for the balance of the year, I mean, first pleasingly \u2013 although these pleasing moments are quickly behind you, but pleasingly this is the second back-to-back quarter now we've been above 60% in gross margin, which, as you know, was a company goal. Indeed, the second edged slightly up on the first. But if you look at your gross profit for the first half of the year, it's up 150 basis points. 1.5 points. So as we, as you, think about the balance of the year, I guess what we would say is our expectation is that our gross margin increase for the second half of the year will be around the same level as the first half, maybe even a little bit higher. And the primary driver of that of course is transaction headwinds will start to lessen as the foreign exchange comparisons, bar another event in our world, improve year upon year.","Operator","We will now move on to Iain Simpson with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","Iain E.

One of your competitors recently commented that oral care was a category that would potentially lend itself to an online subscription model, the advantage being that it would increase rates of toothbrush replacement.

And we will now move on to Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, and morning, everybody.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Mark.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I wanted to ask about Hill's. So in the press release, innovation is called out, seems to be largely driven by prescription Science Diet. I didn't see any mention in there of the natural or Ideal Balance categories, brands. So I guess curious if you could comment on why the focus seems to be on the nutrition science, not naturals which I guess it has been more so in recent years and if there's anything we should read into it from a consumer preference standpoint in terms of changing tastes out there.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think so. I think whatever we do on Hill's, whatever we have done on Hill's, we are always extremely focused as a matter of strategy on the nutrition the diets provide; doesn't matter whether it is a prescription product, a Science product, or even our Ideal Balance product.","I think the thing you might want to read into it is that after we introduced Ideal Balance, we have been through an extensive process of changing the formula composition of our Science Diet product \u2013 at least the one not recommended or prescribed by a vet \u2013 to change the composition of the ingredients in those products to lead with protein and other ingredients that buyers of natural products value thereby no longer providing them with a reason to walk away from the nutrition of Science Diet because Science Diet doesn't offer them a formula composition that they're looking for. And that was a significant change that we made to make that piece of the business less vulnerable to a naturals pure play.","So Ideal Balance is doing okay but I would say our major shift has been to make sure from a dietary composition point of view that our core Science Diet business is competitive. And, of course, in making that change have validated the fact that the nutritional benefit that the pet is provided is completely unchanged in making that formula adjustment. So I guess that's the way I would think about it.","And all of the innovation that Bina talked about on the prescription diet side, as you've seen with the weight products, we translate that science, if you will, across Science Diet and even bring it to Ideal Balance, although we would market it in different ways given the different positionings of each of those three segments of the business.","Operator","We will take our final question from Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for the follow-up. So, sorry in advance for the technical question, but just as I'm asking you about how you define things in your reporting, if I think about Europe where you see pricing down again 3% this quarter, which I understand is a well-documented trend, if I go back to 2009 and just index your portfolio to 100 and multiply it through the reported pricing, it implies that you're pricing \u2013 your portfolio is down almost 20% in aggregate since that time. And obviously there's been a big continuous mix component, I'm assuming, as you roll in new premium innovation that's help offset that in the volume line.","But as I think about how that flows through to margins, I'm assuming that that premiumization has","been beneficial to margins, but if I look at how you define the buckets of margin drivers, especially by segment, you typically call out funding the growth and then all-in kind of raw and packaging costs and then pricing. I just want to understand, maybe using Europe as an example, when there's a significant mix benefit or impact on margins, where does that fall? Is that netting against pricing that mix benefit or is it somehow contributing to funding the growth as it relates to your margin drivers? Thanks.","Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you for the simple question. I think the mix benefit clearly is picked up in gross margin. And I would say it would be between pricing and cost in the gross margin calculation, base cost.","Operator","And we don't have any other questions at this time.","Ian M.

Please go ahead, John.","John Faucher","Thanks, Loren. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations.","Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release.

Ian and Noel will start off with their thoughts, while I will cover our Q4 results and 2019 guidance.","Ian Cook","Good morning, everyone. It's Ian. Let me first wish you all a belated happy and healthy 2019. And let me start my introductory comments where we started the press release. We are pleased with the improvement in organic sales in the fourth quarter, plus 2% on top of plus 2% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and you will recall that the 2% in the fourth quarter of 2017 was the highest quarter that year.","Said a different way, on a two-year stacked basis, we accelerated from 1% in the third quarter to 4% in the fourth quarter. So we entered 2019 with momentum. I think our intense focus on innovation, sustained advertising and product expansions in new channels and markets is beginning to pay off.","You may recall that our biggest problem businesses 12 months ago are now the ones growing the fastest. Hill's, four quarters of accelerating growth, driven by Prescription Diet which is the backbone of the business and the line that creates the recommendations from the best, a strong U.S. business and our continued high growth in e-commerce. And as you will hear later from in Noel, there is big news coming on the other half of the Hill's business, Science Diet in 2019.","Africa\/Eurasia, we cycled through our distributor issues. We're focused back on driving distribution and advertising support and we're back to growth and India now posting continued healthy organic sales growth, driven by innovation, Vedshakti, which is building distribution and continuing to build market share.","On a national basis Vedshakti is now up to 1.7 shares, seven months of continuous share growth. And in the modern trade where distribution obviously builds quicker; and trial, and therefore share growth is faster, Vedshakti is now up to 4.4% market share five months of share increase.","And several other markets are on plan and expectation that we discussed in the third quarter are all generally doing better. Mexico and Brazil, we saw sequential improvement which helped drive Latin America to positive growth. We are taking pricing as we said we would and we are sticking with that strategy.","In the case of Mexico, we have seen that market become somewhat less promotional and the category growth is coming back. In Brazil, the category growth is still modest and the heightened promotional activity we had mentioned before continues, so we balance our business in Brazil, responding where we need to but sticking to our underlying strategy of taking the necessary pricing.","China; sequential improvement as we said, but still negative. Consumption continues to look fine and the pricing is working its way slowly to consumers. We expect to see continued sequential improvement in the first half and return to growth in the second half of this year.","And finally a market often discussed in these calls, the U.K. where we are seeing strong growth driven by increasing market share which in turn is being driven by our premium business in the U.K. And that's before the impact of the Total re-launch in the U.K. And in the U.K. the Total brand is a 16-share substantial business.","However life is not perfect and we have had two markets affected by specific issues. In Europe we had the disturbances called by the Gilets Jaunes or the yellow vests. And that in fact was a headwind to European organic growth of some 40 basis points. As you see yourselves in the news, while the disturbances are still there they are more subdued than they were during the fourth quarter.","And here in the United States, we saw a little bit of slowing in terms of category growth. We were preparing to bring Total to the marketplace in the first quarter and therefore working shelf inventory down a little to make for an easy transition.","But the biggest headwind in North America was onetime very specific and entirely mechanical and that was the shift of a major promotional activity from 2018 to 2019 from a shipments point of view and that happened later in the quarter and that was a 120 basis points shift from fourth quarter organic into the first quarter of 2019.","And the final comment I'll make on 2018 is that, as we have been saying for awhile as planned, we laid on pricing. And we believe it is paying-off despite the expected volume impact. We are beginning to see some competitors follow the Mexico\/Brazil contrast is relevant in that case, but as one has to say on pricing it is early days and we will see how the markets evolve and what the competitive reaction is.","So let's turn to 2019. Our intense focus on innovation and bringing our products to new channels and markets supported by a meaningful increase in advertising continues. The innovation grid we have in 2019 is uniquely and especially strong, particularly on some scale core businesses in addition to many of the adjacencies that we have in our portfolio.","This is the opportunity to accelerate our growth which is why we have guided to the 2% to 4% organic growth increase. And Noel will talk in some detail about the growth plans that we have in 2019. The area I want to talk about for 2019 is our continued focus on pricing and that is for two reasons.","One is a continued focus on premiumizing our portfolio. And the second is offsetting underlying costs including the transactional impact of foreign exchange. So, if I take a step back and just give you a view on the underlying commodity cost trends on our business, for 2018 the overall increase in underlying commodity costs was 7%.","In the third quarter as we told you, it was 8%. In the fourth quarter, it was 9% and for 2019, our plan calls for a 6% increase in underlying commodity costs. Now obviously given the shape of 2018 and as John will reaffirm in his prepared remarks. The cost headwinds will be higher in the first half of 2019. Foreign exchange for 2019 which brings the transactional costs on top of the underlying commodity costs for the year, we expect to be in the 2% to 2.5% range.","Now importantly and pleasingly, over two-thirds of our 2019 pricing is either rollover pricing from 2018 or pricing already accepted as part of the significant re-launches of the Total business and the Hill's Science Diet business. In other words, already accepted and in place. And the net result of that scenario for 2019 is that we expect our gross profit to increase 30 and 50 basis points.","So, those are the framing remarks I would like to put on 2019 and simply, we're pleased it is a unique opportunity to accelerate the growth of our organic topline.","And as some of you may recall, in the second and third quarter calls in response to questions, we emphasized the fact that we were building a plan in 2019 that would reflect the quality and depth of activity we have. That's what we've done and we have confidence in that plan.","So, here's Noel to give you a little bit more on growth.","Noel Wallace","Thanks Ian and good morning everyone. As Ian mentioned in his opening remarks, our number one priority is to accelerate organic sales growth. So, this morning I'm going to discuss three key areas of focus to improve our organic sales performance for 2019 and beyond. You'll year from more from me on this at CAGNY, but I want to provide some initial thoughts to you today.","First, we're driving the core of our business to innovation and improved brand building. Second, we're using innovation to grow in adjacent categories and product segments. And third, we're expanding the availability of our products to distribution to new markets and new channels.","Let me start with growing the core. As you know we have big core businesses that represent the majority of our sales and are the key driver of Colgate status as one of the most penetrated consumer back brands in the world. It is important to keep these core businesses vital and growing to innovation, strong marketing support, and the right consumer messaging.","You will see significant innovation against our core in 2019 including the Colgate Total relaunch which is the biggest news we've had this brand in its more than 20-year history. With this introduction, we are inventing the multi-benefit category that Colgate created. We're invigorating anchor brand and driving consumer engagement, trial, and market share.","It's not easy taking a great formula and making [Indiscernible] so we're excited to bring this breakthrough technology to market this year. The new Colgate Total improves upon the previous version providing several new benefits; including a sensitivity benefit across all variants, instant neutralization of odors associated with bad breath, the ability to seek and fight bacteria for enamel protection, and new cooling agents for lasting freshness.","Importantly, the added benefits allow us to take pricing which should help us drive our global value shares higher, particularly, in key markets like the U.S. and Brazil. And as you would expect, we would support this launch with a new increase in brand-building activity.","In U.S. we expect to generate significant consumer awareness with a record number of in-store displays and advertising that we developed specifically for this year's Super Bowl. The rest of the world would also see a significant increase in advertising and trade activity.","And Colgate Total is not the only core innovation you'll see from us this year. 2019 also marks the relaunch of our Hill's Science Diet business with new SKUs hitting the stores in the U.S. in the first quarter and rolling out globally over the next 12 months.","Our Science Diet sales and market share performance has accelerated over the past several quarters behind improved advertising and higher spending levels, distribution gains and continued strength in e-commerce, the re-launch allow us to build on recent successes.","The Science Diet re-launch includes upgrading the recipes and improving cable shakes. And for pet parents, we've completely redesigned our packaging graphics in a way that will enhance their shopping experience and give them a greater understanding on Hill's brand purpose.","We believe this re-launch also provides us with the opportunity to increase pricing. We're very excited to build on Science Diet strong momentum from 2018. So it's vital to have a healthy core, which includes some of our most important brands. Still, we know we need to continue to innovate into faster growing adjacent categories and segments.","You have heard us talk a lot about Naturals and by the end of 2018 we had Naturals offerings in toothpastes in 79 countries. We continue to expand our Natural offerings in toothpaste based on local insights with the launch of charcoal variant across many countries with encouraging early results.","As Ian mentioned, our Colgate Vedshakti line in India continues to see solid share performance with seven straight quarters of sequential share improvement. In the modern trade, which is Vedshakti's strongest channel, the franchise achieved a 4.4 share in the fourth quarter.","In Germany, we're excited about the launch of Meridol cure for this quarter. We developed a formula that allows us to combine Meridol strong therapeutic heritage with natural ingredients to improve gum health.","Naturals is also a key area of focus in personal and home care. We continue to be pleased with the performance in the Sanex brand with a 0% line is a key factor in driving growth and we've expanded this line into the U.K. We're also expanding our Palmolive Vel Rosita\u00e4 Personal Care line across Latin America and are launching new body wash and handsoap lines including Palmolive Play in Europe.","In Home Care, we're launching under the Ajax brand a number of household cleaner variance using natural ingredients like essential oils, baking soda and citronella. So we've covered how we're driving the core and expanding into adjacent growing segments.","Now I want to focus on how we are pushing even more aggressively into faster growth channels and expanding geographic footprint of our brands. We are launching Elmex and Meridol in the pharmacy channel in new markets this year. We're also expanding the distribution of our professional skincare businesses PCA Skin and EltaMD in spas and dermatologists where we're seeing strong growth.","One of the most exciting programs we have in place for this year is the launch of Hill\u2019s to home, a new e-commerce platform that allows pet parents to purchase prescription diet products directly from their veterinarian to arrive for home delivery.","The pet parents initially signs up for their program through their vet, who enters the appropriate Prescription Diet food recommendation. This new system allows us to maintain the key relationship between Hill's, our vet partners and pet parents while still providing a convenient to that home delivery it is crucial in this category.","By enrolling the pet parents in that subscription-based program we also increased compliance with prescriptions, which leads to better health outcomes for their pets and importantly a higher ROI for Hill's.","Another areas of our business, we're looking on our e-commerce and direct consumer partners with Hubbell and bond based shave club to further build our capabilities in digital, e-commerce and direct-to-consumer which will allow us to expand our offerings and strengthen our consumer relationships. For example, in the fourth quarter we launched at-home whitening kits to our e-commerce platform in China.","So this is our focus. Drive the core, growing adjacencies in new product segments and expand into new channels and markets. I hope this gives you a better understanding our plans and priorities to invest to accelerate organic sales growth in 2019 and beyond.","Now I'll turn it over to John.","John Faucher","Thanks, Noel. In order to leave time for some Q&A, I will forgo the normal divisional review and simply discuss the Q4 financials and then our 2019 guidance. Our net sales declined 2% in Q4. The 0.5% unit volume growth and 2.5% favorable pricing were offset by negative 5% impact from foreign exchange. Our recently acquired professional skincare businesses EltaMD and PCA Skin contributed 1% to net sales and unit volume growth in the quarter.","On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was down 70 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it was down 100 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, our 250 basis points of pricing provided a 110 basis point benefit to gross margin.","Raw material costs, including foreign exchange transaction costs, were a 490 basis point drag on gross margin year-over-year. Our productivity program, led by our Funding the Growth initiatives, provided a 280 basis point benefit to gross margin.","On an absolute basis, advertising investment was up 2% year-over-year in Q4, with increases across every division except Latin America, which was impacted by foreign exchange and reductions in spending in Argentina related to the recent devaluation. On a percent to sales basis, advertising was up year-over-year in Q4.","Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and advertising spending, our SG&A expenses were down year-over-year in Q4 on an absolute basis, but up as a percent of sales, driven by the continued increases in logistics costs. The remainder of our overhead costs were down on an absolute basis and flat as a percentage to sales, benefiting from our productivity programs.","On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share of $0.70 were up 89% year-over-year in Q4. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and the charge related to U.S. tax reform in 2017, diluted earnings per share were down 1% at $0.74.","Looking to 2019. As stated in the press release, based on current spot rates we expect net sales to be flat to up low single digits with organic sales growth of 2% to 4% and a negative impact from foreign exchange. Based on current spot rates, for the full year we expect gross margin to be up year-over-year on both the GAAP basis and excluding charges related to our Global Growth and Efficiency Program.","We expect the benefits of pricing and our productivity programs to offset an overall increase in raw material costs, which includes the impact of transactional foreign exchange. We are assuming that raw material prices increase from current levels.","In order to support innovation that Noel discussed, we plan that advertising will be up meaningfully in 2019, both on an absolute basis and as a percent of sales versus 2018. We will continue our efforts to drive greater effectiveness and efficiency in our advertising spending by improving the impact of our advertising, shifting advertising dollars into higher ROI media and reducing non-working media expenditures.","We expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be between 25.5% and 26.5%, both on a GAAP basis and excluding charges related to our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018 and charges related to U.S. tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018. On a non-GAAP basis this is an increase versus our 2018 tax rate.","Based on current spot rates, we expect GAAP earnings per share to be down low single-digits for the year. Excluding charges related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018 and charges related to the U.S. tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018, we expect earnings per share to decline mid-single digits for the year, which includes a negative impact of translational foreign exchange.","While we feel good about the programs we had in place for 2019 as Noel discussed, we feel it is prudent to factor in uncertainty in global economies, exchange rates and the competitive environment. I would also highlight that we expect foreign exchange and raw material headwinds to be higher in the first half of the year.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Ian for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hi, good morning guys.","Ian Cook","Good morning, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","So, Ian and Noel obviously highlighted the strong innovation pipeline on the call numerous times with Total and Science Diet as well as all the other products. Can you help quantify that for us, how much of the top line growth this year you're expecting to come from innovation? How different is that than a typical year?","And obviously, you're assuming a large increase in A&P spending in 2019 in your guidance, can you give us a bit more detail on where exactly that's going to be focused? Is it mainly just the innovations or given such a large magnitude are there other base geographies or product categories your focused on?","And then last, what gives you the confidence behind the payback from that? And we did see a big add increase in the back half of 2017 in organic sales growth that accelerated in 2018 and would imagine innovations a bigger part of the answer, but what's giving you confidence in the payback from higher spent in terms of top line growth? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Thanks for the one question, Dara. So let me take them in turn. What is not typical about 2019 is the scale innovation on what Noel is calling the core businesses. Now we had mentioned Science Diet before. This is the first time we had mentioned Science Diet.","We mentioned Total before which is a seven-share global brand. And Science Diet as I say is that nearly half of the Hill's business and these will not be the only scale businesses you'll be hearing about in 2019. That is different from traditional innovation cycles.","On top of that, as Noel said, we have the adjacent work that is underway on Naturals across the portfolio and quite a broad array of what I would call normal innovation on the business. So the big difference -- and I'm not going to break out in a quantification sense, but the big difference is scale business -- scale core business, relaunches which by the way terrific technology, terrific consumer acceptance, and we know now with Total, terrific advertising vehicles that have tested extraordinarily well.","To your second point -- and again, I think this is an important point to make. One of the reasons we talked over the last couple of years about sustaining advertising investment and is you need to do two things; you need to maintain the relevance of the equity of our brand which means maintaining continuous advertising support behind the brand in the world with lots of distractions and change.","In 2019, the advertising at that we are putting behind these scaled innovations is incremental advertising. So, we're maintaining advertising support on the equity and we are adding advertising to drive awareness and trial which gets repeat and then builds into a virtual cycle of continuous growth. But we need to get trial of products that are new that are scaled products.","So, that is the focus of the advertising. And within that you obviously have the continued shift to case of Hill's, it's all digital. So, you have those executional intricacies. But from a big picture point of view that is the approach.","And we're confident in the payback in the sense of the expectation we have for growth and market share on those innovations which as we have said have taken a long time to bring together and we think will set change of the business going forward. In other words create an inflection point for the growth of the company that based on the quality of products, will continue beyond 2019. So, that's the confidence.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks and belated Happy New Year to you as well. Its early lots of ground I guess we could cover. But I'm just going to focus on Total, because clearly, it's a big focal point for you right now.","As a step back and as we talk to investors, there's some degree of skepticism on whether or not this can really move the needle. New and improved propositions don't usually move the needle in a big way. It seems like many of the market share gainers in the key categories are winning a distinct benefit platforms rather than universal beneficial bundles such as Total.","So, can you give us a sense of -- or could you give us little more specificity on what drives your enthusiasm and what maybe -- the investment community may not be appreciating? And then related to this, you haven't really mentioned the removal of triclosan from the formula as part of the upgrade platform benefit. Is that because it doesn't really matter? Or is there benefit that comes with that too, whether it be broadening aperture to call it consumers or markets, et cetera? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Yes. Jason there is innovation every year and we see a barrage of labels that say new and improved. But frankly like most things in life there's new and improved and new and improved. And this we view as the biggest breakthrough since we came with the original Total product.","It has been many years in the making in terms of delivering the claims that Noel has mentioned in delivering the flavors that have as much indeed better appeal than the existing flavor which in a taste business is something you have to be very focused on.","And most importantly, the consumer has reactivated in all of our testing, interestingly not just consumer testing, but in market testing that we did if you will under the radar with no advertising, but at significantly higher pricing, because of the quality of the product and the consumer response is very good. And that is why I made the point about the quality of the advertising as well.","So, we know we have a quality product. We do see it as breakthrough. We have been working with dental professionals since the fourth quarter of last year to convey the richness of studies we have behind the product. And we now have advertising that we know is persuasive and motivating and got through with customers.","And on top of that, we are getting extraordinary support from our retail partners in terms of shelving and in terms off-shelf display to generate the trial of the product. And that's why I'm sort of distinguishing the scale of these core relaunches. This is not sort of couple of blue dots in and call it new and improved. So it's a big difference and it's why we are investing through all of the stakeholders involved in the brand that it is a breakthrough which is incremental investment, because trial bills over a two year period for a new product so the time is now.","Now triclosan we are in different. We were quite clear when we spoke about this relaunch at Barclays last September that the new formula would replace the existing formula that contains triclosan that happens to be because we have a better product today than we had with the old product. And that was a great product and we stood behind that product all the time from a scientific point of view. This just happens to be a better product and that's where we are moving to.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks, good morning.","Ian Cook","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about drivers of toothpaste global category growth sort of comparing maybe the last five years versus what you see coming maybe over the next five sort of thinking about the units market penetration usage versus premiumization. Because it sounds like you've been talking consistently about premiumization that's been a biggest trend in some of your major markets.","But I also feel like it's not that long ago that you were still highlighting sort of the actual market penetration usage opportunity. If you could talk a little bit about the balancing of the sort of last five years looking forward and how you're thinking about that as part of your strategy will be great?","Ian Cook","Yes. Lauren good question. It's not an exclusive thing. One trend in the marketplace is that the value growth of the marketplace is accelerating because of premiumization. Premiumization happens in two ways; one is great businesses get better, creates more value for the consumer and receive more value as a brand which is the Total story. The second is we see many smaller brands at premium pricing in niche segments in the category.","And I talked a little bit earlier about Vedshakti. We could talk about Tom's of Maine, which continues to grow quite nicely, which is a unique brand. We could talk about -- again about the charcoal variance what had been mention.","So, when we talk about premiumization, it's both of those things. We're not just talking about Total. And we also are not forgetting the penetration opportunity in the world. I have said before on these calls that still our volume share is higher than our volume share; one out of two physical tubes of toothpaste on the planet are Colgate tubes of toothpaste. And yes, we want the premiumization.","But we also want the users of our product -- and one of the reasons our volume share is higher is because when we entered markets, we made sure that we had the portfolio that had an entry price point that was available to the most rural market entry consumer we could find. And then behind that we have put the Bright Smiles, Bright Futures programs in those emerging markets. We have talked recently about the work we are doing across Africa which has been stepped-up substantially.","And I would repeat when we talk about investment, yes, we're putting in investment behind the innovation, but we are also increasing the investment behind market penetration because we think that that is an important aspect of our sustainable growth over time just based on the average use of toothpaste and the users around the world.","So, they're not mutually exclusive, I guess, is the point. We have focused on the innovation because that is a big driver for 2019. But by no means does that mean we are reducing our effort on building market penetration.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone.","Ian Cook","Good morning Nik.","Nik Modi","Good morning. I was just -- thanks Noel for those comments about kind of where you're focused. Maybe both Noel and Ian you can answer, when you think about the 2% to 4% for 2019, is there any way you can give us perspective on the waitings?","Like how important would the relaunches be relative to perhaps some of the white space opportunities and the distribution opportunities? Just providing a little bit more clarity around the drivers of that 2% to 4% would be helpful. And then maybe what kind of what your expectation is for just general category growth for 2019? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes, I think if we take the categories and you look around the world, we're in a place where you see Europe still flat to 1%, you see North America north of 2%, and you see the emerging markets in that 4% to 6% range. When you take it all together you're talking about 2%, 2.5% underlying category growth rates.","Now if I come back to what's going to drive the shape of that 2% to 4%, I'm not going to break down the scale versus the underlying business is because we are doing a lot of smart things on all of the other businesses that we have. But it is the combination of those that give us the confidence in that 2% to 4% spread, particularly entering the year of the encouraging 2% in the fourth quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Great. Thank you very much. A question on the implied reinvestment this year, I guess, I'm just looking for a little bit more clear specificity if I could. On how much of that is envisioned to go into A&P versus into new capabilities that may not be considered advertising but might touch up in base level SG&A things like as it relates to digital and e-commerce or the Naturals push? Because there's a fair amount of reinvestment implied in the guidance and I'm just trying to figure out if that is truly 100% A&P or there if it's spread across broader SG&A? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Yeah. A good question, Steve. A large part of it is A&P \u2013 a large part of it is A&P. When you start breaking down SG&A you're also going to see that we have logistics in our SG&A and that has topped out reasonably high at the end of this year. And if it continuous at the same level when you look at the fourth quarter that will be a component of the increase \u2013 an in SG&A.","And yes you're right to the extent that digital is requiring personnel and locations and capabilities that might get picked up elsewhere in SG&A. We have also been putting that in place and that underlies Noel's comment about extending into those areas. So you're going to see a bit of logistics predominantly A&P and then also a little bit in the overhead area supporting our continued push into the digital space.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. Good morning.","Ian Cook","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","Hi. I had a few questions on your guidance. I was hoping you guys could help bridge the GAAP between your long-term EPS growth target and then your EPS guidance this year between I guess capital spending the higher tax rate and the FX headwinds?","And also is this higher level spending a new norms for you and really what's necessary for you guys to drive faster growth in this environment? And finally you're forecasting operating margin contraction this year, but do you anticipate the contraction to be less than it was last year?","Ian Cook","Yes. Again, thank you for the single question. I think the most important focus in 2019 is to continue progress on accelerating growth off an encouraging fourth quarter. And I think two things to say, you kind of really asked two questions; one is what happens longer term from a return point of view; and the other was is this cost of doing the business.","So let me kind of break the two. And we're not going to get into discussions about 2020, because it's too much uncertainty between now and then in terms of what could happen with foreign exchange, raw materials and other factors.","Our spending this year is dictated by the amount of activity that we have on our core businesses as well as the other opportunities that Noel talked about. And we believe that this level of support and the quality of the innovation should drive an improvement in our organic sales growth in that 2% to 4% range. That will of course leave us in a better position as we enter 2020 and beyond.","And if our plan evolves the way we are expecting, raw material pressures will lessen in the second half as will foreign exchange which should lead to a sequential improvement in our earnings growth rate and bring us into 2020 with good momentum. And that will set us up for 2020 and beyond.","Now if you flip it the other way and say is this investment behind growth or is this simply the cost of doing the business, you can kind of step back from that question as well. And I think it's been clear that for the past several years, one could say since the financial crises growth has been more challenging.","And what can happen and we have observed does happen is that when growth is challenging that people are willing to pay more for it and you see that in our categories and you sometimes see and we have seen and we have commented about competitive activity that is more in the trade spending area to drive volume rather than build brands.","So that said, we're not spending more because we have to but because we have innovation and marketing programs that are worth spending on now. Now one thing I would say and I should have said in response to an earlier question, one encouraging aspect at this time is that pricing appears to get better. I had talked about you have seen the pricing we got in the fourth quarter.","I talked about the rollover pricing and the Total and Hill's pricing that is already set at over two-thirds of our pricing in 2019. So, if we move into an environment where pricing is positive and you're hearing similar commentary from many in our space and competition happens in the advertising line not above the net revenue line then marketing and innovation will win out not price promotion. And I think we view that as a good thing for the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ian Cook","Morning Ali.","Ali Dibadj","Morning and Noel nice to hear you on the call. So, look I'm glad your filing increasing investments in 2019, but I do want to push a little bit more on whether it's enough. A second ago you said you're not doing it because you need to, but because you got stuff behind you -- innovation, et cetera, behind you.","So, I want to push on whether you think is enough because you're still losing global market share, emerging markets, in particular, and you just mentioned a few questions ago, 4% to 6% EM category growth, you're 1.5%. If you look at your press release and kind of tradition of when there's a mission and market share gains means you're not gaining or you're, in fact, losing and that's Mexico, Brazil, Russia, India, China, maybe South Africa.","And we like the strategy. We like that you're launching Elmex and Meridol and new channels in new geographies to help the Colgate brand out. We like the innovation, but usually that's kind of a long road. It's not a one-year type thing. And so with all that -- and to answer against a previous question tying it back together, it feels like there's maybe 100 basis points or so increase in ad spending in 2019.","Do you expect that to just be a one-time increase in A&P? Do you think you'll have to continue raising your spend to maybe something north of 11% or 12% or 13%. We certainly believe that might be a possibility over the next few years.","And that will continue win on growth because usually these -- you've been in the industry for a long time, we've observed this for a while. It's not a won and done typically, right? It's usually multi-year turnaround, multi-year investments. So, just push you on that is this enough? Is this all we're going to hear in terms of a reinvestment here?","Ian Cook","Yes, as usual a very well-framed question. I think the answer has to be that we believe it is because that is the plan we have put together and the way I think I would frame it; I tried to capture it a little bit in the answer to the previous question. There is a difference between to your point innovation in niches that do take time to grow. We're very pleased with Vedshakti, but it's taking time to build. We know we have a winning product. We will be patient and we will be successful.","So, again, I come back to the difference here is your taking scale businesses. You're making significant relaunches with better quality product perceivable to the consumer and you are focusing your investment on generating trial.","When you generate the trial, our data says we will get elevated levels of repeat and that becomes a virtual cycle. If these businesses, as we plan and expect them to do, driver growth and market share, then as you progress through year, you come out of 2019 in a very good place, growth reestablished, scale businesses to your point about market share with growing market shares and then you enter 2020 in a very different place with an activity array that will be different, strong.","Clearly 2020 has been worked upon for a while and we we\u2019ll decide based on that activity plate what is the necessary level of investment. But it'll be driven by the activity that we have and based on our planning it will be driven by activity on a 2019 that sees us get back to a stronger rate of growth. ","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks good morning everyone.","Ian Cook","Hi Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","Hey good morning Ian. Question on cost structure, as we know it's not uncommon to see companies lean in a bit harder on cost savings in an effort to fund some of the stepped up reinvestment when we see the EPS reset kind of years, but that wasn\u2019t outlined this morning. We didn't see an expansion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program or step-up and savings expected from funding the growth.","So while I don't want to put words in your mouth, presumably there's a certain level of comfort with what the company has already outlined. So I can appreciate sensitivity on the topic, but one, was that a consideration as you were building the plan with what looks like it's going to be about 100 basis points of hurt to the P&L in the year? And then two on that topic maybe perhaps just provide an update on how you see opportunity on this front with respect to cost savings? Thank you for that.","Ian Cook","Yes. No thank you and fair question. You can rest assured actually if I take funding the growth first, when you go through our gross margin role forward, I know John did it in general but our funding the growth savings in the fourth quarter were 280 basis points compared to 250 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017.","So you can rest assured that internationally we have as challenging a goal in place for 2019 and suffice to say we tend to push a little beyond the goals we have established. So there is no lack of focus on trying to generate more from our funding the growth program.","On the Global Growth and Efficiency Program you will remember way extended it one year. We have a variety of new initiatives already baked in that take advantage of the steps we've been making in the three major areas which is the hubbing, the shared service centers and the rationalization continuing on facilities.","And of course, we are working very diligently to see if you can train the new, not yet in the plan opportunities that we can add to those initiatives. And if we find them we will certainly pursue them and we are certainly looking forward to them. So it was not absent. We have set a plan where we are, but we have not -- we are not stopping looking aggressively. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Olivia Tong","Thank you. My question is around your investments in e-commerce and direct-to-consumer. Because while it doesn't sound like there's a ton of incremental spend on the development here, I was curious how your thought process is changing to capture a greater share of our consumers. So like on regular online, how much is focused on changing formulations packaging et cetera versus a change in potentially the messaging around post side bars things like that?","And then, can you elaborate a little bit more on your direct-to-consumers initiatives, you mentioned Hill's to Home. But you're already big in Hill's here, so is that -- where's sort of the incremental in that? And what are you taking from the Hill's lowering capabilities into the other parts of your business? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Okay, well let me -- from an e-commerce point of view, one of the reasons and indeed it was Noel that brought the partnerships in one of the reasons we are pondering with Hubble and with Bombay Shave is to give us some external insight into these areas, techniques that we can experiment with.","And so yeah, we are exploring all of the different ways you can go-to-market from an e-commerce point of view and will continue to broaden what we experiment with going forward. And the Hill's direct-to-consumer, the importance of that is that there are certain group of consumers but for further convenience of shopping online. And yet for a prescription product, you need a vet recommendation and indeed they often seek of that recommendation.","So if you're a dyed in the wool online shopper, right now you can't get that from your local vet online. You have to get it physically from that local vet. So this provides the capability to maintain the engagement of the vet and yet give the recipient of the product, the product delivered in the way they want and we have found with our subscription modeling, but of course at that gives the Pats actually better quality health in the sense that they will stay on the diet and get the full benefit of the product.","Noel Wallace","Olivia, maybe I'll jump in and just add a couple -- a little bit of flavor to that. Obviously, we're increasing our spending in digital. We see a pretty substantive acceleration in digital moving into 2019 as we saw in 2018 which we think is certainly having an impact on our e-commerce shares. As you may have seen our e-commerce shares in the U.S. are up 60 basis points.","In toothpaste, we are clearly the number one player in that category with a delta of about five share points to our nearest competitor. Our shares in highly competitive China market are flat this year and in our view generate a significant amount of learning and we'll be looking to bring new innovations specifically to that channel in China in 2019 to accelerate that growth.","And then our biggest e-commerce business as you're well aware of is our Hill's business which had a terrific year in e-commerce, up 50 basis points. And we're very, very happy with what the progress that team is making in terms of how they are using digital which as you may recall is their only medium of advertising. They spend a 100% in that area behind the business.","And we certainly see that paying off both in our e-commerce shares as well as our brick-and-mortar shares. The success of the Hill's business throughout the year was sequential and the shares are supporting that coming back to that question our vet channel shares which are Prescription Diet were up 60 basis points.","And our pet superstore business which is Science Diet were up 60 basis points. So, again, we think the focus and the learning that we're getting behind digital spending and how that interacts and plays into our e-commerce business is well constructed.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.","Robert Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much. Wondering if you could give us some more insights into your business and commercial moment in China. I think in the opening comments you said you expect to see improvement in the second half. So, maybe some -- what are the drivers for that?","And then perhaps touch on how Dare to Love program is going with Alibaba? What are you seeing from that? Anymore progress or initiatives with Alibaba? And also touch on premiumization in China and Elmex? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Yes. Well, thanks Robert. China, as we said, made sequential improvement, but continued to be down as we work through the very complicated destocking areas to get the pricing -- substantial pricing that has been taken to the shelf.","And yes, you're right, as we said earlier, we expect that to be a journey and whilst we expect to see sequential improvement in the first half of the year, we don't expect to return to positive growth and will the second half. Share is a holding in okay. Consumption is holding in okay.","Dare to Love was repeated with Alibaba this year, but the important new news was Elmex. And that product started on team with Alibaba and it's up to over one share point. So, a reasonably good start for a slow-build therapeutic product. And we're quite pleased with that.","And as Noel mentioned, we'll be going with an at-home whitening offering in China online the same way that happens to be a high-growth area as well in China. So, a lot of plans in place. And we are just going to have the have the patience to work through it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is actually [Indiscernible] on for Bill. Thanks for taking the question. Our question was just on the balance between volume and pricing, particularly, in emerging markets this coming year. I think we kind of understand that the volume drag was due to that pricing in the back half of this past year, but kind of working forward, any thoughts on the timing based on competitive pricing actions that be able to start to see volume growth in the emerging markets coming middle of this year, back half of this year, kind of, any color around that would be great? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Yes, as you said we were pleased with the pricing that we have taken. And as you rightly say, there is always an impact on volume. So, as we think about it for next year, the plan we have is a balanced between pricing and volume. And it would be fair to say that the recovery of volume at least in the emerging markets as you say is spread across the year. Said from a big picture point of view, it is pricing-lead growth for the year, but there's a volume component.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Yeah, thanks, and good afternoon everybody. One quick follow-up and then just another question. On the China piece I was surprised pricing wasn't higher in Asia PAC given the degree of pricing that you're taking in China. So it sounds like maybe there's some timing some inventory work through still to come so that may explain it. But if you could you just help on that that would be great? And then secondly, just I wanted to know explore learnings from the professional skincare acquisitions from beginning of last year.","And if you look at the numbers, it seems like they've actually been pretty successful obviously on a small base. But curious what learnings you've had from that? And whether you could take the professional skincare into -- or would take the professional skincare into retail skincare or other channels. Is that something potentially you'd look to focus on? And kind of related to that given all that we've heard today a lot going on so is that even something with a priority at this point?","Ian Cook","Yes. Well thanks for the questions. Frankly, Mark, you answered your own first question. And that was what I was trying to imply by that these stocks are working through, so we are working the pricing to the consumer, but it is delayed as we work through the complicated inventory destocking.","But I didn't know where you were going to go with the professional skincare business in terms of our learning. I think one thing we would say is that we obviously as Noel said expanding the portfolio in the geographies that we have which we think will continue to drive the strong growth of that business.","The other thing I would comment at this stage in terms of the top line for North America you will remember that effective 2019 that PCA and Elta will now be incremental to the organic growth of North America which is a nice uptick for that business.","As to the idea of retail, I think our thinking is we are likely to take the model and expand more products in the portfolio to other locations as a first step, but I wouldn't rule out retail at a point in time. But I don't think given all of the other things as you suggested we are focus on this year that 2019 would be the year that we would consider that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks very much. So, how much\u2026","Ian Cook","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Feeney","Hi. So, how much do you think a below average microenvironment if roughly the way to think about restrained emerging market growth in 2018 because in light of what at least look like similar FOREX and macro trends in 2009 or even 2015 when your own numbers were a little bit better? There's anyway you can share it or maybe parse what's secular from what's cyclical in emerging markets would be helpful? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Well, I'm not a macroeconomist. So, what we tend to focus on is consumer behavior. Obviously, we -- the one where the lines crossed, if you will, was what we saw in Latin America with the lack of customary inflation which we think given the underlying commodity price pressures is beginning to come back.","I guess the other conclusion we have grown is that Mexico seems to be six months ahead of Brazil. And while we stay very vigilant on Brazil, an optimistic view would see that perhaps follow the same curve.","Beyond that, I wouldn't make any significant predictions. These are products that tend to be more fundamental usage products and we have enough bandwidth in our portfolio to scale down and scale up depending the way the market grows. And even in Brazil where the category has suffered, our market share has held up surprisingly well. Those are the only comments I think I'm informed enough to make.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, thank you. Ian my question is a follow-up on China. So, you sounded optimistic that the high-teens price increase in China is working its way there. But can you break down the performance between direct and indirect channels? Are the volumes still declining in both direct and indirect? And if inventory has normalized in the indirect channel?","And also more like fundamental question about that could you also just explain a little bit more what's driving the indirect channel to be actively seeking out the lower price Colgate products considering the commentary about China generally premiumizing. So, any color on that would be helpful? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Yes, interesting question Andrea. I think pricing generally moves to the direct trade more quickly than it does the indirect trade and we had made that point on the last call. And then when we talked about the destocking, I think, we laid out quite clearly the fact that the distribution go-to-market now has become enormously complicated in terms of the multiple ways people can buy a product whether it's a direct, whether it's indirect, whether it's online, whether it's offline.","And that is what created the complication compounded by the fact you have less visibility with the indirect channel than you do with the direct channel. So, it is the indirect channel, but remember the indirect channel in China still goes to modern trade outlets, supermarkets. So, it's that that's going to have to work its way through.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula","Hi, good afternoon. Ian you referenced a few times in the call so far that two-thirds of the price increases have already been secured. So my question is, if you by chance do not secure the other third of the intended price increases where would that place within the spectrum of your 30 to 50 basis points of gross margin expansion this year?","And then John for guardrail purposes, how do you think about operating profit dollar transfer the full year since EPS will be down mid-single digits? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes. I'll speak for John. In terms of -- actually the point of making the comment on the pricing was to suggest confidence that we will indeed realize all of the pricing, given that more than two-thirds of it is already in place now. And given what we know is the first half headwind in terms of raw materials and foreign exchange and given what we see and hear from competitors operating in similar spaces.","So unless you hear otherwise, our intention was to convey confidence in our ability to deliver the pricing. And in terms of operating profit as you know, we don't guide operating profit. We guide to the gross margin and the EPS. And to your point on gross margin, if we realize the pricing and our funding the growth ambitions of the year, we are comfortable with our 30 to 50 basis points guide on gross margin.","So I believe those are all of the questions. I thank you for joining the call and we look forward to talking with you in April. ","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and the most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and Table 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website.","Now, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.","John Faucher","Thanks, Alicia. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; Elaine Paik, Treasurer; and, Bina Thompson, Chief Investor Relations Officer.","On a reported basis, our net sales were down 4.5% in the fourth quarter primarily due to foreign exchange and the impact of the Venezuelan deconsolidation.","Organic sales were up 1.5% in the fourth quarter. The organic sales growth in the quarter was driven by improvement and pricing while volume excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela was down 1%. Pricing was up 2.5% in the quarter. Latin America was the driver of our organic sales growth this quarter posting continued volume growth, excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela and strong pricing. In other regions, we saw headwinds in several of our markets, some of which were driven by one-time factors like Indian demonetization and some distribution challenges in certain of our African businesses.","We also did see a slowdown in category growth later in the quarter in some markets. For the year, reported net sales declined 5%, while our organic sales grew 4%, driven by a combination of pricing and volume growth. For the full-year, organic sales grew in every division except Europe which is flat. Excluding the items testified in table eight of our press release, gross profit margin was up 180 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus fourth quarter of 2015 led by cost savings from our funding and growth initiatives and our restructuring program.","On a GAAP basis our growth profit margin was up 160 basis points in the fourth quarter 2016 from fourth quarter 2015. Excluding the items specified in table nine of our press release, our full-year growth profit margin rose 160 basis points to 60.3%. On a GAAP basis, our growth profit margin was up 140 basis points versus the year-ago period to 60.0%. Excluding the items specified in tables eight and nine of our press release, our operating profit was up 2% in the quarter and flat for the year. Operating profit on a GAAP basis was up significantly as we lapped a deconsolidation of our Venezuela and operation.","Excluding the items in table eight of the press release deluded earnings per share on a dollar basis for the fourth quarter was $0.75 up 3% year-over-year. On a full-year basis, deluded earnings per share on a dollar basis excluding the items in table nine of our press release was even with last year was up double digits on a currency neutral basis after also excluding Venezuela's results in both periods. On a GAAP basis EPS was up 79% year-over-year primarily due to the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela in fourth quarter 2015.","Very strong working capital performance we continue to grow our free cash flow further strengthening our balance sheet. For 2016, our net cash provided by operations was up 7%. A year-over-year reduction in capital expenditures as our restructuring program is entering its final stages meant a free cash flow before dividend was up 13% year-over-year. While the Q4 organic sale growth was lower than anticipated, we are optimistic that the pace of our growth will improve as we progress through the year drive by increased advertising support behind a full pipeline of new products around the world.","From an EPS standpoint on a dollar basis, the excluding charges from the 2012 restructuring program and the other 2016 items specified in table nine of our press release based on current spot rates, we are planning for growth in the low single digits. The main drivers versus our previous expectation are foreign exchange and flowing category growth in several key markets. We expect free cash flow before dividends to be strong in 2017, reflecting solid operational results and continued focus on working capital. Now, we'll go through the performance in the division.","First off North America. North American net sales, unit volume, pricing, foreign exchange and organic sales were all even with last year's fourth quarter. In the U.S., volume growth in two states was offset by declines in tooth brushes and liquid hand soap. In the quarter we saw strong volume growth for our Canadian business and put on demand. Operating profit declined 3% in the quarter. The gross profit margin expansion was more than offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expense. Up here, North American highlights in the quarter.","In the U.S., we finished the year with market share is either upper flat majority of our categories, our innovation continues to perform well. We have a strong pipeline plan as we head into 2017. Our premiumization strategy continues to pay dividend. The Colgate Optic White franchise finished 2016 with 6.4% market share year-to-date up 80 basis points year-over-year. We expect further momentum in 2017 behind this month launch Colgate Optic White variant. We are also seeing year-over-year improvement in market share as for our sense for sensitivity business helped by our latest launch of Colgate Sensitive Smart White toothpaste.","Tom's domain also posted a growth in the quarter in a year. Year-to-date Tom's toothpaste market share is up 20 basis points versus last year driven by new products particularly rapid relief sensitive toothpaste. Latin America finished the year strongly with organic sales growth of 10.5% in the fourth quarter. Including the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela and foreign exchange, net sales were down 10.5% for the quarter. We remind you that we have now lapped the Venezuela deconsolidation and 2017 numbers will not need to be adjusted.","Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela, we saw a volume growth of 1.5% in the quarter, with growth in markets including Mexico, Columbia and Argentina, partially offset by declines in Brazil. While currency and impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation resulted in a net sales decline in this division, productivity from funding the growth and pricing helped deliver 550 basis points of operating profit margin expansion. Thus operating profit grew in the quarter despite the net sales decline. Some highlights in Latin America include, in Brazil, our toothpaste share is at 73% year-to-date up one share point year-over-year.","We are seeing strong share growth in both Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. In Mexico we maintained toothpaste market leadership with an 81% share behind strength in our Colgate Luminous White brand with market share performance improving sequentially as we finish the year. We remain encouraged by the solid volume in organic sales performance of our Mexican business. Latin America should continue to see benefits from a strong innovation calendar in the second half of 2016. In personal care we've seen multiple innovations across the Protex, Palmolive, Speed Stick and Lady Speed Stick brands in the third and fourth quarter.","Now, moving to Europe. Europe's net sales and organic sales in the fourth quarter were down year-over-year, with sales impacted by macroeconomic condition, foreign exchange and difficult retail dynamics. Organic sales were down 3.5% in the quarter driven primarily by volume declines in France, where our categories flowed sharply in the quarter with the United Kingdom partially offsetting the decline. Operating profit in Europe was down 5% in the quarter, driven by the net sales decline. Operating profit margin was up 70 basis points in the percentage of sales driven by lower selling general and administrative expenses.","Our market share performance in Europe is solid. We continued our toothpaste share leadership at 35% of the market and our premium price Gard business continues to grow share, up 40 basis points here to date in Europe. We've seen regional share in market gains here-to-date in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, body lotion and fabric softener. Our manual toothbrush here is up 170 basis points for 2016 driven by the premium priced Colgate Max White toothbrush with built-in whitening pen. In Q1, we have significant new product news in toothpaste, behind the launch of Colgate Enamel Strength and our Colgate Natural Extracts toothpaste.","Now, Asia Pacific. Organic sales decline minus 2% in Asia Pacific with flat volume and negative pricing. Volume growth across most of the division was offset by a decline in India caused by the demonetization. The negative impact of foreign exchange further contributed to the net sales decline of 4% in the quarter. Operating profit was up 3% year-over-year, operating profit margin was up 240 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by lower selling general administrative expense.","And points on Asia Pacific include, as mentioned above, in India, demonetization cost us a swing from strong growth through Q3 to a decline in Q4. Our recent launch of Colgate Cibaca that sharply continues to gain momentum in the fast growing natural space. In greater China, we still have work to do. But our organic sales growth improve sequentially and our volume is positive for the quarter. Our online business is accelerating, offsetting most of the impact from a difficult offline market.","Now, Africa, Eurasia. Net sales in the region were down 1.5% in the quarter and organic sales declined 2%. Our Africa Eurasia business was negatively impacted by business disruptions with certain distributors primarily due to liquidity issues in Sub-Saharan Africa. Volume was down 12% in the quarter, driven by the Sub-Saharan Africa regions and South Africa. Pricing was up 10% and was positive across much of the region. Operating profit was down 4% in the quarter. Strong gross profit margin improvement driven by pricing and funding the growth was offset by increased advertising environment.","Overall, our toothpaste market share is an after Eurasia continued to trend positively with our shares up year-to-date and the majority of our markets in the division. Q4 highlights in Africa Eurasia include our toothpaste market share in Turkey continues to grow year-over-year driven by Colgate Total. Colgate Total brand market share is up 70 basis points year-to-date driven by the Colgate Total Pro line which shared growth for Pro Breath Health and Pro White. And in Saudi Arabia, the second largest Oral Care market in the region, our toothpaste market share is up a 100 basis points year-to-date driven by Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection, Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief and Colgate Total.","Now, finishing up with Hill. Q4 was a difficult quarter for Hill due to challenges in the pet facility channel. Organic sales were flat in the quarter as growth and pricing was offset by volume decline. Net sales were up slightly and included a benefit from slightly favorable currency. Operating profit grew 7% primarily driven by growth profit margin expansion as funding the growth savings and increased pricing and offset higher cost. In the U.S., our strong growth in online indust was more than offset by weakness in the pet facility channel. We continue to expand our online availability in the U.S. and our e-commerce growth in the quarter and the year was very strong.","We are also seeing significant growth in our online business in Europe, where e-commerce is an even bigger piece of the pet utility category. Developing market volumes were up nicely driven by Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic + Mobility and Metabolic + Urinary, Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet Derm Defense and Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet z\/d. That's it for the divisions, and with that I'm going to turn it over to Ian who has some thoughts on our 2017 outlook. Ian?","Ian Cook","Thanks, John. And good morning everyone and let me wish you all a happy and healthy 2017. What I'd like to accomplish this morning is two things. 1) Reflect a little bit on 2016 and 2) then talk more specifically about our plans for 2017 in the context of the fourth quarter we have just completed. I think it is safe to say that 2016 has been a year of growing uncertainty filled with unpredictable and disruptive events, especially in the fourth quarter when we saw significant foreign exchange volatility following the U.S. elections, the unexpected demonetization activity in India and category slowdown in several of our key markets.","Against that I would say, overall for 2016, we delivered solid performance overall. Topline organic sales growth up 4%, broadly healthy market shares as John has exampled in his remarks good gross margin progress up 160 basis points to 60.3% and just over 3.1 billion net operating cash flow up 7%. As we move into 2017, I think it's safe to say that the uncertainty continues and indeed there is likelihood of more events unpredicted occurring as the year unfolds.","So how are we planning for 2017 in the context of how we ended 2016 in the fourth quarter? From a high level point of view, I think we feel confident that the strategy we have been deploying for over a decade, a strategy that focuses on engaging with consumers developing a steady stream of innovation for those consumers focusing on the efficiencies that allow us to fund our growth and perhaps most importantly continuing to develop a cadre of talented leaders that we can deploy around the world to keep focusing on winning on the ground.","Secondly I would say that our discipline and focus on the fundamentals has served us well and will continue to serve us well. And my third point for 2017 would be that our over arching priority and objective focused against growth. So coming back to the categories as I mentioned categories and several key markets slowed in the fourth quarter and we are now seeing growth in our categories across each of them major geographies that take the following shape. For North America we are seeing our categories grow around 2%. In Europe we are seeing in aggregate categories basically flat.","And for our emerging markets we continue to see categories growth of mid single digits casted closely around 5%. so with that as a context of our consumers behavior the organic sales growth plan that we have for 2017 sees us targeting the low end about 4% to 7% point organic growth range. The growth we deliver in 2017 is expected to rely on less pricing with a sharpened focused on profitable volume growth for the full year starting in quarter one. And from an organic sales point of view we expect to see sequential improvement in quarter one.","The innovation pipeline that John talked to remains as robust as ever. We continue to invest in the capabilities that we need to serve new consumers and new places think e-commerce and as we said in the press release strong advertising support will be behind our brands and the innovation and I will return to that in a short while.","Now it's unusual for us to get country a specific data and detail but I think in a circumstances in the fourth quarter we feel it's important to clear on the understanding of why we have confidence in the growth for 2017. So let me offer a few comments by each of the divisions related to the organic sales growth that we are targeting for 2017 and let me start with Asia.","As John said the demonetization in India was indeed unexpected and that saw a high single digit organic sales growth business become in the quarter a double digit decline organic business. In fact, excluding India the division would have seen positive organic sales growth. So as we look forward into 2017 from that unexpected event we were pleased in the fourth quarter with the sequential progress we made in China and the return to volume growth we expect that sequential progress to continue in china and we expect the recovery in India to build across the first half.","For Africa-Eurasia, the actions we took against a selected number of distributors are behind us and the division would have seen positive organic sales growth without those actions. And we expect to see positive progress, inorganic sales beginning in the first quarter in that division.","In Europe, the decline traces largely to France and in France we saw strong category declines in the fourth quarter both in volumes and in value and the subsidiary in France in developing stronger plans that are being put in place with key customers to help drive category growth and our growth alongside the category.","In North America we also saw a slowdown in the category growth rates and consumer consumption and this was the one division we saw increased promotional activity which we are meeting in 2017. For Hills as John said, we posted strong e-commerce progress indeed our e-commerce growth in the United States with Hills was up from 60% our market share on e-commerce is higher than African motor share and we expect that growth as we expand e-commerce distribution to continue in 2017. That was more of an offset though by the weakness in the pet specialty category which again is being addressed by strengthened programs in partnership with the principal retailers there and the focuses as John said on channel mix.","And finally, Latin America although we expect to see continued growth in 2017. Now I mentioned the strong innovation pipeline. I mentioned the capabilities that we are investing in to reach consumers in new places. But I would like to return to advertising and make a couple of comments.","Number one, we will continue with our focus on customer marketing activities in store that can and do build categories and we are deploying that indeed as we speak. But turning to the traditional below the line advertising in our 2017 plan our advertising is up absolutely and as a percent to sales. It\u2019s advertising that is increasingly digital and mobile and we have planned for continuity of advertising across the year. The advertising will be behind the innovation that we have, the strong brand equities that we possess India for example Colgate was rated one more time the most trusted brand in the country and we will also have advertising focus behind the community programs that Colgate does in many countries. The turn off the tap type of advertising the scholarship program, advertising and advertising that relates to the school\u2019s programs that we have around the world. These are all proven vehicles to build the brand awareness, brand loyalty and induce trial. And we are substantially increasing our sampling in 2017 to further drive trial of the strong innovation we have.","Now for 2017, we are obsessive about protecting those investments. A sudden change in foreign exchange can put pressure on short term results given the lead lag of actions to offset the impact of that foreign exchange. We are not going to reduce our investments in advertising to deliver a quarterly number. What we are going to do is to focus relentlessly across all lines of the income statement on productivity. Our funding to growth program is as vibrant as ever and we will receive sharp focus.","As John said, we will redouble our efforts behind structural cost reduction in this last year of the global growth and efficiency program and we will from a category, a product and indeed the channel mix perspective focus on the premiumization that can be delivered with the consumer.","And from material cost point of view, the environment is relatively benign in 2017 with material cost estimated to be flat to modestly up with a little bit of pressure in fats and oils but a relatively muted landscape. So with that focus and with that landscape we expect our gross margin to be up at the high end of our 75 to 125 basis points range.","Tax rate for 2017 is assumed to be in the 31% to 32% range obviously any changes to tax policy from the new administration is not included in that estimate. We have obviously run many different scenarios, we are as informed on the matter as you are and obviously if anything firm arises we will inform you. I think I would say that we are certainly looking at tax holistically or the different tax policies that maybe adopted, and if one uses holistically we would expect it to be a net benefit but again our current tax rates of 31% to 32% doesn't include any assumed benefit.","So to summarize our plan will see us growing at the low end about 4% to 7% organic sales range with sequential improvement beginning in quarter one. For 2017, its growth with less pricing and a sharper focus on profitable volume growth. It's growth supported by innovation, it's growth supported by investment and capability and it's growth supported by advertising that is up absolutely and as a percent to sales and planned for continuity.","And of course we have the clear focus on the ground plans and executional discipline to help accelerate that growth and that is our primary focus in 2017. Gross margin as I said at the high end of our 75 to 125 basis points range strong net operating cash flow expected as you have seen in the release earnings per share of low single digits in dollar terms and an absolute focus by folk in our company on delivering the growth across 2017.","So those were mine prepared remarks and now we would be delighted to open the call to questions. Hello?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] We will go first to Caroline Levy of CLSA Americas LLC.","Caroline Levy","Thank you very much. Could you just quickly tell us what your thinking is on the currency hit to EBIT and earnings and then as I always do ask, Ian if you could talk a little bit about the climate in China and Brazil those two countries which seems to, Brazil seem to deteriorated meaningfully for the first time for you China the bricks and motor business maybe has deteriorated as well, so if could just touch on those two that would be great?","Ian Cook","Yes I think, the foreign exchange from a ForEx point of view when I was estimating it was about 3% obviously the bottom line impact is more so the change from the guidance we provided, preliminary guidance we provided before entering our budgeting process is really composed of two factors. One is the foreign exchange and the second is based on the assumptions I just went through the fact that we have recognized slow market growth into our planning for next year.","Turning to China and Brazil, I would say two cases, Brazil is indeed in challenging economic times as John said overall in Latin America we have been very pleased with our performance. We note that several companies have been negative on Brazil I think half of you would be our market shares continue to be strong in that country and indeed growing as John said. We have taken pricing necessary to offset foreign exchange in part and we have seen some slow down in category growth with negative volumes from time to time. So we are just going to keep focusing on growing our market shares in Brazil and overall in Latin America expect a healthy business there to continue.","Regarding China again we were pleased that the fourth quarter show us make sequential improvement which had been our plan. We were particularly pleased to see volume growth come back positive. Our market shares are holding well. You are correct that our e-commerce business has loads of potential. We grew dramatically in China. We have a completely standalone team that focuses on driving that business in China. But we do have opportunity to increase our market share further because in China our market share is not in line with our brick and motor share yet on e-commerce so that gives us plenty of opportunity to grow.","So, we remain I must say overall very committed to the emerging markets. We see a strong consumer base there. We have strong brand loyalty there and we continue to see good opportunity for growth there.","Caroline Levy","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Wendy Nicholson of Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, good morning. My first question is really just the follow-up I mean when you talked us in late October it didn't sound like the world is falling off as much as it clearly did for your business and other than the India demonetization which is an extraordinary event, I am surprised things all decelerated as they did. So I guess my first question is on with your guidance to planning to see sequential improvement in 2017 what\u2019s your confidence kind of where we are set here end of January that the first quarter will impact show an improvement from 1.5% and then kind of tucked on to that and sorry for the long question but Colgate has long had this 4% to 7% organic growth target and you haven't been there for a while and I am just wondering if it's time to look at that reset that at least take maybe six and seven part of that guidance off the table and if you were to do that would you be able to take another hard look at your cost structure and maybe have another restructuring program? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Good. Well thanks for the question Wendy. Yes, we feel confident in sequential improvement which is why we say it and why we went through the divisions making the comments we have made. And you are right that we\u2019re a collection evidence that impacted us in the fourth quarter one has to say that the foreign exchange aspect of things was a surprise to most surely, the India demonetization was a surprise but what gives us confidence are the reasons I have laid out in my prepared remarks in terms of we understood what needed to be addressed.","We are in the process of addressing them. And therefore, the plan we have is precisely that wondered sees us sequentially improving in the first quarter and sees us driving full growth at the low end of that 4% to 7% range.","Another restructuring Wendy I think the way I would rather comment that is understand the intensity behind the language when we say that we are going to be relentless in driving the last year of our current restructuring program which clearly focuses on structural cost and as again we have said in a world that is slowing even more that it had. So, we recognize the challenge and we are being and will continue to be relentless on taking advantage of the opportunity of this last year of the restructuring program to address that structural cost.","Wendy Nicholson","And when you think about what happened in the fourth quarter, sort of the zigs and zags, I mean, one of the markets that I think is most interesting to me is France, not that it's all that large or what but not it strikes me as a very stable market generally and for it to turn negative in terms of category growth surprises me and I just wonder maybe on forgetting history and developed markets have always been so economically sensitive when it comes to toothpaste. But can you make any comments on that whether that is \"Oh yes, not a surprise\" or \"Oh yes, that's kind of something new and different that we haven\u2019t seen before?\"","Ian Cook","Well clearly, France category is turning negative was not a pleasant or expected event. I think there is public information out there that says that some retailers in France have suffered from the same problem which is to say consumer purchasing weakness in France. So, you're certainly seeing deflation in France and indeed in some categories, volume reduction. So, the focus has to be to right that with your customer partners on two things. 1) Is innovation that is price accretive, so that you can grow the category volume and hopefully the volume and 2) the brand marketing and in-store customer marketing to drive consumption at the retail level?","So, the sharpness of the slowdown was a surprise.","Wendy Nicholson","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Ian Cook","Hi, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","Hi, how are you?","Ian Cook","Wonderful.","Dara Mohsenian","It sounds like guidance for 2017 assumes a lower level of pricing growth. I'm just trying to get a sense of you expecting a significant change in pricing, obviously you mentioned North America, but are there any issues with price gaps in other regions and then we talk to more about tweaks to promotional levels or could there be less price changes. And then the second part of that is you also mentioned higher marketing spending in 2017, how comfortable are you that you get a tangible topline payback from the higher marketing as well as the incremental promotion given it seems like from an industry perspective the volume payback in those areas is less than it's been historically recently. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Okay, Dara. Well, so on pricing, when we talk SPI selling price increases, we simply had in our plan less pricing and because commodity pressures are more benign and transaction impact have lessened. A large part of that pricing is indeed carryover pricing from year-to-year. When you talk promotion and tweaking promotional level that has been for us largely in North America where we did see stepped up promotional activity in the fourth quarter and we have made some pricing gap adjustments in China on our business which has returned us to the volume growth, which we plan to build on in 2017.","But beyond that, I would also know broad scale observation. On marketing spend, again the focus here is growth. We have like everybody else, return on investment model. I think when you talk about in-store activity or shorter marketing if you will, you're talking more about what can you do to induce purchase of higher priced products with less reliance on price at retails. So, I think that needs to be the focus rather than diminishing return. And on the advertising side of things, given the strength of our advertising, of our brand and given the strength of their innovation, we see that it's a very good return particularly with the effectiveness of advertising but I tried to elude to earlier and the continuity of advertising overtime.","And of course, from an e-commerce point-of-view that has very good return and from a digital marketing point-of-view that has very good return as well. So, we're quite comfortable with the return side of things, I think what one has to try and guard against is a devolution into zero sum promotion pricing, so we're reaching where we need to but it's certainly not something we're looking to leap.","Dara Mohsenian","Great, thanks.","Ian Cook","Good, Dara.","Operator","We'll go next to Stephen Powers of UBS.","Stephen Powers","Great, thanks. First just a follow-up on France. I know you said that the category slowdowns in that market at least on toothpaste according to the Nielsen data that I'm looking at. This is appear more company specific than category? I think Nielsen has Colgate volumes down 30% December period relative to flat for the category with Unilever, Glaxo and Han hold the beneficiary. So, just some more commentary on that will be great.","And like a tuck on, a forward looking question. I know, John cited category dissolvation and dissolvations and effects really explain the lower EPS outlook. But I was somewhat surprised not to hear elevated competition in that algorithm as well. So, just any thoughts there would be appreciated because your gross margin outlook doesn't apply significant competitive pressure either. So, again just your outlook on a competitor pressure and how that changed all since your October outlook. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes. First let's start with the comment on France. And I was trying to be shall we say broad based in my remarks earlier. The fact of the matter is we have had an issue with a retailer in the French environment which is resolved and will see us back where we were before in the first half of the year. So, that's the specificity to the Colgate aspect of France, but it takes nothing away from the fact that on the other categories, the category declines were sharp and meaningful. But on the Colgate brand specifically, there was a customer issue which is now being addressed in a mutually exemptible fashion and we'll see business trading return to normal in the first half of this year.","Now, as we got competitive pressure, the one that we have spilled out is frankly the only one that we see between beyond what has been normative in our markets and that is in North America and that is one that we have stepped up to address within our planning guidelines for 2017.","Hello?","Stephen Powers","Oh, that's great. I didn\u2019t know my, I didn\u2019t know it's still opened. Thank you very much for that. If I am open, could I just have you comment on the tax scenarios that you had run and just the range of impact that your scenarios point to?","Ian Cook","Yes. I'm not open, Steve.","Stephen Powers","Okay.","Ian Cook","No. The answer would be, I don\u2019t think that's time well spent, which is why we try to frame our comments in the holistic sense. I mean, nothing is firm, you all know what the range is out there are and that's why we try to give the headline that from a holistic point-of-view, plus minus we would expect the net benefit to be favorable. And really I think that's enough to say at this stage.","Stephen Powers","Alright thank you very much.","Operator","We will go next to Ali Dibadj of Sanford Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","So, I guess the stock reaction would suggest that there is still a debate about what you are saying and kind of brief in acceleration and what I am really hearing from investors just to going some of the previous question is that investor really want to understand and to figurate your top line organic slowdown and expect acceleration further than they have done so far. So just thinking on that a little bit can you tell us kind of what your precise number what percentage of deceleration category in yours would you attribute to macro versus kind of one time like in France versus competition and if you say the bulk is not competition like I think you did to seize the question.","Second ago I would want to know that the list of countries you are losing share has grown so Mexico, India, China, France, U.K. now over the years it's definitely grown and as you look forward what you are expecting to change from either macro or competition or one time to see the top line acceleration or is it really just your own activities to improve and get deceleration?","Ian Cook","Yes, I mean just aggregating all of that, I mean particularly the competitive activity piece is almost impossible. And in fact, we don't break it down that way. So the largest change that shapes our top-line projection for 2017 was the reduction on category growth, the lessening in category growth that we are seeing that we have simply re-planned against and we see our top-line growing for the reasons I have said.","When you come to the competitive activities the kind of shares you are talking about is I mean take Mexico which I think John talked to our share is about 81 and in the prior it was just over 81 that's on a value basis. Our market shares in general Ali, if you go through them if there are slippages they are quite modest slippages and they are not accelerating in any way with the exception of the French matter on Colgate that I just described. So I mean what we think will build our business is innovation, is the advertising that we are committing to including the in-store advertising but with a commitment to the brand advertising and the manner that I have described. A focus on the fundamentals that at retail and I think from a competitive activity point of view we will be responsive where we need to be responsive from a competitive point of view but we don't want to do it in a zero sum game fashion.","Ali Dibadj","So that's helpful. Thank you. The reason I am well maybe what\u2019s behind kind of the question I had got a little bit is that if you really been able to leverage even the lower end of the 4% to 7% organic sales growth target that you have been delivering, question for the past few years the lower end of that, into double digit EPS growth ex-currencies. But for 2017 it's surely doesn't seem like that is something you are able to do suggesting you are going to have to spend more back and I am trying to kind of get underneath that in terms of but you\u2019re not getting those details for this year but your top-line is roughly you are saying what it's going to be well what it has been so you are spending more back why?","Right so is it that you are feeling when I\u2019m buying on China being more aggressive Procter or PATANJALI whoever have you lost a little bit of the mojo, like why are you spending more back if it's not competition I guess what I am trying to get at?","A \u2013 Ian Cook","I guess the answer would be and I think what we are beginning to see through this earning cycle is that growth in many places has indeed slowed further. And so, what we are saying is what is a reasonable growth objective in uncertain times and how do we ensure that we build our brands to deliver that growth at this unique point in time.","And so, we are saying I mean I think the gross margin expansion is quite strong. I think from a top-line point of view organic sales growth at the low end of our range will certainly put us in a good comparison group and the focus on the restructuring that I mentioned earlier and further driving down on structural cost will equip us to be leaner going forward if this rate of growth in the will doesn't reaccelerate and so I am saying we are saying that we think it is right at this point in time to overweight focus on growth and but it is growth of our businesses at a time when sure all competitors are looking to do the same thing in a slowing world everyone is still looking to grow. So from the big picture point of view it's always a competitive environment what I am trying to delineate against is we believe in the quality of our innovation to drive our business against competitors when I talk promotion it's more in-store pricing promotion which we would rather put against trial for new innovation but we will be competitive where we need to be competitive and I think that's the year we are looking at.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. Thank you very much. ","Operator","We will go next to Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","Yes. Thanks and good morning. The question is on category growth. So can you give any context of clarity on in fact what\u2019s driving some of the down drop in the category growth? Is this trade down? Is this frequency? Is it inventory outside of obviously which you talked about South Africa? Any context around that would be really helpful?","Ian Cook","Yes. I think there are few elements to this. And it's not a generalized statement for the world. Obviously, there are \u2013 there in some parts of the world particularly Europe deflation as pricing comes down to stimulate volume in some categories we have seen that for several years and that remains unabated. From a consumer behavior point of view, they don't go away from the behavior of brushing their teeth.","They will exhaust pantry inventories so which is to say people have more than one toothpaste at home they may try and scratch that tube before they reload their own pantry. There is as we have seen sort of a subtle inventory correlation to a slowdown in categories. So these are all components factors I mean from the pent off study Colgate is in two thirds of the households on the planet and we are very disciplined and very focused on in making sure our in-home penetration stays that elevated levels. So if there is any sort term slowdown from a volume point of view due to pantry destocking in the like that will bounce back afterwards. So, I wouldn't point to anything Nik that says there is down the line behavioral change here that is of concern.","Operator","We will go to our next question from William Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz","Hi, good morning.","Ian Cook","Hi Bill.","William Schmitz","Can you just bridge the gap between the old sort of 10% local currency EPX as growth to five because maybe a point of it is some sort of category growth but where is the other 4% shortfall coming from the follow-up?","Ian Cook","It\u2019s foreign exchange Bill, I mean the two principal elements are now this is against the preliminary guidance we gave in October to where we are now so it is simply the foreign exchange and the lower category growth which is reflected in our growth target for the year. It's those two things.","William Schmitz","I thought before 10% local currency growth and it seems like the implied guidance now is 5% local currency growth. Am I incorrect?","Ian Cook","No. No. sorry I was misunderstanding. no. no. the implied currency guidance is 5% and that is structurally driven by the income statement I mean the growth we have the margin expansion and the investment we choose to make behind the business.","William Schmitz","Okay. Was it not 10% before? Am I off? I thought it was like you thought 10% local currency was the right number and now it's five.","Ian Cook","Yes. It was 10% in -- now. And we are saying that the two differences are foreign exchange and volume.","Operator","We will take our next question from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Thanks. So, on the advertising margin change because is your view to get back to sort of a historical levels about 100 basis points higher as a percentage of sales and where you said now because assuming there isn't something really different below the line it would seem to suggest the fairly move upwards in operating expense to our outlook, your EPS outlook and then on the other hand it turns out that you need to spend more to drive top-line improvement how willing are you to do that if it does end up impacting EPS?","Ian Cook","I think for 2017 we have stepped up our advertising quite meaningfully from 2016 and we believe in uncertain time with clearly slowing category growth with the innovation pipeline we have it is to our advantage in 2017 to invest that advertising deliver that growth and keep consumers with our brands. So we think it's a good level Olivia I mean we have planned due diligently and we are very satisfied with the advertising level we have as I said it includes a sharp uptake in sampling as well. And these are all into the programs that we have on the ground behind brands and the new products that we have. So we think the plan holistically is an appropriate plan for 2017.","Operator","We will go to next to Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. First on Hill, some work around the channel it looks as we have been hearing anyways that at least one of your brands has been dealers in yield one maybe fall through as a major specialty channel but also hearing that there is some innovation on the pipeline potentially so any comment you could make around the Hill business as it relates to that new products or just progress there I would appreciate it.","Secondly, in India I know great business for you historically you mentioned the behavior doesn't really change and it's quite a bit of inventory in anybody pantry of Colgate product. Does this mean that you are going to restock in India and you get better performance at this point in the next six months? Thank you very much.","Ian Cook","On your second point, I would love to think so Jonathan but I wouldn't count on it. The purpose we have in India right now is simply rebuilding the pipeline over the first half of the year if we get a rebound then wonderful.","On the Hill let me sort of paint a broader context here. The strategic decision that we have taken based on consumer behavior is to keep our brands specialty which is obviously a brick and motor channel and go where our consumers are going and our consumers are going e-commerce. And they are going to the traditional places you would expect, the Amazons and the [indiscernible] of this world and their rate of adaption of buying our products on e-commerce is very elevated so we are moving there.","The brick and motor retailers that you principal pet specialty retailers we have not been delisted from either retailer. We have good plans with one and we are in discussion with the other and the one short term difficulty we have with the second retailer is that our shelf location and the number of SKUs we have in the store have been both reduced and moved to another position. And we believe that we can together develop a win, win solution for that to rebuild the business in the brick and motor at the same time as we are driving it online and on Hills innovation we have considerable innovation in Hill's for confidentiality reasons I prefer not to talk about it but that's the story on Hills in the U.S. John.","Operator","We will go to next to Lauren Rae Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman","Thanks. Good morning.","Ian Cook","Good morning Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman","Two things one was just on the two and half things the conversation around category growth, Ian it was great when you walk through kind of your outlook by broad region but I am not sure with the changes like you asset to Europe at flattish number market of 5 kind of feel like where we have been so I am just curious what\u2019s change. Second thing was on the build from kind of double-digit in dollars to lose single digit in dollar for EPS, Fx and volume, is it more pricing because I am hard pressed to think that you were previously forecasting volume growth as six and now it's four given you said it's going to be more volume than price leading so it is your outlook on pricing perhaps has changed more than volume.","And then, finally just SG&A was actually up quite a bit and I was just curious on the percentage of sales, given your commentary on focused on restructuring and taking cost out was there anything particular in the quarter on SG&A to be mindful of? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes. So on the category growth yes it has changed actually Lauren. In the U.S. we were seeing two to three and you may remember me commenting I was getting widely exuberant that it was moving to three so that has now come down by a percentage point. Europe was always flat to modestly up. The range of Europe is now negative to modestly up therefore flat overall. And in the emerging markets well I used to talk mid single digits the reason I talked 5% now is the single included a number with a six in front of it and that is now off the table. So those shifts are real and that is what is build into our planning. So, if I go back on your second point if I go back to our planning, indeed is it is all volume because pricing is more or less at the same level we had in the original plans slightly higher in fact. So it's all volume. And then, finally your point on SG&A up that's still a leverage. So deleverage rather the actually a dollar overhead is down but with the impact on the top-line and the amount of dollar denominated over, we have we don't benefit from a ratio basis which is why we talked about relentlessly focusing on our cost structure in this last year of the restructure, I think those two or three questions.","Operator","We will go to next to Jason Gere of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason Gere","Okay. Thanks. I will just make this really quick. I guess first just in terms of the re-acceleration on the volume. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how excited you are about some of the innovation coming out? I know there is innovation every year but certainly with this kind of 1.5% volume which in the third quarter put aside challenges of the fourth quarter but sounds like you are getting back to 3% range. How much of this can you contribute to really the innovation the step up innovation what\u2019s coming out with obviously giving away any trade secrets and then the second question just on pricing being just a small contributor this year can you just talk maybe about where you are still taking pricing?","I know a lot of it is roll over from last year, maybe how we should think about Latin America contributing versus where you are still going to have price investment such as Europe so obviously the two will offset each other just on the grey. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes. The trouble is that Jason, if I was to display enthusiasm you wouldn't notice the difference. So in terms of volume acceleration re-acceleration part of it is building back from the onetime events that we mentioned. So that\u2019s an important part of it and the strengthened plans we have in place as I detailed earlier and innovation is the strong part of it. We tend to be fairly low key in terms of talking about innovation and I plan to continue that tradition but John mentioned some I would just say we have a broad array of good innovation and we will be driving that starting in the first quarter across the year but I wouldn't lay innovation as the out-sized re-accelerate growth in the first quarter. It will part of it but it certainly won\u2019t be all of it and on pricing I mean I think the way you should think about it is that in the main, much about pricing has been to offset the transaction impact of foreign exchange and therefore you can assume that the pricing taken or being deployed now is in regions that says face those kinds of challenges but I repeat our focus for 2017 is on growth and our focus within growth is on profitable volume growth.","Jason Gere","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We will go to next to Linda Bolton Weiser of B. Riley.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Yes. Thanks. I just had a question of on the pet care area. Can you just explain why the e-commerce penetration is higher in Europe? Is it just as the brick and motor is less developed there or is there an actual difference in how consumers are approaching the market?","And then, secondly can you explain if does the trend towards immunization, is it disconnected from the general economic strength and high consumer confidence like in the U.S. in the pet care or is it actually linked to it? So as the economy strengthens is it actually easier to get premiumization or get consumers interested in spending more on their pets in the U.S.? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes. Frankly Europe and I don't mean anything political by this, Europe is a smaller geography than the U.S. and more urbanized and when you think of the literal volume of those bags the convenience factor for e-commerce in Europe is much higher for the consumer and that is the big driver of why the adaption for bulky products is so high. And premiumization look people pay for value and what they perceive as value is not just price. And therefore, and we have said this before the reason your focus is on innovation is to create value that the consumer believes is good value even if the price is a premium price to what he or she may otherwise buy. ","Operator","We will go next to Stephanie Benjamin of SunTrust Investment Bank.","Stephanie Benjamin","Hi, this is actually Stephanie on for Bill Chapel, just a quick question. Do you really expect any impact to your pet veterinary business from the recent mars acquisition of BCA? Thanks.","Ian Cook","I think the short answer is no. You may know that Mars also own another group called Banfield we have very strong shares in both BCA and Banfield with that Hill's business Mars have said, they\u2019ve owned Banfield for coming on a decade Mars have said that they will let BCA run as an independent group and you should know for BCA pet nutrition products are about 5% of their sales. So that's not really their business. So the headline answer would be no.","Operator","We will go next to Mark Astrachan of Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Yes. Thanks. And good afternoon guys. I wanted to ask about growth by category sort of a different way versus what we were talking about from country standpoint. Anything notable specific to home care, personal care, oral care in terms of your own expectations and perhaps even so how are you thinking about that now versus maybe three to six months ago and then just quickly on something different expectations for spend in EPS. How are you thinking about the assumptions for category and competition meaning your expectations for the increased ads spend out in the percent of sales, is that assume the competition is greater than equal or less than where you were in 2016 will be helpful?","Ian Cook","Yes. In terms of your spending question I mean that's a very complicated question. We build spend based on what we see by market from competitors. Now these days you don't see everything because some of the online spending is not tracked. So there is an estimated components of it. And so you structure the spend to be adequately competitive. I am not talking the traditional advertising spend. And as I have said we plan it then to be continuous for the year behind innovation, behind the brand and sometimes behind our community programs where you see the greatest short term changes and I commented on North America is more in promotion than in the traditional advertising.","So, we have built a plan for 2017 that we think is adequately competitive and strong enough to drive the innovation we have and the brand equity is that we have around the world.","Now when you get into categories we have a very clear strategic view which doesn't change depending on what happens in a quarter. So our strategic view is that we focus in order of priority behind oral care, pet nutrition, personal care, and home care in that order. That has been our focus because of the continuing underlying growth rates of the categories even if they slowed and because of the margin profile of each of the businesses. So our category decisions strategically are informed by the categories not by quarterly events.","Operator","We will go next to Jason English of Goldman Sachs & Co.","Jason English","Hey guys thanks for squeezing me in.","Ian Cook","Hi Jason.","Jason English","Happy Friday to you.. Quick question on the Africa-Eurasia distributor I thought you had to work through I apologize I missed in prepared remarks but I don't think I heard a lot of detail. Can you walk us through what happened there? And then second question is on capital allocation. Your share repurchase activity was a bit less \u2013 a bit more this past year. You are sitting on more cash than usually and you are \u2013","Ian Cook","Let me talk again about Africa-Eurasia. It was distributor issues with a select number small number of distributors. It had to do with liquidity because cash liquidity because of foreign exchange moves and it was moving business away from distributors and indeed bringing back some inventory. I guess the tailing point about we made in our prepared remarks was that the division growth would have been positive from an organic sales point of view without that event and that we expect organic sales progress to recommence in the first quarter of 2017. Relative to capital allocation it our current thinking going into the year is that our share repurchase will be broadly in-line with the share repurchase since we made in 2016.","Operator","At this time we have no further questions.","A - Ian Cook","Okay.

Today's call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Bina H. Thompson","Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, and these statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements. For information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements.","We will discuss organic sales growth, excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. We will also discuss gross profit, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, excluding the impact of the onetime items described in the press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.colgatepalmolive.com","We're very pleased with our second quarter results, particularly in light of an increasingly unpredictable global economy. Of particular note is our organic sales growth, which was positive in every division and up double-digit in the emerging markets, accelerating from the first quarter's strong pace. The total company organic sales growth of 8% reflected a good balance between volume of 4.5% and price of 3.5%. Our market shares are strong around the world, and our categories are growing. Even in the developed markets, we see category growth, albeit modest. And we believe we have the right strategies and plans in place for 2012 and beyond. As you know, 1 of our 4 strategic initiatives is innovation for growth, and that focus has been one of the key drivers of our top line momentum. You'll hear more about recent launches as well as new products to come when we go through the divisions.","Gross margin increased 50 basis points and continues to be higher than the fourth quarter of last year. The increase was somewhat less than previously anticipated due primarily to higher foreign exchange transaction costs from a rapidly strengthening dollar during the quarter. However, we expect gross margin to increase sequentially in the third and fourth quarter, and to be up within our targeted range of 75 to 125 basis points for the full year. Our increase in margin and control of overheads has allowed us to increase advertising, both absolutely and as a percent of sales, as we told you we would. And with EPS as expected, overall a healthy income statement. Earnings per share increased 6% and was up strong double-digit on a currency-neutral basis. Our balance sheet remains strong, both inventory and receivable days declined year-over-year and our free cash flow before dividends increased 8%.","So then let's turn to the divisions. First, starting with North America. Our business in North America remains solid. Our categories are still growing, and we are growing even faster. Both for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, our all-outlet market shares are up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, liquid hand soaps, bar soaps, body wash, all-purpose cleaners and fabric conditioner. Our strong advertising support behind a broad array of new products has helped drive these results.","We're very pleased with the continued strong performance of Colgate Optic White toothpaste and are very excited about the launch this quarter of Colgate Optic White mouthwash to complete the existing regimen of toothpaste and toothbrush. This mouthwash, our first entry into the U.S. market, effectively whitens teeth and freshens breath. The alcohol-free formula helps prevent -- protect against future stains and reaches hard-to-brush areas. It kills bad breath germs, while being enamel-safe. Reception by the trade has been excellent.","In addition to the mouthwash, we're also launching Colgate Optic White enamel white toothpaste, which fortifies enamel through mineralization for strong teeth while providing a whitening benefit. This bundle addresses a large segment of whitening users and nonusers who fear long-term enamel damage. Enamel variance grew 22% in 2011 and now represent almost 6% of the toothpaste market.","In personal care, in both liquid hand soap and body wash, we are expanding our fragrant footprint with Softsoap Pampered Hands Coconut Lime Foaming Hand Soap and Softsoap Citrus Splash & Berry Fusion body wash. The body washes are created with real fruit extracts and best-in-class, wake-me-up fragrances, along with strong, invigorating graphics to help differentiate the products on the shelf.","In the dish liquid category, we're launching Palmolive Fresh Infusions. This new line addresses the mass market consumers' desire for affordable luxuries. The line has premium looking packaging combined with naturally inspired fragrances: lemon thyme, ginger white tea and lime basil. Priced at a premium to a regular Palmolive dish liquid, the product also is expected to deliver category growth for our customers.","Europe\/South Pacific. The macroeconomic environment in Europe continues to be difficult, with low consumer confidence and high unemployment in many countries. But despite that, we were able to achieve positive volume and organic sales growth. And as well, the decline in price largely the result of increased in-store activity, was the lowest it has been in 10 quarters. And we're still seeing growth across many of our categories, albeit at a modest pace.","As referenced in the press release, we are increasing our strong oral care market shares in much of the region. And as you would expect, we have a rich array of new products planned for the balance of the year to continue to grow share and volume.","In the oral care category, we'll be relaunching our Colgate Max White One line in the impactful red packaging that has been used so successfully in both the U.S. as Colgate Optic White and in Latin America as Colgate Luminous.","The bundle will include toothpaste, toothbrush and mouthwash. As you would expect, there will be fully integrated marketing to support the bundle's benefit of \"one shade whiter in one week that lasts.\"","To address the problem that 3 out of 4 people may suffer from gum problems, we are also launching a full regimen to fight gum problems. Colgate Total Pro Gum Health, which includes toothpaste, toothbrush, mouth rinse and interdental devices. The toothpaste is proven to reduce gum problems by up to 88%.","A relaunch of our professional line of mouthwashes transitioning to cylindrical bottles will offer a more modern and cleaner presentation, while at the same time, representing a Funding-the-growth opportunity.","In personal care, we're rolling out a range reinvention for both our Palmolive Naturals shower gel line with new and improved packaging, new formulas and new innovative variance as well as for our Palmolive men's shower gel.","Under our recently acquired Sanex brand, we will introduce double protect deodorant for men, approved by dermatologists. This provides highly effective 48-hour protection against body odor caused by everyday stress as well as wetness caused by physical activity.","Another line of Sanex deodorants under the Zero% brand will continue to be rolled out across the regions. This has natural mineral alum to provide natural efficacy.","Latin America. The strong growth momentum continues throughout Latin America. Organic sales growth accelerated from the first quarter to over 15%, despite a much more difficult year-over-year comparison. Market shares increased year-over-year in virtually every category, the only exception being deodorant, where we were level with the year-ago period and hair care, where we declined modestly.","Our strong growth in toothpaste market share, up 130 basis points year-over-year to 79.2%, is driven by innovation. Colgate Luminous White, launched in Brazil and Mexico in October, reached 5.4% and 5.7%, respectively, in year-to-date national readings. We expanded the bundle this year to Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, Central America and Peru. Colgate Luminous White now accounts for 3% of the market across the region with only one SKU. Our regional manual toothbrush share increased 130 basis points year-over-year. We are market leaders everywhere but Mexico, where we are fast closing the gap. Our share there is at 41.9% year-to-date, with the latest reading at 43.4%.","Regional mouthwash market shares are up 530 basis points on a year-to-date basis to 37.5%, with the latest reading at 37.9%. So we expect the momentum to continue in this region as we introduce more innovation into the market in the second half across categories.","Colgate Total Professional Gum Health toothpaste, mentioned earlier for Europe, was successfully launched in Brazil in the first quarter and is now being launched in Mexico, where our toothpaste market share is now over 83%. This month in Brazil, we're launching Colgate Luminous White Enamel Shine Gel, with a similar positioning to the enamel variance we are launching in the U.S. market.","In personal care, we're launching a line of Palmolive Naturals pomegranate across bath and shower gel liquid hand soap and bar soap. We also have some exciting new products in the deodorant category later in the year. And in home care, we are introducing Fabuloso, our all-purpose cleaner, with an even higher fragrance level to provide more fragrance all day. This should help continue to drive our strong regional cleaner share of 24%.","Greater Asia\/Africa. Organic sales in this region were strong, up 12% as in Latin America, an acceleration from the excellent first quarter results. Across Asia, as referenced in our press release, toothpaste shares are strong. In India, our year-to-date market share is up to 52.8%, with the most recent reading at 53.8%. Both lower priced as well as premium priced variance contributed to the share growth, increasing consumption in the rural, as well as urban areas.","In China, our toothpaste share climbed to 33.7%, up 150 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Both tea flavored and whitening toothpaste variants are meeting with success in that vast market.","We've spoken to you before about success in the mouthwash category, and that continues, particularly as we expand Colgate Plax Fresh Tea mouthwash across the region. This new product was first launched in China in March of last year. And in the first half of this year expanded to Thailand, Hong Kong, The Philippines, Vietnam, India and Malaysia. The launch has been supported by a fully-integrated marketing campaign, including trial-generating sampling programs, and has added incremental shares. Our overall mouthwash share is up to 20.5% in the latest period from 10.8% in 2009. Our recent launch in Thailand, for instance, drove our share from 16.1% to 21.2%, with Plax Fresh Tea accounting for 3 full share points. And we've had similar success in Hong Kong and The Philippines.","Building on these strong results, we will continue to roll out the bundle to other countries in the region in the second half of this year. Another successful innovation in oral care is our Slim Soft toothbrush. The tapered bristle segment is the fastest-growing segment in Asia and has a very big presence in Thailand. Therefore, this was a lead market and we launched there in April of this year. We've achieved over a 3 share in 3 months since the launch, with an increase in our overall share as well. In-store activities, which contributed to this success, were planogram placement next to the leading competitor, product testers, off-shelf display and toothbrush consultants who explained the product benefits. Follow-on countries in the quarter were China, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, and we expect to launch it in other countries in greater Asia and Africa in the second half of this year.","Hill's. As in every other division, Hill's delivered organic sales growth in the quarter. Our new product launches are beginning to bear fruit, and we'll have more activity throughout the second half of the year. Here in the U.S., our recent launch of Science Diet Ideal Balance has met the objective of positioning us better to compete against the natural segment. The product is now in full distribution and benefiting from the launch of companion Ideal Balance treats in the month of June.","In the Pet Superstores, 55% of Ideal Balance consumers are new to the Hill's brand and coming from natural brands. In addition, in the U.S., we will be relaunching our entire Science Diet line with a more consumer-friendly ingredient profile. For example, the diet will not contain any byproducts. Across Europe, we will be relaunching our Science Plan line with a much improved taste profile. As you know, Prescription Diet is also an important part of our business here in the U.S., where our products are recommended 7:1 by veterinarians. We've told you previously about Prescription Diet y\/d with breakthrough technology for thyroid health in cats. Launched both here and across Europe, it has met with great success in the veterinary community and further built our credibility in the area of therapeutic nutrition. Another successful new product is Prescription Diet i\/d, low fat for gastrointestinal health. Shipments and distribution are way ahead of our expectations, and we plan additional distribution-driving activities for the balance of the year.","So in summary,  we're delighted that the strong momentum from the first quarter has continued into the second quarter of 2012, particularly given the uncertain macroeconomic conditions around the world. Our solid second quarter results reflect the ongoing success of our 4 strategic initiatives: getting close to the consumer, the customer and the professions; being more efficient and effective in everything we do; continuing to deliver innovative new products around the world; and building a strong team of leaders for today and tomorrow.","We look forward to sharing our continued progress throughout the balance of the year. And now, Brian, we would like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Nik Modi with UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just, Ian, would love your thoughts -- I mean, the top line was phenomenal. I'm sure share gains have to do with a lot of that. Can you kind of parse out what's going on in the category, just sequentially? And obviously, a lot of talk about consumer slowdown globally, et cetera, et cetera, just curious what some of the category consumer dynamics were and how much you think the share gains really contributed to the top line effort this quarter?","Ian M. Cook","Thanks for the question, Nik. As Bina closed in her summary remarks, we do believe that it is the full strategic initiatives that we have, the innovation that flows from them and the quality of our integrated marketing programs that is driving the top line growth of the company. Obviously, it is a blend between market share and category growth. You probably recall that about 53% of our business mix today is in the emerging markets. And as we have said before, the pace of growth in our categories in those markets is high-single digits, and we continue to see that pace of growth sustained through the second quarter. As we commented on the last call, obviously, category growth in Europe is extremely modest, very-low-single digits, in some cases flat. But as we've also said before, that's not a new phenomenon. That's built into our plans, and we're actually quite pleased with the volume and organic and sequentially improving pricing in Europe and the share gains behind it. And here in the U.S., as Bina said, we have outpaced the also modest, low-single-digit category growth in the United States continuing to build the market share, as Bina commented, and it is a combination of all of those factors that is driving the organic growth of the company. And it is that which gives us the confidence to say that we stand by our objective of 6% to 7% organic growth rate for the full year of 2012.","Operator","We'll go next to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So, Ian, I guess following up on that question, I was looking for a bit more granularity in Latin America, specifically, where you saw a very strong top line acceleration despite slightly more difficult comparisons. So can you give us a rundown on -- specifically in Latin America, what drove the acceleration down there and your thoughts on the balance of the year and the sustainability of that?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. It's -- again, we were very pleased. I remember there were some questioning when we talked about the first quarter on Latin America, whether we could continue at the pace, particularly given the tough comparisons second quarter on. Again, as I think Bina commented, it is largely to do with our innovation stream and the consumers' reaction to that and to the marketing that is bringing those products to the consumer, whether it's Optic White; whether it's Sensitive Pro-Relief, where we now lead in half of the Latin countries; whether it's that continued share progress on toothbrushes, with leadership in Mexico, the next objective. And consistent with our 6% to 7% organic growth for the total company for the year, as we have said before, we see double-digit organic growth for Latin America this year as well.","Operator","And we'll go next to Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. The first is, are you seeing any increased discounting in North America or elsewhere where a competitor have lost share and has sort of committed to getting it back, have you seen that happen? And can you give us a little more detail on Venezuela, Brazil, Mexico, just any macro or micro trends that you could highlight there?","Ian M. Cook","By all means. Again, as we said on the last call, we have seen, I would say, a slight moderation of competitive activity around the world. But competitors who have lost market share, we continue to see that level being intense. We have seen, in some categories around the world, media investment reduced from some of those principal competitors. And perhaps in a drive for short-term volume in selective markets, a step-up in promotional activity. Latin America, for example, in some countries, promotional levels as they have been running 3x our level, but we still see our market shares growing because the consumer is looking for value, and it's value through innovation that builds market share. And so I can't say that worldwide, the discounting is lessening overall. I would say there is a trend to that. And I would also say, from our side, we are benefiting from integrated marketing programs that are actually happening in retail environments, particularly in the developed world. And those programs are brand-building programs, even though they are expensed between growth and net sales in trade spending. Turning to Latin America, obviously, we're extremely pleased with our continued progress. In Brazil, we see our market share pushing through 72% on toothpaste. We see the competitor flat in that 5% to 6% range, again, driven by innovation. In Mexico, our year-to-date share is around 83%, competitors holding in between 11% and 12%. There has, specifically in Mexico, been a step-up in promotional activity. We've seen competitors -- or a specific competitor promoting at 80% level year-to-date, in some months at a 90% level, and yet, we are still building market share. And in Venezuela, obviously, we executed the pricing changes that were mandated by the government. We continue to make about 85% of the volume we sell. We have rationalized and simplified our offerings down to key SKUs, and our market shares are doing very well. I think as I said the last time, we have about a 96%, 97% share on toothpaste, which is quite pleasing. And that really, for us, for the year so far and for the year to go, is what our focus is. Our focus is on getting done what we have agreed to get done in 2012, which is to bring the innovation that the consumer values, to put the appropriate investment behind that innovation and to generate the funding from our productivity programs. And I would say, so far, that is working globally, and specific to your question in Latin America as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Christopher Ferrara with Merrill Lynch.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Ian, can you talk a little bit about what portion of your FX profit drag hits gross profit or COGS as opposed to SG&A? Because you're obviously maintaining that gross margin target. I'm just trying to understand the maintenance of that target. I mean, what does that suggest for the amount of FX transaction drag that you're actually absorbing, like how could -- how much of it would be coming in SG&A, basically?","Ian M. Cook","Well, let me focus on the gross margin because I think that's at the heart of your question and how we are approaching that and how we're thinking about that. And let me start by giving you the normal run-through year-on-year that we provide. So in the second quarter of this year, we start with the gross profit margin of 2011 Q2, which was 57.4%. The pricing that we have taken, and I was reading that some people felt our pricing balance would come off, but we've kept that pricing in the 3%, 3.5% range. Pricing added 1.4 percentage points to gross margin. Our Funding-the-growth stepped up in the second quarter from the first, as it historically always has done, to 190 basis points positive, exactly the same as we delivered last year. Material prices were a negative 260 basis points and then we have some mixed divestment impact of negative 20 basis points, which gets you to the 50-basis point increase. Now if you look specifically at the transaction cost impact, our gross margin, had we not had that impact, would have been higher by some 50 to 60 basis points in this quarter. We obviously, as we have said in our release, know now that foreign exchange is going to be a headwind of 6% to 7% for the year. We have taken the pricing that we said we would. You will remember from the last call there was 63% of the pricing we had planned for this year that was rollover. As we closed the second quarter, some 97% of all of the pricing planned for the year has been taken and is either at market or moving to market. On the last call, we said that number would be around 80%. And obviously, we have accelerated some pricing because of the specific transaction impact, and we see, while transaction is still out there for the balance of the year, easier comps year-on-year. And secondly, the commodity costs, the underlying commodity costs are showing some favorability. So you've got favorability on the commodity costs, pricing well in place and transaction still as a negative headwind. But all of that said, we remain comfortable with the 75 to 125 basis points improvement that we have been speaking of and we plan to see a sequential improvement in gross margin over the balance of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Could you just talk about some of the trends, more specifically in the categories and also your volume in Mexico? Because some of the data out there says like the category slowed like 50 basis points. And then just kind of what the sales growth was in China, both volume and reported sales? And then maybe a follow-up, if I can.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, we're not going to get into that level of country-by-country detail. I think it would be fair to say, and you have the data. And as I said in an earlier remark, obviously, we have seen a slowdown in the U.S. categories, the second quarter modestly slower than the first. And yes, there has been some spillover into Mexico, but not to the level that you were just referencing. What we feel good about is that our innovation and our integrated marketing programs are seeing us push our market shares up, and therefore, delivering the organic growth that we had planned to deliver. Now if you take a broader view of those emerging markets and you think about the Greater China, you think about Russia, you think about India and you think about Brazil, we have very healthy organic growth continuing in all of those parts of the world. And as I said earlier, the category growth rates in those geographies continue to grow high-single digits, and we see no change in that, notwithstanding the chatter around slowing macros for those geographies.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And can I ask a follow-up just on the gross margin side of things? What is the transaction impact kind of factored into that bridge you give us every quarter?","Ian M. Cook","It's in the material prices. So it's in that 260. Of that 260, 56 -- 50 to 60 was transaction.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Could you just give a little more color on the mouthwash in the U.S. launch? Are you getting full distribution? Will that benefit in terms of pipeline sales this quarter? And then do you have any goals for U.S. market share to kind of be similar to what you have in other regions?","Ian M. Cook","Yes, I guess, is the answer. We -- one of the underlying consumer benefits that we believe we have globally is this notion of regimen. We are, I think, the only company that operates in the 3 largest oral care segments under the same brand name exclusively. So you can combine a Colgate toothpaste with a Colgate toothbrush and a Colgate mouth rinse, a name that the consumer has enormous trust in, and a regimen that clearly we want to educate consumers and retailers want to educate consumers to use. So we have good ambition in terms of bringing those 3 categories together. I think when Bina spoke about the rollout of Optic around the world, she mentioned that in the new markets we are going with the regimen, so it is a toothpaste, a toothbrush and the mouth rinse. And in some parts of the world, retail shelves, and certainly, retail displays take full advantage of linking the 3 categories. So Optic, of course, is a single variant entry strategy, thus far, in the United States. But we have good ambition for it. And so far, the retailer reception, both from a distribution point of view and a support point of view, has been very positive, and we'll keep you updated as the end market results start to come.","Operator","We'll go next to Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","One little question and then a bigger on if emerging markets have 53% of sales, about how much of their -- of your profits are they at this point?","Ian M. Cook","Slightly higher, not much.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just slightly?","Ian M. Cook","Slightly.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And I'm a little confused about your statement that there's a slight moderation in competitive activity around the world, but some with less share are hiking promotion. And really, what I'm trying to get at is, is the competitor who has 11% to 12% of the toothpaste market in Mexico, are -- is that the one that is hiking promotional activity internationally and in the U.S.?","Ian M. Cook","The -- again, when you're asked a question about the world, it's very difficult to give a generic answer, given that we operate in over 90 countries. So I would say, as I said before, that overall, we are seeing a slight abatement, less promotional activity. In some specific markets, and Mexico was one, the promotional activity, which has always been high, as I think we have said consistently on calls, because there is no positioning difference, so if you don't have a marketing idea, price tends to be the approach. And that promotional activity, which had always been north of 50%, moved to 80%, even though we saw media reduced in many of those markets. On what the future will bring in that regard, we will deal with when it comes. And you can see our ability to grow and build market share and deliver a return in those geographies by focusing on innovation that provides value at a higher price, and thereby, brings margin and return. And that's where we're going to stay focused.","Operator","And we'll go next to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Ian, if I understood correctly, you mostly refer to price increases that you've already planned. But in the second quarter, you have these 2 big devaluations in Brazil and Mexico. So is the rebound that needs to happen in the second half in gross margin dependent upon price increases to offset the devaluations in Mexico and Brazil? Or this can be done basically on savings and lower commodity?","Ian M. Cook","Thanks, Javier. The answer is it's a bit of everything. What I was trying to say with the pricing we have taken, we accelerated pricing into the second quarter because of exactly the kind of foreign exchange transaction pressure you mentioned. But you can never react to those things quickly enough to impact a quarter, therefore, our gross margin would've been higher without that additional transaction impact, which was not originally forecast. So when we look at the balance of the year, yes, there is continued benefit from the pricing actions we've taken. And I must say, we feel pretty good at being able to take pricing in the 3% to 3.5% range overall and keep the volume north of 4% and being consistent with the 6% to 7% organic target that we have talked about previously. It also requires us to deliver the same kind of sequential Funding-the-growth improvements that we have done historically and we clearly have programs and confidence in those programs behind it, and we benefit somewhat from a more favorable underlying commodity cost environment unrelated to the transaction. So it is the combination of all of those that has us reaffirm advancing gross margin within that 75 to 125 basis points range.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer & Co.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just first question on Hill's. It seems like the volume is really -- haven't turned yet. In fact, this quarter seemed to get a little bit worse. Is that surprising to you or were you guys expecting the push into naturals, for example, to really be more of a second half impact? And then secondly, and I apologize if you gave this, but the overhead savings in the quarter?","Ian M. Cook","Let me answer the second first. You'll see SG&A was up by 20 basis points and that was all advertising, so overheads were flat this quarter, which is a function of timing. On Hill's, frankly, we would've liked to have seen less negative on volume. We were pleased with the pricing and we're obviously pleased with the gross margin because that gives us an investment platform behind the innovation we have. But we have still not, as I said on the last call, made enough progress in penetrating the faster-growing natural segment. We're quite pleased with this Ideal Balance line that I had mentioned the last time. This idea of marrying the science of Hill's with the ingredients that the naturals user prefers. Distribution is building. It's about 88% now. Trial is building. Repeat is healthily north of 30%, which is an elevated level. And as Bina said, in terms of data we can track at retail, 55% of users of Ideal Balance are new to Hill's and coming for the natural segment. So that is already underway. As we also said on the last call, we really wouldn't see an improvement in the organic growth of Hill's until the second half of the year when we start to convert and relaunch our Science Diet business with ingredients that are more consumer-friendly to those naturals consumer. And that process is going to run a year to 18 months to fully complete, but we think, as we said, that it'll have an effect in the second half. I would comment that some 40% of the U.S. business, and that natural segment is a U.S. phenomenon, not a global phenomenon, but 40% of our U.S. business is the Prescription Diet, which is clinically proven to provide benefits to animals that have an ailment, as recommended by and sold by vets. And that business, where we have a 70% share, a 75% recommendation level, is showing healthy growth, both in the U.S. and international. So it really is about penetrating the natural segment. And we think that the plans we have in place, based on the testing we have to date, will complete that job and begin the second half of the year and run through 2013.","Operator","We'll go next to Ian Gordon with S&P Capital IQ.","Ian Gordon","First, I have a housekeeping. On the -- you gave the impact of FX to sales, but you didn't explicitly give it -- what it was to EPS, so I'm just wondering how much bigger it is on EPS? And then secondly, as I look ahead to the third quarter and on the SG&A line, last year, you were down about 70 basis points, both in advertising and non-advertising. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that might reverse in the third quarter and how we should think about that for the year?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Well, let's start with the foreign exchange. You may remember, Ian, which is a great name, by the way, you may remember on the first quarter call, we talked about foreign exchange impacting the top line by about 3% and the bottom line by about 4%. As you saw in our release, we're saying that based on the spot of today, the bottom line impact for the year will be some 6% to 7%, but the sales impact will be more in the 4% to 5%, consistent with the ratios we talked about on the last call. And in fact, in this second quarter, the foreign exchange impact on the bottom line was negative 9%. And as to your second question, I would stay focused on advertising. In the area of advertising, you have seen year-to-date we are up. We expect to continue to be up, both on an absolute and a ratio basis for the balance of the year, and that was the approach or that is the approach we have taken coming into 2012 in order to drive the trial of the innovation program that we have. And on the overhead side, we continue to look for opportunities to find self-funding ways of becoming more efficient. And to the extent that we generate funding to be able to do more, we will tell you about that at the appropriate time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I got a couple of questions on Sanex. I guess since it's been a year since you bought that business, sounds like you're pretty happy with it. But how does it perform compared with your expectations? And is there any, I guess, regrets, so to speak, getting into Europe with the timing of the macro issues? And you've also mentioned with Sanex a large amount of innovation, strong pipeline that they had when you made the purchase, and how do you plan to roll that out globally? And then finally, on the Sanex business, how has organic growth been trending?","Ian M. Cook","Well, we don't give that category level or brand level information. I will say, if you look at organic growth for each of our categories, organic growth on Hill's second quarter to first is that 2%. Organic growth on our other categories, personal care, which Sanex is a piece of, home care and oral care, are up quarter-on-quarter, obviously, given the overall company performance. But in the strong mid-single-digits range for personal care and home care and double-digit for oral care. So our category performance, we think, is very strong. We have no buyer's remorse on Sanex. We continue to be thrilled, and we continue to believe in Europe. We think the Europeans or the Greeks would still brush their teeth in euros or drachma. And the Sanex business is increasing our market shares in the important body wash and underarm categories. The innovation stream we have in Europe in the countries that Sanex is in today is strong. It's an innovation stream. You may see us take to other geographies under the Sanex name. You may see us take it to other geographies under a Palmolive or a Softsoap or a Protex name that we have around the world. The integration is on track. The transfer of manufacturing, which will build margin, is on track. And obviously, we would reveal country expansion plans at the appropriate time, given the competitive nature of those plans. No buyer's remorse.","Operator","And we'll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a follow-up on Hill's and then North America pricing. So on Hill's, just with rising input costs in the agricultural complex, is there any commentary on how much more pricing you think you might need through the year that may run the risk of derailing some of your plans for some volume improvement there, notwithstanding the innovation coming to market? And then North America, just it's a big swing on pricing sequentially, and we're just curious how much of that was -- was it list increases? Was it changes in some of your sort of retailer-specific pricing by SKU? Any kind of mix and particular changes you're making on how your pricing sizes? Because that was a surprise to me, that sort of big change in pricing sequentially in North America and then obviously giving up some volume despite this continued business of Optic White.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, the answer on Hill's, Lauren, you may know we have talked about this before, this is one of the few Colgate businesses that we actually hedged in a very disciplined way. And particularly what one's reading about in corn and soya, that the -- whatever impact will be in 2012 is in our plans, either hedged or in our plans and will not, in any way, derail the programs we have in place on the Hill's business. And some of the formula changes that we're going through will change the profile, if you will, of ingredients in Hill's products going forward. So not a derailer in 2012. And North American pricing, yes, it's a little bit of a lot of things. Some list, but particularly promotional planning with our Colgate business planning tool, bringing some efficiency, and then, yes, focusing on particular pricing with retailers, which, of course, links to the promotional planning. The mix, as you know, we have a dollar-weighted volume, so mix is not a component of that. But it's a little bit of all of the above. And as we have said before, for the last, I think, it's 10 Nielsen periods, our dollar-weighted consumption in the U.S. has outpaced the category.","Operator","And we'll go next to Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I have a question on -- in toothpaste, how the category is getting segmented by so many different applications between Optic White and Luminous and Sensitive and Enamel and Total, and I'm not sure how many other ones are. The question is, at what point do you think consumers get overwhelmed by the choices? And how are you reaching them without -- how are you reaching them so that each one of these segments is successful? And the final part of the question is, are you seeing an increase in per capita usage as the market becomes more segmented?","Ian M. Cook","The answer on per cap is in the emerging markets, absolutely. But per cap is in the developed world, really, how many times a day do people brush their teeth because the penetration is quite robust. In terms of choice, the consumer wants choice. And if you don't give the consumer choice in today's world, they'll go somewhere else to get the choice. Now we talk about Enamel, but Enamel ends up being a benefit within Optic. They're buying a whitening benefit with a secondary benefit on the enamel. You'll find many, many toothpastes, including Total, that offer a primary benefit that is gingivitis protection, but have a variant that delivers a whitening secondary benefit, of which the consumer puts a value on. I think the thing that needs to be understood in all of this is when you are bringing the new innovations, you are winnowing the old, whether that's a flavor variant, whether that's a size, or whether that's a benefit that was at one time interesting to the consumer, think baking soda going back. So it's a living process, Connie. And the way you communicate to the consumers, I think Optic is a wonderful example, it starts with the package. And of course, it is then surrounded by the traditional advertising mediums that we use, and increasingly, today, what we are able to communicate at the retail level, and obviously, for our therapeutic offerings, the clinical evidence that a professional will be relaying to their patients. So the consumer is not changing their view, but they continue to want choice in this category. And I think some of the threads of that choice are pretty broad, whitening, gum health, anti-cavity and so on, and then you have secondary benefits within it. And I think an important point to make is oftentimes, that innovation can be seen as having value to consumers, even again, at a higher price point, which, of course, is accretive to margin and accretive to category value growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A couple of questions. One is just reflecting on -- many times the word transactional or transactional effect of currency was discussed this time, and also it really started last quarter as well. That's very different than, as far back as I can remember, discussing with you guys about currencies, where it was always kind of 1:1 between top line and bottom line, kind of a new word in the Colgate Lexicon. So I'm trying to understand why. I mean you've had historically much quicker currency movements and been able to handle it through pricing. Is it just that they're that much quicker this time? Is it that the consumer environment, particularly in Latin America and Mexico you mentioned, may be a little bit tougher? Is it that there's more competition that's not allowing you to take a pricing? So what's different in that transactional has become a bigger piece of the story? And then separate question is going back to Hill's. Clearly, the compares get much easier on that business as you go forward the next few quarters, so that should be a little bit of a relief. But as you think about your attempt to sustainably fix this business, I guess 2 questions come to mind. One is, what will success look like for the business from a growth perspective as you go forward on the next 18 months, how should we track it? Because I think you guys say, and we say as well, that this is kind of a big change, this is a big thing you guys have to do in that business. And what are the costs associated to that? And then lastly, you were kind of a moment ago just aggregated the prescription business as 40% of your business. So what's the growth rate of the 60% then, if the other -- the prescription business is actually growing, the nonprescription should be, obviously, by math, doing a little bit worse. So can you get us a little bit more color around that? Because that could be an interesting progression to track as you go forward.","Ian M. Cook","The -- thanks for the long question, Ali. The -- taking them in turn, and some I won't answer, but taking them in turn, we have never said foreign exchange is 1:1. And we said, even on the last call, that there was a difference between the top line impact and the bottom line impact, and we said that when we set up this year when we talked about currency headwind. And you're right, the reason why you can't offset the kind of significant foreign exchange swings that we had in the second quarter, was the speed of the change. And I said earlier, we actually accelerated some pricing, but you can't just go to market on Monday morning and take your prices up with the retailer, never mind the competitor comparison. So it was always more on the bottom line than the top line, and the reason on pricing is the speed of the change. I think -- we think that pricing on the -- in the north of 3% and volume and organic -- or our organic growth in that 6% to 7% in this world is very good performance, and that's a balanced judgment we have to make. And we fund the investment behind it by getting our gross margin to that 75 to 125 increase by balancing that pricing with our Funding-the-growth initiatives and the slightly more favorable commodity environment. Now Hill's is -- yes, of course, the Science Diet business is a little bit lower than the average given that the Prescription Diet business is growing. It doesn't change what the fundamental issue is. The fundamental issue is breaking in, in a more meaningful way to the Hill's business. Success will look like growing volume and organic sales. We think, as we have said, that we will see a modest improvement in organic sales in the second half of this year, and that will build in 2013 as the innovation gets to the marketplace. And the costs, given that this has been planned for some time, are fully included in our plans going forward. And frankly, don't get close to the number quoted in your recent note. So we think we know what the solution is, and the success will be a return to organic growth. I think longer-term, with Hill's, because we're kind of microscopically focused on the U.S. here, if you take the long view, the growth profile for Hill's is going to look attractive given our ability to open up and be successful in emerging markets as they reach the maturity to provide prepackaged pet nutrition diets to their pets, and we think that long-term opportunity still is out there.","Operator","And we'll go next to Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I apologize if I missed your full explanation on North America, but you did have a big sequential increase in pricing and yet a big decline in the volume growth. You actually had volume decline in North America in the quarter. And so it looks like you took price and your volumes got hit. Am I mistaken or is there another explanation? And then is that just a temporary phenomenon as that kind of works through the system? Or maybe if you can give a fuller explanation of that region. And then secondly, I guess my question is a little philosophical on the EPS growth rate and the FX impact. I mean, really, you get price that goes along with currency devaluations, so I'm just kind of curious as to why you would exclude the translation, the FX impact from EPS growth and yet you would include the pricing that goes along with the currency devaluation? So maybe you could kind of comment on that. And I don't know if there's any way to quantify the pricing you're expecting in 2012 that would be kind of directly related to currency devaluation.","Ian M. Cook","Okay, Linda, let me do the foreign exchange response first. There are 2 separate things. We said when we set up this year that we would deliver double-digit EPS growth on a currency-neutral basis. That has all to do with translation, just translation. And we said, also, that we were going to deliver an increase in our gross margin between 75 and 125 basis points. To do that, you have to offset the transaction impact of buying raw materials, let's say, in Latin America, that are priced worldwide in dollars when the U.S. dollar strengthens. So in order to deliver the gross margin, to deliver the local profitability, you have to take the pricing to offset that cost impact. And that's the way we set up the year. So it is strictly translation, which has nothing to do with pricing. Now in North America, we -- you may recall, we started with Optic in the fourth quarter of last year. We did not have capacity for Optic when we got the overwhelming response positively from consumers in the U.S. We geared up capacity, and we came back and effectively relaunched that business in the first quarter of that year, up against, I would say, the most modest quarter's volume that we have seen in North America, first quarter of 2011. And we got the volume response we got, but we have, yes, certainly balanced pricing in North America. But I stress the point from an external point of view, we are seeing the consumption, the consumer purchases of our product outpacing the market rate of growth year-to-date, and in fact, for the last 10 periods. So from an organic point of view, we expect to see continued positive organic growth for the balance of the year, balancing the volume with the price and continuing to build with the innovation we have, including the Optic rinse talked about a little bit earlier.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just one question. So thinking about advertising, I know years ago you talked about, I think, 11% was the right way to think about it. Obviously, when gross margins start to contract closer to the trough, it was closer to 10, we started to see a little bit of a pickup this year. So I guess the way I'm thinking about the back half of the year, you're going to have a nice, big gross margin uptick. You guys have talked about advertising. But if we could think about maybe the next 2 years, should we think about the advertising spending still at that 11%? Is that a more fluid situation? So as more gross margin comes through, you'll reinvest a portion of it? Or will we expect to see more of the gross margin savings over the next couple of years really flow through to the bottom line? So I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit of color on that. That'd be great.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, I -- if there was a number I wish I had never thrown out there, it was this 11%, which gets memorialized in tablets of stone. To start with where we are today, 8% organic growth, with advertising at the level we have in this quarter, is, we think, an effective return on our advertising investment. The advertising investment doesn't start with a ratio. We build it up from the plans on the ground. So I would venture to say that when you take our general financial strategic model, what we always intend to be focused on is increasing that gross margin, and that would certainly -- or that is our ambition and our goal next year, and you can imagine would be next year, to attempt to lower overhead on a ratio basis to sales in order to take some of that funding, as we call it, Funding-the-growth, to increase our advertising, assuming we have the breadth and depth of innovation that, we believe, today we have, and still deliver a healthy return on the bottom line. And that thinking has not changed. And if the innovation flow is good, I'm sure our ambition will be to continue to increase our advertising behind that innovation as we move forward in time.","Operator","And our final question today comes from Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just one question on China, where GDP growth, and I guess, category growth for some is slowing, I know you're not in discretionary categories per se, but are you seeing any impact in your categories in terms of consumption, trade-down, et cetera?","Ian M. Cook","No. Again, as I commented earlier, through the second quarter, we haven't seen a slowdown in our categories in these geographies in general. And specifically in China, still growing high-single digits. Our market share there over 33% year-to-date. I believe our principal competitor just hit below 20%, but who's looking?","So thanks very much for your questions, helpful as always. And again, we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress as this volatile world continues over the balance of the year. And a special thank you to all of the Colgate people who get all this stuff done around the world. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's presentation.

Good day. And welcome to today\u2019s Colgate-Palmolive Company First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgate-palmolive.com.","Now, for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, sir.","John Faucher","Thanks, Vickie. Good morning. And welcome to our first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations.","Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC including our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings all available on Colgate\u2019s website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Table 6 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website.","Joining me this morning are Noel Wallace, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. I will start off with a review of the quarter and our full year 2019 outlook. Noel will then provide a few quick thoughts before we open it up to Q&A.","Our net sales declined 3% in Q1. We delivered 3% organic sales growth with 1% unit volume growth and 2% favorable pricing. This was offset by negative foreign exchange impact of 6%. We know that there is still work to do, but we are pleased with the further improvement in organic sales growth in the quarter, as we believe our strategies to reaccelerate growth are beginning to bear fruit.","Importantly, the composition of the growth gives us comfort that we are returning to a more sustainable trajectory. On an organic basis, we delivered both volume and pricing growth for the first time in over two years, with volume and pricing growth in all four of our categories, Oral Care, Pet Nutrition, Personal Care and Home Care.","We delivered geographically balanced organic sales growth with emerging markets and developed markets both up 3% and we delivered breadth in our organic sales growth with more than 75% of our hubs delivering organic sales growth in the quarter.","Our focus on driving the core through innovation, attacking adjacent segments and expanding the availability of our brands in newer and higher growth channels and markets is beginning to pay off. Coupled with our increased brand support, we are optimistic that we can continue to deliver against the expectations for 2019 that we laid out on the fourth quarter earnings call.","On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was down 130 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it was down 110 basis points year-over-year.","For the quarter, our 200 basis points of pricing provided a 70-basis-point benefit to gross margin. Raw materials costs, including foreign exchange transaction costs were a 320-basis-point drag on gross margin year-over-year. Our productivity programs led by our Funding the Growth initiatives provided a 150-basis-point benefit to gross margin. Other was a 10-basis-point drag.","On an absolute basis, advertising investment was up 3% year-over-year. On a percent to sales basis, advertising was up 60 basis points year-over-year with increases on a percent to sale basis in every division.","Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and advertising spending, our SG&A expenses were down year-over-year in the first quarter on an absolute basis and as a percent to sales, benefiting from our productivity programs.","On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share of $0.65 were down 10% year-over-year in Q1. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program diluted earnings per share were down 10% to $0.67. Our free cash flow in the quarter was $534 million, which was up 7% versus Q1 2018.","Taking a look at the divisional results. North America delivered 3% net sales growth and 3.5% organic sales growth in the quarter, with 2% volume growth and 1.5% pricing growth. We saw strong sales growth in toothpaste in the quarter driven by Colgate Total SF, Colgate Optic White, Colgate Essentials and Tom\u2019s of Maine.","Cloud and e-commerce delivered particularly strong toothpaste growth this quarter. The Colgate Total re-launch is proceeding in-line with our expectations, as Total\u2019s market share is up year-over-year since the launch.","In the U.S., we took pricing through a downsizing, and this should lead to a shorter repurchase cycle, which should accelerate unit growth going forward as consumers come back more quickly.","North America also benefited from the strong growth in the Elta MD and PCA Skin care businesses we acquired during Q1 of 2018. These brands are delivering very strong growth across a number of channels, including Professional, DTC and e-commerce.","Europe\u2019s net sales were down 7% in Q1, driven by negative foreign exchange. Organic sales were up 0.5% in the quarter, as volume growth of 1.5% was mostly offset by negative pricing of 1%. While categories in Europe remain sluggish, our market shares were up or flat in seven of 10 categories.","We delivered strong volume growth in Northern Europe with the U.K. and Scandinavia both up on the back of the Colgate Total re-launch. We have reintroduced Colgate Total in Scandinavia and it is driving strong incremental market share gains in that region. We also launched our meridol Pur in several markets in Europe in Q1, which brings our top therapeutic gum offering into the natural space at a premium price.","In Personal Care, we continue to drive significant share gains behind the Sanex body wash business. In France, Sanex\u2019s body wash share is up more than 100 basis points year-to-date behind Sanex zero percent and the Sanex Physiologic brand.","Latin America, we are pleased with our acceleration in organic sales growth in Latin America in Q1. Net sales declined 4.5% in the quarter, as 10.5% negative foreign exchange more than offset 2.5% volume growth and 3.5% pricing growth in the quarter. Importantly, the growth was broad-based as we delivered organic sales growth in every hub.","We are particularly pleased with the sequential improvement we saw in Brazil in the quarter versus Q4 2018 as we delivered both pricing and volume growth. Encouragingly, category trends in Brazil do seem to be better although the market remains very promotional.","Our recent innovations in Oral Care are paying off nicely as we are seeing market share gains for our Colgate Natural Extracts toothpaste line, our Colgate Guard franchise in pharmacies in Brazil, and the Colgate Slim Soft Advanced toothbrush.","Net sales in Asia-Pacific were down 8%, driven by negative foreign exchange of 5.5%, a 2.5% decline in volume, and flat pricing. Our results in China remain challenged by the difficult steps we are taking to reorient our portfolio in an Oral Care category that is rapidly premiumizing and shifting into e-commerce. As we indicated in January, we still expect trends to improve in the second half of the year.","Encouragingly, we saw strong growth in both volume and pricing in India, with growth coming on both, the Colgate MaxFresh and Colgate Vedshakti franchises. In order to drive penetration of Vedshakti, we recently gave away 30 million samples at the Ardh Kumbh Mela festival in India.","Our Africa\/Eurasia business showed solid underlying business momentum in Q1, despite the negative impact of foreign exchange. FX was a 13% drag on sales growth in the quarter, offsetting 7% pricing growth and flat volume. Our Eurasia hub delivered a strong mixture of pricing and volume growth in the quarter driven by Russia. Our North Africa, Middle East, Turkey hub also delivered volume growth in the quarter, despite significant pricing to offset foreign exchange.","In order to help continue this momentum, we launched the full Meridol regimen, toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouth rinse in the pharmacy channel in Turkey in the first quarter. We also launched Palmolive Micellar Care shower gel in Russia this past quarter taking advantage of a big personal care trend.","And finally, Hills, our strong growth at Hills continued in Q1. Growth was led by the United States with particularly strong growth in e-commerce, pet specialty, and farm and feed. Internationally, our growth was very broad-based, we delivered both volume and pricing growth in Canada, Europe, Australia, Asia and Latin America.","As we discussed at CAGNY, Q1 marked the beginning of our re-launch of our Science Diet brand with the new packaging on-shelf as we speak. Initial response has been positive as Science Diet market share trends continue to increase year-over-year in Q1. The re-launch will continue across the globe through the first half of 2020.","We have also significantly exceeded our subscription targets for our Hill's to home service which allows pet parents to realize the benefits of home delivery, while maintaining contact with the veterinarian.","Moving on to full year guidance, we continue to expect net sales to be flat to up low-single digits. We continue to expect organic sales to be up to 2% to 4% based on current spot rates. For the full year we still expect gross margin to be up year-over-year on both, a GAAP basis and excluding charges related to our global growth and efficiency program.","We expect the benefits of pricing and our productivity programs to offset an overall increase in raw material costs which includes the impact of transnational foreign exchange. We expect our advertising spending to be up notably, year-over-year on both, an absolute basis and as a percent of sales. We would expect advertising as a percent of sales for the full year to be fairly consistent with the Q1 level.","We continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be between 25.5% and 26.5%, both on a GAAP basis and excluding charges related to our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018, and the charge related to U.S. tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018. Based on current spot rates, we expect GAAP earnings per share to be down low-single digits for the year. Excluding the charges related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018, and the charge related to U.S. tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018, based on current spot rates we expect earnings per share to decline mid-single digits for the year. We would note that the consensus EPS estimate is in the middle of that range.","And with that I will turn it over to Noel for his thoughts before the Q&A.","Noel Wallace","Thanks, John and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. I thought it appropriate to begin by framing three strategic areas of focus for our company that I believe will be critical to our ongoing success, and we certainly started to see transpire in the first quarter.","The first area of focus is how we are thinking about organic sales growth. No question that to deliver long-term revenue growth that's sustainable, we need to be more aggressive about going after growth, and we are going after growth differently.","As you recall in the fourth quarter call and at CAGNY, I spoke about some of our growth mindset, specifically we are driving the Colgate brands like Total and Science Diet, remember these are big brands, big brands with a global penetration in many countries around the world, and we are bringing that to market through significant new innovation and superior product and formulations. We would also bringing that alongside significant brand building along those businesses with real brand purpose that resonates with consumers in the different way.","Second, we are going after adjacent categories and product segments like naturals which is doing very well for us, therapeutics by expanding Elmex and Meridol to select markets, and importantly, expanding skincare and continuing to focus our investment on opening new doors and channels with that category.","Third, we are expanding the availability of our products through distribution and new markets, being very thoughtful in that regard but we see opportunities in new channels, particularly in channels like e-commerce which is key to our continued growth moving forward. We were very pleased with the growth in e-commerce in the first quarter which was up 28% versus the year ago period. So, more to do and more to come and we are certainly focused on those areas.","Our second key area of focus is to simplify our processes and our structures around the world. We recognize that we need to change in order to respond to a rapidly changing marketplace in terms of our ease and how consumers are shopping.","For example, we have revamping our innovation process to dramatically reduce the time to market. You heard my dear fellows speak about that at CAGNY and those changes are underway beginning in Latin America, and we will begin to roll those out around the world as we move into the balance of the year.","Third area of focus for us is using data and looking to digitize the organization very differently. We know that data can enable faster growth and faster decision-making. We know that data drives further ROI in media, and we know that data-driven marketing is far better return-on-investment than the way we are spending today. We also know that we can use data to improve our assortment in e-commerce. In the area of digitization some exciting thing is coming down the pipeline for us to drive productivity across the organization.","We are going to change from our SAP system that we have had in - that we started in 1994 to the upgraded SAP S\/4HANA which we think is going to simplify our processes significantly around the world, drive more standardization and better reporting and decision-making from all of that. So you begin to see a lot of this unfold as we move into the balance of the year. We are pleased to see some of that taking hold in the first quarter of this year.","So, before I jump into Q&A I wanted to take a moment to thank the 35,000 Colgate people for supporting me during this important transition over the last year. I am extremely proud to lead, to listen and to learn from that extraordinary team, and I know with their drive and continued commitment, and our focus on growth, we will build a future to smile about.","And it's those people that I want to extend a special thanks to Ian Cook for the past 12 years of his extraordinary leadership as CEO of this company. He has transformed this organization in many ways and we will be forever grateful for his leadership. I especially want to thank him for his wise counsel and mentorship over the last six months as he has prepared me for this new role.","So with that let me turn it over to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren Lieberman","Noel, I was curious if we could you talk a little bit about market shares. Just - you know, market shares in oral care have been an important metric for the business, like health of the business and so on, and like a badge of honor, frankly. And this quarter, topline certainly improved sequentially but shares are down versus I think where we talked about them at the end of January, both globally and in some key markets like Brazil, Mexico, India. So can you just talk a little bit about that, how you are thinking about market share in particular? When you would expect that to turn as you think about the path forward and some to the greater growth mindset you are putting in play?","Noel Wallace","Overall, we have seen significant growth first of all, on untracked channels, particularly in U.S. where we saw double-digit growth in a lot of those untracked channels, which we are very encouraged about. If I stay within North America, the toothpaste shares are flat, we obviously introduce Colgate Total in the middle of February, we saw a significant competitive response and we have responded accordingly but we weren't going to deal overly aggressive in order to drive share.","Bear in mind, that we are in this for the long-term, this is a marathon not a sprint with the launch of Colgate Total, it's not like introducing a new product, we have existing shelf space and existing penetration, it's a big brand and we are looking to continue the drive trial and repeat throughout the year. So the way we have structured and strategized our media spending over the year is to continue with high investments quarter-on-quarter through the balance of the year, and we think in the end that would generate sustained growth for the business.","Moving on to some of the other markets, our value shares and volume shares in Mexico are actually flat, we are slightly down in Brazil and that was due to some aggressive promotion from the competitive environment, recognize that the Colgate Total launch which will have a significant premium in both those markets, which - where it has a sizeable share will launched in the second quarter.","Our volume shares on balance are only down 30 basis points, so we feel quite comfortable with where we are, particularly, given the activity in most of the total spending coming in the year to go.","Operator","We will take the next question from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","So, I had a question on your pricing in the quarter. I guess I am wondering why it slowed sequentially. And then I am also curious about this - for your emerging markets where I assume you would have been taking more pricing for FX. And then could you update us on your plan to any future pricing? Or essentially do you expect pricing to accelerate in the future or remain constant at current levels? Thanks.","Noel Wallace","We were actually very pleased with the balance of organic growth in the first quarter, obviously both volume and pricing up, we had good pricing in the fourth quarter as you have pointed out, and likewise, good pricing in the first quarter, so coming off of that, we are quite pleased.","Some of the pricing still yet to come, we talked about in the fourth quarter, the two-thirds would roll through from 2018 to 2019, we have a third to go, and we are quite confident that we will generate the pricing that we set out for ourselves on the year. Certainly at the current spot rates, if spot rates change, we certainly have to look to take more pricing but we are quite comfortable with where we are and how that's flowed through.","Specifically on Total, we are very pleased from the fact that we have seen pricing stick everywhere we have launched Colgate Total. Coming back to the U.S., our equivalized shares - as John mentioned, we downsized, the price per ounce is up about 16% in the Total toothpaste franchise and the U.S. is up 8%, so price is holding and more to come as we move through the balance of the year.","Operator","And the next question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Just following up on China specifically, could you tell us exactly how much volumes were down in China? And I know you are going through a big repositioning of the brand and product assortment in that market but can you sort of give us some timing on that, when should we expect to see stronger numbers? Are there specific new products coming out or new advertising or anything like that? So, when do you think we turn positive in China? Thanks.","Noel Wallace","Sure. So China came in as we expected in the quarter, we had - I think communicated in the fourth quarter call that we expected China to turn in the back half and that's exactly the timing that we are still looking for. Some significant changes in investment going into China as we speak, we are looking at obviously to get the portfolio structured appropriately, we are getting the structure in the organization and putting resources where we think the growth will come in that business moving forward.","So we are making some investments in the business in the short-term that we believe would drive sustainable growth in the long-term for our business which will be - we will start to see that turn in the back half of the year.","Operator","And we will go to Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","So my question is on North America organic volumes, and a follow-up on the Colgate Total re-launch. So on North America, you called out on the prepared remarks that the benefit from EltaMD and PCA Skin now included in organic growth. Can you give us like, kind of a sort of magnitude - not a magnitude of that launch \u00fb not launch and the inclusion on the organic growth? And also on the Colgate Total re-launch, thinking about specifically, Latin America with Brazil in terms of the timing of the launch will all the volume of the re-launch be shipped during the second quarter? You had some of that done in the first quarter, so I am trying to see if there is any lumpiness on the volume as we progress through the quarters. Thank you.","Noel Wallace","Thanks, Andrea. Again, a good growth in the first quarter out of North America, we are not going to break it out but suffice to say, all of the key elements of the North America business grew in the first quarter. We were particularly pleased with Tom's of Maine which had another significant growth following a sequential growth over the last three quarters, so that's doing well, the sell-in on Total performed well.","Obviously as you have pointed out, PCA and Elta were added into the organic growth, not a significant portion, but we are very pleased with the progress on that business that we have seen thus far. So overall, a good performance in North America across a well balanced organic growth in all of their categories and their core businesses.","In terms of the re-launch of our Colgate Total in Latin America, we just started shipping at the end of the first quarter with most of the activity and all of the investment to come in the second quarter. So I would say a portion in the first, most to come in the second as we move forward.","Operator","We will go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","I am just trying to contextualize some of the discussions so far in the quarterly results in a little bit more broad, and you have done that a couple of times but I want to continue on that theme. The big debate I think is, are you spending enough, that's the one I hear the most. And so, if you look at the quarter's results, you could argue that they are consistent with that concerning narrative, right, we are not spending enough to turn the ship. The sequential pricing, i.e. probably more create spend, more promo this quarter to get more shelf space, there was clearly a lot of the inventory load, right, so that pricing that you guys talked about on Colgate Total, for example, in North America, a lot of inventory loaded in Elmex and others. AMP was up, maybe not quite as much as I thought it might be but it's up which I guess is good.","But all this activity so far, and we still see those market share issues in the U.S. and in Mexico, Brazil, Russia, India, China, I mean U.K. looks little bit better but still some pressure - and by the way, do you wonder in the U.S. what the sell-out was versus the sell-in - so it doesn't look great on the tracked channels. So, I guess I am just trying to get underneath this idea of - should we just be more patient to see those terms? I think that's your messaging, but should we just be more patient to see this upturn? And so you are 100% confident that you are actually spending enough? And so this concern about another rebase to happen around the corner or not spending enough that view is just so far what you are seeing going to be wrong.","Noel Wallace","Thanks, Ali. A lot in that question. So let me try to step back for a moment, talk a little bit about our strategy. We realized to drive long-term sustainable growth that we do things very thoughtfully and in a measured way. We have taken the advertising up, as you well pointed out, quite significantly in our view, up in the first quarter, we will hold those levels through the balance of the year and everything that we know about building brands, particularly brands as big and as scalable as Colgate Total, it's that continuity that really pays off in the long run.","We don't look to a percent to sales, we look for what do we need to do to create the right impressions and the right engagement behind a significant innovation like Colgate Total, and that's exactly what we are doing. We are going to continue to plot away with the plan that we have, we were very strategic in not making - and not necessarily spending all of our money in the first quarter, we want to balance out over the year, we are not buying shelf space, I heard you mention that. And a brand like Colgate Total, which is an existing brand in the U.S. at 10-share, that's a successful brand already.","So what we are doing is basically trying to drive more velocity off-the-shelf, we are not necessarily increasing shelf and we didn't necessarily see any of that in terms of shelf increases in the first quarter. So we have got strong shares, strong shelf space, and we are going to continue to build on that.","I will give you a little bit about consumption on Colgate Total. Obviously, as we move through some of the high competitive reactions in February and March, the last four weeks on Colgate Total, the consumption is up 40% and our share is up 1 point. So we are in a good position relative to what we are seeing there and obviously a lot of the work to come as we move through the balance of the year. And in terms of advertising, we will likewise see those increases come to bear as we roll it out, particularly, in big markets like Latin America.","Operator","And the next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","So as you talked about in the open, you are arguably managing a larger number of growth priorities today versus history. And I guess what - I am wondering as we you can talk more about how you are prioritizing them relative to one other. I am sure the first order of business is ensuring the Colgate - the core Colgate Oral Care franchise returns to market-leading growth, but around that, as you talked about, you got the expansion into naturals, you are broadening the reach of brands like Elmex, investing in e-commerce, stepping up support for professional skincare, and obviously driving Hill's as well. And - obviously, not all of those initiatives are mutually exclusive but again, how are you thinking about allocating relative investment dollars to each of them? If you had an extra dollar, which bucket are you most likely to add to? And any thoughts if you can do it all organically or are you increasingly opened to M&A in support of those initiatives? Thanks.","Noel Wallace","Thanks, Steve. So let me go back to a little bit about - with regards to my upfront comments around how we are framing growth. As I talked about at CAGNY, we are really looking at three specific priorities and in many respects that would kind of prioritize how we are spending, that will unfold through the balance of the year. Historically, we were very focused on line extensions and to a certain extent growing in the adjacencies, and we quickly recognized that we have to have a real balance.","Colgate has big core businesses that are in many countries around the world that had significant leakage relative to share and were not driving the growth that we needed, hence our need to put real superior bundles behind the core in order to shore up the core, so when we balance that with increased innovation behind adjacencies like naturals, like therapeutics, that we get the incremental growth moving forward and that's exactly how we are going to prioritize it.","Relative to M&A, certainly there is a lot of activity out there, we are still going to be extremely thoughtful on how we approach M&A. We have obviously done some great M&A over the last couple of years, specifically PCA and Elta which we are very excited about, as those assets become available we will think through them very carefully relative to their strategic fit in the business and what they bring, and if we find the right value we will certainly go after them.","Operator","And we will go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about the balance. You talked a lot about the balance between developed markets versus emerging market performance, volume versus price, so as you progress through the year how do you think about that because I would assume that there, you talked about some of the pricing that you are planning to do in some of the markets, you know, a third of it still hasn't rolled through so I would assume that price becomes a bigger component of that. Do you think that volume then sort of turns a little bit and just your overview on the balance between all those different factors?","Noel Wallace","Sure. I think at the heart of a lot of that good balance this year, particularly between emerging and the developed world was the fact that we are starting to see some of the categories turn in the emerging markets which is particularly encouraging for us given our footprint.","So moving forward, we would continue to see that balance of pricing and volume moving through the balance of the year. The innovation will support the volume that the innovation will support the premiumization that we are going after, particularly as we see total and the Science Diet business, which is just now going into the U.S. and the roll out through the balance of the year start to take hold. So we will continue to see the right balance as we move forward keeping the investment there will help drive that.","Operator","Next is Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good morning.","Noel Wallace","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","So, Noel, my question is on industry growth rates relative to your organic sales growth guidance at 2% to 4%. So at this point where would you peg industry growth in Total as you roll up your business and your geographies relative to the 3% organic growth in the quarter? How has that changed if at all since 4Q, you sound more upbeat on emerging markets, which is obviously a good thing. And then, for us, is it fair that we should expect an acceleration in your organic sales growth over the next couple of quarters as year-over-year comps seasons more spending goes into the marketplace and it seems like the emerging markets are in a better place? So thank you for that.","Noel Wallace","Sure. The categories as you mentioned, we have seen a tick-up particularly in emerging. We are modeling organic, excuse me, we are modeling category growth rates in that 3% to 5.5% depending on the market around the world.","In the developed world, somewhere between flat to around 2.5%, we seen a little bit of tick-up in the U.S., Europe continues to move sideways, but the U.S. we are seeing a little bit of acceleration there.","So we think we are relative to our guidance on the 2% to 4%. We are well-positioned where the categories are and if Latin America and particularly Africa continued to accelerate or hold at the current levels that would bode well for us. But we said that before, let\u2019s get a couple more quarters underneath us relative to those categories and we will go from there.","Operator","We will now go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Thanks. Good morning.","Noel Wallace","Hey, Bill.","Bill Chappell","Noel, first a clarification you had said to Bonnie\u2019s question you came into the year two-thirds of pricing and still a third to go. Are we still a third to go or did you do a fair amount during first quarter?","And then, the second just on Hill\u2019s, can you give us a little more color on the strength and maybe from a market share perspective we don\u2019t get to see so much of the channels are untracked it\u2019s kind of hard to understand exactly where you are getting it. Is it from emphasis from the specialty channel coming back or is it just the vet channel is doing well or just help us give more color why it\u2019s doing better?","Noel Wallace","Sure. Well, let me take the pricing question first. Yeah, we are about right. We are right where we thought we would be about two-thirds of the business. We are seeing a roll through and a third to go and we have got some pricing that\u2019s going into place starting the second quarter. So we are quite comfortable with that in terms of how that\u2019s going to roll through the balance of the quarters in \u201819.","Hill\u2019s is a great story. I come back to a lot of the fundamentals of our strategy, which is driving the core working on adjacencies and particularly expanding into new segments and new retail environments, and Hill\u2019s ticks those boxes extraordinarily well.","We obviously had great growth in the fourth quarter, really strong start to the year, relative to what we are seeing Science Diet re-launch and just now going into the market as I mentioned in terms of the full impact of the new packaging and the new formulations, which as I mentioned at CAGNY will be coupled with increased pricing and the media investment behind that business particularly in North America will now start to go into the market in the second quarter.","U.S. had a very strong first quarter, and, again, I think it\u2019s driven by great market share gains particularly in pet specialty. We obviously continue to have a very strong e-commerce business and holding shares there and we -- in terms of expanding into new channels, we have gone aggressively the farm and feed channel, which was growing and we were under indexed and we have seen incremental distribution and sales growth come from that.","So, all-in-all, really pleased with where Hill\u2019s is right now and particularly pleased given a lot of the Science Diet stuff is still to come in the U.S. and we will start to roll that out in the balance of the world as we move into the second half.","Operator","We will go to Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.","Robert Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much and nice start to the year.","Noel Wallace","Thanks, Robert.","Robert Ottenstein","Wondering if we could drill down a little bit more into what\u2019s going on in Brazil and so a couple of sub points, perhaps, if you can talk a little bit more about the competitive situation you mentioned still very tough promo environment. Is there any visibility on that changing and how do you expect to deal with that?","Second, the rollout of the therapeutics, elmex, meridol in Brazil. How that\u2019s going? Do you need more investment there? Is it going to be kind of self-funding at this point, and I guess tied to that, how you are doing in the pharmacy channel? Thank you.","Noel Wallace","Great. Thanks, Robert. So again good results coming out of Brazil. We were pleased particularly given that we generated both volume and pricing in Brazil in the quarter, which was terrific to see.","Relative to the promotion environment yeah we saw some of our competitors go quite aggressive in the first quarter. We decided not to chase that with our business. It was interesting the share loss that we saw in the first quarter, which is roughly about 1 point on the business. We are still at a 72 share, came out [inaudible], our Sorriso brand, which is our secondary brand because of the deep discount and we saw some from our competitors.","That being said our instinct is that that particularly be driven by a high promotional activity that we always see in the first quarter do we often not chase given some of the foreign exchange headwinds that we have seen in that market and we think that will balance itself out through the remainder of the year.","Early days on elmex. We have rolled it into the pharmacy channel. The pharmacy channel is roughly 15% to 20% of the ACV in Brazil. Early news is really good on elmex in terms of driving incremental share in the pharmacy channel we are up about a point so far in the channel but lots more to go.","The investments there we ring fenced it it\u2019s an important strategic initiative for us and we are optimistic that we will continue to see particularly that channel grow as you move through the balance of the year.","Operator","Next is Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking my question.","Noel Wallace","Hey, Jason.","Jason English","Sticking on the topic of going a little bit deeper and into the markets. Can you take us a little bit deeper into China, give us a beat on where you think the consumption is tracking and whether or not your net sales are still lagging on inventory reduction or whether or not that\u2019s been flushed out?","And then a second and sorry for following on, thinking about your gross margin trajectory for the year, cost inflation headwinds stepped down fairly sizable 4Q to 1Q. How should we expect that to trend through the remainder of the year?","Noel Wallace","Thanks, Jason. So quickly coming back to China. Not a lot more to add there. We are obviously it came in in-line with our expectations. The inventory de-stocking continues. We made good progress in the fourth quarter, continued progress in the first. We are rebalancing, as I mentioned some of our go-to-market structures and how we take the product to market, particularly as it results around the portfolio specifically, and that will unfold as we move through the balance of the year. So as I said we expect to see sequential improvement moving through the back half of the year and that is on schedule as we speak.","Relative to gross margin, so your question around cost, yeah, we saw significant elevation of cost in the fourth quarter, a little bit better in the first quarter, in the range of 4% to 6% commodity in terms of increases moving through the gross profit line and we expect that to abate as we move through and lapse some of the foreign exchange transaction impact that we had last year that occurred in the first half and will get better as we move through the balance of the year. So the answer to your question is, yes, we expect that to abate, which has given us confidence that we can continue to hold and increase gross margins moving forward.","Operator","We will go to Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Hey. Good morning, guys. Noel, you mentioned e-commerce in various parts of your prepared remarks. Can you perhaps provide us a little more context what your share looks like online versus elsewhere maybe what your margins look like online versus elsewhere? And then, I think, you said, e-commerce was up 28%, are you able to give some context on how much that contributed to organic growth?","Noel Wallace","Sure. So, listen, first of all, we are very pleased. Again, coming back to those growth strategies that I outlined earlier, expanding in new retail environments and getting our fair share so to speak is a real strategic focus for us.","And e-commerce is an important area of that. As I mentioned, we were up just shy of 29% in the first quarter, and importantly, that was driven with a strong North America performance. Their shares were up 1.7 points on the Colgate franchise alone, which was terrific and likewise driven by a continued strong growth on the Hill\u2019s business.","The softness we have is to a certain extent in Asia, while the e-commerce shares are flat we didn\u2019t see the growth that we are expecting there and that\u2019s part of the turnaround strategy that we are looking to execute as we move through the back half of this year.","Operator","Next is Steven Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula","Hi. Good morning and congratulations on the new seat.","Noel Wallace","Thanks, Steve.","Steven Strycula","So, Noel, my question is as you look across the portfolio after the work you guys have done the last few years, which three countries and category combinations do you think are the biggest revenue and profit dollar opportunity for an incrementality standpoint as we look forward the next few years? And the quick second part of that would be, is there any reason you guys haven\u2019t given anymore defined parameter around your gross margin outlook for the year relative to what you did last quarter? Thanks.","Noel Wallace","So listen on the categories we love all our children equally in this case, obviously, Oral Care continues to be a real focus for us. The first quarter organic that we delivered was largely driven by toothpaste and by Hill\u2019s, and so we are very encouraged.","But as John mentioned in his opening remarks, we had positive organic across all the categories which in our view is the quality and the composition that we are ultimately looking for. But from a prioritization, certainly, Oral Care, Personal Care, and our Pet Food have always been our top three priorities and we will continue to focus on growth in that regard.","In terms of your second question, it was around gross margins. Listen, we -- as I have mentioned not much more to add. We expect gross margins to be up on the year. We expect some of the cost environment that we saw in the fourth quarter and the first quarter to abate as we move through the balance of the year.","We have got more pricing to come and we obviously have the Total re-launch and Science Diet re-launch rolling out around the world. So we are comfortable with where we are now at the current spot rates and we will see how that unfolds, but comfortable in terms of the outlook that we have given.","Operator","And we will go to Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Thanks, and good morning, everybody. Wanted to ask about specific learning from PCA and Elta. And I am curious do you think you can take those brands into other channels. How do you think about differences of selling into specific specialty type channels, Doctors\u2019 offices and the like versus mass or other channels, and perhaps indulge me kind of to take it a step further what gives confidence that you can have success in skincare more broadly just given competitive dynamics in the market and I am kind of alluding to your comment about expanding on skincare going forward?","Noel Wallace","Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Let me step back for a minute and give you a little bit of insight in terms of how we look at M&A. Not just simply from the economics and the growth aspects of those categories or businesses that we acquire.","But more importantly what are the core competencies and learning that they can bring into the larger enterprise across the company, and Elta and PCA fit those parameters just perfectly. Obviously, we love business with strong endorsement levels. Elta at the dermatology level and PCA at the aesthetician level and we have learned from what we have done obviously at Oral Care and our Vet business on how to successfully monetize that going forward.","Both those businesses have unique aspects to them. Elta has an incredible e-commerce business, and an influencer model, particularly as they have digital very effectively. Likewise, PCA has a wonderful in-office strategy in terms of how they go-to-market there, particularly around their data driven marketing that they use.","So some great insights that we will bring into the business and certainly leverage across other categories and we continue to dial up the investment in those businesses given the great growth that we are seeing coming out of them at least initially in the first quarter.","Moving forward, Skincare is interesting to us. We have got two businesses that we are focused on right now. We will continue to drive those moving forward. If we see other things come available that we think we are interested in and will bring real value to the Colgate Company, we will certainly go after those. But we are very focused on what we have right now and that\u2019s how we are going to lay it out for the balance of the year.","Noel Wallace","So, again, let me extend my thanks to the entire Colgate team, obviously, a good quarter that we should be proud of. We all know there\u2019s a lot of work to do. We are very focused on growth and let\u2019s get after it. We are in the second quarter as they say and we will be in touch with everyone on the call as we move through the balance of the quarter and into the third quarter. Thanks so much.","Operator","And thank you very much. That does conclude our call for today. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"6251":["Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) Q4 2013 Earnings Call January 30, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Bina Thompson","Ian M.

Today's call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","Just a reminder, there may be a slight delay before the question-and-answer session begins due to the Web simulcast.","And at this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead.","Bina Thompson","Thank you, Vicky, and good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, and these statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements. So for information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements on forward-looking Statements.","This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results compared in accordance with GAAP. We will discuss organic sales growth, excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. We will also discuss gross profit, gross profit margin, SG&A as a percent of sales, operating profit, operating profit margin, net income and earnings per share on a diluted basis, excluding the impact of certain items described in the press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted in the For Investors section of our website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.","We are very pleased with our strong finish to a strong year. We exited 2013 with the strongest quarterly organic sales growth for the year at the high end of our targeted range of 5% to 7%. We enjoyed good gross margin growth, and this combined with a reduction in our fixed expenses as a percent of sales allowed us to increase advertising absolutely and as a percent of sales, while increasing our operating profit as well. This is, of course, a simple financial strategy that has served us so well over many years.","Cash generation was strong and our balance sheet is solid. Our savings programs continue to deliver. Our ongoing Funding the Growth contributed significant savings. And in addition, our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track, both from a cost and savings perspective.","For full year 2013, we realized savings of $40 million after-tax, and expect that number for 2014 to be between $90 million and $100 million after-tax or about twice as much. And we've made progress in all 3 areas of the program, expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing global supply chain facilities.","Market shares are strong and growing. We maintained our leadership share of the toothpaste category, with strong market share performance virtually everywhere in the world. Our global manual toothbrush share is up 40 basis points to almost 33% on a year-to-date basis. And our global mouthwash share is now at 17%, up 130 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Our relentless focus on innovation has paid off and we have more in the pipeline for this year and beyond.","So let's turn first to North America. We're pleased with our 3% organic sales growth in the quarter, given the sluggish macroeconomic environment, which resulted in slower category growth, as well as a continued promotional and highly competitive environment. As referenced in the press release, our shares are strong in a number of categories. Good cost control and gross margin increases have allowed us to continue to increase advertising support behind those existing and new products. Our innovation pipeline remains very full and we have some very exciting activities this quarter.","Our progress in manual toothbrushes and mouthwash in the U.S. has been excellent. We have already told you about our record manual toothbrush share of over 38%.","In mouthwash, both Colgate Optic White and Colgate Total mouthwashes launched within the last 1.5 years have delivered a full year combined share of 5.6%, with the most recent read at 7%.","Retail support behind Colgate Total Advanced mouthwash has been at record levels. The growth in the category has been totally driven by this new product and added nicely to retail sales. Over half of the mouthwash buyers are either new to the category or trading up, which drives incrementality. And in addition, trial and repeat rates are above previous competitive launches.","As you know, our Colgate Optic White products have been very successful, particularly as we have been able to drive a regimen approach with toothpaste, toothbrush and mouthwash.","New to the franchise this quarter is the Colgate Optic White manual toothbrush and built-in whitening pen. This product delivered all the benefits important to a whitening enthusiast. It's effective, affordable and convenient. The toothbrush combines stain-remover cups and polishing bristles, while the pen, which fits in the handle of the brush, uses a breakthrough formula with proprietary silicon adhesives. Together, they deliver whiter teeth in 2 days. The superpremium price increase is a growth opportunity for retailers while still providing affordable whitening for the consumer.","In the Personal Care category, this quarter, we are launching Speed Stick Gear antiperspirant and deodorant sticks, gels and body sprays. This new line in underarm protection is targeted towards the millennial male. It comes in distinctive premium packaging with preferred masculine fragrances and unique clinically superior technologies. The Speed Stick Gear antiperspirant contains DryCore technology, which absorbs better for 48-hour protection. Speed Stick Gear has been formulated to have excellent adhesion to skin and utilizes a highly effective active ingredient. As you expect with such an exciting new product, the launch will be supported with a full integrated marketing campaign, including traditional media, digital and other consumer engagement activity.","Also in the Personal Care category, we're launching Softsoap D\u00e9cor Collection liquid hand soap. This new product appeals to the shopper who's looking for offerings found at upscale specialty stores at an affordable price more typical of mass retail. The D\u00e9cor packaging and exquisite fragrances are inspired from specialty. And while more affordable, are still premium-priced to a base liquid soap line, which drives trade up and incremental dollars for the retailer. Initial trade acceptance has been excellent, with full distribution at a majority of accounts.","Turning to Europe\/South Pacific. The macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging across most of Europe. Slowdown in the euro area has continued. While Germany and France recorded a positive GDP growth, Spain, Italy and Greece once again reported sharper decreases. The unemployment rate remains high at 12.1% in November 2013, even though it has been stable since April. Despite this, consumer confidence in the euro area shows nascent signs of recovery since the second quarter, which is a modest positive as we enter 2014. So against this backdrop, we're quite pleased with our fourth quarter performance in this region with positive organic volume growth of 3%, and solid gross margin and operating margin growth. In addition, as you know, many of our global growth and efficiency programs initiatives have been focused in this part of the world and are already manifesting themselves in a reduction of overhead expenses.","Market shares year-to-date are up in toothpaste, manual and powered toothbrushes, mouthwash, deodorants and fabric softeners. Our innovation program throughout 2013 has been critical to our good market share performance and we expect this to continue into 2014 across all our categories.","In Oral Care, we will be launching Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer in select countries this quarter. As you know, this superior anti-cavity toothpaste was first introduced in Turkey last fall, and launched in Brazil late in the fourth quarter. This leading technology is incorporated in the first and only toothpaste that directly fights sugar acids and plaques, which are the #1 cause of cavity. The patented formula helps deactivate sugar acids before they can harm teeth, while strengthening and restoring the enamel that helps prevent cavity formation. The initial introductions in the Nordic group of countries, Spain and Portugal, will, of course, be supported by a full, integrated marketing campaign, including a public health campaign.","In Europe, as in other parts of the world, the whitening category is large and growing. This dynamic segment requires continuous innovation and so we are launching Colgate Max White One Optic premium toothpaste in high-impact packaging that offers an instantly visible whitening effect.","To complement the toothpaste, we are also relaunching our Colgate Max White One mouthwash, which contains an advanced stain-prevention system to seal out stains and seal in natural whiteness.","We're very pleased with the progress our Sanex business continues to make. Year-to-date, market shares are up in both shower gel and deodorants. And to help continue this momentum, we're continuing the rollout of our new Sanex Dermo shower gels with the Dermo Active 3 complex, as well as launching a new antiperspirant and a new deodorant.","The first is Sanex Dermo no perfume designed for consumers with very sensitive skin. The product contains no perfume, is hypoallergenic and delivers 24 hours protection. The second is Sanex Naturprotect extra efficacy containing natural milk mineral alum and an anti-wetness agent, which provides protection for 48 hours.","I mentioned earlier the increase in our fabric conditioner shares, up 30 basis points year-over-year to almost 25%. This quarter, we are rolling out in Europe a premium innovation, which has met with success in France, Soupline Perfect Glide, which has a unique formula with a polymer that allows for a perfect glide and an innovative aroma technology that makes ironing more pleasant. As you know, ironing is important, but most consumers view it as a chore they don't enjoy.","Turning to Latin America. This region exited 2013 with excellent momentum, delivering the strongest quarterly organic sales growth of the year at 12.5%. Our leadership continues in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes and our mouthwash share is closely approaching the leading competitor. Our year-to-date toothpaste market share in Brazil is at a record level of 71.5%. As you know, we launched Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Neutrazucar in the fourth quarter. Early leads show a share of over 3%, which has added incremental share to our overall business. And in addition, both Colgate Luminous White and Colgate Total toothpaste's premium price offerings are gaining share.","Our year-to-date toothpaste share in Mexico remains over 80% despite continued competitive promotional activity. And our business in the traditional trade remains strong and we are building distribution and share in the growing pharmacy channel. Our year-to-date manual toothbrush share is up 1.5 points across the region, with every subsidiary delivering market leadership share gains and holding the #1 position. Both Brazil and Mexico achieved record shares as they continue to offer the consumer a wide range of offerings at all price points.","Across Latin America, in mouthwash, we closed the share gap from over 20 points in 2009 to just over 3 points year-to-date. Innovation have helped this result, as well as strong sampling plans across countries to maximize category growth and increase consumption. Year-to-date, our share increased over 50 basis points to 36.4%.","In Personal Care, our year-to-date market share increased in both bar soaps and deodorants, and we now lead the bar soap market with a 29.4% share -- with 29.7% in the most recent period. New products in both these categories should help us to continue to deliver strong results.","And as elsewhere, innovation continues in the first quarter. We will, of course, continue the rollout of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Neutrazucar toothpaste and expect to build on the success and learnings from our Brazilian launch.","In addition, we're beginning a comprehensive marketing campaign behind Colgate Total Professional whitening toothpaste, which promises up to 95% stain removal in 2 weeks.","A new offering in our Palmolive body cleansing business is Palmolive Naturals Royal Jelly and Yogurt. This new line of bar soap, shower gel and liquid hand soap contains ingredients well-known for body-cleaning solutions.","Royal jelly is known to nourish the skin, while yogurt is known for its properties to soften the skin.","In underarm products, this quarter, we are launching men's Speed Stick and Lady Speed Stick stress defense deodorant. Stress-related sweat is induced by a different set of glands that are primarily concentrated in the underarm area. Unlike regular or thermal sweat that is used by the body as a temperature-control mechanism, stress-related sweat comes in unexpected situations. Lady Speed Stick and Men Speed Stick stress defense formulas activate in those specifics sweat moments, offering effective sweat protection.","Turning to Asia. This region delivered another strong quarter of organic sales growth. And of particular note, both China and India grew organic sales double-digit, despite concerns regarding slowing growth in those regions.","Across the region, our year-to-date toothbrush share -- toothpaste share increased 20 basis points. In India, our share was up 70 basis points to 54.1% and the strong performance was across all price points.","In China, our share increased 30 basis points to almost 34%. In this market, premium brands have performed particularly well, our Colgate Optic White, as well as some of the Darlie products, for example.","Our year-to-date manual toothbrush share increased in 7 of 10 countries. Our targeted efforts to increase share in India has paid off with our share now at almost 42%, up 240 basis points on a year-to-date basis.","Our regional mouthwash share continues to increase, up 60 basis points year-to-date to 20.1%, breaking the 20% barrier. Our most recent share was 23.5%. China has been a particularly successful market for us. Innovation in both the Colgate and Darlie equities has helped us achieve almost a 35% share of the market, up 260 basis points year-to-date.","As you expect, we have a robust lineup of new products for this quarter as well. Our on the ground consumer innovation centers have identified some important consumer preferences and beliefs in which they have developed some relevant and exciting bundles. In China, for instance, charcoal has long been believed to have powerful antibacterial properties. Accordingly, last year, we launched Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal toothbrush, which has been well-received. This quarter, we're launching Colgate 360\u00b0 Charcoal Deep Clean toothpaste, along with Colgate 360\u00b0 Charcoal toothbrush. The toothpaste addresses the consumers concern that dirt can be left in between teeth even after brushing by reducing bacteria buildup by 99% even in between teeth.","The companion toothbrush offers charcoal bristles that are slimmer for better cleaning.","In the mouthwash category, we're launching Colgate Plaque Jasmine Tea, developed for the consumer who wants to use mouthwash to help keep their breath fresh who doesn't like the strong and burning mouth feel. This mouthwash contains jasmine and tea extracts, which provides fresh breath without the burning sensation.","Africa\/Eurasia. Our winning on the ground strategies in this part of the world are resulting in strong performance as well. Innovation has played a key role in good market share progress. While our regional toothpaste market share is up 20 basis points on a year-to-date basis, it has increased 50 basis points in Russia to almost 33%, 170 basis points in Turkey to almost 29%, and 300 basis points in South Africa to 50%. As you know, Turkey was our lead country for our Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer bundle, and while it is early days, initial shares are already at 2%.","In mouthwash, our regional share is up at almost [indiscernible] and is now the #2 brand. More innovation is planned for this quarter. Colgate Total Pro Interdental toothpaste, Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash, and Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal toothbrush, just to name a few.","In the Personal Care category, an interesting new product developed for the African market is Protex African [ph] therapy. As you know, Protex is a premium brand sold in many developing markets with an antibacterial positioning. This new mini line contains a unique combination of some of Africa's greatest skin secrets. It helps protect natural healthy looking skin and comes 2 variants: glycerin and African herbs and cocoa butter and lemon.","Hill's. We're very pleased with Hill's continued solid performance. This marks the third quarter of volume growth and the strongest organic sales growth in 5 years. Also while gross margin, as expected, was down year-over-year, it increased from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and we expect that trend to continue in 2014.","Our launch in Hill's Ideal Balance continues to meet this success. Early trial and repeat results are very promising. Now that the product is in the natural section of the large-format retailers, cannibalization of other Hill's brands is at an all-time low and sales of Ideal Balance are growing strong double-digits. Healthy support behind the products will continue in the first half of this year, including nutritional consultants at superstores and eye-catching pallet displays.","Our Prescription Diet business remains strong and growing. We've told you on previous calls about Prescription Diet metabolic. This breakthrough weight management diet is now sold in over 50 countries and sales are growing at a healthy double-digit rate, driving our global share of the weight category up by almost 2 points year-to-date.","This quarter, we will be launching another new Prescription Diet product, c\/d Multicare stress, for the nutritional management of urinary tract health in cats. Stress is an important contributing factor for some urinary conditions in cats. Prescription Diet c\/d Multicare stress has been clinically tested to reduce the recurrence of feline idiopathic cystitis, which can arise from stress. The Q1 launch will be supported by a comprehensive in-clinic communication plan and sampling program with veterinary professionals and their clients. The feline urinary category is the largest feline therapeutic nutrition category globally.","So in summary, we're extremely pleased with the way that we finished the year 2013. Our organic sales growth was strong around the world, our gross profit margin increased and our market shares are healthy. Colgate people around the world are all focused on our strategies and priorities, thereby delivering these consistent strong results.","Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track, as are our ongoing Funding the Growth initiatives. Our innovation pipeline is full and we're excited about the many new product initiatives we just told you about. So we expect this momentum to continue in 2014, and look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go throughout the year.","That's the end of my prepared remarks, Vicky, and now, we can turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My first question has to do with currency. In 2012, if currency was a 400 basis point headline, pressure on top line, can you tell us what it would've been roughly on EBIT and earnings? And to the extent currency rates remain where they are now, what are you modeling for 2014, again, both on the top and the bottom line?","Ian M. Cook","Thanks, Wendy, and thanks for the question. The -- I would, though, before answering it, just like to reaffirm how we're thinking about the year 2014. As we have said before, we have been deploying the strategy that Bina mentioned for some 8 years now, and we think, focusing on that, which you can say is focusing on the fundamentals, is serving us well. So as we look at 2014, we're thinking and planning for top line growth to continue in that 5% to 7% organic growth range. We are looking for our gross margin to expand between 75 and 125 basis points, and that traces to a slightly more benign commodity environment, the continued strength of our Funding the Growth program, the on-plan tracking of our global growth and efficiency program, which will also lower our overhead, allowing us to continue in 2014, as we did in 2013, to increase our advertising, absolutely and as a percentage to sales, behind the rich and broad range of new products worldwide that Bina mentioned. Foreign exchange, as we have said before, is -- from a top line point of view, has a lower impact on a profitability point of view. So the top line impact in 2014, we have, based on the release we sent out, a hit of 3%. And when you look at the operating impact of that, it is near a 4% to 5% on the bottom line. And I think we fairly consistently said the bottom line impact is greater than the top line impact, and that ratio has historically been roughly the same. I would add that with the confirmation of our comfort with the consensus of external analysts' estimates and many of the notes we saw this morning, have that spot on, you're looking at a dollar EPS increase around 9%. And I would say, that's around 13% on a currency neutral basis. And that's the way we're thinking about the year.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just as a follow-up to that. Obviously, your savings are accelerating. So in theory, hypothetically, suppose the FX impact worsened, how do you think about the tradeoffs between taking some of that $100 million of savings and dropping it to the bottom line? Or do you think, if FX worsens, well, then the reported earnings growth would slow?","Ian M. Cook","I think, Wendy, in the world we're in, we'll respond to that when the time comes. We said in our release that the emerging news from Venezuela, while not yet clear enough to take a view, is not factored in, nor any other macroeconomic impact, which we cannot yet foresee. What I would say is that, I think, as we have shown in the past, our response and communication on the view we take would be timely and comprehensive.","Operator","And we'll now go to the next question which comes from Ian Gordon with S&P Capital IQ.","Ian J. Gordon - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Just on the commodities again. So I think you did again repeat that you're expecting a more benign environment to this year. Well, we have been hearing, I think, from some other companies that it's becoming a little bit more of a headwind. So maybe a little bit of color there and maybe that's a good opportunity to sort of give some of the drivers of the gross margin for the fourth quarter and maybe how you're thinking about what the individual components will be for 2014?","Ian M. Cook","Okay, Ian. Well, let me start first by doing our now customary walk-through of the fourth quarter and take that as a jumping off point. So if you take the fourth quarter of 2012, the start point is 58.6%. And if you then work your way through, pricing gave us nothing, restructuring gave us 10 basis points, Funding the Growth, strong at the end of the year as it customarily is, 290 basis points. Material prices, a headwind of 260, that's a combination of cost and transaction, a little bit of -- or another 10 basis points, which gets you to the 59 1 or the increase of 50 basis points. Now as we look at 2014, I said benign. Benign for us is around about a 1% increase in raw and packing material costs. And the way we have thought about oil as an input is around $110, and I would say it is in that zone today. The one thing I would stress is that, of course, with the recent foreign exchange impacts we have seen, there will be a related increase in transaction costs, which we are, of course, absorbing in the plan that we have for 2014, which is going to see our pricing at the higher end of our 1% to 2% pricing target for the year.","Operator","We will now go to Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer & Co.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I guess, since we just mentioned pricing, I'll start there. In terms of the pricing in the quarter, it looked like it was flat overall. How much of the pricing -- is it easy to tell, how much of the pricing is that you took in this quarter or the promotion you took in the quarter was to benefit new product launches and how much of that was a response to competitive activity? And then, secondly, just a follow-up on Hill's, it looked like another very good quarter in the fourth quarter. Have we turned the corner there on profitability? And should we see a return to more 2012 levels in terms of margins and EBIT there?","Ian M. Cook","Okay. Well, thanks, Joe. For us, the mix effect -- we have a dollar-weighted volume. So mix effect is in the volume growth. So when you think about pricing, for us, what you see across the divisions is pricing up in the emerging markets obviously beginning to address the transaction impact, and pricing in Europe and North America beginning to react to the promotional environment we are in correspondingly negative. I think, the good news is that the organic was still 6.5, and that volume is very strong at 6.5. And I think, very importantly, as we think about our marketing mix modeling, notwithstanding that position in the fourth quarter, our gross margin was still up 50 basis points, right in the middle of the guidance we gave there. So as we think forward and as we have said many, many times, our innovation seeks to deliver premiumization and therefore be accretive to gross margin by developing ideas that consumers believe they get good value for the premium they pay. On the other hand, from a promotional point of view, we don't seek to chase what we think are unsustainable promotional efforts that simply load pantry but will take growth out of future quarters, although we will selectively adjust to defend our market share where we feel we need to. And Hill's, we're very pleased with the consecutive quarterly performance on Hill's. We think, it traces, as we have said before, to a growing portfolio of very competitive innovation in the early periods catch-up. But I think, as Bina went through both on the last call and this call, you're now beginning to see, I think, some innovative, market-leading innovation on the Hill's business. And as we said on the last call, we expect that innovation profile to continue on Hill's. Gross margin is a rebuild on Hill's, and we increased gross margin third quarter to fourth. And again, as Bina said earlier, we expect that to continue into 2014. So we're pleased with the pace and we plan to continue that momentum in 2014.","Operator","And we'll go to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ian, just one point of clarification. The comment about the sequential improvement in the Hill's margins versus Q4's level, is that as you move throughout the year in 2014, or is that more just looking at Q1 versus Q4?","Ian M. Cook","It's looking at the Q1 versus Q4.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, I was hoping you could walk us through what you're seeing from a macro perspective as you look across the various emerging markets, geographies, any changes in consumer spending or impact on your categories and some of this volatility in January, are you seeing any fallout from that?","Ian M. Cook","Well, the data we have from the categories is fourth quarter data. It seems to be the topic de jour, the emerging markets. And as we look around our world and we have had several of our executives traveling the world, I would say we are seeing consistently what we said on the third quarter call, which, if you go around the world, is basically to say that our categories, and I stress, we're talking our categories, not the macros or a general industry basket, our categories continue to grow mid to high single-digits in those emerging markets, which is pleasing. In the North American environment, our categories are growing around low single-digits, around 2. And as Bina said, in the fourth quarter, we saw that slow a little bit. And as we have said before, and it's a view we continue to take on Europe, notwithstanding a certain amount of growing enthusiasm for a macro turnaround, the overall category growth in Europe is essentially flat, with some categories modestly up and other categories down. And we continue to expect that to be the case for the next several years, which was why when we embarked upon our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we said, and you've already seen some of it announced, that the impact would be disproportionate to Europe because we wanted to rightsize our cost structure against likely more muted category growth in the medium term, and that's exactly what we're doing. So I would say the world continues, in our businesses, to be pretty much the way we saw it in the third quarter and current data shows no overall change to that.","Operator","Next is Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Ian, I just want to make sure, on the Max Cavi with sugar acid, I think, the comment was you're moving into Spain, Portugal and the Nordic countries this quarter. And I'm just trying to understand, I was kind of under the impression you were looking more at developing regions for that first before you moved into developed. So is that kind of a change and maybe you could give kind of an update of what countries you do plan to go into this quarter? I think, Bina mentioned a few of them.","Ian M. Cook","Well, the answer to that, Bill, is we're doing a few things. I have said before, we have said before, that we do think the biggest opportunity is in the emerging markets. Clearly, we're using Turkey and Brazil to see the pace of growth we can get there. The European entries is really to see, in a fairly simple regulatory environment, what sort of marketplace potential that product may have. As the year unfolds, you will continue to see more of a focus on the emerging markets, and the only reason we didn't mention it is that we didn't want to reveal, and still don't, when and where those entries would be.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just to make sure I understand, you go in, is the entry margin-accretive? I mean, is this a higher-margin product than what you're replacing?","Ian M. Cook","We're happy with the margin, Bill. And we are happy with the margin. Let's just leave it at that.","Operator","And we'll go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Earlier in the call, you batted down some concerns with respect to growth and trade up opportunity in China and India, which was helpful. But are there other markets where you are seeing some pushback? It certainly sounds like growth in Brazil is balanced with growth in the anti-cavity and Neutrazucar, as well as Luminous and Total, but what about Mexico and other key countries?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. I think, I guess, there are 2 factors here. Consumers, and I think, this is the duty of a consumer marketing company, are prepared to buy things that work and deliver a benefit that they see a value with. And we don't believe that, that is limited to certain countries. We believe that one can develop products that deliver those benefits and that the consumers are prepared to pay for. And I would say, without being too clich\u00e9, that's a global statement. So premium innovation can work anywhere, and I think, it's our duty and our challenge to keep finding ways to make it work. In certain parts of the world, you see a promotional activity stepped up as perhaps some people chase our market share, and the view we have taken on these things is that all you are really doing is advancing purchases that, that is not a sustainable position to take. Now as we manage our business planning, we obviously manage a repertoire of activities that includes the premiumization, that includes an intelligent response to the marketplace environment we have and very much in those emerging markets where the down trade consumer struggles with cash, we put enormous focus on sizing and the pricing that goes with that sizing in order to provide an affordable entry point to those consumers, even if on a per mill basis, they're actually paying more for the product, you are meeting their cash outlay needs, so it can be accretive from a margin point of view and address the consumer. So all those 3 things are in play as we think about our business plans market by market.","Operator","Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo is next.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Ian, I was hoping to get your perspective on Latin American pricing. All right, I guess, so the gap between price and FX, where there's usually some relationship, I guess, is almost as wide as it's been ever in the last 20 years. And each time it's been this wide, it's gone the other way, it's bounced back, right? So if you go back to 2002, 1995, you've basically taken pricing to cover the currency later. So I was just wondering if you can give a little insight into whether there's any difference in the relationship between those 2 things today relative to those historical periods that would make us think it wouldn't bounce in the future. And I know Venezuela is a piece of it, maybe some price is actually what's more like mix or volume today, but I was wondering if you could just comment on that?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. It's a difficult question to answer crisply. But you would have to say that Venezuela is definitely a piece of it because that is a constraining factor on pricing given the regulations that are in place today. And equally, one has to say, Argentina, while intelligent movement can be made, it has not been with the freedom that maybe history would have allowed. And the second point to make is there is always a lead lag to your ability to take pricing. And frankly, in today's world, you see such a rapid shift in foreign exchange as opposed to a steady erosion that can be reacted to in a timely fashion that I think, yes, one will see a catch-up, but there is a lag to the catch-up, and Venezuela and Argentina are outliers in that regard from a Latin American point of view. So I hope that was clear.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. That helps. And I guess, just a quick follow-up on Venezuela. The news you're talking about, just to make sure I have it right, I mean, is this basically the announcement that the SICAD rate could be at VEB 11.3 instead of the VEB 6.3 that we've seen?","Ian M. Cook","It is, Chris. And the fact of the matter is, there is not enough clarity yet to make a definitive or come to a definitive conclusion as to how that is going to affect the business because you got translation, you got historical costs like inventory and you've got the cost of bringing raw materials and finished goods, and there is not yet enough definition around all of those things to take a view, but it is indeed that news that we are referring to. And as we said in our release, we're still reviewing and assessing to take a position there.","Operator","We'll now go to Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Ian, if you could just talk about any early insights from some of the Turkey test market or from Brazil on the anti-cavity product in terms of what's going on with category growth? Is it a trade-up? Any perspective you can share on just the dynamics around that product launch?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. First, I have to say, it is very, very early days. And I think, getting too excited is never a good thing ever in my view. So -- but I would tell you that from a distribution point of view, I would tell you, from a build of market share point of view and the early trial curve, they had been very good in both countries. We have not yet seen the full impact of the marketing plans, we have not yet felt the benefit of the sort of public health programs we're putting in place, nor do we have repeat number. But early indications are growing category, growing share, and certainly, a premiumization in that segment. So we'll keep you posted on how things unfold.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then, just a quick follow-up, unrelatedly. Just from a competitive intensity standpoint, I'm sorry if I missed this earlier, I had to hop off for a second, but as you look across all of your very heavy share markets, when you're 70%, 80% share, are you seeing some of the competitive intensity settle out or stabilize? I'm just trying to get an understanding of what some of the competitive behavior looked like recently?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. I guess, I would say, as a general view, there seems to be more promotional activity in the developed world and maybe that is people chasing a greater share of a pie that is not growing so fast, or in the European case, not growing at all. I would say, overall, in the emerging markets, nothing that we would point to, to say a dramatic difference in competitive activity, some country to country changes that we have observed, not enough to conclude a trend. And I think, we're meeting that hopefully intelligently and well. We're seeing our share in Brazil up. We're seeing our share in Mexico hold over 80%. We're seeing our share in Russia, over 33%. We're seeing our share in China up to 35%, and our share in India over 54%. So I think, we are balancing meeting the activity and yet bringing the innovation that provides true growth both from a category point of view and a market share point of view. But the big picture answer would be nothing to say there has been a noticeable trend change.","Operator","And we'll go to Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A couple of follow-up questions on pricing. Overall, it was flat this quarter and yet you're projecting, I think, 2% for next year. So could you specify more where that acceleration is coming? And also, this is sort of about 2014, the North America, your organic sales growth was 3%. Is that something that's reasonable to expect for next year? And in answering that, can you talk about whether you think you'll start gaining share in toothpaste?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Okay, Alice. Well, the pricing that we will recover in 2014 will, of course, be global pricing. But I think, it would be fair to say, given the transaction impact, the bias for that pricing would be more in the emerging markets. We are pleased with our North American organic growth prospects. The U.S. market share is one of many market shares that we have around the world. And as we said on the last call, there has been a, shall we say, slightly elevated promotional environment, some of which we are choosing to respond to, and some of which we have not and will not because we don't think it's reasonable. I do think we will see market share improve over the balance of this year, but I would make the comment, when you're thinking about a global business, you're going to have situations from time to time where certain geographies face short-term pressures. But if you take the long-term view in terms of our share, whether it's North America or all the world, you see pretty strong progress, and you raise toothpaste, as Bina mentioned, we're up to a 7% now in mouth rinse and we're fully global in that business, 7% share in the U.S. And of course, our toothbrush leadership share is now over 38%. So we will do what is right by the business and we believe that will lead to share growth. But we're not going to abandon sensible business principles just to chase market share.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Ian, so you're going to be more second half-weighted for EPS growth this year?","Ian M. Cook","I wouldn't comment on that, Alice. I wouldn't comment on that.","Operator","We'll go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So just a first clarification. Moving from a 6% EPS growth that you delivered in 2013 to the 9% in 2014, I think, from your -- from the mosaic of your commentary, it sounds like it's more really gross margin-driven, particularly cost-cutting and FX. So just a clarification there. And then, what I've noticed is that a lot of the questions have to do with this volume price differential. And I know you guys resisted breaking out volume between kind of true volume and mix, but given that there's just so many new products coming out, it's actually pretty tough for us to figure out what actually is going on in your top line. So can you give us a sense of quantifying maybe how much of that -- [indiscernible] emerging markets there, just your overall \"volume number\" is mix versus true volume or how much premiumization you get when you, on average, put out a new product or just something of that nature? And why it's tough for you guys as opposed to every other company to kind of split out that volume and mix within that number?","Ian M. Cook","Well, the -- to come back to your point of clarification, yes, I would say, the broad headline is, that is a fair conclusion. We will see improvement in our gross margin. We will see improvement in our overhead, driven by the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, allowing us to increase absolutely and as a percent of sales our advertising. And as I said, although it's 9% from a dollar point of view, it's 13% from a local currency point of view. And as far as we're concerned, Ali, the way we have, for many, many years, explained the top line growth of our company is, we think, translatable. You see what the organic is, you know what the pure SBI [ph] is. And organic is organic. So it's in the numbers. And we think, an ability to deliver 5% to 7% organic growth consistently, and by expanding our gross margin, delivering healthy bottom line growth, is a reasonable and sensible model.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I think, the direction is clear on it in terms of the growth, it's just difficult to know how much is actually volume growth versus premiumization because one could argue one has a different longevity than the other. But okay, so anyway, I'm not going to win that battle today. To switch on Hill's, can you give us a sense of what's going on, particularly in Japan? And also, just back to this margin question, there was a time when the belief was that these margins could go back to historical levels. And I just want to double check that -- make sure you still feel that. And in that answer, if you could, the margin degradation we've seen, how much of that is promotional spend, so that could go away versus how much of that is the ingredient cost on Ideal Balance is very different and that will remain for a while?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Thanks, Ali. I think, first, let's take the Hill's business overall, and then the Hill's business gross margin in Japan. I have to say, we are pleased with the Hill's progress in a relatively short period of time. Remember, the U.S. is the largest part of that business by a long way. And we believe that we have the portfolio now and the innovation stream to remain competitive, not just in the U.S., but in other parts of the world going forward. We have said clearly and the plan we have built was to return the Hill's gross profit over the coming years to historical levels, and that remains the plan. We have seen the quarter-on-quarter increase to 4 [ph]. We talked that, that would continue into 2014, starting with the first quarter. And therefore, that will continue out in time. And of course, the innovation we are bringing gives us the opportunity to use the mix to further increase the gross margin. So the answer on that question is, yes, it is our plan to get back to historical levels, and we're on plan, and we feel good about that. Japan, which is not an enormous part of the Hill's business, we have had some market issues from a distribution and a portfolio competitiveness point of view. And the innovation work that we have done, driven by the U.S., is being deployed in Japan in 2014, along with some go-to market changes. And we believe that, that will correct the business in Japan over the coming little while.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now go to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I don't know if this is purposeful or not, but it seems like, regionally, when one region starts to sort of show accelerating margins, others fall. So the [indiscernible] the North American margins for instance and now they're hovering above 30%, but there's been obviously a fallback in Latin America and some other regions. So is that part of the broader strategy that we're going to focus on North America from a cost perspective, from a mix perspective, when that kind of runs its course, we're going to move to the next one or is this kind of the natural progression of things?","Ian M. Cook","I would say, Bill, it's the natural progression of things. We don't sort of rotate businesses across divisions in such a manner. Yes, no is the answer to your question.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I mean, so the operating margin in North America at 30%, I mean, is that sort of hitting against sort of like the natural resistance level of how high margins can go or do you think there's still is kind of more room there to get it up? And then, I guess, conversely, obviously, the African business is still very much in investment growth phase because it's much sort of earlier on the consumption curve, but could that be the big upside maybe if that 30% starts stabilizing?","Ian M. Cook","Well, as you know, we don't tend to get into discussions on EBIT because it depends where the timing of innovation by geography. So I would simply bring you back to the gross margin. And there, our objective is to grow gross margins in all divisions year upon year. And you know that our gross margin in the emerging markets is higher than the developed. So that will continue to be our plan. And then, depending on the timing of events, the EBIT margin will be what the EBIT margin will be. We don't tend to think or talk about lines of resistance on the gross margin. When we get to the 65%, we'll have another discussion.","Operator","And we'll go to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","First, a clarification. What is your current exposure to Venezuela as of the fourth quarter in terms of profit? My real question has to do again with this pricing topic that had been going on throughout the conference call and has to do with, it seems from the outside that you're being conservative in Latin America in terms of pricing. And at the same time, it looks as if when we look at Europe, very negative pricing, we don't know whether these are real price cuts or these are increases in trade or spending. But help us understand why you seem to be investing in terms of pricing in a region like Europe that has very little to offer going forward in terms of growth. And at the same time, you seem to be leaving pricing on the table in Latin America, at least this is the way that I see it from the outside.","Ian M. Cook","Well, Javier, let's start with the exposure. I think, for Venezuela point of view, we have been very clear in our Qs as to the exposure that Venezuela represents from a global point of view. And from an operating margin point of view, it's 3%. So that's what Venezuela represents. I think, in response to an earlier question, the question mark around pricing conservatism in Latin America, as I said earlier, Venezuela regulations currently don't permit across-the-board pricing, so we take what we can, when we can. And the same is the case for Argentina. And then, you have the customary lead lag between the deterioration of exchange rates and your ability to price to offset the transaction costs. In Europe, it's just a practical reality, Javier. The environment in Europe is basically no growth, and that brings pressure from retailers and competitors perhaps who had more of a footprint in Europe than we who want to wrest market share. And so we deploy the same strategies that we deploy, and we have seen terrific progress on gross margin from a European point of view. And therefore, as we think about marketing mix, we will do more at the store level in Europe than in other parts of the world, and that comes in the pricing line and not in the advertising and promotion line. And if you look at our market share performance in Europe, we think we've got the balance relatively right, and that is why -- because our market shares have been going up in Europe from an oral care point of view particularly, and that is why our focus in Europe is on structural cost, so that we can rightsize the structure to reflect the top line as reality will have it be and not go chase that top line, but rather grow more aggressively from an organic point, as you have seen in the emerging markets where we're growing double-digits. So it's a case of balancing against the market realities. And I guess, that's the answer.","Operator","We'll go to Michael Steib with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Ian, my question relates to geographic mix and what you're factoring in for 2014 really in your outlook. I mean, given that you have some very high-margin businesses in Latin America and in parts of Asia where currencies have been most under pressure, I was just wondering how you're looking at the impact of the geographic mix for 2014?","Ian M. Cook","Well, Michael, actually, we're quite pleased. As a matter of strategy with our geographic mix, we still believe that having 53% of our business in the emerging world pays us dividend from a growth point of view, with categories growing in the mid to high single-digits compared to low single-digits in North America, and essentially flat in Europe, so we like that. And when we released our earnings, and indeed, I said earlier on this call, we are happy with the focus on our current strategy. We think it has served us well for the last 8 years. So with the geographic mix we have, we are looking to continue a top line growth rate of between 5% and 7%, which obviously will be more accelerated in the emerging markets than it will be in the developed markets, just as we have seen this year. And with our Funding the Growth program and the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, be able to provide the funds to invest in advertising, absorb the transaction impact of the foreign exchange changes so far announced and which many of you have already captured and still deliver a 9% EPS growth or 13% on a currency neutral basis. So that's how we think about our split in the world.","Operator","And we'll go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to ask you about the Personal Care launch actually in North America. I just couldn't recall the last time you guys talked about fully integrated campaign, et cetera, and new technology in Personal Care, particularly in North America and in that deodorant business. If you could just kind of talk to us about your multiyear goals there, maybe where are -- I'm guessing your deodorant shares are in the single-digits today. That would be great.","Ian M. Cook","They are in the single-digits, Lauren. We're really quite pleased with this Speed Stick Gear innovation. It gives us a quality concept, a quality product, and conviction to put meaningful marketing spend behind. And the trade reaction has been a very, very good. Obviously, early days, a category that we are committed to globally and you will see a multiyear plan unfold in the United States. And of course, the objective is to get the market share up.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. Okay. And just completely unrelated, I just wanted to make sure I read this statement in the press release correctly about currency -- that your current outlook has taken into account some of the dramatic moves that we've seen in emerging market currencies in the last 10 days or so, excluding Venezuela, but all the other kind of craziness out there, you have factored into your outlook?","Ian M. Cook","The craziness so far, yes. And you captured it perfectly in your note [ph]. Yes, you read it right.","Operator","And we'll go to Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just 2 questions. One is a follow-up on FX. If we exclude -- so if we exclude the special cases that are Venezuela and Argentina from FX, there is so much fear these days of a contagion of all the currencies falling. Do you think that's realistic or does your experience, since there was the Asian contagion, tell you differently about the current environment?","Ian M. Cook","To be candid, Connie, I think, you're asking the wrong person. The notion of contagion of emerging market currencies is not an area of expertise that I would have. So I wouldn't care to forecast.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Are there people that you consult about this? I'm just wondering if this is a media construct or if it's something you're seriously dealing with.","Ian M. Cook","I think, my experience over the last 5 years with foreign exchange is that everybody knows after the fact. And that coming into any year, projections which usually have a broad array of differing opinions are usually wrong. So we have taken multiple opinions and you can get the answer to the question that you want, and we would rather react. Obviously, one plans, it's not that one doesn't plan, but people coming into the year, predicting Turkey, predicting Ukraine, events in Thailand, as we have said multiple times in prior years, so many of the things that happen in our world these days, even some of the best minds don't know about until after they have happened. So we do run models and we do have discussions and we do take points of view, but it's something that we wouldn't care to predict.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. That's helpful. And just one entirely different question. What does your market research tell you the appeal is of highly flavored toothpaste such as mint chocolate and vanilla mint that are coming on the market next month? And would you be playing in those categories?","Ian M. Cook","Well, I haven't tried -- I like mint and I like chocolate mint in ice cream. I must say, I had not tried the product, I think, you're referring to, Connie. We have seen in different parts of the world attempt to come with, shall we say, very differentiated, nontraditional toothpaste flavors, whether they be fruits or other things. And so we will be monitoring, as we have done in other cases, with interest, the performance. But I guess rather like our view on foreign exchange, we have no definitive answer to that question either.","Operator","And we'll now go to Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Just a couple of things. Again, on the North American margin, which is the highest in the world, which is a little different from some multinationals, and you said the gross margin is higher outside [ph], but do you see upside to your North American EBIT margin over time, do you see steady growth there?","Ian M. Cook","Again, Caroline, you may have missed my prior answer. We don't comment on EBIT projections for the company. You can rest assured that our focus continues to be to get the gross margin up, as you said, and with the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, to lower our overheads. That, therefore, provides one the opportunity to invest some of those funds and bring other of those funds freed up to the bottom line. So -- and we will make those choices as we go forward.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Got it. And then, in Funding the Growth, is there any geographic skew to that to where those savings happen?","Ian M. Cook","It depends from year-to-year, Caroline. Generally, they're pretty broad-based, both by geography and by category. Some years, you may have a particular initiative that is powerful in one particular category or for one particular geography. But usually, they're pretty broad-based.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Great. And my final question would just be on GDP growth and demand for toothpaste. It would be intuitive that you'd be less sensitive to swings in demand in other categories. But if China's GDP growth goes from 9% to 5%, I mean, God forbid, but if it is 5%, would you expect that you would still be growing your business just because of the lack of penetration of toothpaste usage?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Caroline, it's interesting. I would say, over many years, we have not seen a very strong correlation between modest slowdowns in GDP and the purchasing of our products. If we look, as I said earlier, at the emerging markets, even into Brazil with the GDP slowdown, our categories are still growing mid to high single-digits. And I think, that's a combination of the still emerging middle class, our ability to increase penetration, our ability to educate to increase usage and our ability to trade up intelligently consumers in the business. So whilst one can't say they're completely decoupled, there's no empirical evidence, at least on our data, that it directly affects our categories.","Operator","And we'll go to John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'll try to keep this quick. The 13% currency neutral earnings guidance is very impressive, particularly given the difficulties out there. Was that in line with what you were thinking before in October when you guys first gave guidance or have things changed to maybe try to offset some of the incremental impact?","Ian M. Cook","It was entirely driven, John, by the foreign exchange slide that started in the middle of January. So when we were looking at the world in the fourth quarter, we genuinely were thinking and planning for double-digit in dollar terms. And as I said earlier -- and many people externally, to your point, in the notes we had seen already, reflected those exchange movements, excluding Venezuela, as we discussed earlier. And so, therefore, that change came subsequent to the way we were thinking about the year, and indeed, talking about the year, when we last spoke in October.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, Ian, that's great. Ian, I guess my question was, was 13% always the number on a currency neutral basis or did that actually move up a little bit?","Ian M. Cook","It probably moved up slightly, John.","Operator","We'll now go to Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess, most of the questions that could have -- must have already been asked, but I'll focus on online shopping. I wanted to know how meaningful that channel is for you today, is it growing faster than other parts of your business? And I guess, the second part would be what's your strategy approach to the online channel? Are there advantages there that you're looking to take advantage of lower cost, better margins, better targeting of consumers? Just any thoughts on that would be helpful.","Ian M. Cook","Yes, Jon. Well, obviously, it's much in the press area. We are today delivering our toothpaste using drones to people in Manhattan. That was a joke, Jon, or an attempt at a joke. It is a high-growth area, but it is still an extremely small part of our business today. We participate with all of the major online shopping portals, whether they be linked to a brick-and-mortar retailer or whether they be a standalone, both here, Europe and in China. For some businesses, we see the potential as greater, take Hill's, where you have fairly large bags of pet nutrition product in an urban area in Europe, we see a greater potential for online. So we have a multi-point strategy that is an awful lot of -- we call them tests and learns to see how we can engage and connect with the consumer. So we're experimenting broadly, but it is still not a meaningful part of our business, albeit with some potential on Hill's in Europe.","Operator","And we'll take our last question today from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I had a question on pricing. No, just kidding. I think we've beaten that horse enough. Actually, most of the questions have been asked. So I just wanted to turn to the balance sheet really quickly. Your leverage ratio is incredibly low. What prevents you from taking on more leverage, whether it be to buy growth, invest in growth or return some cash to shareholders?","Ian M. Cook","Well, I think, Jason, it's funny, I think about the year leading into the sub-prime and the questions were remarkably similar, why don't you leverage up and do something? Our general thinking on this space is that you've seen our debt move up a little bit, although it's still very low, 7.5% of our market cap with all of our ratios in a good place. I guess, the view we tend to take is that we like to keep our powder dry, should an acquisition candidate present itself. As we think about 2014, obviously, we have not yet taken a decision, our board has not yet taken a decision on our dividend. You know we do that earlier -- a little bit later in this year. But you can imagine that our dividends would grow in line with earnings. This year, our share buyback was around $1.5 billion, and we're thinking in the same range for 2014, unless that appropriate acquisition candidate presents itself, and that's rather, if we were to prioritize where beyond dividend we would see the money going, on the sense that it is strategically of value to the company. The problem is, as you know, that an M&A strategy or an execution of an M&A opportunity is often a long and arduous and very unpredictable process, so they cannot be done at will. And of course, during the years of the restructuring program, we have seen our CapEx increase as we are putting in place some significant projects for the future. And bluntly, that's the profile we'd like to keep and plan to keep going forward.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So are you actively pursuing M&A? Or are those comments just meant to reflect your willingness were the right asset come to market?","Ian M. Cook","It depends what you mean by pursue, Jason. I don't think you would have to do an awful lot of detailed work to know the kinds of companies, businesses that are attracted to people in the consumer product space base. Garver [ph] was a multiyear journey. So I think, the most appropriate way to answer the question is to say that were the right opportunity to present itself, we would actively consider it, obviously, at the right evaluation.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session, I'd like to turn it back to Ian for any additional or closing remarks.","Ian M. Cook","No. Thanks for the extensive list of questions and thanks for taking an interest in the performance of the company. We will, of course, keep you updated across the year, as is now customary. And especially, big thanks to all of the Colgate folk around the world who make these results happen. Talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank everyone for your participation and have a good day."],"6253":["Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) Q2 2014 Earnings Call July 31, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Bina H.

Please go ahead, Bina.","Bina H. Thompson","Thank you, Angela. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, President, Chairman and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","We're happy to report another quarter of good organic sales growth with every division participating. Consistent with other companies in our industry, we are facing increased macroeconomic pressure in certain areas of the world. Category growth has slowed somewhat in geographies such as Asia, a factor which we actually referenced last quarter. On the other hand, we see some encouraging signs of slow recovery in some European markets. Competition remains healthy and promotional battles continue. However, our new product pipeline is as full as ever and our commercial investment behind our launches has increased worldwide, a careful balance between media spending and in-store activity, and this has resulted in solid market shares, many categories and geographies and showing positive trends in the most recent periods.","Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track and savings from that are supplementing our ongoing Funding the Growth initiatives, which are as healthy as ever. Both of these contributed to our 20 basis point increase in gross margin.","Offsetting these savings were increases in raw and packaging material costs, as well as continued foreign currency transaction pressure.","Our 3 business service centers around the world are now up and running, in Warsaw, Mexico City and Mumbai. The hubbing activities are complete in Europe and are well underway elsewhere in the world, which will make us even more nimble and effective winning on the ground. And of course, our balance sheet is strong and cash generation is solid.","So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. Organic sales growth in North America was modest. The volume growth of 2.5% was of course on top of the very robust increase in the year-ago quarter of 6%, reflecting the initial launch of Colgate Total Mouthwash. We have an exciting innovation launching as we speak, which I'll discuss in a moment.","Pleasingly, versus the second quarter of 2013, our 2014 second quarter shares increased in toothpaste, toothbrushes, deodorants, body wash and fabric conditioners, and our mouthwash shares have steadied at about 6.5%.","Trial and repeat numbers for Colgate Total Mouthwash are above previous recent competitive launches and the product has been instrumental in driving overall category growth.","Our recent launch of Suavitel Fast Dry fabric conditioner has also met with success. Our quarterly national share is at a record 18.6%, up 170 basis points versus the second quarter of 2013. And this is a product which is largely sold in Hispanic markets, where it holds a 36.2% share on a year-to-date basis, fast closing the gap between us and the leading competitor.","So looking ahead, our latest toothpaste innovation here in the U.S. is Colgate enamel health toothpaste. The enamel strengthening segment is the fastest-growing in the toothpaste category, with 54% of consumers concerned about enamel. This new product replenishes natural calcium and other minerals back into weakened enamel, filling in rough spots while at the same time, polishing the enamel surface so germs are less likely to stick on the teeth. The formula has an active fluoride system, along with gentle on enamel silica and the product comes in 2 variance, whitening and sensitivity relief. In addition, the impact for packaging is interactive with a touch-and-feel demo showing acid soft in rough enamel and healthy smooth enamel. So as you would imagine, we have a very robust integrated marketing campaign planned, including television, print, public relations, professional, digital, social, mobile and in-store activities.","Turning to Europe\/South Pacific. We're very encouraged with our progress in Europe and are cautiously optimistic that some of the macroeconomic headwinds we have been facing are beginning to die down. Our organic sales growth of 2.5% reflects the balance between volume and price where we have had strong promotional activities across the region to support new product launches. And this has paid off in terms of market share.","Our Oral Care shares are strong across the category and is showing good momentum in toothpaste. Our year-to-date market share is at 35.2%, up 70 basis points from the year-ago period, with the most recent share at 35.4%. And of particular note is the U.K. where despite an ongoing competitive battle, our year-to-date share is just shy of 50%, up a full point with the most recent lead over 51%, a record high.","In manual toothbrushes, our year-to-date regional share is up 90 basis points to 23.5%, with the most recent lead at 24%, consolidating our #1 position. And this was in part fueled by excellent progress in the U.K. where we've achieved a record 37.5% share year-to-date.","And in mouthwash, our share is up 10 basis points to 16.4% on a year-to-date basis, with the most recent lead at 16.9%.","We're very excited about the launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer across Europe and the South Pacific. First quarter launches in Australia and Norway have achieved 3.7% and 3.5% shares, respectively, in the most recent period. We've only just launched in the U.K. where, as I mentioned, we are reaching record market share levels and we'll introduce the product across the Rest of Europe in the balance of the year.","In Germany, where our share is up 140 basis points to 41.2% on a year-to-date basis, we've launched it under the elmex brand.","More new products are planned for the second half of this year as well. We'll continue the rollout of Colgate Max White One Optic. Whitening is the second-biggest segment in toothpaste in Europe and we hold the #1 position.","Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, we will continue the rollout of Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal toothbrush, a product which, as you know, was developed in Asia but is met with great success in other parts of the world.","And innovation in the mouthwash category is Colgate Plax Deep Clean mouthwash, which provides a deep effective clean even in hard-to-reach areas. The product contains 2 natural ingredients, eucalyptol and propolis, that are well known to the consumer. Eucalyptus is known for cooling and antibacterial properties and propolis for its protective properties.","Turning then to Latin America. We're very pleased with the continued strong organic sales growth in this region. This growth was broadly based. One exception was Brazil, where our consumers were glued to their televisions during the World Cup and not spending time in stores, a temporary condition which we expect should reverse itself in the second half of this year.","Market shares continue to climb. In the press release, we cited record toothpaste shares in a number of countries. Our year-to-date manual toothbrush shares also achieved record highs in Brazil, Chile, Peru, Puerto Rico and Uruguay.","In Brazil, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste has achieved a 2.3% share year-to-date, lifting our overall share to a record 71.9%.","In Mexico, our toothpaste share has been over 80% for the last 3 months, and while we don't have readings yet in national Nielsen shares, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste in Mexico has registered a 3 point share in ScanTrack.","And as in other regions around the world, the launch of Colgate Slim Soft toothbrush has met with success in Latin America. In Brazil, our share is up 80 basis points to 32.8% year-to-date on the strength of both Colgate 360\u00ba and Colgate Slim Soft, both of which are superpremium priced, helping to increase margins.","In Mexico, our manual toothbrush leadership share climbed to a record 44.9% in the most recent period.","And our mouthwash share across the region is up 30 basis points to 36.3%, while our principal competitor is down almost a full point to 38.8%.","In the Personal Care category, we've increased our underarm share in Mexico as a result of new products such as Men's and Lady Speed Stick stress. We're now the leader in bar soaps across Latin America with Protex and Palmolive holding the #1 and 2 positions, respectively.","And in fabric conditioners, our regional share is up over 2 points to 50.8% year-to-date, with the most recent lead at 51%. And more innovation is planned for the second half.","During the third quarter, we will be launching Colgate Total Professional Breath Health toothpaste. Dentists advise their patients that bad breath can be caused not just by food odors, but also by the accumulation of bacteria in the mouth. This breath-freshening toothpaste formula with breakthrough neutral odor technology is scientifically proven to fight and neutralize bad breath-causing bacteria. Next month, we are introducing Colgate Luminous White Instant toothpaste. Its exclusive formula with optic brighteners activates while you brush for a visibly whiter smile instantly.","And in the Personal Care category, this month, we're launching Lady Speed Stick Aclarado Perfecto with Vitamin E. Its formula was, with Vitamin E and pearl extract, was perceived in a consumer test to help restore the skin's natural tone, while also providing sweat protection for up to 48 hours.","Turning then to Asia. While organic sales growth in this region slowed from the first quarter pace, this quarter was compared to the strongest quarter of last year, which saw organic sales growth at a very strong 13%. Macroeconomic factors in China affected our results, and we told you on our last call about some categories slowing and, in fact, that did happen. However, as referenced in the press release, we continued to see strong growth in other countries in the region, such as India, and innovation continues to help drive market share increases.","In toothpaste, our market share in India is up 70 basis points on a year-to-date basis to 54.8%, with the most recent period at 55.1% and this in the face of recent competitive entries. The revitalization of Colgate Active Salt, a toothpaste with a unique salt formula that gives deep clean feeling and helps fight germs for strong teeth and healthy gums, helps drive these results.","In Malaysia, our share increased 50 basis points to 73.5% year-to-date, with the most recent lead at 74.5%. This was our first Asian market to launch Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste. And in just 6 months, it's achieved almost a 4% share of the market.","Our toothbrush share across the division is up to 30.6% year-to-date, fueled by increases in India, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. In India, new product such as Colgate Super Flexi have resulted in an increase of 240 basis points to 43.5% year-to-date, with the most recent lead at 43.7%.","Our mouthwash business is solid as well, with a regional share year-to-date of 21.8%, up 110 basis points.","Colgate Plax Jasmine Tea, a mouthwash which provides long-lasting fresh breath with a pleasant jasmine tea flavor, has contributed to very good results in Thailand and the Philippines, where total mouthwash shares are up year-over-year 170 basis points and 380 basis points, respectively.","Colgate Plax Herbal Salt mouthwash, which was launched in Malaysia and Singapore and contributed 80 basis points and 250 basis points, respectively, in the initial lead, will launch in India as Colgate Plax Active Salt during the fourth quarter. As you may know, the Indian consumer habit is to rinse one's mouth with salt water, so this innovation should resonate well in this market.","Of course, more innovation is planned for the second half of this year. We will continue to roll out Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste. In China, we'll be launching Colgate Tea health toothpaste, which provides refreshing breath with a pleasant longjing tea flavor. Longjing is a popular and premium type of tea in China, which is associated with multiple types of benefits, including healthy teeth and refreshing breath.","We will also be launching the Colgate HT1 toothbrush, with 7-way cleaning, with the following benefits: Cleans teeth surface, removes bacteria, is gentles on gums, cleans in between the teeth, absorbs brushing pressure and is easy to maneuver.","And in Thailand, we will be launching Colgate Plax Tartar Control mouthwash, an exciting addition to our strong mouthwash portfolio in that country. This mouthwash provides the dual benefit of tartar control and breath freshening all at once.","Turning then to Africa\/Eurasia. We're encouraged with the continued solid organic sales growth in this region. Of particular note was Russia, where despite an uncertain political and macroeconomic environment, new products such as Colgate Altai Herbs toothpaste, Colgate Total interdental toothpaste and Colgate Optic White Instant toothpaste helped drive strong growth.","Toothpaste and toothbrush shares remained solid across the region. Innovation in the mouthwash category has delivered good share results.","In Russia, we told you last quarter about Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash, which contains an ingredient well known to the local consumer, a comparison product -- companion product to the previously mentioned toothpaste. Our mouthwash share in Russia is up year-to-date 170 basis points to 27.5%.","In Turkey, our newly launched Colgate Plax Green mouthwash has resulted in a market share increase of 120 basis points to 20.5% year-to-date. And we're also very pleased with the continued success in our shower gel business across the region, where we hold a leadership position of 22%, up almost 2 full point\u2019s year-over-year.","Palmolive Gourmet Spa has driven increases of 220 basis points and 400 basis points in Russia and Turkey, respectively.","And the recent launch of Palmolive Thermal Skin Renewal resulted in an increase of 5 points in South Africa.","More innovation is planned. In the Eurasian markets, we are introducing Colgate Total Pro Whitening toothpaste. And here, as elsewhere, the premium price whitening segment is very important to the overall toothpaste category.","In Russia, consumers believe in the power of natural ingredients and traditional recipes to improve oral health. Accordingly, we're launching the Colgate Natural Extracts toothbrush, containing pine tree bristles, with premium differentiated and impactful packaging designed to stand out on shelf.","As I mentioned earlier, our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line of shower gels has been very successful, and we hope to build on that success with 2 new variants to be added to the existing chocolate, vanilla and strawberry. The new creamy coffee and peach sorbet variants are infused with natural extracts and their creamy formulas smooths the skin. As you would expect, we will have a very strong integrated marketing campaign to support this launch.","Then turning to Hill's. Hill's business continues to be solid. General softness in the pet superstores has been affecting us and others as well here in the U.S. However, we're encouraged by our continued stream of innovation, which we expect to drive growth going forward. Our rollout of Hill's Ideal Balance continues to meet with success. Here in the U.S., our share of the naturals category continues to grow. And in addition to the regular Ideal Balance, we launched Ideal Balance Slim & Healthy in the second quarter for both dogs and cats. Support activities included features and coupon brochure handouts, brand ambassador coupons and nutritional consultant coupons.","In Europe, we launched in the U.K. and Germany in April and May, respectively. And so far, we've seen very good trade acceptance, with listing in the major accounts supported by promotional activities, as well as secondary placements.","In the store, we activated with branded gondola ends, demonstrators in key accounts and indoor and outdoor posters and point-of-sale materials. And in addition, we featured the product at consumer pet shows and through testimonial campaigns.","On the therapeutic side of the business, our 2013 launch of Prescription Diet metabolic continues to do well both here and abroad. In the U.S., our sales are exceeding our expectations. Our commercial support includes before and after imagery, along with videos online. And this quarter, we've globally launched an antioxidant upgrade to the product.","In greater Europe, we've widened the gap between our nearest competitor from 2 points to 8, establishing a clear leadership share of 47% year-to-date in the weight category.","Another important therapeutic category is feline urinary, a category where we were underrepresented until the launch of Prescription Diet c\/d. New platforms such as efficacy, stress, ocean fish and stew were added in the second quarter here in the U.S., all supported with in-clinic sampling and messaging at professional conferences. Similar activities in Europe have resulted in a 130 basis point increase in our share of the category to almost 30% year-to-date.","Looking forward, this quarter, we will continue the rollout of Ideal Balance Slim & Healthy and Science Diet Perfect Weight, our new wellness weight-loss products in markets outside the U.S. And for the fourth quarter, we have more exciting news, which we will share with you soon.","So in summary, we're pleased that we continue to drive organic sales around the world with good bottom line growth. Our new product pipeline is as full as ever and our market shares are healthy and growing in many regions. Colgate people everywhere are working hard to keep us winning on the ground. We look forward to sharing our results with you as we go forward through the balance of the year.","And now before with turn it over to Q&A, Ian would like to make a few remarks. Ian?","Ian M. Cook","Thanks, Bina. Many of you may remember that on the first quarter call, as we began the Q&A, I took the time to make some preliminary remarks on the shape of this year and it seems appropriate to open by doing the same in this quarter. Clearly, we saw a slowdown in the top line pace of the company in the second quarter, and that really began towards the very end of the quarter. And as you break that down, one contributing factor is further emerging market weakness in our categories as we see the macro economic weaknesses finally come more sharply to our categories. You will recall on the first quarter call that we revised the category growth rates for the emerging markets down to a 5% to 7% range from the previous 6% to 8%. And based on what we saw in the second quarter, we see for the balance of the year those emerging markets still posting good growth but at the lower end of that range.","In the developed markets, for the Colgate businesses, category growth continues at 1% to 2%, with some growing optimism, I would say, in Europe. Hill's, as you heard, experienced channel-specific slowdown here in the U.S., which we are already seeing recover as this quarter begins.","As you heard very clearly from Bina, our market shares around the world continue to be strong and accelerating in Mexico and the U.S., 2 particular geographies that we were focusing on since the beginning of the year. And our innovation pipeline is deep and rich, not just for the balance of 2014 but into 2015 as well. We continue to feel that the strategy we have been deploying for several years, a strategy that focuses on building brands with our consumers, creating innovation that drives growth, maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness that funds that growth and developing a cadre of leadership to continue to manage the company, continue to be the right strategy, as does our execution on the fundamentals of our business around the world. We believe both remain correct, and that is what we are redoubling our focus on for the balance of this year.","So with that as a backdrop, while we continue to expect organic growth for the company this year to be in that 5% to 7% range, albeit towards the lower end of that range given the current world environment.","On the material cost side, we have seen further increases in material costs, including topical oils and several of the agricultural commodities that affect the Hill's business and, of course, the continued transaction headwinds due to foreign exchange. And because of that, we now see gross margin expectations for the year move to a 30 to 50 basis point range, with Funding the Growth maintained at historically strong levels, as you will see when I go through the gross margin roll forward and, of course, more pricing across the balance of the year.","Behind that strong innovation stream, advertising and the increasingly important commercial investment of in-store work will both be up. The restructuring program remains on track, and we continue to expect after-tax savings of between $90 million and $110 million, and that tax rate, as you would expect, remains in the 31% to 32% range.","As you saw in the press release, we remain comfortable with our 4% to 5% dollar EPS range and you may recall the walk-through that we provided on our first quarter call, which guided to the middle of that range guidance that I would reiterate.","So in summary, we believe the strategy that we are deploying and the focus on the fundamentals that we have remain the right ones. Our market shares are strong. Our innovation is robust, and I think we can continue to demonstrate the agility and the flexibility to react to the volatile world that we are all doing business in.","So with those as introductory remarks, Angela, perhaps we could now open the lines to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will now go to Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess a couple of things. There's a lot there, Ian, in your final comments. But in terms of the macro slowdown, I think you commented that it happened very late in the second quarter and I guess that concerns me because outside of Brazil, every region saw I think a deceleration in your organic sales growth and at least came in below my expectations. And I have a hard time believing that, that all happened very late in the quarter. And in terms of kind of going forward from here, how quickly do you expect a pickup? How quickly do you expect a reacceleration? I guess, specifically, with regard to pricing and what you mentioned about commodity inflation, how quickly can you put some pricing in place so that even that tempered top line growth outlook is achievable at this point?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Well, obviously, Wendy, that is why I tried to make the introductory remarks because clearly, from the early notes, those are exactly the questions on people's minds. If you track through the organic and focus on the emerging markets, we were actually quite pleased with the organic growth that we sustained in Latin America. The big variation, of course, is in Asia. And clearly, the world macros out there have been volatile and weak in some cases for a time. But beyond the adjustment we made in the first quarter, we had not seen that come through to our categories and it did so in the second quarter and it did late in the second quarter. The other factor, as I mentioned, was related to Hill's. And as I just said in my remarks, we've already seen that -- Hill's bounce back. The important point to make is that the underlying category growths are in that mid-single-digit range, as I said. What you get from a volume point of view is that in large geographies, like a China for example, with a very complex distribution system, you get an inventory reaction that works its way through the system that has a short-term impact. That was the impact we felt in the second quarter as we look forward at the consumption rates, in other words, the consumer purchase rates with them in the mid-single-digits area. And with the pricing plans we have clearly in place for the second half of the year, we feel comfortable with that more tempered organic volume growth for the entire company at the lower end of that 5% to 7% range. So it's the underlying consumer purchasing that gives us confidence.","Operator","And we will now go to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ian, you're now expecting sales at the low end of where you were, gross margins moving a little bit lower. Maybe you can just walk us through a couple of the offsets that help you keep EPS sort of the midpoint of where you were still intact?","Ian M. Cook","Well, we obviously have the restructuring program, which we have underway. I talked about advertising for the year. As I said, the total commercial spend will be up and the advertising will be up on the year on a ratio basis. It will be more in line with the strong levels of last year. And when you work all of that through, with the guidance we provided in the first quarter on the EPS that brings in the year.","Operator","And we will now go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So it's a little -- I mean, I think it's unusual, Ian, for you to do one of these prepared remarks. I'm just trying to figure out the severity of things. Was it really that bad of a slowdown in the emerging markets? And even if it is, you've historically been relatively immune to slowdowns as we've seen in the past. I wanted to know, you think that's changed for your business? Or is that much worse? In that context, secondarily, if you could talk about the double-digit constant currency earnings target for this year. It sounds like you're not going to make that. I just want confirmation of that. And if it changes your view, given what you're seeing in the emerging markets right now, about this company being a double-digit earnings company over the next few years.","Ian M. Cook","Okay. So to answer your second question, the growth this year is not double digits. So I confirm that in a constant currency basis. But it does not change our view, our strategic view, that for the longer term, this is a double-digit earnings company. As far as your comment on the prepared remarks and the slowdown on the top line, frankly, the only reason we elected to do it this way was because otherwise what you do is you usurp somebody's question in order to make some opening comments, which seemed unfair. So we simply thought it was cleaner to do it this way. So I apologize if trying to be proper in the presentation created a sense that things were somehow bad, which we do not believe they are. We do see a volatile world. We have tried consistently in that volatile world to deliver the agility and the flexibility necessary to keep driving our business ahead of the market growth, which is why Bina spent so much time on the market shares, because our market shares are strong and growing in key markets. So this is us just reacting to a deceleration in our marketplaces in order to outperform what we see now as the probable growth rate in our categories for the balance of this year. And we just wanted to be as clear as possible about that.","Operator","And we will now go to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ian, can you discuss your market share performance so far for the SAC anti-cavity toothpaste where it's been launched and incrementality to your business? And then also on a related note, given the healthy innovation pipeline you pointed to, do you think you're investing enough in marketing here or will you temper the marketing a bit given the top line dynamics out there?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. I think Bina went through quite a few. In fact, almost all of the market shares we have so far on superior anti-cavity. And indeed, it has been predominantly incremental in the marketplaces we have gone to. So you're seeing share performance, I would say, in broad terms, depending on when the markets were entered, between 1.5% and 5% Turkey, 1.5% Brazil, as Bina quoted, Malaysia, 4%; Australia, 4%; New Zealand, approaching 5%; Greece, over 2%; Norway, 3.5%, as Bina said; and Mexico, 3%, albeit that, that is ScanTrack data. And you heard that the Mexico shares are back up over 80 and the Brazil share is at an all-time high of 72. So the more important breeding for us on superior anti-cavity, frankly, is that the trial rate is building very, very nicely. We have now 6 months data in, and it is significantly ahead of the category average and the repeat rates are dead in line with premium category entries in the category. So we're seeing it in the share. But more importantly, we're seeing it in the consumer behavior. And on the support behind the new products, no, the levels of advertising spend, and I'm now talking the traditional below-the-line advertising, are at compared to our history, elevated levels. They're in line with the strong levels we had last year. They are clearly focused behind the innovation in terms of building awareness, getting recommendation. And we keep trying to stress this point, but it sometimes is difficult, I guess, to make the impression that part of our investment to build brands with consumers and generate trial of new products comes in activity that we do at the store level, and that activity is captured in trade spending. So it doesn't go into the traditional advertising line. But when you think of consumer purchasing behavior and the techniques available to you today at retail, it's an enormously important part of building brand and provoking trial purchase. So we're managing very carefully between those 2 investment buckets, the traditional advertising and the overall commercial spending, to make sure, the example I just gave on superior anti-cavity, that we're generating trial above category norms so the repeat multiplies on a higher than normal trial base. So the answer is, we continue to believe we have a very well balanced plan behind the innovation for the year.","Operator","And we will now go to Alice Longley with Buckingham Research Brokerage.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","With your guidance for the year that organic sales growth will be at the lower end of 5% to 7%, it looks like you have to get some acceleration from the 4% in the second quarter to get there. And you already talked about Hill's. Where else might we see some improvement, maybe Latin America because people won't be so glued to their TV sets and maybe the U.S. on innovation. But if you could just tell us more where we get improvement in the second half versus the second quarter that would be good.","Ian M. Cook","Well, first, Alice, I would say that the prevailing rate you have to get to in the second half is pretty much what you would have delivered in the first half. So yes, there is the second quarter 4%. And as we look at the balance of the year, given the underlying consumption rate that I mentioned in the emerging markets and, particularly, in Asia, that would clearly be a business area where we would expect the organic growth to come back. And as I commented on the Hill's business with the specific channel issue in the second quarter which we're already seeing come back, we would expect to see that in Hill's as well. So if you were pointing to 2 particular areas, it would be those areas. And who knows, we may get wild optimism in Europe.","Operator","And we will now go to Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess the question is, how do you -- how does your new view on the category growth dynamic affect your decisions on pricing, if at all, all right? Because I know at least one of your major global competitors has said that competitive levels in the markets are affecting their ability to price for currency. You said that you expect more pricing in the back half. But how does that work for you guys? Would you now take less pricing than you would've thought than before?","Ian M. Cook","Well, remember, Chris, when you think about pricing, what you're actually trying to do is to get the average selling price up. So there are many ways of doing that. List price is clearly part of it. But there are many other techniques that we deploy strategically and tactically to elevate the ASP, premiumization, changes in your promotional activity. So there are many techniques that we deploy. And the reason we made the comment about the market shares in Mexico and the U.S. is, we got 1.5 pricing on the quarter and we have those market shares moving in the right direction. Bina went through a whole host of other market shares that are moving in the right direction. And we think we have the ability to continue to take pricing, create pricing in the second half of the year without impinging on that mid-single-digit organic growth rate. And innovation is an important part of that.","Operator","And we will now go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Ian, just kind of talking about capital allocation and looking with where the stock is today and going forward. I mean, is the EPS guidance, I assume, just assumes only the kind of $3 million a quarter share repurchase. But would you look at deploying more in this environment and from -- or are there other things out there that you're looking that have a better return at this point?","Ian M. Cook","Well, that's a very broad question, Bill. I guess the way we have thought about capital allocation over the years, obviously, one pays the dividend. Obviously, one has internal capital expenditure programs, which deliver consistently, in our case, beyond a 33% hurdle rate of return. And of course, that capital investment is elevated in periods when we go through restructuring. So right now, we're deploying a little bit more in capital expenditure than we have done historically quite purposely. And then of course, we buy back shares, as we have done, and I would say our target is still in that $1.5 billion gross range for this year. And obviously, should an acquisition candidate present itself or should we find one in various parts of the world, then we would prefer to allocate the capital in that direction. And I don't think, at least, so far, our thinking has changed in that regard.","Operator","And we will now go to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I don't know, probably a tough question to answer, but did you figure out like what is the source of the volume shortfall? I mean, is it people buying less? Is it fewer people in the category? Is it sort of the mix mechanisms you've used in the past aren't work as effectively? Is there any way to kind of triangulate those 3?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. I -- it's difficult, Bill. As we have, over time, got under the hood of that, you see what people do is they exhaust their own personal pantries. They literally try and squeeze the tube and make it last a little bit longer so that they can extend the time between purchase cycles. And as we have seen, sometimes, for cash outlay reasons, instead of buying a bigger tube at a certain channel of trade, they will go and buy a smaller tube in a different channel outlet. So in terms of the consumer purchase that is what we have historically seen has been the behaviors they adopt. The direct correlation to volume, and the point I was trying to make specific to Asia on this quarter is, from a selling in volume point of view, you then have the dislocation that, that slowdown brings to a very complicated and interrelated distribution network, which sees some inventory adjustment, which is a short-term effect as everybody readjusts to the now lower consumer purchasing rate. So you see it more sharply on the company volume in the short term, even though the underlying purchase that you will go back to, as I said, is still in that mid-single-digit range.","Operator","And we will now go to John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A little bit of a follow-up on Chris' question. If we look at your pricing in Latin America and, it's a lot lower than what we're seeing from a lot of these other companies. I'm not asking you to comment on their pricing as much, but can you talk about sort of how you're viewing sort of real pricing in Latin America as we look forward? And is this something where you're just not going to move as much relative to some of the FX pieces? And then sort of further delving down into Venezuela on this, we have seen some companies talk about the margin caps, et cetera. Can you talk about sort of where you feel you are from a margin standpoint in Venezuela and if we look to map that out ourselves.","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Well, let me start with Venezuela. We've read all of the transcripts on the pricing caps, obviously, in Venezuela. In our situation, virtually all of our business is capped, if you will, by the government's 2012 policy that prevents us from taking pricing in the marketplace. And therefore, because of that, the pricing cap doesn't really apply to us -- margin cap, I mean. So that would be the simple summary on Venezuela. You probably saw or you will see that we posted a modest profit this quarter and, indeed, for the half, which we had not done last quarter, which is pleasing, and we continue to manage that business with the diligence that you would expect. And there have been quite a few press reports and, indeed, we are in very constructive discussion with the government about the opportunity for us to realize pricing on products as we continue forward in this year, and we'll have to see where that ends up. But we do spend a lot of constructive time in discussion. In terms of pricing in Latin America, actually, we're quite pleased with the pricing balance that we have been taking in Latin America at this time, remembering that there is no pricing in Venezuela. So the overall pricing we're taking, we think, is both consistent. You look at the first and the second quarter, 6 and 5. And of course, that will continue in the back half of the year. And of course, for our gross margin to improve across the year, we will have to see a light gross margin improvement in divisions, including in Latin America, so that is very much in our plan. And I think the market shares talk to the fact that I think we're finding the right balance between the 2.","Operator","And we will now go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You talked a lot about increased in-store activity, but obviously volume was a little bit light of expectations. So do your analytics suggest that consumers are just not as responsive to in-store activity as they used to be? Or was it effective and volume would have been worse if not for the promotional activity? And then also, it sounds like you're quite pleased with the Funding the Growth and cost saves progress overall. So what drove overhead up this quarter?","Ian M. Cook","The -- okay, a couple of answers then. In terms of in-store activity, again, as I try to example, I think you have to try and separate out, depending on the part of the world you're talking about, the slowdown in overall consumption and the short-term impact that has on company volume. So as I described before, you can have a situation where as the consumer consumption slows overall, you're still connecting with that consumer, let's pick the emerging market mid-single-digit growth rate now that we are talking about. But behind that, given the distribution system, as the volume readjusts to that lower level, you see company volumes slow in a shorter timeframe. The consumer is just as responsive at the purchasing end to the in-store trial activity. So the in-store activity continues to be effective from a consumption point of view. And in terms of the overhead increase, it largely relates to distribution decisions we have taken in various parts of the world, either to take our products to market directly and not through a distributor, or to extend our distribution depth and, therefore, incur more logistic cost in order to get that distribution depth, both of those things being good in terms of building our brands over the medium term. So very conscious choices. The underlying overhead is actually flat.","Operator","And we will now go to Michael Steib with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can I ask a question, just a follow-up question on the Latin American margin, please, it was down over 20 basis points in the quarter. Given your comments on sort of the temporary effect on Brazil volumes in the quarter but also pricing, do you expect to be able to reverse that in the second half, at least partially?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. I mean, as I was trying to explain a little bit before, obviously, when you look at the impact in the second quarter, a part of it is Venezuela and part of it is the lead lag between the very sharp increase in transaction impact on product cost and the ability to keep feathering pricing into the marketplace. So as I tried to answer with the earlier question, we do have more pricing planned for the balance of the year. And as we look at our gross margin ambitions for the company, that will see gross margins expand in our divisions, including in Latin America. So to your point, we will indeed see improvement in gross margin as the year unfolds in Latin America, as indeed we saw improvement second quarter to first.","Operator","And we will now go to Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division","This is Brian Doyle in for Caroline. We were just wondering how long destocking usually lasts and if it is limited to China at the moment or if there are other areas where it's affecting you?","Ian M. Cook","It's predominantly China. It tends to be relatively short term. I would say, overall, 60 to 90 days.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I know it's a small market for you, but this morning, there are headlines that Argentina is defaulting. What impact would that have on you?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. Don't cry for me, Argentina. Argentina, as you may know, Connie, is less than 1% of the company sales. We manage these geographies as if they are a hyperinflationary, so we do all the things even though we don't book it as hyper because it has not yet crossed the 100. So we hold little cash. We have de minimis cash in Argentina. We don't have any debt outstanding, and we don't believe we have a need for any external funding. We make most of our product locally. So as a direct impact of the default, no impact for us. Now of course, what the knock-on effects are in terms of inflation and foreign exchange, we'll have to see how it unfolds and react accordingly, but I come back to the first point that it is less than 1% of our sales.","Operator","And we will now go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 quick things, 1 was just following up on the 60 to 90 days for how long the destocking usually lasts. You said some of the weakness popped up at the end of the quarter, so should I interpret that as there's still a little bit more to go in 3Q or that continues in July but you would expect as you get into August, September, things start to improve?","Ian M. Cook","That would be a correct assessment.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then the final thing would just be if you could run through the gross margin bridge for us that would be great.","Ian M. Cook","I thought you'd never ask. So in terms of gross profit, prior year gross profit was 58.6%. With the pricing we took, we got 50 basis points from that. Between our Funding the Growth savings and the modest contribution as in the first quarter from restructuring, our total Funding the Growth in restructuring was 220 basis points, actually slightly ahead of the 210 we got in the prior year. Material prices were a headwind of 2 50. And so with the pricing and the Funding the Growth, that's what leads you to the 58.8% or 20 basis point increase year-on-year.","Operator","And we will now go to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Question, I don't think that you clarify the situation with Hill's in the specialty stores. If you can elaborate what was this temporary dislocation. And you mentioned that it was resolved, but I'm just curious if you can tell us what happened there. And then on pricing again, shall we expect pricing to improve in emerging markets or is just a reduction of promotional activity in Europe given the strong volumes?","Ian M. Cook","To answer your latter point, first, Javier, no, it is not a reduction in promotion in Europe, which drives that. It is pricing and it is pricing across the world with a heavy emphasis on the emerging markets and continued emphasis on Hill's. And in terms of Hill's, I'm sorry if I made it sound like some sort of untoward event, they had a traffic slowdown in their stores. And as we have come into this quarter, with our innovation and with the activity we have behind our innovation, that, for us, has gone away and we have kicked off to a nice start in the third quarter. So just a temporary blip.","Operator","And we will now go to Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Ian, I was wondering if you could just break apart the drivers of the change in your gross margin outlook between January and July, really I guess between April and July? How much of the reduction has been driven by a decision to move demand building dollars from ad spend to trade spend versus some of the other factors you mentioned like FX, commodity inflation, the general slowdown that you experience, et cetera? That would help.","Ian M. Cook","Yes. I don't really want to get into that sort of level of detail. And I would say, in terms of rebuilding our gross margin, it's basically between the materials and the transactions. So that's where our focus is.","Operator","And we will now go to Alec Patterson with AGI.","Alec Patterson","Ian, I need to follow up on that last question. Just trying to understand, you're saying that material costs, are the material -- is the main change versus where you were in April? Or is it more a function of promo spending that's up to offset, I presume, increased pressure on the categories, especially in emerging markets?","Ian M. Cook","Well, clearly, when you do the investment at store, that investment at store brings pressure on gross margin. But we have had that thinking in our plan. So the new aspect is an increase in material prices and, a, shall we say, heightened impact from transaction.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Curious on your thoughts on Hill's given the slowdown you talked about in the specialty stores. Do you think there's an opportunity to expand distribution and is there even a benefit in doing so beyond just that channel? And then just more broadly curious, your thoughts on growth rates in that business or in Pet Nutrition sort of broadly in Europe, U.S. and sort of your views on longer-term opportunity in developing markets is something that eventually will be bigger than it is today?","Ian M. Cook","Yes. The answer to the distribution question, which has been asked many times, is given the model we have for that business, we do not believe that, that would be to advantage but rather the recommendation we cultivate with veterinary professionals is best maintained in a controlled environment, whether it's a pet store, a PetSmart or a PETCO, where the assistants can advise or indeed directly with the vet. That is part of the connection that brand has with the consumer. If you were then to liberalize that and take it more broadly into, if you will, a grab-and-go environment, you lose that connection. To your second point, you are absolutely right, Hill's today is predominantly a developed world business. We have a very clear focus on a handful of emerging markets where we are seeing a most immediate potential for that growth. But indeed, part of the attractiveness of the business is the long runway we see in terms of emerging markets coming into the fold and providing sustainable growth for the long term.","So those are all the questions for today. I thank everyone very much for joining. I thank all the Colgate people for contributing so hard to the results that we deliver. And we look forward to catching up with everybody again after the third quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"6259":["Colgate-Palmolive Co.

Please go ahead, Bina.","Bina Thompson","Thank you, Chanel. And good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.","We\u2019re delighted to have finished 2015 with continued strong organic sales growth in the froth quarter. The 5% growth was well within our targeted growth rate of 4% to 7% and is impressive coming on top of strong growth in the year-ago quarter. Our gross profit margin was up 20 basis points despite continued pressures from foreign exchange related transaction costs. And although down on a year-over-year basis, our advertising as a percentage of sales was up sequentially from the third quarter.","As you will hear in more details as I go through the divisions, our market share around the world are growing. Innovation has played an important role and will continue to do so as we enter 2016. Our global growth and efficiency program is on track and our ongoing funding-the-growth initiatives continue to deliver substantial savings. Our balance sheet is strong and working capital is under very good control.","And as you read in this morning\u2019s press release, we have taken the decision effective December 31, 2015 to change our accounting method for our Venezuelan operations. And as a result, in future periods, we will no longer include the results of our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statement. As we stated in the press release, we expect the EPS impact in 2016 resulting from the change in accounting for our Venezuelan operation will be about a negative of $0.10 for the full year. And we\u2019d expect this impact to be negative $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter.","So let\u2019s turn to the divisions, first with North America. We\u2019re pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth in this region. And as mentioned in the press release, our market shares increased year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. And as you\u2019d expect, innovation was an important contributor to these excellent results.","In the third quarter of 2015, we launched Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste. This toothpaste remineralizes weakened enamel to help prevent cavities and maintain stronger teeth, as well as kills bacteria that cause gingivitis for healthier gums. In addition, we engaged in a targeted outreach to consumers with diabetes. People with diabetes are two times more likely to develop gum disease. We reached both dentists and consumers and developed retail partnerships. And as a result, our overall market share for Colgate Total toothpaste grew to 10.3% from 10% at the beginning of 2015.","Our Colgate Optic White toothpaste franchise is growing as well, up to 5.7% at our last period of 2015, thanks to the launch of Colgate Optic White Platinum Express White. With the help of a comprehensive IMC plan, support from dental professionals and strong in-store activities, Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste has grown share as well. And toothpaste innovation will continue in the first quarter.","Building on the success of our whitening franchise, we\u2019re launching Colgate Optic White Platinum High Impact [ph] White which provides four shades visibly whiter teeth in six weeks and starts working in just three days. Also, we\u2019re introducing premium-priced Colgate Enamel Health Mineral Repair toothpaste with an accompanying mouthwash and whitening toothbrush. The toothbrush and mouthwash help replenish natural calcium for stronger enamel.","To bolster our toothbrush business, we\u2019re launching Colgate Kids Interactive, the only talking-powered toothbrush featuring kids\u2019 favorite licensed characters which coach you to better brushing. The brush features a two-minute timer to help ensure effective brushing.","Also in the first quarter, Tom\u2019s of Maine is launching Tom\u2019s Natural Rapid Release Sensitive toothpaste with a clinically proven arginine and calcium carbonate formula to provide rapid release and long-lasting protection. With no artificial dyes, sweeteners or preservatives, it will be premium-priced.","Our liquid hand soap share was up 90 basis points year-to-date. And our year-to-date body wash share increased 80 basis points. More innovation in this quarter should help maintain this healthy momentum.","In liquid hand soap, we\u2019re launching Softsoap Foaming Hand Soap for kids that makes handwashing fun, as well as Softsoap Pure Foaming Hand Soap with a simple formula that is dye-free, alcohol-free, has 100% natural fragrance, yet effectively cleans and purifies.","And in body wash, we\u2019re launching Softsoap Luminous Oils, one variant with avocado oil and iris and the other with macadamia oil and peony, designed to leave skin feeling soft.","Turning then to Europe, South Pacific. We\u2019re delighted with the return to positive organic sales growth in this region. Across Europe, our market shares increased - toothpaste, toothbrushes, body wash, underarm and fabric conditioner.","In the toothpaste category, we\u2019ve seen strong results. In France, our market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to 22.4%. In Poland, we grew share 160 basis points to 47.6% year-to-date. And in Italy, we increased share 30 basis points to 24.6% year-to-date. Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, our market shares increased year-to-date. Overall in the region, our market shares are up 120 basis points to 24.7% year-to-date with excellent results in areas such as the UK, which is up 340 basis points to 39.3%; Germany, which is up a full point to 21%; and Italy, which is up 60 basis points to 16.4%.","And as in the U.S., our innovation grid for the first quarter in Europe is very full. In the toothpaste category, we\u2019re introducing Colgate Total Deep Clean, which features high cleaning prophy-silica, the same ingredient dentists use for in-office cleaning. The product provides a deep-cleaning user experience and is unique among the current variants in the Colgate Total portfolio. In addition, we\u2019re restaging the Colgate Total toothpaste premium line with a new design that better communicates higher quality, healthier and scientific and therapeutic benefits. New icons visually convey the variant benefits, enhancing differentiation, relevance and shopability.","In the toothbrush category, we\u2019re launching Colgate 360\u00b0 Expert White Toothbrush Plus Pen, the toothbrush and whitening pen that has helped increase market shares here in the U.S. under the Colgate Optic White name. And in personal care, we\u2019re relaunching Palmolive Gourmet shower gels with high-density creamy formulas and a new packaging technology that provides a premium look with high quality satin finishing and very strong shelf impact. Vanilla pleasure, chocolate passion, peach delight and strawberry touch will enchant consumers at point of sale.","Also in personal care is the Palmolive SKIN GARDEN line, a premium offering with a regimen approach. The shower gel, bath foam, liquid hand soap, bar soap and body lotion contain irresistible fragrances, natural ingredients rooted in the garden such as violet and honey, peony, pear and Mirabelle plums, sensorial [ph] and vivid textures and cutting-edge packaging, all reinforcing the Palmolive regimen.","And as we told you last quarter, our Sanex business is performing well and we have new news to report here as well. Our line of Sanex Advanced shower oils is bringing the shower oil trend from pharmacy to mass. The shower oils provide a feeling of comfort in the shower and are formulated to minimize the risk of irritation. These are even suitable for children, a new consumer target. Also inspired by the pharmacy channel are our new Sanex Advanced body bombs [ph] in a new stand-up tube format with a thicker, richer formula and premium pricing. Sanex Manual will also be launched, which is the first mask [ph] personal care range truly focused on men\u2019s skin health. As you know, we have a very strong market-leading homecare business in this region.","And an exciting innovation in this category is a line of Ajax specialty sprays which facilitate difficult everyday tasks in the kitchen. Priced at a premium, individual variants tackle different surfaces - the oven and microwave, MicroCeramic and stainless steel.","So turning then to Latin America. Despite some macroeconomic challenges in certain countries such as Brazil and Venezuela, the division delivered solid organic sales growth. Severe devaluations across the region have necessitated fairly significant price increases. But despite that, our regional market shares are solid and increase year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, toilet soaps, shampoos and liquid cleaners.","In Brazil, our toothpaste market share continues to climb up 100 basis points year-to-date to 72.4% with the most recent lead at 73.4%. Innovations across our portfolio have contributed to this success. In Mexico, despite continued competitive pressure, our market share is up 120 basis points to 80.8%. One of our newest innovations, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Neutrazucar increased 70 basis points and is now almost at 2 points. Our market-leading manual toothbrush share is up 350 basis points year-to-date across the region. This excellent performance has been driven by innovation in the Super Premium category with products such as Colgate Slim Soft and Colgate 360.","In toilet soaps, we increased our leadership share 40 basis points to 30.9% year-to-date. Protex and Palmolive continue to hold the number one and number two positions in the region. And we achieved record shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala.","More innovation is planned for this year. In oral care whitening category, we have three exciting launches. In toothpaste, we\u2019re launching Colgate Luminous White Advanced Expert, which delivers three shades whither teeth; A companion Colgate Luminous White mouthwash with an alcohol, free zinc and anti-tartar salts formula that helps deliver an anti-stain white smile; and Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothbrush and whitening pen with a claim to provide whiter teeth in two days will both be launched later this year. In mouthwash, a graphics relaunch of Colgate Plax 2-in-1 mouthwash clearly explains the benefits, see the [ph] removed bacteria for a fresh and clean mouth and to drive growth for the category.","In personal care, under the Protex name, we\u2019re launching a range of bar soaps, shower gel and liquid hand soaps. Protex Pro Hydrate, developed from the consumer insight that to have healthy and moisturized skin is necessary to deeply clean skin before moisturizing, this innovation has a formula that eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and has a macadamia oil complex that glides over your skin for a soft sensation. A similar range under the Palmolive equity will be Palmolive almond and omega oil with a nourishing formula.","In underarm, a relaunch of premium-priced Lady Speed Stick Clinical and Speed Stick Clinical will provide the benefits of superior sweat protection, neutralizing the source of bad odor, hypoallergenic, anti-stain technology and advanced skin care.","Turning then to Asia. While organic sales growth was somewhat muted in this region in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re pleased that volume increased in our largest businesses - Greater China and India. And this, despite some overall slowing in category growth rates. And as elsewhere, innovation has helped drive growth.","In India, our toothpaste share is up to 54.7% year-to-date. Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent and a relaunch of the rest of our sensitivity line have met with success. In addition, Colgate Total Charcoal with a unique antibacterial formula which reduces bacteria on 100% of your mouth\u2019s surfaces has added market share.","Elsewhere in the region, our toothpaste shares were a little soft on a year-to-date basis but market shares for the fourth quarter increased versus fourth quarter 2014 in China, Thailand, The Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Pakistan.","Our year-to-date toothbrush shares are also up in India, The Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Pakistan. A particular success has been Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal Gold toothbrush with less than 0.01 millimeter charcoal gold slim tip antibacterial bristles for deep, gentle cleaning. In the most recent period, it achieved 2.1, 3.6 and 2.2 share points respectively in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. In the fourth quarter in Hong Kong, we launched our Colgate Optic White toothbrush and whitening pen and it has a 6.4% share in the latest read. Our mouthwash business is strong. Across the region, our market share is up to 25.7% year-to-date, up 70 basis points year-on-year with the most recent lead at 26.5%.","And we have some exciting innovation launching this quarter. In China, where natural ingredients resonate very strongly with the consumer, we will be introducing Colgate Naturals toothpaste. There are five variants - tea tree oil gum care, lemon zesty radiating white, jasmine and chamomile healthy refreshing, lotus jade green soothing gum and seaweed salt pure white. The packaging visually communicates the different ingredients.","And we have a number of new products in the toothbrush category. Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive, a silky soft brush for sensitive teeth and gums; Colgate Super Flexi Black, with a flexible neck and improved handle; and a line of mid-tier brushes for kids with tapered bristles. To maintain our momentum in mouthwash, we\u2019re launching in China Colgate Plax Extreme Icy Mint mouthwash, which delivers long-lasting prevention of bad breath with dual mint essence as well as an antibacterial protection.","Then going to Africa, Eurasia. As you know, currency headwinds in this part of the world have necessitated some significant pricing in countries such as Russia, but market shares are solid and growing. Our year-to-date regional toothpaste market share is at 33.2%, up a full point from a year-ago period. In Russia, our share is up 260 basis points year-to-date to 34.5%, reaching a record-high of 35.2% in the most recent period. In South Africa, our market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to 49.6%. And our recent launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer in both these countries has contributed to these strong results.","In manual toothbrushes, our market shares are up in many countries across the region. In Russia, our year-to-date share is up 260 basis points to 48.4%. Excellent in-store execution has played an important role in these results. In Israel, two new products, Colgate Extra Clean and Colgate Slim Soft, helped increase our year-to-date share by 300 basis points to 51.2% with the most recent share read at a record 55.6%.","Our bar soap business is strong as well, up 80 basis points to 21.7% on a year-to-date basis. And in South Africa, the Protex brand is helping grow the business and our market share is up 20 basis points on a year-to-date basis. In Russia, Palmolive is leading growth driven by promotional support as well as strong in-store execution. Our year-to-date share is up 50 basis points.","And we have some exciting innovations for this part of the world as well. This quarter, we will be launching Colgate Total Pro Breath Health [ph] toothpaste across the division. The differentiated packaging with icons on the pack clearly explains the benefits, which include a unique breath-freshening technology, ON12 [ph] complex. Another toothpaste launch will be the Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent line extension. This premium-priced toothpaste repairs the cause of sensitivity and prevents further sensitivity from gum recession. And an innovation for the Russian market is Colgate Altai Herbs Ginseng, with an exclusive blend of Altai herbs and ginseng. In the personal care category, we are relaunching our existing line of Palmolive Aroma Sensations body washes and adding two new variants, Feel Good and So Dynamic.","Finally, with Hill\u2019s. Hill\u2019s finished the year with a strong quarter, both here and abroad. All three brands - Prescription Diet, Science Diet and Ideal Balance - are doing well. In fact, Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet or flagship line of therapeutic pet foods became a $1 billion brand in 2015. In the U.S., superstore retail consumption is growing in both PetSmart and Petco, which contributed to our solid results.","In Europe, our Ideal Balance line is now fully rolled out across all key countries and doing well. We\u2019re seeing a steady build of distribution and volume. Our integrated marketing campaign is focusing on trial and repurchase. And we\u2019re very excited about our upcoming innovation. Just launched at the North American Vet Conference is Prescription Diet Derm Defense for dogs. This diet is the first and only nutrition formulated to reduce signs of environmental allergies by helping to disrupt the internal allergy response and create a barrier against future episodes in dogs. It\u2019s available in dry and delicious new [ph] forms and of course will be supported by a full IMC campaign to engage the increasingly millennial vet population.","Hill\u2019s will also be entering the wearables space. Hill\u2019s has formed a strategic alliance with AGL to advance veterinary healthcare with the development of a wearable sensor for dogs that is sophisticated enough to distinguish the acts of scratching and shaking from running. Coupled with a robust data and analytics platform, it\u2019s designed to more quickly alert veterinarians and pet owners to potential health concerns as part of an ongoing monitoring program. It will be recommended for dogs that need to be regularly monitored, including those with dermatological conditions, arthritis, or obesity.","New news in the wellness category is premium-priced Hill\u2019s Science Diet healthy cuisine for dogs and cats, which uses our new Algenec [ph] technology to deliver superior-looking, tasty wet food. The new formulas are loaded with tasty morsels, tender vegetables and savory sauce.","So before I wrap up quickly, I want to cover two more housekeeping items relative to your models. Net interest in 2016 should be between $30 million and $45 million to quarter with a loss of interest income in Venezuela. Average diluted common shares outstanding were 896.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Because we had a GAAP loss in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the one-time charge with Venezuela, this number excludes 6.6 million of net incremental common shares outstanding assumed issued from the exercises in the money stock options as they\u2019re anti-dilutive. We\u2019d expect the 6.6 million shares to be included in diluted common shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2016 as they should not be anti-dilutive in this period.","So in summary, we\u2019re extremely pleased with the way that we finished the year. Organic sales growth was strong around the world, our gross margin increased and our market shares are healthy. Colgate people around the world are all focused on our strategies and priorities, thereby delivering these consistent strong results. Our global growth and efficiency program is on track and these are ongoing funding-the-growth programs. Our innovation pipeline is full and we\u2019re excited about the many products and initiatives we just told you about.","So we expect this momentum to continue into 2016 and look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go throughout the year. So, Chanel, that\u2019s the end of my prepared remarks. I should like to turn it over now to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning. So, Ian, you had very strong pricing in the quarter both at the corporate level and in Latin America but the volume reaction looked more severe than what we\u2019ve seen traditionally in your business, particularly in Latin America. So I was hoping you could just discuss consumer demand elasticity in this current macroenvironment if you\u2019re seeing any different behavior versus past with the macro slowdown we\u2019re seeing in Latin America and then how that may impact your desire to take additional pricing going forward to offset incremental FX pressure.","And then that\u2019s at the consumer level, but at the competitor level, what are you generally seeing from your competitors? Are they following and can you characterize the competitive environment that you\u2019re seeing? Thanks","Ian Cook","Yes, thanks, Dara. And before I jump in, let me just take this belated opportunity to wish everyone on the call a happy, healthy and safe 2016 in this volatile world. And when we turn to that volatile world, we\u2019re actually very pleased with the results in 2015, as Bina said, with consistent 5% organic top line growth in the quarter and in the year and with our gross margin building from the second quarter to 59% in the fourth quarter, which is the highest in two years in that environment which positions us well to see margin expansion in 2016. And I\u2019ll come back to that when we no doubt talk about margin.","But turning to how we think about the business in the environment everybody is operating in, first of all, we seek to have clarity and consistency of strategy. And we have that for the last decade with a simple and focused strategy that starts with consumers and ends with the leadership development in the company to deliver our products to those consumers.","Then you have the balance between the consistency of the results by quarter and our ambition of the longer-term which are captured in the global growth and efficiency program in terms of building the organization we want for the future. And then, of course, the decisions we make on the ground and the agility that\u2019s required to deal with events as they unfold.","Now, if you look at Latin America to this specific question, obviously, the foreign exchange headwind there as it was in Africa, Eurasia, was the most severe we experienced in our world for 2015.","And when we think about the consumers, we think about the brands and the health of our brands and the development of the market share of our brand. But obviously, we need to be focused on rebuilding the margin which is the fulcrum for investment in a business.","So in both those divisions, we took conscious decision to take pricing to help recover gross margin and suffered the volume decline you see.","We feel, however, very comfortable because of the performance of our market shares whether you look at the value market share and local currency as Bina talked specifically to Brazil or whether you look at the volume market shares in that region, they\u2019re up. So the consumer is staying with us and the consumer is staying with us across the portfolio of brands that we have.","And as we think forward into 2016 now, I guess a couple of things to say. And it relates to the gross margin. First of all, the enormous translation headwind we faced in 2015 will still be there in 2016, but it will be at a lesser level.","Second, the general commodity pricing environment year-on-year will be flat to modestly down.","Third, we have our funding the growth program which we talk about every call, which we expect to build the same way it has done for the last several years. We have the global growth and efficiency program. And on top of that, we have pricing. But we have less pricing in 2016 than we had in 2015. And half of that pricing without Venezuela is still rollover pricing into 2016.","So our planning expectation is that we will see the balance between volume and pricing move back a little bit more to volume and less to pricing. And that will include Latin America and we expect our market shares to continue to grow.","So the consumer behavior hasn\u2019t changed. We haven\u2019t seen down trading. And we\u2019re confident about the reversal back to volume more and price less in 2016 for Latin America and the overall business.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Can I just follow-up on that last one just in terms of the outlook maybe in the near-term to manage expectations? I know the comps in Latin America on the volume, so either really tough in the first half of \u201816. So do you think we\u2019re going to see negative volume growth maybe for the next quarter or two, potentially even worse than we just saw in the fourth quarter in Latin America?","But then broadly, I also wanted to ask more strategically, Asia, the slowdown in category growth that you\u2019re seeing there, it surprises me that we\u2019re seeing a slowdown in category growth given the very low per capita consumption levels. I get in Latin America, but not so much in Asia. So can you talk about Asia, specifically China and India? I think you called out - do you think there\u2019s something more structural there? Do you think that it\u2019s going to take a longer time? Do you really think it\u2019s an economic factor that\u2019s leading to the slowdown of the growth? If you could talk about that, that would be great. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes. I think in Latin America, the expectation is to see - not to see the kind of volume negative that we had in the fourth quarter as we set our way into 2016. Obviously, it will build across the year. But no, we don\u2019t expect to repeat of that level.","When you turn to Asia, and if you look at the emerging markets in general, the local currency growth rates in category is still mid-single digits, maybe slightly off that in the fourth quarter. We haven\u2019t seen anything dramatic in terms of a change in behavior thus far. We\u2019re obviously very focused on that, Wendy, as you would suppose we would be.","And pleasingly, I can report that the market shares in China and India has been mentioned with India, are both out nicely in 2015. So we stay close to it. Right now, we continue to see cash agreements growing around mid-single digits in local currency terms.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Powers with UBS.","Steve Powers","Great. Thanks. Just one more on the volume if I could just to clean it up. Ian, can you just talk away to the volume softness that you\u2019ve seen in response to pricing has been at all more pronounced on the personal and home care side of things versus oral care or if it\u2019s about equal?","And then a few months ago you\u2019d indicated that you saw traditional advertising ratios would be up again as a percentage of sales in 2016. And as we\u2019ve talked about, good deal has changed, since then the macroenvironment, so I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s still your expectation in terms of what\u2019s embedded in your outlook, the Super bowl ad notwithstanding. Thanks.","Ian Cook","The answer to your first question on volume is no, not really. It has more to do with the short-term slowdown in relation to the level of increase in pricing you take regardless of which category you\u2019re taking pricing in.","On the advertising side, I won\u2019t repeat too much of an old story. But I would say, back to this notion of marketing mix, when we think about advertising, we think about everything from educating kids in schools to get dental professionals and veterinary professionals to make a recommendation before the consumer has even purchased a product, to engaging with consumers to the various different media that we can avail ourselves of increasingly digital, but also the so called traditional media and then of course a strong belief in making that engagement carry through to the retail level where we think that expenditure can build a brand health and value as well.","But as we said on the last call, we expected as we got into our budgeting process that our innovation flow would be such that we would expect to see coming into 2016, an increase in the traditional advertising while still using the in-store lever as well. And indeed, as you might imagine, given richness of innovation that Bina went through in her prepared remarks, that is exactly where we have ended up with our plan. And so I can say that our advertising, the traditional advertising, for 2016 is up both on an absolute basis and of course on a ratio basis as well given that strength of innovation.","Operator","And let\u2019s go to our next question from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Hi, good morning.","Ian Cook","Hey, Bill.","Bill Schmitz","Hey, a couple of things. How do you define strong organic growth? Because I\u2019m trying to figure out how that sort of plays out relative to Venezuela. So can you tell us how much Venezuela contributed to organic growth now that kind of the cat\u2019s out of the bag on the earnings side? And then sort of how you think organic growth is going to play out next year?","Ian Cook","Yes. Well, let me just say, Bill, in response to your question, when you say how do you define strong organic growth, I think we would say in the environment wherein the range we had 4% to 7% bookends strong organic growth and 5% for 2015 in that regard is therefore strong.","And the way we\u2019re thinking about 2016 without Venezuela is exactly the same way which is to say our target for organic growth is to grow in that 4% to 7% range without Venezuela. And I can report that I have to say from a top line point of view, the year is off to a bright start.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good morning, folks.","Ian Cook","Hey, Jason.","Jason English","Thank you for the question and happy New Year to you as well. I want to come back on Venezuela real quick just to make sure we understand the math. I think in the last Q, you filed that you listed around 4% of sales, 2% of EBIT, clearly more UPS with interest income that you talked about.","But on the EBIT side, the math I know on very rounding numbers suggest that removal of Venezuela is going to be about a 50 basis point contribution of EBIT margins. Is that sort of directionally right? And if so, can you comment sort of bigger picture on how you are thinking about margins overall next year both with and without that tailwind?","Ian Cook","Yes. Well, we don\u2019t tend to talk about EBIT margin, Jason, so let me turn to gross margin which as you know we regard as the fulcrum of everything. So as I said, gross margin, up 20 bps to 59 in the fourth quarter.","And perhaps I should take the opportunity now before Lauren comes on and chides me of going through the row fort for that fourth quarter gross profit. So if you go to the gross profit in the prior year, was 58.8. Pricing, our strongest showing for the year, up 1.6 percentage points, so positive 1.6 points. Restructuring and funding the growth, 290 basis points, positive 2.9. Material prices, 420 negative, of which 240 was transaction, modest negative with all other and you get to the 59.","Now, as we roll that forward to 2016 and the plans we have, we feel good about our ability to meaningfully increase gross margin in 2016. And we would say that we expect to have gross margin expansion in 2016 to be in that 75 to 125 range. Part of the reason, as I said earlier, is the less aggressive foreign headwind. But as I also said earlier, we have pricing less, but half of it rollover, we have funding the growth which you know very well. We have the global growth and efficiency program. And we expect to see that gross margin expansion begin in the first quarter of 2016.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi guys.","Ian Cook","Hi Ali.","Ali Dibadj","I wanted to drill down on two things. One is SG&A and then just a broader question on SKU proliferation. First on SG&A, I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about ad spend, you know, it is the seventh quarter in a row we\u2019re seeing ad spend as the percentage sales go down. But your point earlier, your shares aren\u2019t moving as you confirm both volume and value. It doesn\u2019t like it\u2019s moving.","So how much more of a shift do you think you can do from ad spend to in-store? And kind of what are you watching just to make sure you don\u2019t go into the olden days\u2019 fear of just hurting the brand and it becomes a risk from that perspective? So kind of what are you watching? How much more you can go?","And on non-advertising, ex-advertising SG&A, I thought we would see more benefit because of the hubbing and the restructuring and everything that we talked about there. Why are we not seeing there? So that\u2019s the SG&A question.","And then on the SKU proliferation or innovation question, how do you guys - so every quarter we hear really interesting things, being briefly out of breath describing them at the start of every quarter. How do you guys deal with SKU proliferation? Is there a very clear discipline of put one in, take on out? Or how do you deal with that? And if you give us a sense of your number of skews you guys sell over the years and how much that\u2019s gone up, it\u2019s just something that struck me listening that again. Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes, yes. Well, thanks to your one question as usual. But let\u2019s turn to the advertising. And I mentioned in the introductory comments the word of balance. And you and I had this conversation on the last call. We don\u2019t view this as either\/or, we view this as what do we need to do to create the trial and repeat of our brands, build health over time and ultimately build market share with more consumers using our products.","And I wasn\u2019t quite sure what you meant when you said your market share is not moving. It is moving and it\u2019s moving up. And Bina went through some of those examples. And when we think about advertising, we think about, as I said earlier, marketing mix from the school room to the dental office, to the store and all of the other media through which you can reach people including digital, including television, including magazine and advertising and the like, even billboards in Africa.","And we think about that balance all the time to make sure that our brand health doesn\u2019t weaken over time. And I said that the advertising would be up absolutely and as a percent to sales in 2016. And we have quite a list of measures that we look at from trial to repeat to various brand health measures which we prac over time so that we don\u2019t get to a point where you start to, shall we say, take more out of a brand than you are putting back into a brand. And that\u2019s back to that word, balance. We think we\u2019ve kept the right balance in 2015.","When we go into 2016 with the portfolio and the brand objectives that we have for 2016, we\u2019re taking up the traditional. We will continue to use the in-store as part of our marketing mix and we will monitor very, very closely the trial and repeat measures we have in terms of the new innovation and the brand health measures that we have in terms of the brands Colgate, Sonic, et cetera, that we have around the world, because we\u2019re a marketing company. And that\u2019s what we do.","So I think you can be reassured that it\u2019s not one or the other. We\u2019re not trying to push from one to the other. We\u2019re just trying to register the point that we have to think about the mix of all of the engagement points we have with consumers. And as I said before, you have a 74 share in Brazil. That\u2019s how much of the shelf you have. You can have an enormous impact with the consumer in the store.","Your SKU proliferation point of view is spot on. It is always a risk that you end up in the hunt for innovation of this risk of over proliferating. I can\u2019t say that we have a strict one in, one out policy. That would not be correct. I can say that as a company measure, from the top of the house, we monitor our SKUs by division, by business and overall as a company. And thankfully, our SKU count has been coming down.","And now, within that, you have cycles when you\u2019re replacing and you\u2019ve got a double count. But it\u2019s something we watch really at the top of the house. And it\u2019s a central part of our simplification initiatives because it touches everything, the factory, the inventory, you could imagine all of the touch points.","So it\u2019s a fair question. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at risk of over proliferating with the innovation we have because we have a discipline to bring the overall numbers down year upon year.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Thank you. Good morning. Hey guys. I guess I just want to go back to gross margin for a second and the 75 to 125 bps expansion outlook for this year. That seems to be your evergreen target. And I was looking at my model and if it\u2019s right, you guys haven\u2019t done that since 2009. So it\u2019s been a while and I understand there\u2019s been a lot of external factors that have kind of crept up here.","But how much confidence do you have in that? And I guess how do we think about raw materials ex the transactional impact of currency in that? And how do we think about the exclusion of Venezuela in terms of the dynamics of that gross margin expansion? Thanks.","Ian Cook","Yes. Well, how you think about it - I mean first of all, there is no one more keenly aware of our gross margin plateaus than us, number one.","Number two, when we think about it, again, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, from that transaction point of view, although foreign exchange continues to be a negative, it is less of a negative than what we endured in 2015. Now, of course, that improvement builds over the year, but still overall it is less negative. As I also mentioned earlier, underlying commodity cost with [indiscernible] even at 35, are basically flat to modestly down. That\u2019s favorable.","Third, we have the funding, the growth program that we have had every year and we track through quarter by quarter. And you will see the history and you now know the history for 2015. And that\u2019s our goal and objective for 2016. And as I said, we have pricing lesser than last year, of which 50% is rollover.","Now, Venezuela clearly adds benefit to gross margin. But I would say that we definitely feel that 2016 is the year we need to raise our gross margin and the proof will be in the pudding when we talk next at the end of the first quarter. Everything that we know we feel confident about that.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy","Thank you so much. Hi, Bina and Ian. Ian, just a more commentary if you wouldn\u2019t mind walking around a couple of big markets - China, Brazil, Mexico, Russia - just the state of the consumer. I mean from where we sit sometimes, things can sound really dire. But what are you hearing from your country leaders and people on the ground about the consumer sentiment? And is it significantly worse in any one of those areas than in another?","Ian Cook","Well, it is difficult to find anybody with anything optimistic to say about much of anything these days. Without being overly general, I would say that the underlying consumer sentiment and behavior in China and India is okay. I would say that the underlying consumer sentiment in Mexico is okay. I would say that the underlying consumer sentiment in Russia is not great. And that would be English understatement. And I would say in Brazil, the underlying sentiment in Brazil is not great.","And we have said before that again, our objective is to grow market share for our brands in those environments. I think we have said before that we think Brazil is not an overnight fix. And we will stay the course.","But again, if you take this generalized view, I think there are still more of the emerging countries where the underlying consumer sentiment is okay. Russia and Brazil would not be in that group in 2015. And we don\u2019t believe in 2016 either. And although it\u2019s a smaller part of our business, that would also apply to some of the African countries, but they are smaller.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Thanks, good morning.","Ian Cook","Hey Bill.","Bill Chappell","Just a follow-up, could you quantify what the organic growth was last year ex Venezuela? And then the other question, on share repurchase, I\u2019m not sure if you commented on that on what it was in the quarter. But is there any thoughts with kind of stock, where it\u2019s been? And in the past, you\u2019ve certainly used opportunities to step up and use a little more cash? Is that a though right now?","Ian Cook","Okay. The answer on Venezuela is polite no. So I repeat, we delivered 5% organic growth in the fourth quarter and in 2015. And we are guiding that we will deliver the same organic range between 4% and 7% excluding Venezuela in 2016.","As we think about the share repurchases, one has to be thoughtful about capital structure in the environment wherein given the foreign exchange impact on cash profit. And as we have gone through our capital structure right now, and we have not made this decision yet, but I think it would be fair to say as a company that we have been for since 1895 I think committed to paying dividend and have increased it for the last 50 plus years. So that\u2019s a decision yet to be made, but that is obviously a use of cash so is capital expenditure which is very focused on supporting our global growth and efficiency program. And then we turn to share buyback.","Right now, our capital structure would say our gross share buyback for this year would be in the 1 billion to 1.3 billion range.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great, thanks. I would never chide you in, first of all.","Ian Cook","I did it already.","Lauren Lieberman","I had a question on Europe. When I spent some time with panels, middle of last year, we talked quite a bit about premium innovations and it struck me that sort of newer direction, a different way of dealing with the longstanding deflationary environment in Europe. So if you could talk a little bit about how those efforts are going on premium innovation, if it\u2019s a strategy you\u2019re thinking about taking a more significant way into other markets, that would be really helpful. Thank you.","Ian Cook","Yes. Well, it is well underway. I mean as we went through our 2016 budget program, I think you may have had a sneak peek on stuff we haven\u2019t yet seen here. But that is very much underpinning the European plan for 2016 and some of those products are moving into the marketplace as Bina mentioned as we speak right now.","And it would be fair to say that depending on the market, depending on the condition of the consumer, that is the model that is under serious study and indeed has already been adopted in certain parts of the world. But to the extent that it can be deployed, you expect that it will be.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante","Good morning everyone. My question has to do - hello, how are you? My question has to do with reports on the British press that Glaxo is considering to sell off its consumer division. And I would like to hear your thoughts with regards to whether this asset which includes Sensodyne, is something that you would consider as strategic for Colgate on one end?","On other, to what extent with the restructuring savings ending in 2016, whether financially will of interest as well as a means to generate savings? Thank you.","Ian Cook","Well, first of all, I\u2019m hesitant to comment on the British press, Javier.","Javier Escalante","Okay, I understand. But what about Glaxo consumer? Is it something that - is it kind of - I know that you are very choosy and very financially disciplined, but do you think that this is something that it would be of interest to Colgate to consider?","Ian Cook","The only proper answer to that question is that we don\u2019t comment on market speculation and rumor or the British press.","Operator","And our final question comes from John Faucher with JP Morgan.","John Faucher","Thank you very much. Two questions here. The first is, a lot more discussion about the local brands and things like that. Yet as you said, your market shares are generally increasing. Can you talk about what you\u2019ve seen from them from a transactional pricing standpoint?","And then the second question is probably, it\u2019s a little bit of a devil\u2019s advocate question and probably not one you\u2019re expecting, which is when you talked about having the flexibility of sort of the touch points, right, advertising versus trade and in-store, what have you, and given that dialogue you\u2019ve had over the last 6 to 12 months, wouldn\u2019t that argue that longer-term that the gross margin expansion which we\u2019ve been looking for is less relevant, right? It seems as though if you have that marketing mix flexibility, it should be about the operating margin, not the gross margin.","So I guess sort of putting it back in your court in that regard, doesn\u2019t the gross margin lose some of its importance overtime if you\u2019re moving these buckets around more? Thanks.","Ian Cook","So let me answer the question of the local brand pricing. I guess for those materials that are dollar-denominated, they say it\u2019s the same pressures that we do. And many of these local brands are not classic cheapies. They are reasonably well-priced products. I must say I can\u2019t give you a chapter and verse review on have they mimicked the pricing we have. But we certainly haven\u2019t seen them going the other way. So either they are premium in many cases and they stayed there or I think I could say that they will have moved their pricing. We haven\u2019t seen them trying to go the other way.","On the marketing mix comment, I would be careful to argue about the flexibility. I think what it gives us is against the objectives we have for a brand or an innovation or against a particular consumer, what is the best way to think about all of the touch points in terms of reaching them.","I made the comment on the last call that over half of moms today in Latin America are Millennials that Facebook and YouTube are enormous connection points for that community. So that\u2019s a great place to go to touch those kind of consumers.","And I think personally, gross margin remains as important because what you\u2019re trying to do there, I think, is to create value in a product that the consumer sees and is prepared to pay for back to Lauren\u2019s point about premium by innovation. And it\u2019s off that fulcrum, everything else comes because otherwise from an operating point of view, you\u2019re only leaving yourself really leveraged overhead and advertising to deal with.","So I think a gross margin focus should be an un-remising focus in a consumer products company in our types of businesses.","Ian Cook","Okay. Well, I\u2019m pleased and surprised pleasantly by the duration of the call. Thank you for all of the questions. And we look forward to keeping you updated as the year unfolds. Thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation."]}}
