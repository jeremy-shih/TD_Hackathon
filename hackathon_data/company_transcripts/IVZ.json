All participants will be in a listen only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to turn call over to your speakers for today Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco and Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan you may begin.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you very much. And thank you for joining us and as was just mentioned Loren Starr Invesco CFO is on the call with me. And we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on our website if you're so inclined to follow along.","And as we typically do, I'll give an overview of the business results for the second quarter. Loren will go into greater details on the financials and then importantly we'll open up to Q&A. So let me begin by highlighting the firms operating results for the quarter which you'll find on slides four of the deck.","Long term investments performance remained strong during the quarter, 68% to 73% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers on a three and five year respectively. Strong investment performance and our continued focus on meeting client needs will retain the impact of volatile markets during the quarter.","Strong client demand helped drive passive and institutional flows which led to long term inflows of $4.5 billion during the quarter. The adjusted operating margin was 38.6% an improvement over the prior quarter and during the quarter we returned $318 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buy backs.","Assets under manage were $779 billion at the end of the second quarter up from $771 billion in the first quarter. Adjusted operating income was $330 million in the quarter up considerably from $307 million in the prior quarter.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56 versus $0.49 in the prior quarter. Also noted during the quarter, we've raised our quarterly dividend to $0.28 cents per share. And we also repurchased $200 million of stock during the quarter.","Before Loren goes into details in the company's financial, let me take a few minutes to talk about investment performance and flows during the quarter.","Turning to Slide seven now, our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain strong investment culture help us to deliver solid long term investor performance across the enterprise during the quarter.","Looking at the firm as a whole 68% of assets were in the top half on a three year basis and 73% were in the top half on a five-year basis. On page eight, you'll see that flows into passive capabilities were quite strong, while flows into active capabilities were flat with $4.5 billion in total long term in flows.","Flows into passive capabilities were driven by strong demands for Invesco power share capability. This was the second best quarter in Invesco power shares history with roughly $3.8 billion in net new assets, and the strong flows are helping us continue to gain ETF market share.","This reflects longevity and the breath of the power shares offering as well as our continued focus on meeting client needs. We are well positioned in the current market environment through our low volatility suite, commodity suite, fixed income and bank low ETF.","As you're probably aware, smart data strategies are growing at nearly twice the pace of the overall ETF market. Although this is prompting a wave of fund launches by competitors, our expertise in smart data and factor investing continue to differentiate us in the market and help us gain share.","Although long term flows are flat on the active side. We saw solid demand for alternatives including real estate and multi asset capabilities as well as fixed income.","Asia pacific demonstrated continued strength across retail and institutional with tremendous momentum continuing into the third quarter. A continued focus on delivering strong investment performance and bringing in our broad range of capabilities supply and contribute to the very positive results in the region.","Globally, we also saw strong institutional flows during the quarter which reflects our continued focus on this channel and results in a series of positive institutional flows going back two years.","Client demand trends remain consistent with particularly strong interest in fixed income, multi assets, real estate and our institutional pipeline remains very strong. So at the June the one, but not funded pipeline is up 15% on assets under management versus the prior quarter and the prior year.","Retail flows are flat this quarter as investors weighed their options during some of the late quarter volatility. That said, we continue to see strength in fixed income, U.S. dividend strategies as well as retail alternative capabilities specifically GTR and real estate.","Now let me take a moment and highlight the business in EMEA. Our number one position U.K. retail, our strong cross board of retail business and our robust institutional pipeline across EMEA all position us extremely well ahead of a potential Brexit.","We've positioned our business over many years to serve clients who are located in a variety of countries across the region. Our people and fund ranges are organized to meet those local needs. We are well diversified across channel with U.K. retail cross border and institutional each comprising roughly a third of our business in the region. We are also diversified across asset class with assets spread across equity bond and multi asset capabilities.","Lastly, with more than 1300 people in the region, we are well placed across the region with strong business in both the U.K. and on the continent. And our level diversification and our construct positions extremely well to deliver for our clients in EMEA.","Investors across Europe reacted thoughtfully to the market filled volatility that occurred at the time around the vote. Since then clients have taken advantage of the market movements by utilizing a full range of Invesco comprehensive fund range to achieve their long term investment objectives.","As an example we've seen strong movement in the capabilities such as our highly regarded global targeted returns fund which clients seeks to manage risks in their portfolios.","With regard to flows, our business in EMEA has demonstrated good resiliency through the Brexit topic with flows improving when compared to the prior quarter pre the announcement of the results of U.K. referendum on June 23rd. For the month of June, up to the date that the Brexit vote we saw daily average outflows of approximately $78 million. Since the referendum vote outflows have subsided to a daily average of $13 million.","Although it's still early days, we feel good about the momentum in our EMEA business and going forward were focus on staying close to our clients, managing our core business and executing our strategy while adopting to any changes that might be brought about by Brexit.","Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few words about the new DOL Fiduciary Rule. We're actively engaged with clients as they work to understand the impact of the DOL Rule on their business, you know, for the past couple of years our discussion with clients have intensified moving from clarifications and interpretations to practical application.","We are in discussions with them regarding product implications, share best possibilities and how best to leverage Robo solutions such as Jemstep. Based on our early discussions we continue to believe our comprehensive range of capability positions us very well to help our clients as a DOL Rule is implemented.","Additionally, given Invesco's tremendous expertise and experience partnering with clients to address regulatory topics. For example, our work and RDR in the U.K. we view this as an opportunity to further deepen our relationships, provide new capabilities and enhance our business overall. With that, I will now turn it over to Loren to review the financials in more details.","Loren Starr","Thanks, Marty. Okay so quarter-over-quarter you saw our total AUM increase by $8.1 billion or 1%. This was driven by positive market returns of $10.7 billion. We also saw long term net inflows of $4.5 billion. I should note, of this $4.5 billion, $0.9 billion came from IVR leverage, which is classified as our institutional passive fixed income.","We also saw the acquisition of our India joint venture get completed and that brought in $2.4 billion. We saw inflows from money market of $2 billion, these factors are offset by negative FX translation of $7.7 billion and we also saw outflows from the QQQ's of $3.8 billion.","Our average AUM for the second quarter was $784.5 billion that was up 4.9% versus Q1. Our net revenue yield came in at 43.7 basis points which is 0.1 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Although this was a small change there were a variety of factors which impacted our yield and Q2.","These included AUM mix and lower performance fees which reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points and 0.4 basis points respectively. These factors were offset by one more day in the period which increased the yield by 0.4 basis points.","In addition, currency mix and the increase in the other revenue each contributed 0.3 basis points to net revenue yield in the quarter.","Next let's turn to the operating results, Page 13. Before I begin, I'd like to point out that we've evaluated and taken onboard the SEC's new guidance on non-gap financial measures. Accordingly, you'll already noticed the changes that we made in the format of our second quarter earnings press release which now focuses primarily on the U.S. gap results.","In addition, the U.S. gap period-over-period variances are now set out in detail in our earnings release. Both our earnings release and this investment presentation contain detail reconciliations between our U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP. And importantly there is no change to how we've calculated our non-GAAP measures relative to prior quarters. But since we've already provided the U.S. GAAP narrative in the earning press release, my comments today consistent with past practice will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures. So actually let's turn to the next page that's titled non-GAAP operating results.","You've seen that revenues increase by $38.5 million or 4.7% quarter-over-quarter to $856.6 million, which included a positive FX rate impact of $6.4 million.","But then within that revenue number you'll see that adjusted investment management fees increased by $32.6 million or 3.5% to $962.9 million. This reflects higher average AUM for the quarter. Foreign exchange increased adjusted investment management fees by $7.7 million. Our adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $5.7 million or 2.9% reflecting higher average AUM for retail products.","Foreign exchange increased adjusted services and distribution revenue by $0.5 million. Our adjusted performance fees came in at $9.3 million in Q2 and were earned from a variety of investment capabilities including $5.5 million from our bank loan products.","Foreign exchange increased these fees by $0.1 million. Our adjusted other revenues in the first quarter were $31.7 million and that was an increase of $7.7 million from the prior quarter and that was the result of increased transaction fees from real estate.","Foreign exchange increased these revenues by $0.4 million. Third party distributions service and advisory expense which we net against gross revenues increased $1.3 million or 0.4%. This movement was in line with higher revenues derived from our retail AUM and FX increased these expenses by $2.3 million.","Moving further on down this slide you'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $526.2 million increased by $15.2 million or 3% relative to Q1. Foreign exchange increased adjusted operating expenses by $4.1 million during the quarter.","Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $347.9 million an increase of $7.6 million or 2.2%. This increase was driven by higher sales commissions and variable compensation cost, a full quarter of higher based salaries effective from March 1st, an increase in deferred compensation expenses for the awards granted in the first quarter.","This was offset by a decline in the seasonal payroll taxes. FX increased our adjusted compensation by $2.8 million in the quarter. Adjusted marketing expenses increased by $3.6 million or 14.2% to $29 million reflecting the seasonal increase inclined events. FX increase adjusted marketing expense by $0.3 million in the quarter.","Adjusted property, office and technology expenses were $82.8 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.7 million versus Q1 driven by higher technology cost. FX increased these expenses by $0.5 million.","Adjusted G&A expense at $66.5 million increased $2.3 million or 3.6% and this was driven by professional services expenses when compared to the prior quarter and FX increased G&A by $0.5 million.","Going on further down the page, you'll see that adjusted non-operating income increased to $15 million compared to Q1 and this difference was largely driven by higher equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in the second quarter, but also the 7.1 million FX loss recognized in the prior quarter.","The firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q2 was consistent with the prior quarter at 26.5% which brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.56 and adjusted net operating margin of 38.6%.","And so finally before I turn things over to Marty, I just want to provide a quick update on our capital management activities in the quarter. As you'll recall from our recent announcement in addition to our ongoing share repurchase activity during the quarter we entered into a 150 million accelerated share repurchase program on June 30th.","And as a result of this our end of period share count declined by approximately 1.7% quarter-over-quarter to 413.1 million shares.","And with that, turn it back to Marty.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you, Loren, let me just make a couple summary comments before we get to Q&A. We believe our ability to produce strong long term net flows this quarter reflects the fundamental strength of our firm.","Our expertise across a broad range of fundamental and factor base capabilities and our focus on helping retail and institutional clients achieve their investment objectives.","We feel good about the commencement of our business. We closed strong across the quarter as we help clients manage through the volatility we saw in June.","Strong flows have continued into July with more than $8 billion of long term net inflows across variety of capabilities and regions. This $8 billion includes $6.5 billion that is related to the 529 mandate which was recently funded.","As noted during our investor day and earlier this year, we were very well positioned to help clients be successful which in turn will enhance our market relevance strive growth and strengthen shareholder value over the long term.","And with that Loren and I would like to take any question you all have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks good morning everyone.","Martin Flanagan","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","So it nice to see the strong rebound in your fixed income flows. Can you let us know which products were the largest contributor to the bond flows and also can you help us think about the sustainability of the second quarter results into the second half?","Martin Flanagan","Maybe I'll make a comment and Loren can talk more specifically. You know, as I just mentioned we just continue to see really strong, you know, really strong flows. And I think importantly, you're seeing as I said long term flows away from the 529 plan you saw more than $1.5 billion already. You know, the pipeline continues to be very, very strong. And the other element that we're seeing is again the power share data capabilities, the breath and longevity of the range. It's really kicking in and so this - we are right now it looks like it's going to continue quite strongly, you know, through the border.","Loren Starr","I'll just say generally the growth in our fixed income is being driven by our U.S. investment grade capability which is pretty much I think also in our institutional pipeline showing up as a large contributor. I just want to remind people that in the flows this quarter there was about $0.9 billion related to IVR leverage which shows up in the fix income column. But we also are seeing a lot of interest even in power shares, fixed income, emerging markets, sovereign debt, Chinese fixed income, so are a variety of other fixed income capabilities factor into that. And each one is about roughly $0.5 billion in size [Indiscernible].","Craig Siegenthaler","And then on Brexit, I think the client reaction is significantly more muted than anyone was thinking about 30 days ago. But how are clients reacting in both the U.K. and continental Europe today following the vote? And have you seen a lot of that initial reactive activity dying down?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. And, you know, like us, like by others, you know, very engaged with clients. I mean what was really interesting was you saw in our numbers, June, you know, that was probably the peak of uncertainty and you saw it in the flows being most negative here to date. Interestingly, a number of institutional clients were waiting until after the vote and what it really did was start to, in their mind it created clarity and the institutional mandate started a fund in quite, you know, in the 30 days past that.","And we're also seeing retail investors making decisions on where to put their assets. And again, we point out GTR has been a real beneficiary of that. So people are looking to, you know, just relook at their asset allocation capabilities. The good news is the breadth of our capabilities put us in a position that we can be helpful to them in any which way.","So, it is really days but everything we see, I frankly think its opening opportunity for a firm like us. We are positioned very strongly, you know, structurally for a Brexit. That means we're not distracted by trying to - having revamp product lines or anything along that way. And we can just really, really be focused on clients. And again it was a total over reaction in light of if you look at Invesco share price and again I take the results are making that point quite clear.","Loren Starr","And the other thing kind of worth mentioning is I mean our teams have been really good in terms of being innovative and creating new product in advance of client demand and so we would expect to see other, I think, very interesting products hit the U.K. market this year towards the beginning of next year.","I think there is an income oriented sort of GTR type of product that is being looked at, as well as some enhanced index capabilities and factor capabilities too. So I think all those are going to really help us even if we see continued sort of level of uncertainty around Brexit.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks for taking my questions.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Line is now open.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. First, in terms of, maybe a couple questions to excess cash. What was the balance at the end of the quarter? And I've recalled that consolidation was a conceptual focus when that pool was being built. But I think product development and capital return have been higher priorities more recently. So how do you see that access cash level evolving and is a billion dollars the number you still want to migrate towards over time?","Loren Starr","Ken, total cash at the end of the quarter is $1.45 billion and so the regulatory requirement element of that was about $660 million leaving us roughly $800 millionish of sort of capital. I mean, we're certainly within sort of tolerances around that billion. And so again I won't get fixated on that billion being sort of like this bright line that we have to sort of hit.","And clearly we've been very opportunistic and we'll continue to be very opportunistic with respect to returning capital to the extent that we see our stock being valued in a way that we think is not commensurate with our true values. So, I would say look to our past sort of practices to evaluate how we're going to operate going forward. It will be very consistent.","Ken Worthington","Okay, great. Thank you. And two little questions maybe one on the Rhode Island plan how's the transitioning gone? And how much money actually came over when it was first announced? I know it was about seven billion was that about what eventually moved over?","Martin Flanagan","So, what came over was $6.5 billion and so those are combinations of your market impact and with the transition it is now completed the transitions in place. And everybody is very, very focused on expanding the capabilities through the retail channel. We think it's going to - it's a great plan and we think that we can help make it even more successful. So, we're executing as we speak.","Ken Worthington","All right. Excellent. Then just lastly active equity net outflows were pretty large this quarter. Obviously it was a big risk off quarter. There was Brexit and other things. Maybe any observations you have on sort of the nature, either the lack of money coming in or the more money coming out that kind of drove that big net outflow this quarter?","Martin Flanagan","Ken, the one thing I would just there's about 2.8 related to international growth. That was sort of the thing that we - I think we - people understand that there was one client who turned out it was a parting of ways, but that international growth capabilities performing extremely well. It's been a close capability and its one that I think is going to get filled up pretty quickly through the course of this year.","So I would do that as a little bit one offish with respect to kind of the equity - the active equity outflow. The other elements are sort of somewhat consistent with past, what you've seen in the past. So I don't think there's anything that's sort of accelerating outflow, relative to that category other than that one element.","Ken Worthington","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.","Alex Blostein","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks. A couple of quick questions. I guess, first around the margins. Obviously we saw the adjusted margin improve sequentially given better revenue environment, but still down pretty meaningfully every year. So if we're seeing more range bound market which obviously feels like a big if right now, but under that scenario how should we think about the trajectory of the margin for the rest of the year? And then is there anything else you guys are targeting on the expense front to help drive margins higher in today's environment?","Loren Starr","Yes, Alex, I'll take that. So I think our expectation even with markets being flat which is the way we normally forecast anyway, and even with the pounds being down where it is for the last half of the year we would expect margins to be on an upward trajectory, as we continue to grow organically and continue to work hard on the optimization work around cost.","The firm has done I think a really great job of creating capacity for investment without having to add to cost, really through using as we talked about in the past, greater use of our own shared service centers, being able to leverage technology more effectively, streamlining, simplifying, a lot of our processes. So that work is going on as, you know, and we're on track with respect to the optimization which we've discussed provide some expense relief of roughly $30 million to $45 million by the end of the year.","And to that run rate which is actually now beginning to flow through our numbers is something that has been very helpful, and just remind people, we had those acquisitions that came onboard Jemstep and Religare. And those expenses are being offset through this optimization whereas the revenues are showing up in the revenue line items. So we do think that, that's going to help further drive margin expansion.","Our increments on margin continues to be at very high level and with that sort of 55% to 60% incremental margin, and our fee rate because of the mix that's coming in particularly around institutional being at our higher fee rate than what's going out. We'll continue to benefit from that.","So I think all those factors to us that we can continue to see margins increase and, you know, get up to the levels that we've seen in the past without too much stretching. Clearly that's a factor of the market of course and what...","Alex Blostein","Sure.","Martin Flanagan","I might add a point though. I would say from my perspective where were really going to see the margin expansion is really on the organic growth. You know, we continue to be very discipline on expenses as we always have been as Loren just described. But","I tell you for the 11 years I've been here I don't know that I know a time when I've seen so many of our initiatives sitting in front of us to have such an impact. You know, you're starting to see and institutional factor base smart beta solutions.","And so our debate internally is, what is the wise move of investing in these to get the returns versus being very cautious. And again it's something we do all the time, but it's really that market relevance expansion of the business that sits right in front of us.","And it's a very exciting time quite frankly for us.","Loren Starr","I mean, just generally because I know people are quite curious. I mean in terms of guidance around expenses I mean we would see expenses sort of being roughly flat from the current level through the course of the year - based on sort of flat markets and FX. So that provides a nice back drop as we continue to grow the revenue line item.","Alex Blostein","Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks guys.","Martin Flanagan","Yes.","Alex Blostein","Second question on the DOL. I understand it's still pretty early, but it seems like there is a lot moving pieces already happening on the distribution side of things and different kind messages from various distribution partners.","What do you guys hear from some of the larger distributors out there, whether its warehouses or some of the more regional platforms and specifically as it relates to essentially payment per shelf space and how those conversations are evolving?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, so I would say, from my perspective, which is probably na\u00efve I thought there was going to likely be a uniform you know response, but in reality what\u2019s happened is each of those distributors are different. Their businesses are positioned differently and so they\u2019re all variations on the theme and that makes sense quite frankly.","And what also -- it\u2019s -- there are ways to continue to be supportive of the brokerage business, but knowing that the movement is towards their advisory businesses. And so you know they\u2019re putting a DOL on the place you know along those lines and again that you know plays well to an organization such as ours where we have such a range of high conviction fundamental capabilities and the factor-based investing.","And so it would be too early for us to be very specific on what the outcomes are but, as I said, it looks like you could see some changes to share classes. You could see some different changes in use of -- focus on asset classes and the like. So, that\u2019s what we know right now. But again, I would be getting ahead of our clients if I said--","Loren Starr","And the other thing that we also changed is maybe as a team is the use of fewer providers and so it\u2019s the ones who are probably -- have the broadest set of capabilities, good performance who will probably fare better to the extent that there\u2019s assets in motion as a result of DOL. We think we\u2019re probably you know as well-positioned as one can be in that environment.","Alex Blostein","Yes, understood. Thanks so much.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Brennan Hawken of UBS. The line is now open.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks, good morning. Quick question on the fee rate here and we saw the management\u2019s fee rate decline quarter over quarter. I know that you guys often speak to the revenue yield, but just hoping if it\u2019s possible to ask a question, cutting out some of the other noise and just speaking specifically to the investment management fees divided by AUM.","What drove that? Was it mix and if so, should we think about that as being sustainable and I think last quarter you had given some indications saying that you expect the fee rate to improve throughout the year and is that still your expectation?","Loren Starr","Yeah, so obviously the management fee rate does have -- is impacted by FX and then there are some factors there as well as overall equity component verses non-equity. And so when the market declines, you\u2019ll see some of that change.","There's another element around our gross management fee rate, which people should be aware of. It\u2019s the RDR impact right, as we go to continue to bleed out the old fee rate and replace it with the net fee rate that has an impact on the gross management field.","And so I\u2019d say that is sort of a permanent and sustained as we go forward. But it doesn\u2019t have any impact on the net revenue yield because commensurately our -- well the pain away goes away too. So, that\u2019s why it is -- you almost have to look at that net number to really understand the dynamic of that shifting mix","But there -- in terms of the trends around what\u2019s driving our management fee, we still feel that it\u2019s quite stable. Maybe, I mean to the extent that Europe is a little bit slower than it\u2019s been in the past, its one engine that was driving that fee rate, which is probably not something you\u2019d look to be driving forward. But we are seeing continued engines around Asia alternatives, which is helping us continue to see that fee rate increase as well as the institutional mix generally being better.","So, I\u2019d say the net revenue yield ex-performance fees, you know, quarter -- next quarter and going forward is kind of flattish to this quarter and so that would be -- so even with that FX, so I think with that FX down obviously that has a negative impact, but because the mix is positive, it\u2019s probably off setting it.","So, hopefully that\u2019s helpful in terms of the modeling on the fee rate. A lot of dynamics underneath clearly have to have some impact, but generally, we expect to see that trend in terms of improving fee rates continue, but maybe at a somewhat slower pace.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, got it. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I know that it\u2019s a --it\u2019s probably pretty hard to be -- maybe hard might even be understating it, but to be anything close to precise. But given how important the U.K. is to you all, is there a way that you could help us understand how you\u2019re thinking about the different things that might happen to your expense base and to your business based upon the handful of likely outcomes that have been thrown out there from a post Article 50 world?","Martin Flanagan","Sure, so again take this -- reality as no one knows exactly, so let\u2019s do the more likely than not. The more likely than not is Brexit is going to happen and that you\u2019re going to end up with trade agreements between the continent and the U.K. that are mutually beneficial. It\u2019s going to take time to get there.","That said let\u2019s get down to our business. Our business, as I was trying to highlight, we are already structured for a post-Brexit environment. We\u2019re a very strong U.K. business, very strong continental business, and we don\u2019t see any changes there.","And for all a range of reasons and the impact on the business is going to be largely driven by the economic environment. And yeah, there is a scenario where it\u2019s less negative than everything that you heard. I mean, with the pound depreciating, that\u2019s actually the exporters in the U.K. are actually doing very well.","So, I think, the reality is this is going to be very hard at a political level, but I would say our business is a business that is structured for the change and there is a need for asset management services and we just really don\u2019t -- the -- this industry being hurt to the degree that some other businesses might be where they\u2019re literally going to have to move people to different part of -- out of the U.K., out of the continent and you know vice versa. So, it is just not part of what\u2019s going to happen to us as asset managers.","Now there are some asset management firms that are not structured like we are, and they\u2019re going to have to do some work to get positioned to be continually successful. But again, we\u2019re trying very hard to point out looking at the elements we talked about earlier -- it\u2019s a huge part of the world. It\u2019s a strong part of the world. They\u2019re clearly going through some changes, but I think it\u2019s a total mistake to think that the reach will not continue to be important and that it will not continue to be an important part of our business.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks for that color.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Line is now open.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks. Just a quick follow-up question on your comments on July. Besides the 5.29 [ph] funding, the bout 1.5 billion of inflows, does it have a comparable mix to what we show on the quarter, alternatives and fixed income in inequities on the out?","Loren Starr","So, of the 5.29, the 6.5 -- about 2.1 is equity, 3.5 is fixed, there\u2019s 0.4 of money market and 0.5 of Alts. So, that\u2019s on the 5.29 component of the flows. I\u2019m sorry; did that answer your question?","Glenn Schorr","No, I appreciate that though. That\u2019s a good follow-up. The 1.5 billion that wasn\u2019t a part of the 5.29, I'm sure it's a similar--","Loren Starr","I\u2019m sorry I thought you were -- so the 1.5 billion and that was just related to market and outflows and so I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t know how it -- where it came out of.","Martin Flanagan","No, no, the question of the $8 billion, what\u2019s the 1.5 billion? What were the flows for the 1.5 billion?","Glenn Schorr","Does it look like second quarter with alternatives and fixed income inflowing with equities on outflow?","Loren Starr","All right, so of the 8 we have -- I don\u2019t know if we have all the detail right now. I think it\u2019s similar -- similar is what my experts are telling me. Okay, very good.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. And then just curious, you alluded to everyone [Indiscernible], I think performance is good. It feels to me that this is a really good backdrop for that product. Has it gone into positive flows and do you think we\u2019re turning the corner and get positive flows just globally?","Loren Starr","The [Indiscernible] has gone positive in the second quarter, but that was -- it was largely institutionally driven. Retail has significantly improved, so it\u2019s just very modestly in an outflow. So, I\u2019d say both on the retail and institutional side, very good sort of indication of this product. Sort of the better position now than we than it has in the past given the very strong performance.","Glenn Schorr","Great. And just and one more follow-up, Loren if I could. The -- in the prepared remarks, you mentioned a bunch of things that are -- I wouldn\u2019t call turning the corner, but just things that are just doing well in general outside of maybe active equity or parts of active equity. So, is the 3% to 5% organic growth rate still cool? Can it happen without U.S. equities? I mean it looks like it can given everything else that\u2019s working. I just want to get that straight.","Loren Starr","I mean we think it\u2019s -- I mean that 3% to 5%, obviously, is what we think we can do over time. It\u2019s been sort of more of a benchmark. I think for this year, we would like to see us at least enter that range.","But given obviously what\u2019s going on in Europe, it\u2019s been a little bit of an unusual situation. So, I don\u2019t want to sort of promise flaws because that\u2019s always -- that\u2019s probably even harder than the promising performance fees.","But we -- everything we say in terms of the institutional pipeline growing the fact that we have -- certain parts are business, particularly Asia is absolutely strong both on the retail and the institutional side. We see power shares hitting new records or close to records on flows. I think it's certainly reasonable for us to think that we could sort of get close to that 3% at a minimum.","Glenn Schorr","All right. Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Line is now open.","Andrew Nicholas","Hi, this is actually Andrew Nicholas filling in for Chris. My first question is on GTR. Obviously, you\u2019ve had exceptional performance there across all time periods, particularly on a year-to-date basis and with respect to some of the strategies, largest peers. I was just curious if you could provide some color on how that pipeline is looking and that asset class as a whole?","Loren Starr","So, I think the GTR pipeline is certainly featuring in a lot of the growth in a pipeline generally. That\u2019s the one that\u2019s you know probably up more than 20% quarter-over-quarter. So, it\u2019s just one that continues to be seen.","I think it also with respect to some of the continuing products that it\u2019s sort of distancing itself even further, relative to other products. So, it had the ability to grow far beyond its current level, we would expect. And certainly is looked at I think and reviewed in the U.S. by consultants and then taken on as well.","So, that\u2019s the important component of getting that completed for us to really fulfill, ultimately I think what could be the full potential as well as on the retail side in the U.S. where I think it\u2019s about 0.5 billion or maybe a little less, only 300 million or something like that. But it hasn\u2019t really been launched fully and it hasn\u2019t hit its two-year track record yet and so once it does that I think it\u2019s really going to have an opportunity to do a whole lot more than what we\u2019ve seen in the U.S.","Andrew Nicholas","Great. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful color. And then on the DOL rule. I think general expectations are that the rule will drive flows to products that either have lower fees, very strong relative performance and\/or a combination of both. I\u2019m just wondering if you have any thoughts on which of those two factors will play a bigger role in driving flows in a post-DOL world and how you think your product suite is positioned to compete on each front.","Martin Flanagan","So, our view is this is that it's by less simple than your perspective. What our financial advisors are trying to do, they\u2019re trying to generate excess returns, risk adjusted returns over time and you cannot get there with cap weighted indexes. And so it really is a combination of high [Indiscernible] fundamental, good performing active as you\u2019re describing in combination with passive and where we think the combination is, is in smart data.","And when you combine those together you get an overall -- the total cost is less and so that\u2019s why this element of being strong in solutions really matters for an organization. So, we just look at the position of the firm and having the whole range of capabilities and the ability to help with solutions and that\u2019s at a retail level, we take our position very well. I think the firms that are disadvantaged are those that are very, very narrow in scope and clearly, if you\u2019re a high class, narrow in scope, moderately performing organization, you\u2019re in trouble.","Andrew Nicholas","Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Line is now open.","Chris Harris","Thanks. Hey, guys. Hey, so a few quick questions on your U.K. pound hedge. Obviously, this position is significantly in the money. Regarding the accounting of that, is that a mark-to-market methodology or are we going to see gains as you start exercising that position? And then part two of the question is, given where the pound is today, how big of a step down in income can we expect when you have to roll that hedge?","Loren Starr","So, I mean in terms of the U.S. GAAP, it\u2019s mark-to-market and then that\u2019s -- you\u2019re going to see that flowing through the P&L and you are seeing it flowing through the U.S. GAAP P&L currently. In terms of our non-GAAP disclosure, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve backed out that mark-to-market and we are only bringing in what has been actually realized. And so this quarter that was a very small amount of money in terms of the impact.","For the next couple of quarters, just based on the current rate, that\u2019s probably close to a penny EPS for each of the quarters going forward. So, in terms of what we would do if we were going to roll it, because we have it out through the Q1, I think we\u2019re going to be patient and think about whether we need to or want to.","But I, obviously, again have to look at the cost first to sort of lock-in right now at current rates, or a discount to current rates because we\u2019ve been using out of the money puts. I\u2019m not sure if anybody would be too excited about a hedge 1.25 or something like that.","So, it is something that we\u2019re going to continue to look at and evaluate as to whether we continue to roll this thing. But certainly we\u2019re going to hold on to what we\u2019ve got right now and continue to benefit at least from a cash flow and EPS perspective from the protections provided.","Chris Harris","Great, okay. Thanks for clarifying that. And then a quick follow-up on comp. It sounds like there are a few discreet items that impacted the number this quarter. How should we be thinking about comp in the back half of the year? And I apologize if you addressed this in the comments earlier.","Loren Starr","No, I think it\u2019s going to be roughly flat to current levels, so I think that\u2019s the way you can think about it, sort of flat. There\u2019s a little fluctuation here and there, but generally flat.","Chris Harris","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Line is now open.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate all the color from Brexit and the kind of commentary around flows thus far. I guess, is there any kind of negatives fall-out that you\u2019re seeing institutionally or certain regions whether you actually are seeing maybe some changes more to the negative that might be longer term or has it generally been kind of consistent across the board?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, I mean, it really has been consistent. And as I said, in the -- and let me make sure, this is in response to sort of the Brexit impact. Is that right?","Dan Fannon","Correct.","Martin Flanagan","Yeah. I mean, no, I mean it really did unleash, in particular, in the U.K. and on the Continent, people decided to move forward with the -- their intention to fund different institutional capabilities.","And then if you -- as Loren said, if you just go to Asia-Pac right now, it\u2019s just very strong for us. And so there really has not been any impact that you could tie to that event or other uncertainty in the world. In fact, for us, much differently than that, it just the pipeline as we keep saying, it just keeps getting stronger and stronger and -- so, no we\u2019ve not seen that.","Loren Starr","The only thing that I\u2019d say is probably around the DOL, there\u2019s probably more question marks just generally.","Martin Flanagan","Yes.","Loren Starr","And I think it was so the comment that was made are people -- certain clients going to sort of gravitate to using exclusively low fee product as opposed to active product and so whether insurance companies or others may choose to do something like that in the future, unclear. But if it happens, it happens obviously to industry-wide. As we said, I think we\u2019re well-positioned to operate in that world as we do have low fee tax deposits.","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, but I would add though is that what is happening is the financial advisors want to generate excess returns -- adjusted excess returns that you just can\u2019t get in cap weighted indexes and so active is here to stay. And if you\u2019re good investor, you\u2019re going to do well.","Dan Fannon","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, and I guess wondering if there has been any benefits from the Rhode Island win that you can talk about as that\u2019s been helping your pipeline or if that\u2019s kind of raised the profile for your firm within that channel and if there\u2019s been any benefits.","Martin Flanagan","There\u2019s no question it raised the profile and it is helping very much and as I said, we\u2019re actually, it\u2019s a two different levels the solutions element, it\u2019s starting to kick in. Frankly, you would imagine, but it -- at the retail level and also in Asia-Pac, there is actually, Mainland China in particular just really growing opportunity. So, again, we\u2019d say its early days for us in that area, but again, we feel a very, very strong capability and there\u2019s an awful lot of activity around it.","Dan Fannon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Robert Lee of KBW. Line is now open.","Robert Lee","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Martin Flanagan","Good morning.","Robert Lee","I guess my first question is just maybe any update you may have or thoughts you have around the -- obviously the SEC\u2019s proposed different liquidity rules on 40 Act products and certainly that impact, ETFs. And I know you\u2019ve talked about this in the past, Marty, but current thoughts as maybe you\u2019ve been part of any interaction with the SEC on kind of what\u2019s likely.","And given the explosive growth in smart data, ETF products and other products, do you think it -- there\u2019s any risk that it kind of inhibits some of the -- and then liquid Alts to some of the strategies that you\u2019re running out there?","Martin Flanagan","I get if -- so, how is smart data inhibiting some of the strategies we\u2019re running to this -- can you help me?","Robert Lee","Well, I meant just that if you have different liquidity or derivative requirements and different strategies, as proposed, is that going to inhibit how you run things?","Martin Flanagan","Got you. Yeah, so, look as we said in the past and I think we all just saw it, so anticipate something coming out of the liquidity rule. The involvement that the industry has had is that we think there\u2019s going to be a commonsensical outcome, which would be a good thing. And if that is the case I -- it\u2019s going to be quite frankly an awful lot of work, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s very manageable for the industry.","The derivatives rule, again, it\u2019s -- it is I would say the first notion of it was -- it would\u2019ve gotten in the way of a number of products for the industry and in particular, for us at a retail level, GTR probably would\u2019ve been very, very challenged in the proposed rules.","We\u2019re sensing that we\u2019re going to end up with a better outcome, which will not get in the way of a number of our products. I don\u2019t want to be so definitive yet because it\u2019s not there. But I\u2019d say very good progress and being very thoughtful on really trying to help the SEC get to what they need and so the dialogue has been constructive. And so again I -- we\u2019ll see what ultimately comes out, but at the moment I\u2019d say it\u2019s trending to a commonsensical good, thoughtful outcomes on both levels.","Robert Lee","And great, and maybe sticking with the regulatory theme, I mean, the business that we never really talk about is your money fund business. But come October you've got changes taking effect, the -- you have predominantly an institution business there.","So can you maybe -- any update on how you think come October any sense of how clients are going to you know behave? I mean, obviously, you've seen prime to govi kind of movement anyway within the industry. But any concerns that that\u2019s going to -- I don't know, shrink that business and then in that context any rethinking of its strategic positioning within Invesco?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, good question. So, you\u2019ve already seen the number of money fund providers have over the last couple of years. You\u2019re probably going to see it again. And it\u2019s going to be a smaller number of firms that are committed to and successful in that area.","So, we\u2019re actively committed to it. We\u2019ve done a bunch of work on the product line-up and you\u2019re going to see us, I think -- you\u2019re going to see the -- a very strong part of our business in growing and that, I think just in July there\u2019s been $4 billion of money fund in-flows already. So, yes we\u2019re anticipating that it\u2019s going to be a stronger part of our business going forward.","Robert Lee","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Line is now open.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks very much. Hey, Marty, just to start-off with a question on the smart data franchise, obviously, you\u2019ve have a good you know relatively good first mover advantage in that. But as you do see more competition coming in to that market given the attractiveness of the product, what kind of steps are you taking to leverage that first mover advantage? And talk about to what extent you see that improving within DOL and can you leverage the -- I guess traction and leveraging the Jemstep platform with that as well.","Martin Flanagan","Good question. So, we look at smart data as a subset of factor investing and again, I think very importantly I\u2019m repeating myself, but we\u2019re one of very few firms that have a factor-based capability that\u2019s been in business 35 years and the fundamental investing that we have.","And so that combination of those around the world for us that put us in a unique position. So factor investing outside of the United States is much more an institutional business and it\u2019s growing in demand, both in the Continent and Loren mentioned that we\u2019re looking -- doing some things in the U.K. at the retail level. Actually, there and Asia-Pac is actually growing in demand.","In the United States, it tends to be a retail focus and expressed as smart data through ETFs. And where we look at our strategic positioning and I think very importantly, then differently than a mutual fund where you can have 200 of the same XYZ funds competing it\u2019s very hard to see beyond really three ETFs of sort of the same color would be successful just because of the nature of the ETF with market makers and the like.","So, first mover advantage matters a lot. The other thing that really matters, too, is the longevity of, so think length of track record. And if you look at the power shares line-up of smart data, any number of funds are 10 years old.","And so when people are looking to invest or looking at the length of capability also look at the liquidity within it. And so those are very different dynamics than you would have with a mutual fund. So, the good news is people are coming in so it sort of -- it confirms the attractiveness of smart data.","That said, it\u2019s going to -- it\u2019s a very, very competitive space to enter into to say nothing of how do you work in conjunction with active management within your organization. So, we think we\u2019re in a pretty good position.","Loren Starr","I think, again, like any -- like you\u2019d imagine, I mean if we continue to launch very innovative and products in advance of competitors, so that\u2019s also part of our strategy is making sure that we have that first mover advantage. And just given the depth of our team and our connection to our clients, I think we\u2019re achieving that quite well.","Brian Bedell","And is Jemstep part of this process. Is that maybe just an outlook for the new term or intermediate term horizon for the traction there?","Martin Flanagan","It\u2019s a good question. I'm sorry. So, yes, still early days with Jemstep. It\u2019s proving to be a very constructive addition to the firm. It is an application so the -- if you want to call it the sales cycle is longer. There is a tremendous amount of interest in it and I think you said it right; it\u2019s sort of looking into mid next year that type of thing before you start to see an impact.","But again, it\u2019s very much positioned to be helpful to our clients, not competing with our clients. So, it is direct-to-consumer and it is -- as I said earlier, it is -- we\u2019re having deeper conversations with clients because of the capability that we have to help enable them deal with the range of things that they\u2019re dealing with coming through DOL and the like.","Brian Bedell","Great. And then, just lastly Marty, maybe just your perspective on this rising speculation of consolidation and the asset management industry broadly if active management continues to underperform and products need to be rationalized. Maybe just to review on whether you think that that will happen? And then to what extent you think you may participate either in acquisitions or even combining with other firms?","Martin Flanagan","So, I\u2019ve not been in the industry for quite a long time. And it\u2019s been declared to consolidate for every five years it seems it really hasn\u2019t for various reasons that we all know. I would be in a camp consistent with others that it does seem very different this time and I -- one of it -- you could look at it as a maturing industry. But you talk about active management. My view is you go in cycles and we\u2019ve had this beta run from 2009 on with government intervention, which aligned the stars for cap weighted indexes, that\u2019s not sustainable.","So, I think that\u2019s been overdone. That said it\u2019s here to stay. I think you\u2019re going to see greater growth of factor investing as we said. But active management you\u2019ll actually -- it will thrive. I think those individuals that are calling it dead asset class are making a mistake.","So, that said, I think the other element that\u2019s really driving the notion of consolidation. It\u2019s the regulatory landscape; it is so costly to keep up with all of these, to say nothing of Cyberspace. So, its rising cost in a competitive environment and I think those are the dynamics that are going to you know also be changing -- be forces to drive consolidation.","And luckily we\u2019re fortunate enough to be positioned extremely well. As we\u2019ve just been talking about on this call. I\u2019d say the business here has never been stronger. It\u2019s seemingly getting all engines are kicking in quite nicely and matched against the trends that are in place and I think that people that try to catch up with the trends, it\u2019s going to be very hard. You need to have started three years ago, five years ago, seven years ago, honestly.","That said, we don\u2019t see a lot of gaps, but we will continue to pay attention to the marketplace, as we have in that past, selectively as things can -- if we can become a stronger organization by teaming up with another organization, we\u2019ll continue to do that. That\u2019s said, that\u2019s not our focus right now.","Brian Bedell","Great. That\u2019s great color. Thank you so much.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Line is now open.","Michael Carrier","All right, thanks guys. Hey, Loren, just two quick follow-ups. One is, just on the management fee you mentioned on the net basis given RDR, that that that\u2019s kind of shifting. I just wanted to get a sense on timing, meaning how much of that\u2019s played out verses how long we can expect to see that?","And then I don\u2019t think you mentioned it, maybe just because there\u2019s no real clarity right now, but sometimes you give a little color on the performance fees in terms of the outlook. So, just any color there.","Loren Starr","So I think the RDR impact is going to be largely completed by the end of this year. That would be my guess. So, you can expect that to be completely sort of played out. In terms of performance fees, you\u2019re right; I don\u2019t have you know full clarity. I think I would still say sort of roughly $5 million a quarter and for the other revenues, which is another element I think sort of again hanging roughly around $30 million a quarter is the right way to think about it.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Loren Starr","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Line is now open.","Michael Cyprys","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the next phase in evolution of ETFs as a wrapper, particularly active ETF, both on the non-transparent side, which I think so far only make sure it has approval from the SEC. But also if more can be done on the transparent active ETF side as well.","Martin Flanagan","So, we\u2019re one of the first firms to have exemptive relief or active ETFs and we launched them, I\u2019m going to say, in 2007, two of them. And I think what\u2019s in them is basically our C capital. So, there\u2019s a lot of conversation about active ETFs. They just really have not taken off.","So, we have the capability to do it. We keep analyzing it. We\u2019ve just not seen that as a big -- lot of demand for it. Now, if you read the papers, you would think that\u2019s all that anybody cares about, so that\u2019s been our experience, so maybe we just have it wrong but that\u2019s our experience.","With regards to different wrappers, I -- the -- if you look at net shares, it\u2019s interesting, but it can be 100% achieved by a share class and a mutual fund. If you use an R6 share class, you get the exact outcome via without the challenge of -- a different vehicle trying to get launched within a channel. And although it\u2019s creative, I think that\u2019s been the head wind for it.","So, it could ultimately be successful, but again I think there\u2019s an easier way to get there. And you really need to do it in conjunction with your clients, i.e., think distribution partners. So, things will continue to evolve.","I personally think the area that will continue to grow the most for IB, most additive is smart data because it is -- you get better outcomes with smart data than you do with cap-weighted indexes. So, I think that\u2019s really going to be where the gravitational pull is when you look at these ranges of capabilities that you just highlighted. So, that\u2019s our view. We could be wrong, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking right now.","Michael Cyprys","Okay. Thanks. And then just coming back to the flow side, active flow was a bit soft in the quarter. I know you mentioned meaningful redemption there, but if we just look at the gross sales, that\u2019s been just a bit weak. So, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about reaccelerating the pace of gross sales on the active side, what sort of strategies or actions can you take, whether it\u2019s with distribution partners or with investments in sales teams and so forth?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, look, the reality is we\u2019re still in an uncertain market. If you just play back the year, look at January, February, what happened -- you look around at what\u2019s happened with Brexit and the knock on, that tends to be the big driver.","If you look within our flows, we\u2019ve had tremendous flows in U.S. dividend stocks, which is consistent with this sort of -- I want yield, I want some growth, but I\u2019m somewhat concerned about the environment.","If you look at the value capabilities, I feel really good about the teams and how their managing, what tends to be in those are you know energy and financials, which had been hurt again in the volatility.","So, my basic view is that you continue to ensure that you have high quality teams that can deliver over a market cycle and I think that\u2019s really the important thing. You can\u2019t look quarter-to-quarter or year-by-year calendars don\u2019t matter, market cycles matter. And you\u2019re going to get excess returns with strong active management and I think when the psychological environment moves, I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re really going to see the gross -- the net flow has actually pick up in those active capabilities. So, again, I think you have to segment them to the different styles. I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving it right now.","Michael Cyprys","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that\u2019s the last question in queue.","Martin Flanagan","Well, thank you very much. On behalf of Loren and myself, I appreciate the engagement and the questions and we\u2019ll be speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s conference.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Thank you very much; and thank you, everybody for joining us. And if you're so inclined, you can follow along the presentation, which is on our website. And as has been our practice, I'll hit some of the highlights of the business during the first quarter; Loren will go into greater details within the financials of the quarter; I will then spend a few minutes really talking about some of the key differentiators of our strategy and put that in the context of growth opportunities; and then, of course, we'll open up to Q&A.","So, let me begin by highlighting the operating results for the first quarter, and that's on page 4 if you happen to be following along. Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter. We had net inflows of $300 million during the quarter. We did see the impact of market volatility, impacting investor behavior, which impacted net flows during the quarter negatively.","Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 37.3% versus 39.6% in the prior quarter. We did return $120 million to shareholders through dividends during the quarter. And reflecting the strength of the business and the focus on providing returns to shareholders, we are increasing the quarterly dividend to $0.30, which is a 3.4% increase.","Turning to page 5. You'll note the investment performance continues to be strong in a three and five-year basis, 68% and 70%, respectively. And although the long-term investment performance remained strong, we did see headwinds in one-year numbers, the short-term numbers being impacted by some relative underperformance in some of the larger strategies in the U.S. and the UK.","Turning to flows. What we did see is quite a bit of demand for our passive capabilities, and which is very robust, with particular strength in our commodity ETFs, both in Europe and the United States during the quarter. On the active side, and in our retail business, the flow environment remained somewhat challenged with the uptick in volatility, which I mentioned, in particular, in the U.S. and UK equities, as well as outflows from our sub-advised REIT in Japan. As an offset, we did see strong institutional demand and solid flows in areas such as stable value, Global Targeted Return and a number of our quantitative strategies globally.","With that, as a summary, let me turn it to Loren and have him go to more detail in the financial results.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Thanks very much, Marty. So, quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $3.4 billion or 0.4%. That was driven by market losses of $12.2 billion. We saw outflows from non-management fee earning AUM of $0.4 billion. These factors were somewhat offset by a positive foreign exchange of $7.9 billion. We saw our reinvested distributions of $0.6 billion positive. Inflows into our institutional money market products came in at $0.4 billion; and then, we had long-term net inflows of $0.3 billion. Our average AUM for the first quarter was $951.3 billion. That was up 2.3% versus Q4. Our annualized long-term organic growth rate for the quarter was 0.2 percentage points compared to negative 0.8 percentage points in the fourth quarter.","So, before turning to net revenue yield, I just wanted to provide a quick update on a change this quarter to our presentation of AUM in response to investor feedback and to provide greater transparency into the composition of changes in our AUM. We reverted to our historical presentation of sales-driven long-term flows and presented reinvested distributions on a separate line item in our AUM tables. So, you will see that in the back. We have also restated the third and fourth quarter of 2017 to allow for a consistent presentation and comparability.","So, now, let's turn to the net revenue yield discussion. Our net revenue yield came in at 40.3 basis points; and our net revenue yield excluding performance fees was 39.9 basis points. And that was a decrease of 1.4 basis points versus Q4. We saw two fewer days in the quarter. That reduced the yield by 0.9 basis points. The impact in the change in asset mix, and the growth, we saw a non-fee earning AUM reduce the yield by 0.7 basis points. And we also saw an impact of the new revenue recognition standard, which I'll mention a little bit later. And that reduced the yield by 0.2 basis points. And then we saw also a decrease in other revenues, reducing the yield by 0.1 basis points. So, all these factors were then somewhat offset by positive foreign exchange impact on the mix, which added 0.5 basis points. So, a lot of puts and takes there.","Anyway, given the changes discussed above, and the continuation of changes in our asset mix, and our focus on strategically pricing our products remain competitively positioned with new and existing clients, we expect our net revenue yield for the remainder of 2018 to come in at approximately 40 basis points, which is about 1 basis point less than our original guidance. And again, this guidance assumes flat markets and foreign exchange from today's level.","Slide 9 provides our U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter as is customary.","My comments today will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which you'll find on slide 10.","And before returning to these results, I just want to quickly touch on the impact of this new revenue recognition accounting standard that impacted our revenues and expenses. So, overall, this new reporting standard has changed the way we present certain revenue and fund-related expenses and has an impact on many of our revenue line items. The method we elected to adopt this guidance did not require us to restate prior periods. Our Q1 2018 results are presented under the new guidance, but the Q4 2017 numbers are presented under the old guidance. So, that will impact the variances quarter-over-quarter, as we'll discuss.","We have included in the appendix a slide that shows the line item impact that the new standard has on our revenues and expenses for the first quarter of 2018. And as you'll note, the revenue recognition changes have reduced gross revenues by $19.6 million. However, the overall impact to our operating income margin and net revenues are immaterial.","So, let's now get to the non-GAAP operating results on slide 10. You'll see that net revenue decreased by $46.9 million or 4.7% quarter-over-quarter to $958 million, which includes a positive foreign exchange impact of $16 million. The impact of revenue recognition reduced net revenues by $4.2 million. So, excluding these impacts, net revenue decreased $58.7 million, and let's get into the variance there.","So, within that number you'll see that adjusted investment management fees decreased by $52.4 million or 4.7% to $1.07 billion. The impact of revenue rec reduced adjusted investment management fees by $53.8 million. FX increased these fees by $16.8 million. And so, excluding these two changes, our adjusted investment management fees decreased by $15.4 million quarter-over-quarter, which primarily reflects two fewer days in the quarter, which was partially offset by higher average AUM.","Our adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $28.6 million or 13.1%. Compared to Q4, the impact of revenue recognition increased adjusted service and distribution revenues by $32.4 million. Excluding these changes, our adjusted service and distribution revenues decreased by $3.8 million, which primarily reflects fewer days in the quarter.","Adjusted performance fees came in at $9.1 million in Q1 and were primarily earned from real estate, U.K. equity, and bank loans products. The $34.2 million decline from the fourth quarter was driven by the large real estate performance fee recognized in the prior quarter. Adjusted other revenues in the quarter came in at $58.1 million, an increase of $39.7 million from the prior quarter. The impact of revenue recognition changes increased adjusted other revenues by $41 million. Excluding that change, our adjusted other revenues decreased modestly by $1.3 million.","Next, adjusted third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, that increased $20.6 million or 7.3%. So, the impact of revenue recognition changes increased. Our adjusted third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $23.8 million. Foreign exchange increased adjusted third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $1.3 million. Excluding these two changes, our adjusted third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $3.5 million largely driven by some non-recurring reductions in third-party expense, which were recognized in the prior quarter.","So, now, let's move to expenses. Overall, moving down, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $600.7 million decreased by $6.7 million or 1.1%. Relative to Q4, the impact of revenue recognition reduced our adjusted operating expenses by $4.2 million. FX increased adjusted operating expenses by $8.8 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenue recognition and FX, our adjusted operating expenses decreased by $11.3 million.","Looking to the adjusted employee comp number that came in at $389.5 million, that was an increase of $11.5 million or 3%. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted compensation expense by $5.5 million. Excluding FX, adjusted employee comp increased $6 million, which reflects seasonal payroll taxes, as well as employee benefit costs, which was partially offset by decreases in our variable compensation costs.","Our adjusted marketing expenses in Q1 decreased by $11.1 million or 27.9% to $28.7 million, reflecting again a seasonal decrease from Q4 related client events and marketing campaigns. Our adjusted property, office and tech expense came in at $101.3 million. That was an increase of $0.5 million or 0.5% over the fourth quarter. That was in line with the guidance that we provided last quarter. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted property, office and tech expense by $1.2 million.","Next, going onto the adjusted G&A expense. That came in at $81.2 million. That was a decrease of $7.6 million or 8.6% quarter-over-quarter. The impact of revenue recognition reduced our adjusted G&A expenses by $4.2 million. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted G&A expense by $1.6 million. Excluding these two points, our adjusted G&A expenses decreased $5 million, and that decrease reflects lower legal and regulatory costs, reduced irrecoverable taxes in the quarter, lower travel costs during the quarter, while MiFID II costs were in line with expected levels in this quarter. And then, of course, they were not there in the prior quarter.","Our adjusted non-operating income decreased $23.1 million compared to the fourth quarter, reflecting the difference in mark-to-market of our seed money investments compared with the prior quarter. The firm's effective tax rate on pre-adjusted net income in Q1 was 20.6%, in line with guidance. And that provides us with our adjusted EPS of $0.67 and adjusted net operating margin of 37.3%.","So, before turning over to Marty, I just want to touch on a few topics. First, long-term flows in April. Overall, the flow picture has been a bit volatile with good growth opportunities, but we have also seen a spike-up in redemptions. Through the month of April, we have experienced net outflows in the current month of approximately $3.5 billion. That was driven largely by a single sovereign wealth-related outflow and as well as a sub-advised mandate that outflowed. It's not great news, but certainly, we don't expect that trend to continue through the quarter.","On capital management, certainly something we want to touch on for 2018 now that we've completed the acquisition of the Guggenheim ETF business. The transaction was completed in early April. We funded it with a combination of approximately 30% cash and 70% borrowing on our short-term credit facility. As previously noted, our goal is to pay down the balance of that credit facility over the course of 2018 to bring our leverage ratios back in line with pre-acquisition levels. And after our leverage ratios are reduced to these levels that we should return to a share buyback that's consistent with our historical practice. And our current estimate is that will occur sometime in the fourth quarter.","Let's move on to a topic we're all near and dear, is organic growth. So, I really want to talk about what to expect through the remainder of 2018 and then looking into 2019. The chart on slide 11 shows the composition of our flows over the last nine years. And I think it helps to explain why the diversification of our business is actually significantly benefiting us. Each region, you'll see, has been the largest annual flow contributor at some point during the last nine years. And the firm's diversification has helped to drive overall positive organic growth in each period. We see that diversifying our capabilities and our offerings in each region where we operate certainly allows us to better serve our clients and makes us stronger by not being overly reliant on any one geography, distribution channel, or asset class.","Next, just turning \u2013 slide 12, this is a slide you've seen before. Looks at the relationship between organic growth and the consistency or variability of that growth for Invesco and its public asset management peers. On the vertical axis is the average annual organic growth rate for the five-year period 2013 through 2017. And then on the horizontal axis is the standard deviation of those flows to reflect the level of sustainability or variability of the organic growth.","So, when viewing Invesco against this group, it's evident that our diversification is benefiting us. Invesco has one of the lowest standard deviations of flows in the group, and it reflects a high level of flow consistency. We've previously talked about the long-term target, however, of the 3% to 5% organic growth. And we'll cover that in more detail today in the areas that will drive that growth.","But looking at the remainder of 2018, and given the overall volatility of markets, and given some performance challenges we (00:17:40) larger products, which have been completely a function of the market environment we've been in, realistically, we think our growth rate will continue to be around historic levels that we've seen for this year. But looking past 2018, however, as many of the critical investments we're making in the business start to gain traction, and as we generate increased flows, we believe that organic growth can move into that targeted 3% to 5% range that we had discussed with you in the past.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over back to Marty, who will actually cover some of these growth areas in greater detail.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Thank you, Loren. And I'm on page 14, again, if you're so inclined to follow along. And so, I did want to pick up on our strategy and put in the context of the opportunities and competitive advantages that we believe we are creating.","A number of you have been owners of the company for many years and following it for many years, so the foundational elements of the company are well-understood. I'd also say the key strengths are well understood. What is less understood is really four of the key growth drivers that we really think are improving our competitive position in a meaningful way. And I'm going to spend a few minutes on them today. So, ETFs being one; factors being the second; solutions; and finally, digital advice, which includes Jemstep.","So, building these growth drivers continues to be a primary focus of our organization. And we really think it is improving our competitive advantage, which will lead to greater growth opportunities. And it's the combination of our comprehensive range of investment capabilities, our global presence, our focus in both retail and institutional channel that differentiates us in the market and positions us for growth and success over the long-term.","So, over the next few slides, I'm going to just spend a minute on each one of these growth drivers, but importantly, show you how they come together, and that is really what creates a competitive advantage. Any firm might have one of these growth drivers; very few firms have all four of them. And the ability to put them together is really what creates the greatest opportunity in our mind.","So, turning to page 15, turning to ETFs. Over the past year, we've meaningfully expanded our ETF business, which ranks as the fourth largest in the U.S. and globally. And in total, our ETF business has grown sixtyfold over the past 12 years. We know, and you know, being first to market has a clear advantage in the ETF space. We now have more than 50 funds, with assets greater than $500 million. We noted earlier in the year that we are moving to a single brand, Invesco, throughout the organization globally. And this is really going to enable us to strengthen our brand positioning and consolidate our marketing spend behind the growth drivers, which we think will actually be meaningful over time.","We've been a pioneer of smart beta since 2003, and now rank as number second in market share in smart beta and assets under management globally, trailing the market leader by only $9 billion. With regard to this market share, the delta is less than 3 percentage points between ourselves and the number one position.","Turning to factors on page 17. Our aspiration is to be a global market leader in factor investing, leveraging our significant expertise and experience, as well as our strong investment capabilities across both the retail and institutional channels. The existing and long-term market potential for factor investing is quite significant, in our opinion. However, as we have noted previously, saying you can do factor investing and actually delivering are not the same thing. You really need to develop and maintain special skills and the expertise to deliver the results that client expect from these capabilities. As importantly, you need to have the infrastructure and resources to educate financial advisors, RIAs, partner with institutions and others on how to use these capabilities appropriately within portfolios. And our focus on education is helping us deepen our relationship with platforms and key institutional clients, while also, over time, will broaden the market opportunity for us.","Invesco has more than 40 years of experience in factor investing across a variety of investment teams, which has helped us build a solid foundation of client relationships and assets under management. We are intensely focused on executing an integrated global plan for factor investing that encompasses client needs, analysis, product development, and further expansion of our considerable expertise in this market.","Turning to solutions on page 19. Our solutions capability is both a growth driver and an enabler within our business, as we continue to build out this important capability to help us better meet client needs and strengthen our competitive advantage. Our ability to design, implement and manage custom portfolios, investment solutions, leveraging our comprehensive range of investment capabilities is helping us enhance relationship with advisors and clients and strengthen product innovation. And I do want to make the point, you cannot be a credible solutions provider if you don't have the broad, deep set of investment capabilities which we have. Our Solutions team also supports our Distribution teams with investment and analytical expertise that helps them better partner with clients and deepen relationships.","With our broad range of investment capabilities and vehicles, Invesco is one of very \u2013 a small number of firms that can truly be product-agnostic in developing outcome-oriented solutions to meet client needs. To build on this competitive advantage over the past years, we developed one of the strongest most experienced solutions team in the industry. The team is entirely focused on helping clients meet their investment objectives.","Turning to digital advice. We are very much in the process of developing the full potential of our digital advice platform, Jemstep. Our position as one of the first digital solutions in the market for advisors and our focus on providing an open architecture platform are enabling us to build this capability meaningfully.","As you can see on slide 21, we are live with a major bank in the U.S., as well as 20 smaller clients. We're onboarding two additional major banks, as we speak and a leading insurer during this year also. We're strongly positioned to be a market leader provider with banks and credit unions and are seeing solid emerging demand in the RIA channel. Our focus in 2018 and beyond is to extend this capability globally. A key advantage of our digital advice effort is it gives us access to much broader range of clients, while also providing opportunity to expand our distribution of our investment capabilities. So, we are currently pursuing impactful combinations of these key capabilities that will unlock disproportionate opportunities for Invesco by allowing us to serve key markets in new ways.","And here's an example on page 22, if you're so inclined to follow. We're currently onboarding a firm with a network of more than 200 banks and credit unions. They selected Jemstep as their digital advice partner to deploy across the network. They selected our solutions team as a strategist for creating portfolios tailored to meet their client needs. Our ETFs are being used as the underpin for small account portfolios on a network. And lastly, Invesco Consulting, which works alongside the Distribution teams, will provide education and support to drive the adoption of the platforms. And it's our ability to bring these capabilities together to meet client needs in key markets and channels that's really a powerful differentiator and will help us grow our business in the future. This approach provides meaningful benefits to clients and helps us create new relationships and deepen the current relationships that we have.","For 2018, our focus is on bringing together combinations of our growth drivers and our investment capabilities in a seamless and effective manner. This approach will enable us to focus the power of our global platform to help meet client needs and drive growth. So, some examples of the power of the integration of these different capabilities on our platform include: a combination of three regional institutional business with our solutions capability, which would enable us to become a leader in addressing the $30 trillion institutional market globally; bringing together multi-sector, our Asian institutional business, factor investing and solution, which would help us further penetrate the institutional market by bringing together the best of Invesco in solutions, factor investing and multi-sector capabilities; and finally, a combination of factor investing, digital advice, ETFs in the EMEA retail market, which would enable us to grow our UK digital advice business, with independent financial advisors and platforms by using next-generation individualized products, which is an emerging need in that marketplace.","So, as I mentioned at the outset, it's really the combination of our comprehensive range of investment capabilities, our global presence, our focus on both the retail and institutional channel that differentiates us in the marketplace and positions us for growth and success over the long term. We are truly excited about the potential for the growth opportunities that these key factors and capabilities bring to the organization and to our clients. And we'll continue to update you as we make progress along.","And with that, we'll stop; and Loren and I will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Okay. The first question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Loren, maybe first one, just on the expense line items, I guess, just curious, given some of the moves, any update on how we should be thinking about 2018 relative to like the guidance that you gave on the last call, just whether it's by line item or just overall how we should be thinking about the expense?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. Good question. So, we would expect the guidance to be, I mean, largely intact except for compensation is going to flex down in the sense that revenues are down, competition flexes down, too. So, without getting too explicit, I think we'll see where that goes. But it's probably some $10 million less than we had guided previously. So, you're in more like the $400 million to $405 million per quarter range going through 2018. So, that's one change to the guidance in theory.","And then, the other one would be G&A, which has the revenue recognition impact. So, $4.2 million has moved from G&A up to the revenue line items. And so, that would be a reduction of G&A by $4.2 million. So, those would be the two I'd point you to. Obviously, we will continue to look at trying to be more effective and efficient with our resources. And it really will depend on what sort of market environment we're going to end up in. It's been rather volatile. But certainly, people should understand that we are all currently flexed down comp in light of lower revenues.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks. And then just a follow-up, Marty. I think you pointed out a lot that the investments being made, and you have a lot of the products that when we look at where the demand is you're seeing in the industry. Just as you think about transitioning from, say, 2018 to 2019 and beyond, Loren mentioned, you're sort of getting to that 3% to 5% new growth rate. Like how should we be thinking about what it means to whether it's like the fee rate and revenue growth in the next couple of years, and then also, like the incremental margins? So, trying to translate a lot of the investments in the strategic impact, and ultimately, to the financials longer term.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So, look, we look at these with a high conviction that this is where any of the market is going. And again, just like many of us, just traveling world, being in Asia, being in EMEA, and obviously, in the United States, the time spent with the clients, more and more, is very clear to me that clients and platforms are dealing with fewer firms. Having strong investment capabilities is very important, but reality, I'd say, going forward, it's table stakes. And the greater traction that we're seeing is the broader range of capabilities that we have the, the engagements with solutions, and even large sophisticated institutions looking for us to partner with them with analytical tools, even though they have those capabilities, it's really a very different mindset that is emerging. And so, we see that those are the things that are going to continue to provide growth.","So, the overall effect of fee rate though, I really put in the context is it's really going to be driven by where the clients are building their portfolios. And as we are moving much more towards growing the factor capability in ETFs, the relative fee rate is lower than alternatives or high conviction active, and so, the blend's really going to depend on where clients go. So, I can't give you a specific answer to where the fee rate goes, but what I do know the growth and profitability will continue to be \u2013 enhances our growth and earnings as we go forward.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. And, Mike, I think in terms of incremental margins, I mean, certainly for this year, we're probably still in the range that we've been talking about historically for this year, that sort of 40% to 50% incremental margin. Longer term, I don't think anybody sort of said we're changing the long-term view being closer to that 50% to 65%. Obviously, we will continue to sort of see how the market is shifting and changing. But certainly, what we're doing is we're trying to build scale in our capabilities, which has very positive incremental margin impacts by doing so and trying to get a little bit less subscale in some parts of our capabilities. So, overall, I think we're still quite optimistic on the incremental margin story. But that's changing landscape still with us getting into some new areas like digital advice, still brand new.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, Marty, you highlighted that Invesco is top two in smart beta in terms of AUM. What we'd really like to see is Invesco rank top two in sales of smart beta. So, you're buying, you bought two positively selling firms, Source and Guggenheim, that helps. It doesn't quite get you to top three in the U.S. So, are the aspirations to be top three? And if so, can you give us maybe some more specifics on that path to break into the top one, two, or three?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So, where our aspirations are, is really to be the leader in smart beta factor. We think that's where the greatest impact is for clients, where there emerging need is, that has been our focus, it will continue to be our focus. The last two, Guggenheim and Source, have been very, very important. Guggenheim's been closed all of the handful of weeks. The early responses are very, very positive. We are now in the mode of getting the range of those Guggenheim ETFs on the platforms. They were not broadly placed at all. That is the opportunity for us, which will drive the growth flows (00:35:05) that you're talking about. We don't drive that timetable, but we've met with all the important platforms as you would imagine. The feedback's been extremely positive, but I can't tell you what their timeframe is for making those decisions. But, outside of that, the interactions that we've had with the FAs has been very, very strong already.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. In terms of the April outflow number, $3.5 billion from the sovereign wealth fund and sub-advised. Can you talk about the regions that this is taking place in and maybe the asset classes of the outflows? And ultimately, what happened here?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","All right. So, in terms of the region, the large sovereign wealth happened in our EMEA region. And the asset class was active equity, sub-advised U.S. active equity as well. They were not performance-based decisions; these were client-based decisions entirely. Our performance was excellent in these products. So, again, I think, for the sub-advised, different models being employed, going to index versus active. And then, in the sovereign wealth, I think it's very specific to the client's needs for our cash.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Okay. And then, a tiny one. Loren, based on Guggenheim's ending AUM and based on the fee reductions and the tax code changes, what do the IRRs look like for that Guggenheim deal now? Has it gone up, or has it gone down?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","So, I think, again, early days to see, if we're going to change and maybe improve our growth trajectory, above and beyond what we have had originally modeled, because it's early days. I think we have a slightly lower IRR, just given some of the fee reductions that you heard about on the BulletShares. But that impact was probably just 1 percentage point of IRR, so still, solidly in the 20s. And then EPS creation probably nicked off $0.01 in 2018, as a result of that. And again, so I think, it's modest move off of those prior levels. Hopefully, we can make that up to higher growth.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is now open.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Hoping you could walk through maybe in a little more specificity the factors that drove you to lower your expectation for the revenue yield from here?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. No problem, Brennan. So, we have a few things coming through. So, starting kind of at the 41 basis points, which was our original guidance. It's really AUM mix in terms of growth in non-revenue fee generating assets as well as where we're seeing the flows, which are more recently biased to lower fee products. And so, that's about 0.5 basis point.","The revenue recognition changes, which we talked about a little bit already, we think that's going to be about 0.3 basis points off of our original guidance, which had no rev rec impact there. Strategic pricing initiatives, just generally call that, pricing our products in a way that keeps them competitive. That's probably 0.1 basis point impact. Foreign exchange is about 0.1 basis points negative, too. So, if you add up all those things, you go from 41 basis points to 40 basis points.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for that. And then, when we think about fee rate, hearing about more competition, more pressure on fees, especially in Europe, in light of MiFID and some of the increased clarity \u2013 transparency there. What are your expectations for fee pressure in the region, and how do you think that, that's going to play through here on Invesco, broadly? How should we frame that as analysts and investors? Thanks.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. Our view really has not changed. I think, what we are seeing in the landscape is focus on value for money. And we still say, you have to be competitively priced. And what we are seeing in most regions of the world, but probably, to varying different degrees, a broader use from cap weighted indexes, to factors, to high conviction active and alternatives. And yeah, that's really what's going to drive the mix. And yeah, that's part of what we're seeing as an organization as we continue to bring factors up to a broader part of the footprint for us as an organization. So, I don't know that I can give you any greater insight than what you're seeing within the organization and what we've talked about historically.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","No, that helps, Marty, for sure. I guess, I'm just \u2013 and certainly, at least you guys are positioned to a point where you have the factors, so you're in a good position to retain the assets to the extent that they become at risk. But, if we want to think about clients remixing their traditional active into like a smart beta solution, you believe you're well-positioned to retain the assets, although maybe continued fee pressure through mix is probably something that we should assume here, it seems as though, from that region, for you guys. Is that fair?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","I think, that's fair. But what you are still seeing though, and it's more pronounced in United States than in the UK, on the continent right now. So, you continue to see a very high use of high conviction active portfolios. We are seeing that still, so you've not seen that issue. The issue that you do see, probably UK, in particular, has been a very high degree of focus. And I'd say rightfully on sort of closet indexers that are \"active investors,\" and that is the most at risk group of money managers. We are not anywhere near that category. And so, from that perspective, we think we are very strongly placed.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. That helps a lot. Thanks. And hopefully, you can, of course, pick up more share in smart beta than it was elsewhere, so.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","That's right.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. I get it. Thank you.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","That's the intention. Yeah, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. I just want to clarify, Loren, your comments about this year's growth rate. I think you said similar levels to thus far, so kind of slightly positive for the first quarter. Are you including April in that kind of trajectory of the year?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. No question. I mean, I think April was an anomaly, we certainly don't expect that to be a monthly run rate. It was really specific to two events that we don't think are going to be recurring. We'll get into a bit of pipeline. Institutional pipeline is still strong, still at the high level. I think we have seen some creeping up of redemptions generally, and so I think that's sort of something that just keeps us a little less optimistic about getting to a higher level of growth rate than we've historically seen. Overall, opportunities still exist on sales. So, I think when you look at what to expect in 2018, I think, again just looking to more recent history, is probably the right basis point \u2013 or the right point of focus.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Look, I think you all are having your conversations with your clients, too. And what we are definitely \u2013 there's more unease and conviction and where equity markets are going in particular. And we have seen people get more defensive \u2013 or the conversations are more defensive than what we've seen historically. That can change as rapidly as it turned into that. And again, that is the one large redemption that Loren talked about that was exactly a result of moving to a defensive position.","It's very hard for us, and frankly, impossible to predict those decisions. They tend to happen pretty quickly. And where we have insight into the positive pipeline, we tend to not to do a great job of, as we've been very direct historically, is when people make these other decisions based on our portfolio repositioning.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And then, just a follow-up on that, like the sub-advised loss. I think this is the second one at least you guys have flagged in recent months. Can you give us a sense of kind of how big that \u2013 broadly, the sub-advised U.S. book is? And is that something you expect to kind of shrink over time, or is that stable growth kind of any outlook within that?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, it's a great question. The overall sub-advised book is more than $30 billion, and so, it's not small. When I asked that exact same question, I think \u2013 the answer is that this is not a trend. This is really just specific clients who have made some things. And yes, there's been a few data points of it happening, but I don't think there's any expectation on our side that this is going to just sort of all go away. I think it is a factor. Several factors come into play in terms of these clients making these decisions. They're not all the same in terms of how they're being made. But, there is a handful of (00:45:13) of onesies and twosies that are chunky. So, that's our hope based on our best intelligence.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. Could we come back to Jemstep for a moment? Can you give us a sense of how to sort of potentially size the revenue or the flows, and maybe even the timing of when you think some of the onboarding might translate into unit growth, and kind of think about some of the top line impact to that?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So, the timing again has not changed, right. Where we will start to see an impact is 2019, and it's once these institutions are on the platform. And we'll have to give you greater insight into the impact. I would imagine it will be a relatively slow build, but what we are seeing, is what's really going to happen after these institutions, is the pipeline just getting that much more robust and much bigger onboarding into 2019. But we'll have to \u2013 as we get further into the year and have a greater sense of conviction, then we'll have that conversation. I would be uncomfortable in extrapolating that right now.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And this is a \u2013 so, a two-part, I apologize, but unrelated question.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","(00:46:42).","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","On the $3.5 billion of \u2013 sorry to keep coming back to the same number, but the $3.5 billion, could you frame out the size of the one-offs, if you will? And then, where are you seeing the traction? And then a broader question is I'm sort of reading a lot about pricing pressure in the European ETF market. Sort of wondering if you could talk about how you think you're positioned in terms of where the business is today from a price perspective, and what kind of risk there might be from a sort of revenue degradation perspective?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","So, on the $3.5 million, it was about $2 billion for the sovereign, $1.5 billion for the sub-advised, so that was kind of the mix, all decent fees unfortunately. So, the pricing pressure, I think, is probably more profound on the smart beta, in general ETF space. I mean, as we're looking at how we position products against some of the competitors, and it's not everything has to go to a lower price, but making sure that our product lineup, particularly like Guggenheim coming over, is priced so it's competitively positioned against similar products of similar size, is critical for success. And so, I'd say, that's probably where our focus is most on sort of strategically pricing product.","I think on the active product, to the extent that we have capabilities that are good, there's probably far less need for us to think about changing the pricing on those products, because one, they're generally priced well and in line with competitors; and number two, there's value there in terms of the alpha that they have historically generated into sort of \u2013 buy flows or buy assets through lowering fees has not been our strategy.","And I don't know, Marty, if you got...","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, no. I agree with it.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for taking the question guys.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start on Jemstep. And really appreciate the color on slide 12, so thanks for that. But how should we think about the net flow potential in 2019 from the six large financial institutions that should be live at some point this year? And I'm really just thinking about how should we frame this potential, because it's really a brand new source of business for you guys.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, no. It is no question, it is \u2013 we believe it's really important competitive advantage for us. It is also consistent with what we've been talking about. We see the future is \u2013 being a strong set of investment capabilities is very important, but it's table stakes. And it's these types of developments is really what's going to create this competitive advantage and the necessity that's being driven as we look forward.","So, again, Bill asked the same question. I really am not in a position to give you the potential sizing of the flow into 2019 at this point in time. The fact is, the institutions are large, and we would anticipate that we will be successful, as we serve them going forward. And yeah, I wish, I could give you more insights, but I would...","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Well, we have no data...","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","I guess, yeah.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","...to base it on, really. So, I think we have a clear view that out to 2020 and kind of if this all kind of happens the way we think it is, I mean, we're talking about substantial amounts of assets with not so much penetration. I mean, even assuming modest penetration...","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","I mean we're certainly in the tens of billions, $50 billion \u2013 I mean, that kind of number of the assets being gathered through digital advice. How it gets there, because we don't have enough really to trend line anything, is what is the problem for us, Bill (sic) [Craig] (50:43), that, it's just too hard for us to guess.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then just as my follow-up on the ETF approval process. The SEC is now allowing more asset managers to self-index, and also looks like there's a potential SEC ETF rule that could further lower the barriers to entry. I'm just wondering, do you think a more open policy from regulators could open the door to more competition, or is it sort of like what I think Dan Draper always says, that ETFs have a very low barrier to entry, but a much higher barrier to succeed.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, we believe that very strongly, and I think evidence would \u2013 and the facts would support that. We've been at this now over a decade. Just having an ETF does not mean you're going to be successful, and the range of capability and the knowledge that goes along with it is really quite different. It is not a natural extension to whether it'd be historical, retail, distribution success or institutional success either. It is quite different. And so, will it bring on new ETFs? Probably. Do we think it's going to change our competitive positioning? I don't think so.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks. So, when looking at the pickup in \u2013 I don't want to call it churn, but just activity, lots of sales, lots of redemptions, pick-up, up and down, do you think that's mostly just a function of the obvious in volatility and people's changing macro outlook? And what I want to really get to is how much of it relates to the ins and outs related to broker\/dealer channel shrinking (00:52:44) consolidating relationships, and focusing on model portfolios, things like that?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So, my sense of it is, it's the right question. And if you look at the gross and the net in the quarter, the outflows, I think, it's much more related to the sentiment change within the quarter, just the magnitude of the change. And Loren's hit on a couple things that we've seen happen.","I think to your point of the narrowing of the platforms in the U.S. in particular, that is going to put money in motion. But remember, being taken off the platform, or having your fund not available for future sales is not foreseeing immediate redemptions. So, I don't think that's \u2013 that's going to take time. The people that, and the capabilities that remain on those platforms, they will be net beneficiaries, but I see that being slower than you might imagine because of, again, the correct answer, not foreseeing a client out of a capability that they chose to be in.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","I appreciate that. The only follow-up I have there is, I think you and pretty much every other player that we all covered will talk towards the ability to try to cap \u2013 or the desire to try to capture flows as they move and client sentiment changes. So, as this is going on right now, you have this awesome relationship within the channels, if you will, are we capturing as much as you'd like? In other words, if people are selling out certain components of active equity, switching into fixed income, switching to risk managers, switching even into cash, like are you capturing that within the channel? Because $56 billion in, $56 billion out looks like a flat today, but there's a whole lot more underneath the cover.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. No, you're right. Look, I would say, the fact is we were \u2013 I would say, we are not capturing what we would want to. And so, how do you change that? And I think historical efforts will not change that at all, right. So, historical practices of being in front of a platform or an FA aren't going to change it. So, what will change it are things that we started to employ in \u2013 last year was really the pilot, and in really much more in action right now. And it's our use of predictive analytics, and it has been incredibly beneficial to us.","And you can really start to see \u2013 actually, literally predict where FAs are going to be putting money, where they're about to redeem, and we are using that in a very positive way to do exactly what you're talking about. So, yeah, again, we're 12 months into it right now. Does it show up in the numbers? Not to the degree that would change your, as you say, the $56 billion in, $56 billion out, but we think it's that those types of things that will create the very different outcomes going forward.","And again, I think it gets back to this topic that we have collectively been talking about the competitive environment. You need to have the financial resources and the wherewithal to invest in those technologies to be effective going forward. And I'm just not sure that the totality of the money managers in the industry is going to have that wherewithal. Those that do will end up being much stronger going forward, and we happen to be one of them.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","All right. Thanks very much, Marty.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kenneth Lee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","The targeted organic growth range of 3% to 5%. What's the expectation in terms of which asset categories could be either above or below this range? And specifically, which can be the biggest contributors toward that growth rate?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","So, I mean, the good question, I think it's going to depend on what sort of market environment we're in. We're really looking at this more from a function that we have this broad set of capabilities that we can bring together in conjunction with sort of catalysts around digital advice, factors just generally \u2013 so, these are kind of general themes that cut across asset classes. And so, I would say, I mean, generally, we think passive is probably going to continue to grow at a faster rate than active. So, that's one aspect to the 3% to 5%. Whether it's going to be fixed income versus equity, versus alternatives that's a little harder to predict, although I think we're pretty well-positioned with both shares in particular to grow that asset class in the passive space.","But I don't think we are able to really lay it out with that degree of specificity with any sense of certainty, other than kind of the active versus passive split, I think, is probably the most real (00:58:17). I think the other thing that we probably would say though is that we think alternatives will continue to grow probably at a faster rate generally than other sort of more traditional classes as been the history for us. And so, we're just looking at the trend line there that, that would continue to be an area of higher growth for us, not just in our real estate, but in commodities. Some of the Global Targeted Return types of products, we think will have a lot of opportunity to grow faster.","And Marty, I don't know if you have any...","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, no. I think what I would like to put in context is what Loren talked about earlier during the presentation, and where he showed the advantages of diversification going back to 2009. And this range of 3% or 5%, it's not unknown to us. We've been in the range over those periods of time.","The other thing that's factual is that the consistency of our growth is very unique in the industry. What we want to change is have the consistency be within that 3% to 5% range. And I think, the clients are really going to decide where they're going to put their assets. The effort is to drive the totality of our penetration up with our clients, and there's many areas that we can be doing a better job of that, and whether it be the institutional parts of our business that we've talked about, a broader penetration on platforms, et cetera, and greater success in the broadening of the penetration of our ETF platforms in the U.S. and in EMEA probably, in particular. So, that's really what we think is going to drive it, in particular, it's the totality of the offering. And really, that's just being much more effective with our distribution capabilities.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you. And I just have one more. In terms of the recent additions to the Global Solutions team, I wondered if you can talk specifically about efforts to gain more insurance clients. We've seen few other competitors picking interest in this area, and just want to see how you view the growth opportunity there. Thanks.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, it is a real growth opportunity. And again, as you're saying, money managers are turning their attention to it. We have been quite successful in the area. It is also an area where if you look at the skills that we've developed internally over the last few years, a number of the backgrounds are coming from the insurance industry and having that specific expertise really, really matters. And again, it is an area where we have seen success, and we will continue to see success, and frankly, is probably going to be one of the relative areas of relative strength within our institutional business in particular.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Hey, Marty. Good morning, Loren. Good morning, guys. Wanted to go back to the Guggenheim discussion for a second with the recent fee rate reduction. So, understand you guys are trying to be more competitive as you position this product, but looking out, are we largely done? Do you guys still see any incremental price reductions that need to be done in either of that product or kind of your broader PowerShares brand as you're kind of getting ready to roll this out more broadly, especially with Jemstep?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. And Loren was talking about it. I think we have developed quite a strong discipline around pricing within the ETF capability. And again, it is back to the comment I made earlier. It is a very different set of capabilities. And frankly, in the mutual fund world, we feel that the BulletShares are really one of the very attractive elements of Guggenheim. And we're not trying to be the low-cost provider at all, but really focused on this value for money. And we think it is appropriately priced right now, competitively priced.","We are looking at the whole range of our ETF lineup as we said we would post the acquisition. And you'll see probably some duplications and things like that, that will be addressed during that period of time. But nothing immediately in front of us, but we'll continue to look at the competitive positioning of our ETFs as we look forward.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And Loren, one for you. I guess , going back to the press release, it sounds like you guys are about 70% of the way through the cost-cutting program. Just kind of looking what's in the run rate as of the first quarter versus the total. I guess, is there room to do more given a more challenging obviously revenue backdrop and sort of flattish organic growth here? And then as we think about 2019, obviously, lots of moving pieces, but using your kind of typical methodology, but also taking into account that you are investing in the business still and Jemstep pipeline sounds pretty robust, Is 50% plus realistic for 2019 in incremental margin, or that might get pushed out?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","So, on the cost opportunity side, we do think there's always further opportunity to do more. We continue to look at other things that are not currently in that run rate. I think in terms of the overall program that was put in place a while back in terms of optimization with the specific activities being identified, that is going to come to a close in 2018. We're really going to be, I think, done with the optimization program per se, but we are going to continue, I think, to roll through some fairly, hopefully, significant opportunities to continue to look at technology more effectively, potentially outsource other activities within the firm to the extent that it makes sense. Someone can do it better, cheaper, faster, whatever. Those are the things that we need to continue to be focused on.","Use of robotics is another one that people are looking at obviously. It's an opportunity for lots of firms, not just us. So, I would say more to come on that one and should allow us to continue to grow with a good cost at a slower pace than revenues. And so, with that said, I don't think anybody internally has said that, that 50% to 65% goes away. And that 2019 opportunity may still certainly exist for us to be able to deliver at those levels. But I also mentioned, we have to get through 2018 to sort of get a clear view of where we are in 2019. So, not ready to sort of commit at this point that, that is locked in, other than there's nothing that implicitly says it can't happen.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. I understood.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Okay.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning folks.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Marty, maybe just to get back onto the factor-based and the smart beta franchise. Just in your view, obviously, we've been in a slower positive net flow environment for smart beta over the last year or so, given beta has done so well in the market. It's been up pretty strongly. But as you see this develop, and you're making a bigger effort, what do you think are the biggest drivers that can actually positively move that needle?","And I'm thinking like, first of all, the market conditions that you've been alluding to, of people getting more conservative versus how you're positioning the smart beta versus active products, and then versus passive products. And it sounds like it continues to be more like a sold product rather than a bought product, so how are financial advisors perceiving smart beta as a better solution for them?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","You're on a really, really, really important point. If you listened to the commentary, you would think that \u2013 and I'll stay in the United States for a moment, because it's different than other markets. You would think that the adoption rate of smart beta factors is at a very high level; in fact, it's not. It's not at all, where it can be. And what we are seeing, and this could be whether it'd be platforms, financial advisors, or some institutions, the intellectual merits are embraced. The how to use it, how to implement factors in a portfolio and build portfolios extending again high conviction active alternatives and factors, it is not well-developed.","And so, that's why I come back to how are we making an impact. There's a huge educational element of not just what it is, but how do you use it. That's where the Solutions team also comes into play, too, because we literally help people build model and analytics of how, in fact, to use them. And it's just not at the institutional level, it's actually at corner offices, FAS, where our analytics team is helping them determine how to build portfolios more effectively to create the outcomes that they want. So, the fact of the matter is, it is early days, and so, you're exactly right, it is \u2013 at the moment, it's not a bought capability, it's much more a learned or sold capability. And as the adoption rate goes up, I think, that's where you're going to start to see a much greater momentum in the flows in these areas.","Factors outside of the United States, and in particular, in Europe, institutionally have been embraced much more holistically for good long period of time, and that's just at a different level now. I would say, at a retail level, it's probably similar to the United States. And quite frankly, there's still much greater appetite for active investing whether, it'd be fixed income and\/or equities in the U.K. and on the continent. We have, frankly, the same thing for the retail channel in Asia. I will also tell you it has been a marked change of interest in the beginning adoption of factor capabilities in Asia, China, and Japan, frankly, in particular, from the interactions that we've been having.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's great color. And then, maybe a little different subject, as you think about quantitative strategies from the research side, you did talk about this a little bit in the presentation, obviously, there's been a reasonably decent push to embrace quantitative tools within research and different firms are implementing it in different ways. And if you can talk about how you're implementing it at Invesco. I know you guys obviously operate on a more decentralized base with teams sort of a lot of them doing their own thing. But how do you view your fundamental teams embracing quantitative strategies, and are you kind of trying to push that through within the organization?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So, let me clarify a point. The investment teams, they are built by \u2013 under unique philosophies and processes, but it's all on a single platform. And so, the tools are available to all of the teams, and they're used in different ways. And the reality of the situation is every one of these teams, and if you go back to our quantitative team that's been since the early 1980s, they've always adopted new technologies to enhance their quantitative models, and that's exactly what's happening right now. And so, the adoption of the tools is really driven by each of the investment management teams. And it'll be no different than in the past, and they will continue to be adopted in that manner. So, I don't know if that's helpful or not.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","I do know \u2013 I mean, we are looking specifically at things like natural language as an opportunity to be able to go through some of the filings more effectively. So, that's work in progress right now. And I also know there's some exploration around the use of AI, specifically around macroeconomic views and the bets around macroeconomic events. So, I think it's all been explored. I think there are \u2013 the teams that are embracing them. But it's additive to their existing processes, as opposed to taking parts out.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, and you're talking about the fundamental teams not the quantitative?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yes, this is all fundamental teams that we're talking about. The quantity teams have been doing this for a long time.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","For a long time, yes. Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning Thanks for taking the question. Just curious if you could update us on the Great Wall JV in China, how that's progressing, and your outlook there? And also, just given some of the recent regulatory changes in China, just curious how you're thinking about any sort of change to the JV structure, or how you're thinking about approaching China?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. I'll make a couple comments. We probably don't talk about it a lot. Or our China position, I'd say, is arguably one of the strongest in the industry. Invesco Great Wall continues to do quite well in the marketplace, and the penetration continues to increase. And back to some of the topics that we're talking about, the other thing, it's a very different market. And we are frankly learning a lot about using technologies and retail channels in China, because they are actually more advanced in many parts of the world. And that is one of the things that led to Jemstep a number of years ago. So, we also see other opportunities with some of the digital platforms in China. And again, we'll just have to \u2013 we'd be more specific here on that.","Institutionally, we continue to be very, very strong, I'd argue, probably top three institutional managers, multiple mandates with everybody that you would hope to be there. As you say, the changing dynamics from a opportunity to change our 49% shareholding is top of mind right now. And as soon as we can have that change, it will be changed, which is also another real positive for us as an organization.","And to your point, Michael, the bigger topic is \u2013 the opportunity probably has never been bigger in China just because of some of the developments that are happening there. And we feel extraordinarily well placed in that market.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, I would just say, I mean, they're flowing really well. The products, fundamental and quantitative, fixed income, I mean, it's really doing well. I think, the overall joint venture is one of the largest and seem to be one of the most successful there. It's about $20 billion in size and rapidly growing. So, there's a lot of focus on kind of how do we continue to grow our opportunities with the Great Wall. And we also have a WOFE as well, so that is another element \u2013 that Wholly Owned Foreign Entity (sic) [Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise] (01:14:16), I think, is what that stands for, which is yet another kind of element into the whole Greater China strategy.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","And I'd just add, I mean, as you know, as best we can tell, we're the only Western firm, where the name is led by Invesco Great Wall. And we also have management control of the JV, and I think that's also unique in the market. So, part of the success of the JV is we are able to utilize the capabilities of Invesco, whether it be investment disciplines and the like, that are probably not afforded to other JVs. And literally, we operate as a single organization in the market, and jointly going to clients, recognizing it as a JV even. So, again, we just feel we're in a very strong place in that marketplace.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just one real quick one on capital allocation priorities, just outline that, and where acquisitions fall in that mix right now? Thanks.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","So, obviously we just finished an acquisition, and so our priorities is really paying down the credit facility, as we mentioned, to bring our leverage back down to pre-acquisition levels. Once we get to that, which we expect to happen sometime in Q4, we would expect our normal capital priorities to kick back in, which really is investing behind the business, which would be mostly seeding products \u2013 have sort of contained needs there, roughly \u2013 historically, has been somewhere around $100 million, $200 million a year, then would be an ever-increasing dividend. And you saw what we did in terms of that increase, modest, but again, consistent growth in our dividend. And then the remainder could be allocated to buybacks, which again, is something that we're looking forward to, given the stock price, where it is.","In terms of acquisition strategies, as I mentioned, I think our focus is really trying to leverage what has just come onboard between Source and Guggenheim. There are continuing opportunities that present themselves to us. And I think just as we've always done, we've been open to looking at those in terms of what they might bring, but has not been the key focus to our success at all. We think we should be able to grow organically, first and foremost, but we're paying attention as the industry is shifting and moving and certain things may be more interesting than others.","And I don't know Marty if you want to add to that as well.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","No, I agree. No, you're right on the mark.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks, Loren.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Apologize if I missed this, I had to step away during the Jemstep conversation. But are these new platforms a situation where there's \u2013 you'll be sitting next to other asset managers, robos, and the fee advisor chooses which one they want to use? And if so how do you kind of become the one that they choose, when I imagine there's some pretty powerful constituencies behind the other ones?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, no. What we're talking about these clients, they pick one digital platform, so it is \u2013 think of you as an organization, you choose an application, you install the application in your environment, and that's really the point here. No institution wants multiple digital platforms; they want one to serve their financial advisors and their wealth managers and the like.","And so, that's really the point. Being first to market and the penetration with the clients puts you in a very unique situation. You become a service provider to these institutions. It is white-labeled; it is open platform. But we think our decision to do that was, we think, very, very wise. No way would an institution want to not have open platform and not \u2013 an organization like us not recognize that we are their client, we are serving them. And I think that has served us very, very well to-date here.","And I think Loren also made a point, depending on the institution, what we are seeing is they start to turn to an organization like us to provide models for their platforms. And again, this gets back to how do the models happen. It's a combination of being the digital advice platform; the combination of our Solutions team working with the client to determine what they want built for their clients; then using a combination again of our active factor capabilities, whether it'd be mutual funds and ETFs to build these models for the clients. And again that just really gets back to \u2013 you have to look at the totality of the offering. And you have the relative market share and time. We are modeling to be quite dramatically different to the upside and a traditional relationship to a traditional platform.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Great. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. There was some news a week or so ago about a fee dispute with the enhanced income trust in the UK. Could you give us a total AUM exposure to those kind of trusts? And is this a trend we should worry about for all of them?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","I don't think the exposure is large. I think it's probably $5 billion or less. Some of the other trusts have already gone through and have made some adjustments. This was a particular situation that I don't know if we can really comment too deeply on in terms of kind of where that dispute was, and seems more anomalous again than sort of a theme.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. Thank you.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Lee of KBW. Your line is now open.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and appreciate patience to a long call. I guess, in a way, maybe it's a more of a hypothetical question than anything, but is organic growth really even the metric we should all be focusing on really? Because if you think about it and you talk about your net revenue yield and there's pressures there, and we all talk about fee pressure in the industry. Clearly, there's a concern rightly so about the ability for any organic growth, for you and a lot of your peers, to translate into revenue growth.","But really, isn't the real measure the ability to generate EBITDA and earnings growth from incremental flow? So, shouldn't we really be thinking about, and how do you think about really growing pre-tax operating income regardless of revenues maybe or increment \u2013 not regards of revenues, but regards to kind of incremental fee rates.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","I mean, isn't that really the conversation we should be having?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","It's a good question. And I guess, we collectively have talked down a path, it's been organic growth rate. And I think, what the organic growth rate does do, I mean, it is sort of a momentum measure, right, and penetration, so there is something healthy about it. But where I think the conversation gets lost probably is where you're going, right. So, we've been focused on our effective fee rate and what's driving that change. Where we see the bulk of our effective fee rate changing, it's really going to be the asset mix more than anything else.","And what do we think is going to happen with \u2013 so if you start to dissect it, in a way, if you looked at this, \u2013 again the range of capabilities, over time where are the bulk of our assets are going to be? They're going to be in probably factor capabilities. Why would that be the case? Because traditional active, you're going to hit \u2013 we know that equity capabilities, in particular, there's a limitation to the size if you're going to generate alpha. So, when an investment team says no more, we shut them down. And I think that's the right thing to do. And that is \u2013 and I'd say, the same thing on alternatives, right. There's going to be a limitation to the size. And so, when we looked forward, we made the determination to fully service clients. We needed this whole range of capabilities and recognizing that you can build absolute scale and factor capabilities, while frankly, meeting client needs.","So, that is really the conversation we've been having. And you're really pulling it out in a different way. And I think understanding that is really important and the implications. What's the point of it, if you look at our ETF business or factor business, it's lower fee, but it's finally profitable, right. And that is really what you're driving to, you're going to get scale, and you're going to get the profitability, and the earnings growth because of it.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. And I think, I mean, obviously, we're fiduciary and our focus is on our clients, and that doesn't mean earnings growth or profits don't matter, they absolutely do. And certainly, I spend a lot of time thinking about them myself. But, in terms of kind of the metric there, everybody internally is focused on, growth is really a measure. We've got a growth measure. Do our client want our products? I mean, are we serving our clients well? It's really a measure of health. And then, from that, comes revenues and profits. So, again, I think from maybe your perspective, I certainly get the question. I think internally, people would still find organic growth, sort of a very good measure of whether we're doing the right things by clients.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","And I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we don't have any questions in queue.

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to the speakers for today, Mr. Martin Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco, and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Thank you very much and thank you for joining us today. I'm on the call with Loren Starr, our CFO, and we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on the website, if you're so inclined to follow. Today, as we typically do, we'll review the business results for the third quarter. Loren will then go into greater detail on the financials, and the two of us will then answer any questions you all might have.","So let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter, and you'll find that on slide three, if you're following it along. Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter, 73% and 83% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers over three years and five years respectively. Strong investment performance and continued focus on meeting clients' needs were not enough to offset the impacts of the volatile market, and a single large institutional client withdrawal, which resulted in net long-term outflows of $3.9 billion for the quarter.","Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 41.4% versus 41.7% in the prior quarter. The quarterly dividend remains at $0.27 per share, which is up 8% over the prior year. We also returned $292 million back to shareholders during the quarter through a combination of stock buybacks and dividends.","Assets under management were $755 billion at the end of the quarter, down from $803 billion in the prior quarter. Operating income was $373 million in the quarter; this was down from $390 million in the prior quarter, but roughly in line with the operating income in the first quarter of this year. Earnings per share were $0.61, down $0.63 from the prior quarter. We repurchased $176 million of stock during the quarter.","Before Loren goes into details on the financials, let me take a minute and review the investment performance, that's on slide six. Our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain strong investment culture help maintain solid long-term investment performance across the organization during the quarter.","Looking at the firm as a whole, 73% of assets were in the top half on a three-year basis, and 83% were in the top half on a five-year basis. The one-year number results partially reflect increased exposure to energy by certain of our equity teams, who also during the quarter took the opportunity to make investments in those positions, which positioned very well for the future.","The results also reflect our European corporate fixed income portfolios, which short in duration during the period in corporate bonds to position themselves again for a continued long-term success. Our investors are taking advantage of the short-term market dislocation for the benefit of the long-term results for clients. I'm highly confident our clients will continue to benefit from this high conviction approach to investing.","On page seven, you'll see active flows reflect the macro environment during the quarter as investors reacted to volatility in the markets. Within ETFs 60% year-to-date net flows have come from international ETFs, and 50% of the international flows have come from currency hedge products to areas where we do not have an offering. This narrowing of client demand impacted demand for passive capabilities in the short-term year-to-date. Also, during the third quarter, specifically traditional cap-weighted ETFs captured 80% of the net flows, again, an area that we do not focus on. So the combination of these is a unique, abnormal thing that we've seen. We suspect it's short-term in nature.","We saw positive institutional flows during the quarter in spite of the volatile markets, and a large single institutional client withdrawal. We view this withdrawal as an isolated event. Retail flows were impacted by the macro environment, as investors weighed their options during the volatile quarter.","We did see continued strength in number of asset classes, asset categories and \u2013 Global Total Return, European Equity, Investment Grade Fixed Income, Diversified Dividend to name a few. Additionally, it's early in the fourth quarter, but quarter-to-date, we have net flows of about $700 million and in the different areas, we've seen ETFs come back quite strongly.","Traditional ETFs, net inflows are about $1 billion in total, about $2.1 billion from the QQQs, which is more interesting from a market \u2013 investors' sentiment point of view. Core retail flows continue to be challenged, but we're expecting them to be better than they were in the month of September.","Asia Pac, EMEA continue to be in net flows. In the institutional pipeline of one, but not funded remain near all-time historic highs. We feel good about the results of the quarter, continued strong investment performance. Our focus on meeting client needs contributed to solid operating results, despite what we saw in the markets. We continue to see strength across the global business, in particular within Asia Pac, EMEA and the institutional business globally.","Our focus remains on strengthening our efforts to deliver strong long-term investment performance that help clients meet their investment objectives and running a very sound, good business. With our comprehensive range of capabilities and broadly diversified business, we believe we are well-positioned to succeed over the long-term, regardless of where the markets take us in the short-term.","That said, we continue to see numerous short-term opportunities which will advance our business. Given the strength of our capabilities and the disciplined manner in how we run our business, we believe we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of these opportunities, including, for example, ETFs after investing in the institutional business globally, alternatives and solutions, to name a few.","Now I'll turn the call over to Loren so he can review the financials before we answer your questions.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Thanks very much, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter, total AUM decreased $47.8 billion or 5.9%, this was driven by foreign exchange translation of $5.9 billion, long-term net outflows of $3.9 billion and a negative market return of $35.6 billion combined with outflows from money market and from the QQQs of $1.5 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively.","Average AUM for the third quarter was $788.9 billion, which was down 2.7% versus the second quarter. Our net revenue yield was 45.8 basis points, a decrease of 0.4 basis points versus Q2. Other revenues accounted for the decline of 0.5 basis points and a change in mix reduced the yield by 0.1 basis points. These are offset by an increase in performance fees in the quarter, which added 0.2 basis points.","Now turning to the operating results. You'll see that net revenues declined by $33.6 million or 3.6% quarter-over-quarter to $903 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $1.4 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees fell by $45.2 million or 4.2% to $1.04 billion. This reflects the lower average AUM during the quarter. And FX decreased third quarter management fees by $1.8 million.","Service and distribution revenues decreased by $4.8 million or 2.2%, also in line with lower average AUM during the quarter. FX reduced service and distribution revenues by $0.5 million. Performance fees in the quarter came in at $17.6 million and they were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.4 million from UK equities. Foreign exchange decreased performance fees by $0.1 million.","Other revenues in the third quarter were $27.6 million, and that was a drop of $10.3 million due to lower transaction fees from real estate and UIT activities. Foreign exchange decreased other revenues by $0.1 million. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, fell by $22.2 million or 5.3%. The movement was in line with the lower revenues derived from retail AUM, and foreign exchange decreased these expenses by $1.1 million.","Moving on down the slide. You'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $529.6 million declined by $16.8 million or 3.1% relative to the second quarter. FX decreased operating expenses by $1.6 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $346.9 million, a decrease of $4.5 million or 1.3%. The decrease was due to a reduction in variable compensation for the quarter. FX decreased compensation by $0.9 million. Looking forward, assuming AUM flat to current levels, we'd expect compensation to run between $340 million and $345 million for the fourth quarter.","Marketing expenses decreased by $4.9 million or 16% to $25.8 million. The decline was driven by seasonally lower expenditures for advertising, literature, travel and client events. FX decreased marketing expenses by $0.1 million in the quarter. Marketing costs will ramp back up in Q4 as it usually does, coming in somewhere, we believe, between $32 million and $35 million.","Property, office and technology expenses were $79.9 million in the quarter, which was down $2.3 million. The decrease was the result of reduced property-related expenses and lower outsourced administration costs in EMEA. FX decreased these expenses by $0.2 million. In Q4, we'd expect property, office and technology to be around $80 million to $83 million.","G&A expenses at $77 million decreased $5.1 million or 6.2%. The decrease in G&A was a result of non-recurring fund and regulatory costs in the prior quarter, as well as lower professional services expenses. FX decreased G&A by $0.4 million. Our Q4 G&A expense, we believe, should be in the range of $77 million to $80 million.","Continuing on down the page. You'll see that non-operating income decreased $15.8 million compared to the second quarter. The third quarter had unrealized mark-to-market losses on our trading investments and on our consolidated sponsored investment products compared to gains that we saw in the prior quarter.","The firm's effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income in Q2 was 26.5%, down from 28.7% in the second quarter and consistent with the guidance that we provided in the second quarter call, which then brings us to our adjusted EPS at $0.61 and our adjusted net operating margin at 41.4%.","And, with that, I'm going to turn things back over to Marty.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Operator, can we take questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. Our first question coming from Michael Carrier of Bank of America.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Marty, maybe first just on the flow trend in the quarter, but then probably more importantly the outlook. You mentioned on the institutional side the pipeline being really strong. I just want to get a sense on the retail side. Obviously, the quarter was pretty volatile. Given your guys' exposure both in the U.S. and then outside the U.S., just some of the trends that you're seeing, some of the products that are still gaining some traction or there's still demand for versus the areas where you've seen the let up.","And then you mentioned like the October trends. But what do you see shifting? Particularly the areas where you feel like the performance is still there and in a more volatile environment there's going to be demand. Just want to try to get a sense of which products can work in this environment.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","So more retail focus, was that right?","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yeah, because it sounds like the institutional was good. If you had that, the lumpy amount or the one institutional outflow number, that too. But just wanted to get a sense on the outlook.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Good question. So what we're seeing, and I can't speak for other organizations, but it really has been moving very rapidly. September being a very volatile quarter in particular.","Where you saw it impact the most I would say would be the U.S. retail business and even not just mutual funds, but ETFs. It was a really different environment. It feels like it's changing already in October and we're seeing that, as I said, sentiment. You're seeing traditional ETFs again really looking quite strong for us. And, again, I used QQQs as an example of follow that for sentiment. That was actually pretty strong.","Where the flow is, you're seeing it still in things like Diversified Dividend. I think it's confidence, international equities and the like. But I think as confidence comes in, there's a broad range of things that I think could work. I will say what's also interesting is the broad range of retail alternatives that we have perform extremely well during this period. So things like GTR and the like, again, you test those things in these periods. And so that would be an area within the U.S.","Outside, as you frankly, Loren and I, we're in Frankfurt, Germany now, and so you really get a pulse on the ground. The retail business continues to really look strong. Europe Equities actually in particular, is sort of a core retail focus here, has been an area, and also Asia Pac retail is back in net flows. And it tends to be pretty broad, but it feels like, again, it's early, but confidence seem to be coming back more quickly in Europe and in Asia than in the United States in the retail market.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. And then I would also just \u2013 a couple points too on flows. The other thing around flows, I think there's about $700 million of the institutional outflows that was just related to fundings in, or dispositions \u2013 sorry, in real estate. So that's good news. I mean it's also a part of the process, as we sort of provide returns to our shareholders. So it had nothing to do with performance. It's really just part of a lifecycle of some of these funds.","The things that are really showing up in October more recently, and we're seeing good positive flow activity in October to-date, is around GTR. We're seeing Pan European Equities continue to flow nicely. It continues to be of interest. Fixed income is a very strong driver, generally both on the retail in the U.S., as well as outside of the U.S.","So it's sort of broad-based in terms of what's coming back in October, and certainly Marty mentioned it, but it's important, the ETFs are backed significantly, the traditional ones, which were an outflow. We're now seeing strong inflows close to $1 billion of continued inflows, and that's across a variety of different capabilities within the ETF spectrum.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for the color. And then just as a follow-up, Loren, just on the guidance that you gave, I think you mentioned the comp in that range. Obviously, the markets are a bit stronger than maybe flat for the AUM. So, any color on that. And on the revenue, just given the volatility that we saw this quarter, maybe relative to the expectations and performance fees and other, kind of any color on the outlook? I know both are tough to gauge, but just any sense.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","The comp estimates were based on sort of current asset levels as of today. So we're in that \u2013 a little bit above $790 billion in AUM. Obviously, that could go up or down depending on day-to-day activity. But it's sort of based on current levels...","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Got it.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","...which is obviously above where we ended in September. So I think again, management around it are sort of comp-based and expenses will be in line with what you'd expect.","In terms of the revenue outlooks and performance fees, traditionally are not seeing sort of one area produced performance fees in the fourth quarter, and so again, we would probably tend to sort of guide conservatively in that space for Q4, but it probably, without knowing much, we're talking about $5 million, something like that.","The other issue on other revenues; definitely saw a slowdown in Q3, just given the volatility of what was going on, that happened around transaction fees. We could see a pickup on that line item in Q4, could get it back to the $30 million, $35 million range in Q4.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Luke Montgomery of Bernstein Research.","Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research","Hey, good morning, guys.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Hey.","Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research","Just on the operating margin, I think, you speak to incremental margins in the 65% range. Average AUM was down about, I think, 3% on a period end, 6% on an average basis. Revenue was down 4%, and yet the margin held in really well. So I guess, I'm wondering, how we think about incremental margins on the downside. It seems like you've been pretty successful at controlling comp in spite of I think some significant head count growth over the last couple years. So I'm not sure what that says about your ability to ramp it down in lower markets. And then maybe how we think about other expense levers to pull in lower markets.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","I think we would \u2013 as we've said in the past, and I'll obviously reiterate again. In a declining revenue situation it's just hard, it's next to impossible to \u2013 smartly to have expenses go down in line with revenue declines.","We saw this a little bit in advance in the quarter, and we might have even talked a little bit about it in \u2013 at our last call. But we ultimately did put out some signals within the business to try to slow things down, think about prioritizing our investments within the quarter, because we just didn't know what it was going to \u2013 what was going to happen.","And so I think \u2013 we were successful in terms of holding off certain discretionary elements of our spending in the quarter. We gave some guidance obviously to the fourth quarter. Some of those expenses are sort of going to be in line with this last quarter, but perhaps up a little bit.","I mean, there are investments that we continue to need to make, want to make, which will help improve our success and positioning strategically going forward. Again, with that said, we're going to continue to work really hard to \u2013 think about our investments, and we'll continue to watch the volatility of the assets.","And so the pressure is still on internally in terms of thinking about, how to be smart around our investments, just given the uncertainty of our revenues and AUM. So we can't really, sort of say, we're doing a better job now. I think we're doing a good job as we've always done, in light of volatile markets where we're trying to sort of pause and take a breather on certain investments that can be paused without doing much damage.","Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research","Okay, thanks. And then just a technical question about how you mark AUM for FX. Is it once at the end of the quarter? Is it month-end or some kind of daily average approach?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","It's done monthly.","Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","I just do want to reiterate Loren's comments. We have \u2013 we are, as we always have, very focused on running a thoughtful business, and we're always looking to what we call create capacity to continue to invest. And we just see that there are a number of areas where we think we can continue to create an advantage for us, and our clients, whether it'd be in ETF, that we're investing global institutional businesses we've been talking about, alternative solution. So we're working that balance very diligently, and we will continue to do that.","Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research","Thank you.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi, good morning. Historically, when you ramped up repurchases like you did in the third quarter, it's kind of been a one quarter or two quarter event. I guess, could you kind of speak to how you're thinking about the sustainability of this level, or is it purely just where the price is?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So look, we do like the approach that we've had. We think we have strengthened the financial position of the firm, while at the same time focus on these capital returns. Where the stock is priced, you just can't help, but buy in the stock, and it looks like still where the stock is right now, we think it's very, very attractive. And probably something seem more consistent this quarter to what you saw last quarter.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay, thanks. And then just to clarify, the $700 million, did that include or exclude the QQQs?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","That excludes it.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","The QQQs were, like, $2 billion \u2013 $2.1 billion, and the traditional ones were close to $1 billion.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Hi, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So we ran the new guidance numbers, and it looks like the adjusted margin may dip down into the 39% range versus the strong 41% result this quarter. And I realize you didn't provide any adjusted operating margin guidance today, but would you make any additional steps to protect the margin in 4Q if it trended down into the 49% range?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","So yeah, we definitely are continuing, as I mentioned, focus on this as a topic. The guidance is, you know, somewhat of a, based on what we know right now, we would like to do better. But again, based on what we know right now, the guidance is \u2013 make sense for us to provide. We would agree generally with what you're sort of identifying. We don't think it's a great result. And so we're obviously trying to do better.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, Loren. And just as my follow-up, Asia flows slowed, but remain positive. I'm wondering if you can provide us a quick update in terms of what Andrew Lo and team are seeing across Asia from a product demand standpoint.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. I think, I mean, Asia is definitely in the numbers that we're seeing through October. Asia is quite strong, quite positive in terms of its flow pattern. It's very much driven by the institutional business, which continues to take on significant follow-on fundings, as well as new fundings across fixed income, bank loans, equities as well, so it's a pretty well diversified element. They now have GTR in Asia as well, so that's very interesting. So I'd say the level of optimism around the fourth quarter for Asia Pac is at a much, much higher level than it was in Q3.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, Loren.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Michael Kim of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey, guys. Good morning. First, can you maybe talk at a high level about sort of business with sovereign wealth funds, just trying to get a sense of, sort of the risk of attrition assuming commodities pricing remained under pressure, and then any sense on sort of relative fee rates versus the overall weighted average for the firm?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Let me hit a part of that, Loren, and chime in. So just generally, an area that we don't talk about specifically, the clients; that said, we have no indication that there'll be redemptions in that area. And I know, it's very topical within the industry, but that's what we would know right now.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","In terms of relative fee rates, obviously, we saw a little bit of a mix impact, which was negative point, I think it was 0.1 basis points in the quarter. That was largely due to just the market impact on our percentage of assets that are equity-based. We still are seeing good flows coming in from cross-border, so we don't think the story around fee rates is \u2013 we think it's going to continue to march forward as we grow.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Okay, and then, Marty, I know you've been quite vocal in terms of the DOL's fiduciary standard proposals. And I understand, sort of the broader concerns around less advice, less options, and maybe even higher costs at the end of the day for investors. But just curious to get your take on some of the consequences for asset managers specifically in terms of potential changes to the economics of distribution, as well as maybe from a product development standpoint.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, it's a fair question. I'd say, it's too early to know, because we're not exactly clear what the outcome is. That said, I will tell you, obviously I think the people that are going to be more strongly placed are those organizations that have a really broad range of investment capabilities. Those organizations that have ETFs, those organizations that are strong and smart beta factor investing, and also have the ability to create share classes that are very stripped down, that will be really investment fee-type share classes only that will be much more sought-after, and will ultimately be sort of unified accounts on the retail side.","So that's been our focus. That said, otherwise, it's going to be a guessing game to see where they end up. But those would be the areas that I would look at that we've been focused on and how we are positioned then to \u2013 what might come out of this.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then just one minor clarification. So you mentioned the $700 million of inflows quarter-to-date. I know you said that does not include the Qs. But does that include the traditional ETF inflows?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yes, it does.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yes.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Hi, thanks. I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned some money is going into some products that you don't have capabilities. And I think you mentioned cap-weighted and currency hedged. I'm curious on two-fold. One, is it too late to start investing in things like that just to continue to constantly broaden the product suite? And then other parts where you think you might have blind spots, where you might be investing?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, it's a good question. I guess at one level you don't know the blind spots until you're blind.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Well put.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","So the currency hedged international capabilities, it really has been quite the area over the last year or so. And I will say within the ETF world, it's hard to have more than handful of firms with offerings that are successful, so being pretty quick matters a lot. That said, we won't ignore it.","But I will say if you look at the fundamental strength that we have is the longevity and breadth of all the smart beta products that we have and low volatility offerings in particular. So, again, we are always asking ourselves, what are we missing, what are clients needing and trying to respond. So hopefully that's helpful.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Absolutely. And then the overall performance is in very good shape, three-year and five-year, you pointed out. In the one-year, there's some slippage, particularly in equity. I didn't know if you mentioned or if you could mention any specific factors that you think are particular to your business that a certain market might respond better to?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, so good question. I was trying to address a little bit in my comments, and this is a better way to get to it. So the one-year performance, quite frankly, a handful of capabilities are just under 50%. I mean, maybe 50 basis points off. So the dispersion from the top half is very, very little. And it tends to be those areas where people have invested in energy, in particular. I personally think it's going to be a great investment. Timing is always a question.","That said, I also think confidence that they have been continuing to have add-on investments in those areas during this period and I think probably, I don't have the numbers, but from September 30 on, I think that could only be a good thing. So we have really good \u2013 high level of confidence in what our investment teams are doing and where they're positioned as opposed to, probably what you're trying to get to is, are we concerned about the quality of one of the products. And we don't feel that at all right now.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Bill Katz of Citi.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks so much. So certainly I appreciate the tactical volatility of the markets and your expense guidance within that. But sort of stepping back as we look out into 2016, what's your latest thoughts on incremental margin opportunity? Are we at the end of the incremental margin opportunity based on some of the quarter-to-quarter guidance? Or is that just more timing around market impact?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, so, again, where we are right now, Bill, like $790 billion in AUM, we'd sort of be right in line with our average AUM for 2015, maybe even a little bit below.","So we'd actually, all things equal, expect revenues if you're just flat, no market impact, which is the way we tend to look at things, you could see revenues down year-over-year if we didn't have any organic growth or anything like that going on.","So the topic of margin, incremental margin, it's an important one. But it's not necessarily one that applies perfectly in this environment. Obviously, we want our assets to grow with market and our assets will grow with organic growth. Both those things said, we're absolutely going to see that 50% to 65% incremental margin impact be there. If revenues are down, you'd want it to be as little as possible. If revenues are up, you want it to be as high as possible. We certainly get that point.","We're obviously working hard to position the firm for results in terms of margin that the Street will certainly respect and appreciate. We're still working it through and you're going to get a lot more color in terms of thoughts around guidance for 2016 on expenses at the next call. Just know that we're very aware, we're very tuned to it and we're working hard to try to manage the expenses in light of this volatile market.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, Bill, what I would add, though, I would say, subject to this short-term volatility that we have in the downdraft, nothing has changed in our long-term outlook. In fact, I couldn't feel more confident about that and that in a more normal market that is where we are.","And also at the same time, what we are absolutely trying to do is deliver the financial results that would be expected of us while at the same time not be penny-wise and pound-foolish and not investing things that really separate us from a competitive advantage in the marketplace and also we believe generate the results for the client. So we are trying to do both and we're very focused on doing that.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I appreciate your update for the October flows. So it sounds like the active business is in still slight outflow mode. From your comments, it sounds like Asia is doing pretty well and maybe European Equity. Is it U.S. that continues to be the bugaboo? If that's the case, any strategic thoughts on how you try and ramp that to may be more of a positive market share opportunity?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, much of it, if you look at the overall industry results, that really is frankly where the U.S. mutual fund industry is. Now, that doesn't make anybody happy in the short-term. I still have a high degree of confidence in \u2013 may be in great products and great things for clients. And we continue to generate the performance that will ultimately serve clients very well, and serving the distribution partners in a way that will be more important to them moving forward. So I think we're doing all the right things.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","I would also say, I mean, we're continuing to be good traction with some of the liquid alternatives getting put on platforms. Some of the performance on these products, again, like GTR, we have this market neutral product is spectacular. So it's exciting. We're seeing the daily flows around GTR even in the U.S. grow every single month.","So there's definitely some element of potential here. Then other products, like Diversified Dividend has been positive, I think every single month for the last year. And definitely growing in its traction too. So there's definitely some positive things, despite the market overlay, which has been somewhat negative for Domestic Equity.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Just wanted to highlight the \u2013 or discuss the institutional pipeline. It seems like a lot of the same names in terms of the funds are in there, in terms of the strength. I guess is there anything that's may be fallen out, given some of the implications of the third quarter or may be the outlook isn't as good or, and also just kind of walk through the funds that obviously are in there?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, Dan. I think nothing has fallen out. Everything is sort of moving in line with what we've been seeing. Probably again, the biggest grower continues to be GTR. Real estate continues to do very, very well. We're seeing broad fixed income really move \u2013 a big mover, and so that continues. General multi-asset, IBRA, as well continues to flow well. International does well, fund \u2013 is also \u2013 so it's pretty diversified across many, many different capabilities, and also across all the regions, too. So we don't feel at all like the institutional story is weakening. If anything, it may be, that we'll have \u2013 something is funded, and \u2013 but we're near the all-time high, and we expect to sort of see those all-time highs continue to get hit going forward.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. And then I guess, just on GTR, could you give us some specifics on kind of the way that AUM sits in terms of the overall complex, and kind of where that product is being marketed today?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, so it's probably mostly focused in the UK, that's where the greatest asset base is, retail, as well as institutional. Europe, it is absolutely getting traction \u2013 traction now. Asia really early days, so nothing really to talk about. And then as I mentioned, in the U.S., getting viewed and rated by the consultants, which is important.","And then on the retail platform, growing every single day. I think of the total assets right now, $10 billion, pipeline $1.4 billion on top of that. So again, it's definitely continuing to impress. And very encouraging thing is in this last market environment, performance has been outstanding. So I think people are really paying attention to it.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Robert Lee of KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a question on capital management, and Marty, I heard earlier, and I think, maybe it was Loren, on the share buybacks, obviously accelerated this quarter, kind of find the stock at a level that probably is still prone to buyback more than your average. But I think back this quarter, you did the debt offering. I think you more or less reached the liquidity levels you've long talked about wanting to maintain on balance sheet.","So in light of that, and the fact that you really haven't, aren't too interested in M&A, I guess going forward, is it reasonable to assume that notwithstanding the near-term pickup in share repurchase that we could see just an ongoing higher level of repurchase going forward than maybe we've seen the last couple years, as you don't have to kind of build cash on the balance sheet to get to your targets?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Let me make a couple comments, and Loren can chime in. So \u2013 it's exactly the right question, the reasonable question to ask. Part of what we said with the target, so it's also getting some clarity in the regulatory environment. And I don't think we've come to the end of that honestly. And so we just want to continue to be a little bit cautious there. We're feeling better than we felt 12 months ago, for sure.","We also continue, as I've said a couple times on this call, that we really do see some really important investments that we can make in the business that frankly will generate better returns in us buying back the stock, and limiting our ability to make those investments that we need. But we like buying our stock, and that's for sure (42:29).","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","I'll just ask as maybe the follow-up to that. I mean, I know the last couple years, your level of seed capital has risen, has gone up. And do you feel like that's starting to get to a point where it's more about recycling, or do you see that there's, just given the opportunity do you see that, that actually going to continue to grow somewhat next year or so?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","I guess, I can comment on it. I mean, it is \u2013 because the alternatives continue to be such a point of focus for investors and the need to co-invest alongside important parts of our business that really require co-investment. It probably is \u2013 continue to be a theme for us. And it's a competitive advantage in many ways, the fact that we can do this, where others may be more capital constrained and not able to do it. So it's something that's part of our planning process, and we look at the products that we know we're going to need to put capital behind and earmark some of that for those types of activities, which again sort of leads us to be perhaps just a little bit more conservative than some others who may not be using their capital in that way or don't have the capabilities that need capital the way the real estate and others do.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, and then maybe one last question, and thanks for your patience on ETFs. You touched on earlier, flows rebounded quarter to-date, that's great. And but it feels like competition is coming out of the woodwork, particularly in the so-called smart beta space...","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yes.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","...where you operate. And some of those competitors seem intent to compete on price. I'm just curious if you're seeing that have any impact on, on demand. I mean, apparently not since your flows are good. But just kind of your thoughts around that dynamic and how you think about responding if you need to?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, take a step back and I think when you put on your U.S. hat, we tend to think of smart beta, we tend to think of ETFs as one thing. We have separated them as a firm in a way that we approach it and it's a combination of actually our quantitative team actually in Frankfurt we're with, who have a very, very long track record and systematic factor investing. And outside of the U.S., the continent in particular, in Asia you're starting to see it more, different, separate account-type mandates in the area.","So it's the combination of that, and the vehicle, the ETF being, so we look at it as important parts of the world, there's an opportunity for us, and when you look at the breadth of team, the depth of team, the length of track record, and I think that's the other thing that people \u2013 you don't need to pay attention to. You are in much better position when you have a long track record in anything, right? And if you look at the track records of our smart beta, capabilities in ETF, it's the broadest capability. It's the longest tenured capability with the results.","So I think more people coming in, is just confirmation that we're doing something right, and that there's demand for it. And we just look at it as a very important part of our business going forward. And to the pricing conversation, it's \u2013 we're not seeing much different than what we've seen over the last number of years.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. That was it. Thank you for taking my questions.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Good morning.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Continuing with the theme, so first PowerShares, can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of ETFs outside the U.S.? And to what extent are you seeing evidence of kind of a ramp in the UK with RDR kind of getting underway? And then, in line with that or understanding a smart beta is gaining momentum, especially in Europe, especially with institutional investors, so is there a way to kind of link what's happening with PowerShares in the U.S. in ETFs to what may be demand by institutional clients in Europe for smart beta? Thanks.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, so good question. That's what I was trying to get to, so I'll try to be more clear, Ken. So ETFs outside \u2013 so RDR, it really has not taken off like we thought it would take off. That said, our focus with our ETFs, the U.S.-listed ones, it really tends to be through the Capital Markets' desk, and that has been a helpful thing. But we've not yet seen the uptake of it with RDR.","We're thinking about it that actually smart beta factor investing, however you want to call it, it might make more sense to be bringing in a different type of vehicle, more an open-ended fund for RDR. And our engine is not limited to PowerShares, but it's our quantitative team, again like \u2013 who have this very long, deep track record. And you're right. So we're seeing it in particular on the continent and we're actually seeing it in Asia, Japan, China, so it is really \u2013 but again, it's not limited to the ETF package. And I think that's also what's very important.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And...","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Does that answer your question?","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, that gets to the heart of it. And then we'll try this. Talk about the changes going on in the Japanese postal service. And if it's appropriate, would you tie what seems to be changing opportunities there to what is your very big presence in Japan?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","I hear the question. I'm not going to speak specifically of institutions, but what I will say is that Abenomics has changed things. It is creating real opportunities outside of local JGBs and pension plans. And so, it's been an expansion into Japanese equities, it's been an extension into fixed income, investment grade type fixed income, bank loans, so it is really broadening. And it looks like for the foreseeable future, I'm sorry, it's dangerous to say, but let's put it this way. It continues to be quite an opportunity, I'd say within Japan.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","I'd say \u2013 also to say that, because of the investments and the time that we've spent building out our fixed income capabilities in our team, there's a lot of interest in the products, the fixed income products that we're now offering that, I think may be displacing others who maybe at levels of concentration that the clients don't feel comfortable with.","So I mean, there may be some of that, that's going on too, that's helping us, now that we have a very, very strong offering.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. First question on IBRA, yeah, you guys sound like you're pretty constructive on that particular product. But the data we're tracking, which given it's very limited, it's limited to just U.S. retail is showing kind of outflows there. So just wondering, if you guys can expand a little bit on where you're seeing the demand for IBRA, is it institutionally-oriented at this point?","And then if the U.S. retail is an outflow, I'm wondering, why that is. It seems like this quarter given all of the risks off, would have been a good quarter potentially for that product. So any color you could provide there would be helpful.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","So you're right. Retail is out in the U.S. on IBRA, institutional is positive, so we're seeing continued take on IBRA. Obviously, in the retail space, IBRA is competing with a whole variety of different types of funds with different capabilities for the institutional investors, much more specific, someone is looking for a risk parity product, they're going to come to us, because we have one of the best capabilities that's available.","So \u2013 and the risk parity offering is one that's getting more and more acceptance in the consultant community. So that's why IBRA is doing well, I think in institutional. I think the fear is right now for IBRA on the retail side is what's going to happen with the Fed raising rates, and how, you know, how will it form.","And again, we feel quite comfortable that our product will perform well under sort of a rate hike increase. But people are skittish at this point, and generally the market is skittish about that one topic overall, which is keeping people a little bit off side.","The product still has a very good, strong long-term performance around one year, three years, five years. And so it's not a performance topic, it's entirely I think just an investor apprehension topic at this point.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And did you guys disclose the large institutional redemption that you had this quarter? And if you haven't yet, can you disclose it? And then maybe a little color on why that particular redemption occurred.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","So all we're really going to say about that particular thing, because we don't talk about clients, it's our policy not to talk, it's about $2 billion in size. Asian Equity was the mandate. It wasn't at the highest fee level, it was fairly below a normal retail product, well below. And we felt, as Marty said, it was an isolated event.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Ken Hill of Barclays.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon to you guys there. Last quarter I think you discussed a little bit on the liquidity for your products. I'm wondering if you've had any discussions with regulators regarding maybe some of your more alternative style ETFs, PowerShares franchise. And has that sparked any concern internally or with the SEC? And how might you think about that moving forward? I guess really are you looking at regulation causing any sort of disruption going forward?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, it's a good question. I think we've just seen the beginnings of the liquidity framework coming out from the SEC. The industry is very involved, have been very involved, will continue to be very involved. And so at a specific company level, too, we are very involved in those conversations, wanting to get to the right place with those and so it'd be too early to describe a point of view.","Obviously, we know what the regulations are trying to get to and, at the same time, we want to make sure that they understand the framework they've put in place doesn't cause unintended consequences. So I still think we're a good number of months before having a view on the exact end game there. It's just an unknown at the moment.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. I guess then just a little bit more generally on Europe, I know you guys have worked very hard to build a strong platform there and we've seen some more positive sentiment around further easing there. How would you characterize the opportunity for higher flows in Europe? And on the back of some of the monetary easing, what are you trying to do to capture that longer term?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","We have been quite successful the last number of years here, but it came from multiple years of improving the range of capabilities, the service levels, et cetera. We are still relatively early innings on the impact that we can have on the continent.","Strong team in place, strong products in place, good performance. What we are now getting through and improving is the acceptance of our products as top-tier partner-type recognition. Within a number of the big distributors we've made good progress, but we're not done. So that makes us feel that the future will be quite bright.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Chris Shutler of William Blair.","Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. First, just based on the product mix, where you sit today and where you're seeing flows, just wanted to get your thoughts on the fee rate going forward?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, Chris, again, the product will have some impact so will the geographies in which they are being sold. We think overall the product mix is leaning more towards alternatives, and that's helpful. We have never been traditionally an enormous provider of lower fee fixed income products, for example, or in our ETFs, as you mentioned, as we know, kind of at the higher fee range.","There's a lot of expectation that Europe and Asia will continue to grow. And they have certainly significantly higher net revenue yields in aggregate relative to the U.S. So all that said, I think we would believe our fee rate will continue to march up from where it is based on mix.","Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. That makes sense. And then secondly, just wanted to get an update on the Wilbur Ross business. You haven't talked about that in a while, and just the outlook for performance fees there over the next few years. Thanks.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","So, again, without \u2013 because I'm not (56:20) terrible at predicting performance fees. I know that. The performance on the products have been good. It's been a very volatile market, though, so things can move around quite dramatically.","Based on everything that we know, the embedded performance fees and carry within the products that we would be able to access in terms of performance fees, which would be Fund 4 and Fund 5, are significant, and it's probably an aggregate something on the order of nature of something you've seen for a full year for us in the past. So it's a pretty significant element.","Timing-wise is a big unknown. Very unlikely to be realized in 2016. More likely than not 2017 just given the fact that the dispositions that would have to take place in those portfolios would be significant before we, from an accounting perspective, would be allowed to recognize any performance fees. There's still a fair amount of time to go, so that's why we don't talk about it that much, because anything can happen in markets and there's a lot of things that can happen in a year. But based on right now, it's pretty significant, pretty attractive.","Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Understood. Thank you.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question coming from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, folks. Marty or Loren, just to circle back on GTR and the pipeline. How do you think about the fee rate overall, I think it was 100 basis points roughly? And correct me if I'm wrong on that. And then just bifurcating between retail and institutional, in that fee rate and how you see the pipeline on the institutional side for GTR versus the retail demand. And if you can say what GTR flows were in the third quarter, if I missed that.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, so, again, I think on the retail side our pricing is transparent. You can see those numbers. I think it's like 90 basis points to 100 basis points. On the institutional side, I don't think we get into disclosing those fees. Its prices are in line with I'd say the normal differential you'd expect from a retail versus institutional. So it's a nice price, very, very attractively priced.","In terms of the pipeline and the opportunity, I think we're seeing, really just because it's easy to see, the huge take on on the institutional side that is giving us a lot of comfort that it's going to be growing certainly on the institutional side.","Retail capabilities, probably even larger. But it's hard to quantify ultimately how big it could get. We know just how large some of the competing products are on the retail side. And so, and again, in terms of, I guess just even in the third quarter, the flows were about $3 billion for GTR in aggregate across retail and institutional. So it has a lot of capacity to grow on both sides. And it's just brand-new, as we mention, in the U.S. and just really kicking off in Europe and Asia, it's also brand-new. So great opportunities.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great. That's helpful. And then Marty, just if you want to talk a little bit about on the institutional solution strategy, as you mentioned, I think you're not seeing the \u2013 some of the redemptions in sovereign wealth funds like others are seeing.","But if you can comment on your view of pension plans certainly in the U.S., reallocating more to fixed income into fees and liabilities, and how you think you've been developing your solution strategy to capture that, to basically retain the assets with the client.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, so our approach to solutions is really is literally, again, they tend to be the most obvious is the larger institutions. And it's really facing off to understand them when you're more (1:00:26) what they're trying to accomplish. And it ultimately is bringing a number of different investment capabilities to meet what they are trying to achieve. And again, I'd say that's really early days for us, but also very important.","On the retail side where people are less focused, it also is an opportunity where more and more of financial advisors and sort of the higher end financial advisors are also looking for \u2013 they have the ability to get that type of feedback and guidance from money managers. And that's the other area where we've been having some early successes. So again, I'd just look at it as a part of \u2013 just what you need to be doing as an organization, and I think we're doing it reasonably well, but we sure have some room to do better than what we are.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Just one lastly on the buyback. I assume you're sort of locked up until earnings are through. Is that \u2013 when are you able to go back in the market for buying back your stock?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Well, just a day after earnings. I think we can get back in 24 hours...","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets.","Rosa Han - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good morning. This is actually Rosa Han standing in for Eric Berg. Our first question is, how do you perceive the rise in interest rates would affect your fixed income flows? And would those flows necessarily turn negative?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Again, simple question, harder answer because of the magnitude of it. But yeah, probably what you'll see is a lot of the credit type capabilities will probably still be in demand. They seem to be in demand, and that's what clients are looking at right now as they anticipate a slow rise in interest rate. So if it is a slow rise in interest rates, we don't see a big rush to the doors.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. And it just helps at some of our largest well-known funds, like the bank loan capabilities would tend to do well and we're seeing actually \u2013 in October our bank loan ETFs and positive inflow just as people are beginning to expect a rate hike in December sometime.","Rosa Han - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. And then what are your latest thoughts on how the SEC's proposal to strengthen the mutual fund liquidity might affect your company?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. Again, we were speaking to it little bit earlier. It's \u2013 again, it's \u2013 the early feedback, the industry is very engaged on it. There is some thoughtful comments in there. And there's some areas where there really needs some improvement. And we're not going to know for a number of months what the outcome is. So it's hard to predict, to give you a specific answer until we get through that process.","Rosa Han - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. It may be too soon for this, but I thought I'd throw it in at the end if we had time. We're expecting the final method two rules next month. And I'm curious, how much preliminary work you've done on what it could mean for your business either expense-wise or margin-wise and if you have done a good amount of work, maybe give us some, an early read on what you're thinking.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Like us, everybody, that's operating over here is dealing with it and it's been in the works in our organization, always coupled for a good period of time. So, it's really well embedded. And we don't see any immaterial consequences to our business really at all from it.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question coming from the line of Michael Kim of Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey, guys. Just a quick technical follow-up. Just want to understand the dynamic between the 5 million share repurchases during the quarter versus the average share count being down just a bit less.

Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","The buyback happened late in the quarter.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah, got it.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to turn call over to your speakers for today Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco and Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan you may begin.","Marty Flanagan","Thank you very much and thank you for joining us on our third quarter call. As is our practice, I will review the business results for the third quarter and then Loren will go into greater details about the financials and then we'll open up to Q&A after that. So, let me begin by highlighting the firm\u2019s operating results for the quarter and you will find this on slide 4 if you happen to be following the presentation, which is available on our website. Long-term investment performance remains you know continued very strong at 68% to 79% of actively managed assets, we are ahead of peers on a three and five year basis respectively. Our continued focus on leveraging our broad investment capabilities provide meaningful solutions to client contribute to solid operating results during the quarter and what I think all of us would describe as a difficult business environment for money managers. Strong investment performance helped drive robust long-term net flows of $1.2 billion during the quarter, reflecting solid retail and institution demand across both active and passive capabilities. And total flows during the quarter were just over $19 billion.","Adjusted operating margin was 39.7%, an improvement over the prior quarter that reflects our continued focus on running a disciplined business. We also returned $176 million shareholders through dividends, buyback during the quarter. Assets under management were $820 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $779 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income was $399 million in the quarter, up from $330 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.60 this quarter versus $0.56 in the prior quarter and as noted earlier in the year we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share, which is up nearly 4% from the prior. We also continued our stock program during the quarter. And before Loren goes into detail on the financials let me take a moment to review the investment performance inflows for the quarter. Turning to slide 7 now, our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain a strong investment culture helped us deliver solid long-term investment performance across the enterprise during the quarter. Looking at the firm as a whole, 68% of assets were in the top half. On a three-year basis, 79% were in the top half on a five-year basis. On page 8, you\u2019ll see the quarterly long-term flows of $12.2 billion were quite strong across both active and passive capabilities.","Flows in the passive capabilities were driven by strong demand from Invesco PowerShares capabilities which has an all-weather line-up that\u2019s well positioned to meet client demand in any type of market. This was the second-best quarter for Invesco PowerShares in its history with roughly $4 billion in net flows and strong flows are helping us continue to gain ETF market share. As we noted during or recent Investor Day, strong passive flows reflected our longevity in ETF market, our deep experience, our comprehensive range of factor and smart data capabilities and our significant track record of innovation. Results on the active side were equally as impressive with solid demand in multi-asset given an income capability, fixed income and other capabilities such as real estate. I will focus on delivery and strong investment performance in bringing our broad range of capabilities to clients contributed positive results in Asia-Pacific with strengths across both retail and institutional channels.","Globally we saw institutional flows during the quarter, which continues a series of positive institutional flows going back more than two years now. Client demand trends remain consistent with particular interest in fixed income, multi-asset and real estate and are one but not funded and qualified opportunities are at all-time high. Retail flows also our strongest gross sales rebounded nicely and redemptions moderated during the quarter. This includes a $6.5 billion Rhode Island 529 mandate. Before I hand the call over to Loren let me say a few words about how Invesco is positioned against the changes being brought by the DOL fiduciary rule. We actively engaged with clients as they work to alignment platforms that demands fiduciary rule as we make clear sense of rules approval the key decisions reside with the distribution platforms but we are actively supporting them. The market has gotten an early scare from [indiscernible] Merrill Lynch and last night from Morgan Stanley, but I believe we are still in a very dynamic period with regard to how we\u2019ll play out. It is clear each distributor has a different business mix and we will implement the rule in a manner that will meet its client needs. Based on the discussions we are having with clients we continue to believe that our comprehensive range of capabilities, our distribution expertise, our market leadership all positions us extremely well to help our clients [indiscernible]. If the shift is towards passive as some believe, a decade of ETF experience, our comprehensive range of factors and smart data capabilities, our scale, our significant track record of innovation all put us in a very competitive position. As mentioned during the investor day there are low barriers to entry but very high hurdles [indiscernible] in the EFT business, it will make it difficult for latecomers to do well.","Now I will turn the call over to Loren to review the financials.","Loren Starr","Thanks very much Marty, quarter over quarter our total assets under management increased 48.6 billion or 5.2%, this was driven by positive market returns of 23.6 billion and we also saw long-term net inflows of $12.2 billion which included as you know $6.5 billion related to Invesco\u2019s Rhode Island 529 plan win. We also saw inflows from money market and QQQs of 5.9 billion and 1.1 billion respectively, these were offset by negative FX translation which amounted to $2.2 billion. Our average AUM for the third quarter was $814.1 billion that was up 3.8% versus the second quarter. Our annualized long-term growth rate in Q3 was 7.1% and that was up from 2.6% in the second quarter. This measure represents our long-term flows in the quarter divided by the beginning of period long term AUM which excludes the institutional money market assets and the QQQ assets. Our net revenue yield came in at 42 basis points which was 1.7 basis points lower than the prior quarter. The change in mix largely driven by currency reduced the yield by 1.1 basis points. This was primarily a result of declining pound sterling rate which was 8.4% lower on average during the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Also, we saw a decrease in other revenues which reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points and lower performance fees in the quarter further depressed the yields by 0.3 basis points. These factors were offset by one more day in the period which increased the yield by 0.4 basis points.","A little bit of guidance here, looking forward to the fourth quarter we would expect our net revenue yield to be roughly in line with the third quarter level at 42 basis points assuming consistent market and FX levels in line today. So moving onto slide 12 as we\u2019ve done before we provide the US GAAP operating results for the quarter, my comments today however will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP GAAP adjusted measures which can be found on slide 13. Slide 13, you will see net revenues decreased by 1,9 million or 0.2% quarter over quarter to $854.7 million which includes a negative FX rate impact of $18.5 million. Within the net revenue number, you will see that adjusted investment management fees increased by 19.8 million or 2.1% to 982.7 million, this reflects higher average AUM for the quarter partially offset by the impact of currency on our AUM mix. FX decreased adjusted investment management fees by 23 million. Adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $10 million or 4.9% reflecting higher average AUM for retail products. FX decreased adjusted service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Adjusted performance fees came in at $3.8 million in Q3 and were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities including $2.3 million from bank loan products. Foreign exchange decreased these fees by 0.1 million.","Again some guidance here, in Q4 we'd expect performance fees to be in line with our historical guidance at 5 million in the quarter. Adjusted other revenues in the third quarter were $19.3 million and that was an decrease of 12.4 million from the prior quarter primarily due to a decrease of 7.3 million in transaction fees from real estate and 2 million decrease in transactional sales charges from our UIT products. Foreign exchange decreased these revenues by $0.1 million. Some guidance here looking forward to Q4, we would expect to see this number increase in the range of $23 million to 25 million. Third-party distribution services and advisory expense which we net against growth revenues increased by 13.8 million or 3.9% and this movement was in line with higher revenues derived from our retail assets under management, FX decreased these expenses by 4.8 million. Moving on down the slide you\u2019ll see that adjusted operating expenses at 515.4 million decreased by 10.8 million or 2.1% relatively to the second quarter. Foreign exchange reduced adjusted operating expenses by $8.2 million during the quarter. Our adjusted employee compensation came in at 339.1 million, a drop of 8.8 million or 2.5% and this was due to lower variable compensation on performance fees. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted compensation by 5.1 million, adjusted marketing expenses fell by 2.2 million or 7.6%, 26.8 million reflecting fewer client events held in the quarter, FX decreased adjusted marketing expense by 0.3 million in the quarter. Our adjusted property office in tech expenses were 82.1 million in the quarter, a decrease of 0.7 million over the second quarter and FX decreased these expenses by 1.2 million.","And then adjusted G&A expenses at 67.4 million increased 0.9 million or 1.4% and this was driven by cost associated with several new product introductions. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted G&A by 1.6 million. Again some guidance from Q4, we would expect to see these expense line-items roughly flat with the third quarter other than marketing. We expect marketing spend to increase in the range of 32 to 35 million which is seasonally consistent with prior years. Continuing on down the page, you will see that our adjusted non-operating income increased 9 million compared to the second quarter. This was primarily driven by 4.9 million again realized on our pound sterling US dollar hedge as well as due to mark to market gains in our seed money investments in the third quarter. Firms\u2019 effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income in Q3 came in at 26.5% consistent with prior quarter and guidance here looking forward to the fourth quarter; we believe our tax rate will increase slightly to 27% largely due to the currency impact on the mix of our earnings.","And this brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.60 and adjusted net operating margin of 39.7%. I would say just generally as you probably would expect that foreign exchanges had a real impact on our operating results as reported in US dollars. Just to quantify that for you, when we look at our Q3 versus Q2 results, our operating EPS was resulted $0.018 lower as a result of foreign exchange as well as our margin being impacted by 0.3%. Looking at year-over-year, Q3 to Q3, the numbers are larger obviously, EPS is down $0.034 cents due to currency and our margin is done 0.7% as a result of FX only. So, with that before I turn over to Marty, I would also like to provider a quick update on the business optimization work that we implemented in Q4 of last year. We made very good progress on our optimization efforts and have generated approximately 14 million in annual run rate savings by the end of the third quarter. Some of the bigger opportunities are ahead of us however. But we are confident that we will be able to achieve the targeted rate savings number as we've discussed of 30 to 45 million in 2017.","And with that I would like turn it back to Marty.","Marty Flanagan","Thank you operator, could you open up it for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead.","Robert Lee","Marty can you maybe breakdown I guess a little bit more color on kind of the retail flow trend, I know I think you mentioned Asia Pac but kind of give some sense of what you're seeing Asia, US versus EMEA and then maybe are we getting any sense that ahead of the overall implementation that\u2019s starting to - at this point starting to change kind of investor behavior or activity levels in the US.","Marty Flanagan","Good questions. So I\u2019ll make some comments and ask Loren to come for some of the more specifics. So Asia-Pacific in particular is having a tremendous year both retail and institutional and it is also very broad base there. EMEA continues to be strong for us, we've had that the Brexit and some of the challenges on the continent. Generally it is lower than what we had seen previously but the UK would have really come back from that reserve, the Brexit low but again not robust that inflows as we saw a year ago. But again I think we feel we are on track. In the States with regard to DOL rule, it\u2019s hard to point to the behavior with anything to do with the DOL. I think it\u2019s still more the active passive debate that\u2019s really probably driving behavior more than anything right now. Will it change going forward, it will definitely put an awful lot of money in motion in the US retail channel, there is just no question in my mind as people make the changes from brokerage to advisory and as brokers narrow the platform of money managers and so what that sets up there will definitely be winners and losers and again I think those firms with the breadth of capabilities of both active and passive capabilities are going to be the ones that do well lot of it. Loren you want a little more.","Loren Starr","I mean just a little bit more color, I mean in Asia Pac we are seeing significant flows coming in, particularly into Japan [indiscernible] has a big winner there. We are also seeing China mutual funds flows in our joint venture providing good lift and that\u2019s been pretty consistent. In continental Europe net flows continue to really be a little bit mix but our GTR product in particular just every quarter continues to grow both in the UK and in continental Europe. So that\u2019s a continued trend and we are very excited about some of the new product introductions FYI in terms of income oriented products that is similar to GTR product. In the US, it has been sort of a mix of things we are seeing very strong take on products like our diversified dividend product, our core bond plus fund is doing very well and then certainly ETFs, very strong flow into senior loan products and another fixed income products. So I think we are third most successful ETF provider in fixed income year-to-date in the US. So that\u2019s a trend. And then some of that in the [indiscernible] has been some outflows in some of the other products that are more value oriented that have seen performance tick down a little bit. Hopefully that gives you some good color.","Robert Lee","And maybe just quick follow-up and second maybe with the DOL theme. I mean obviously there has been all those focus of whether it\u2019s\u2019 due to the mutual fund business and brokerage versus advisory. I would expect that if more money moves to advisory as I think broadly expected that benefits, the SMA business. So could you maybe update us on kind of how you feel about your positioning in the SMA business is that a part of the business that you\u2019ve you know how big is that for you and do you true feel like you have the right offering there or you need to invest in that in those strategies.","Marty Flanagan","So a good question. So we have an SME capability have for a long, long, long time like many people. So again it\u2019s not limited to at all a limitation for us. So we would like to look at it as another vehicle offering to deliver our investment capabilities and again that would be I agree with you it is a need that firms are going to have, they don't have it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Craig Siegenthaler","I have a follow-up on the DOL rule, and I\u2019m assuming I probably won't be the last one in this call either. But I'm just wondering are you actually seeing brokers strength the numbers, partners they work with just yet and I'm also wondering what key components of Invesco's platform do you think the firm will you think will help the firm remain large at the main US brokers and in some cases you think you actually be able to increase your share?","Marty Flanagan","I don\u2019t want to get ahead of what announcements have been made and not been made because I'm not sure what's public and what's not, it does seem and it's only been different firm by firm. So I think that\u2019s the first point, I think so often when we have these conversations we think it is going to be a generic outcome and it\u2019s not. And as I said, if you just look at where Merrill Lynch is going where Edward Jones seems to be going and where now Morgan Stanley seem to be going with all the public information you can see that they are taking different approaches to it. That said, the firms that are going to do well which we have been suspecting and again it seems that we are getting early confirmation are those firm with broad ranges of capabilities that are strongly performing they are going to - they\u2019ll do fine in this. We\u2019ve put ourselves in that category.","Those firms that actually have ETFs a long track record of ETFs, they\u2019ll also do well those are capabilities that are in need and I pull a third element into where again it is different firm by firm by but those firms that can take the capabilities whether it be a mutual fund or an ETF vehicle and help rate solutions for clients and this is even at the broker level are going to do well. The other element that people are talking about I think and I think we all get in the right context the price sensitivity it is real, the way that the financial advisor is going to meet that need is really a combination of active and passive capabilities that will drive down the overall effective key rate for their clients which is a good thing. And again I think specifically vehicle by vehicle, you need to be competitively priced. If you are selling at a premium price and if you are very strong performance, you\u2019d probably, hopefully can keep it there but there is going to be real pressure there. If you\u2019re at a premium price or not performing well you are in a lot of trouble. And we do believe that the platforms, they will be narrowed and they will be - and again each firm is going be different and we look at ourselves as being on the right side of those outcomes.","Operator","Our next question is from [indiscernible] with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","I can\u2019t help myself either, on DOL, can you give us a sense of what percentage if you have it, I know it\u2019s tough given the omnibus relationships that you have with your distributors, what generally if you have it, what percentage of your retail is bucket into brokerage oriented qualified accounts versus advisory?","Marty Flanagan","I don't have that right now but again I'd still come back to the point you're probably making is if you\u2019re brokerage it\u2019s going to go away its\u2019 all going to go to advisors and you're going to be a loser and I don't think you can make that draw that conclusion from what we are seeing. Again just look at Morgan Stanley in the announcement today they're going to keep the advisory and brokerage both open and again I think it doesn't really matter how our capability is there whether it\u2019s in the brokerage channel or in the advisory channel, you have a good capability, you\u2019re going to continue to be there. So, again I know I\u2019m not getting the specific number you're talking about I just don't have it here.","Unidentified Analyst","Stepping back there seems to be a bit of a pickup of M&A discussion you've seen it in some of your markets alright with Janus Henderson [indiscernible]. What\u2019s your sense of how the industry deals with this excess capacity muted active flows and some of the regulatory changes, would you anticipate a big wave of consolidation and what kind of shape and form you think it takes and what\u2019s Invesco's role in that?","Marty Flanagan","A good question, look, you've been around the industry a long time and so by now there is a declaration of massive consolidation for a couple of decades. I would say the reality is the environment we are in now which support that notion more than never before. And I\u2019d say much has been driven by the regulatory environment principally and just the ever increasing cost you then have things like cyber security areas where we all spend a lot of money where we never did before. And then the extended period of active passive movement which again I would also say it is when you read about in the paper every day it's probably going to far right, it\u2019s not going back to where it was but it would moderate and I do believe there will be very strong place for active capabilities too. And again we are in a position of we take the answers active and passive. So we are well placed regardless. So, I think what you\u2019re going to have happen in the M&A front is you were firm a without scale I think you\u2019re going to need to do something and so I think you are going to see the likelihood of combinations of undersized firms is probably higher than it\u2019s ever been before. And the other point though is somebody has to be a willing buyer and not everybody is going to be willing buyer of some of those firms. So, I think what you\u2019ll see is organic growth coming from firms that really are not well positioned in this environment.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Hey Loren, maybe just a couple for you on some of guidance that you gave. So one is just on the other revenues, the rate or the level you gave is a little bit lower than where our expectations have been. So just - is that just fourth quarter, we\u2019re heading into \u201817, I know it's lumpy and hard to predict, but just wanted to gauge kind of what's driving that. And then I think on the expense side, you gave a lot of color on FX in terms of how that's impacting the revenues, the expenses and then the hedge and the non-op, and I know you\u2019ve got the efficiency program in place to lower the run rate, but if we\u2019re continuing to be in this environment, is there any other levers you can pull on the expense side or how much can be offset by FX, pulling that down, just to try to manage through this volatile FX backdrop?","Loren Starr","So, good questions. So, on the other revenues, that was specifically just for Q4 guidance, we don't think it\u2019s really a trend. Obviously, it moves around, it's hard to predict and we've seen that line can be somewhat volatile based on timing, just in terms of transactions happening, they can lump up in a particular quarter or be a little bit absent in the quarter. And then certainly when there is more volatility uncertainty in the markets, you can see that number, there is a slowdown, there is a component of our UIT sales that has slowed down, just in line of - in respect to the DOL, uncertainties. And so I think that is something that should hopefully begin to be more clear as to whether that's the true run rate or whether it can come back. But I think right now, we\u2019re looking quarter-to-quarter on that line item. So that\u2019s it.","In terms of expenses, is there more to be done, I mean, there is always more that can be done. We\u2019re continuing to look beyond some of the things that we identified in the optimization to see if there are other sort of larger opportunities that can be realized into 2017. As we all know, when we get into our - looking out three years and understanding the need for our incremental margins to be where we want them to be, we have to continue to look and find ways to organize ourselves in a way that would provide that outcome. So I would say there is more to come on that to the extent that we can identify them, but certainly in the near-term, in terms of the optimization, we are eagerly going after those.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then Marty, maybe just as a follow-up and the question on M&A in the industry. I guess has anything changed for you guys, meaning it seems like you've done things in the past that have kind of created the business mix that you have. You've been more focused on either launching products, small things on the side and then capital management, whether it\u2019s the dividend or the buyback. Just is there anything that you see shifting in the industry that would cause the firm like you like that has scale to think that you need to become bigger or do something that\u2019s maybe not - that hasn't been the default over the past couple of years?","Marty Flanagan","So I would say, like always, we continue to pay attention to what's available in the marketplace and the way that we look at it really has not changed, is it filling a skill gap for region, those types of obvious things, we\u2019ll continue to do that. There are fewer gaps now than we\u2019ve ever had. I mean, and it gets back to the comment to Bill's question and others in the DOL. We think we've put the firm in a position where client demand is right, whether be alternatives, passive capabilities through factor investing ETFs, et cetera. The institutional business continues to be a huge opportunity for us and the like. That said, we\u2019ll continue to pay attention to what's going out there. I think it's again just my opinion, those firms that are narrowly focused are going to be dramatically more challenged than those firms that are global in the retail market, the institutional market and have a broad range of high conviction fundamental factor-based capabilities. So, but again, we\u2019ll continue to pay attention.","Loren Starr","Michael, maybe one more point because I know your question with legitimate, but I think we\u2019re spending more time honestly thinking about ways that we are going to grow revenues as opposed to we\u2019re going to be in a position where we\u2019re having to cut costs, so we\u2019re continuing to invest around new product introductions, continue to strengthen our capabilities. As Marty has mentioned, I mean we think we are well-positioned to actually succeed in this environment. And so that\u2019s really been our focus and being able to grow organically in that 3% to 5% range I think should provide us with the ability to continue to expand margins going forward and we are not sort of looking defensively to protect ourselves. We are, I think, thinking about the opportunities to grow in this market.","Marty Flanagan","So let me stay on that, because I think this is what is different today than prior challenging times when there is a pullback, I mean the traditional playbook was market pullback focus on cutting expenses where we can do that with an eye to making sure that you don't just vanish the firm. That was really more an environment. We thought it was competitive five years ago and 10 years ago, but it\u2019s nothing like today and that's just competitive, but the market shift. So we feel again we\u2019re uniquely placed with the capabilities we have that it would be stupid of us not to continue to invest and grow the ETF business or the institutional business or the solutions business and I think to your point earlier, the most dangerous thing you can be doing, if you are a narrowly focused firm, challenge right now is to be not investing in the future, and I think that's where a lot of firms are finding themselves having to do when I think that's you\u2019re confirming about outcome as far as I am concerned. But you have to be disciplined, right, and that's why we\u2019re very, very disciplined. We\u2019re always looking to be more efficient, more effective and while at the same time invest for the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. I guess Loren, you talked about a flat fee rate for the fourth quarter. I guess if we think about the ins and outs with regards to products from a kind of a flows and your backlog and what you guys are seeing strengthening, can you talk about the direction of the fee rate based on that ex kind of markets and currencies?","Loren Starr","Yeah. I mean it\u2019s all positive. So we\u2019re continuing to see institutional pipeline at a much higher revenue yield coming in and what's coming out in terms of the mix generally of the products on the retail side. Asia, China, very positive relative to the overall fee rate for the firm. So, that which would make you think while the fee rate must be going up has been offset obviously due to the FX impacts because obviously the pound has declined even further from where we were in the third quarter and that's why it\u2019s in this flattish kind of range.","But again, the trends that have been there for a long time are still there in terms of the types of products that we\u2019re offering more alternatives, I think that it do support a higher fee rate are absolutely still there. And so we feel that it\u2019s not necessarily a situation at all where we\u2019re going to see the mix being anything but a positive for us. Other than the FX which we can't control and certainly in our operating results, you are seeing that and so people shouldn't read too much into the US dollar numbers.","Dan Fannon","Great. And then I guess Marty, the comments around each of the brokers or the warehouses coming up with different solutions, I guess just from a servicing perspective and how you guys are dealing with that, it seems like that\u2019s a burden on the industry to now have to deal with all the various different platforms in a, not in a uniform way and so that seems like costs, that seems like more investment on your guys side. I guess, is that the right way to interpret that?","Marty Flanagan","So it's a good question. Here is my view on it. So at one level, there is no change from the standpoint of those firms have always had brokerage business and advisory business and the movement to advisory has been a trend and the desire of the broker, the distributors for a number of years. So, the industry is already set up to serve that way. Now again, I\u2019d come back to in this environment, what - there is an awful lot of work to comply with the DOL and so it is firm like us that have the depth of capability through wholesale, Invesco consulting that can help make the move, because they are real moves that with their client base.","So again, we have the resources, we have the capabilities and we can help them make those changes. I think the biggest concern that I think everybody has heard over more recently was a real concern that there is going to be a large proliferation of share classes, because each distributor wanting to serve the clients in a different way and I know this is no great insight, but it seems to be the industry is coalescing probably on a couple of share classes which would be some costs associated with it, but I mean that\u2019s very doable. And I think it\u2019s much better outcome for both we and the end clients. So again I think what I would do is go back to the firms that have resources and capabilities to support their clients through this change are going to be in a better position than those that don\u2019t. And again this gets back to the part of the questions about scale and M&A. I mean, if you can support your clients beyond just an investment capability, you\u2019re at a disadvantage.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Hey, thanks, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry to add to the extensive row of tequila shots, that are the DOL questions, but I had a couple more for you, sorry. Not asking for attribution here, but thinking broadly in the dialogs that you\u2019ve had with your partners and obviously they are at a greater depth than we\u2019re seeing out in the press and such, can you give us a broad sense or even a range of how much you expect that the wealth management product shelf could end up shrinking for commission accounts?","Loren Starr","It's hard to answer that question. I would say what is a truism across-the-board, you would get the feedback that the pace to advisory account will pick up at a material rate driven by the DOL, but again I think that's consistent with the direction of travel that has been in place and, but again, you see cross currents in that, right. So Morgan Stanley has, I think, they are going to support both channels, right, but that said, their advisory business has been growing quite dramatically and it will continue to. So it\u2019s hard to size, but I think if you look back five years from now, the predominance of assets will be in advisory. I think that's a fair conclusion to draw.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Well, okay, that's fair. Good enough. And then thinking about maybe down the line where this might lead to potential cost-cutting opportunities and of course understanding that this isn\u2019t a near-term thing, right, because you just highlighted earlier how you\u2019re going to need to be there to support your partners as they go through this transition, but ultimately beyond near-term, this is probably going to lead to some pretty substantial differences in distribution dynamics, you guys do tend to have a pretty large wholesaler team. And so when you think about how those selling dynamics in to this channel might change, what kind of expense cut opportunity could that lead to if we end up seeing a channel that is more focused on home office and less on the field, can you help us try to frame what kind of opportunity ultimately that might lead to from an expense cutting perspective?","Loren Starr","Yes. So interesting perspective. I think the answer is more along this line. I don't think the demand for support is going to go down, it will probably only go up. But it will be different and so if you go back 10 years ago, if the role of a wholesaler was to, here is a great fund and here is why you should put it in your portfolio, it has a great long term track record, it is in that grade, the nature of the support is going to be very different and the field support if you want to call it that will be much more of individual\u2019s focus on solutions and how - as they are working on their asset allocation, how do you help them build a portfolio range of different investment capabilities, the range of different vehicles that would meet their need. So it would be a very different type of support.","So what you can\u2019t size right now is it doesn\u2019t stay the same, but just different skill sets or is there a sort of a size issue that you're talking about and I\u2019d say it\u2019s too early to conclude whether or not there are real cost savings there. My instincts would be the demand for the support is going to be there, but it\u2019s going to be different. So the cost savings opportunity might not necessarily be there, which then gets you back to the prior questions that again if you\u2019re not a firm with resource and capabilities to support the client, you\u2019re extremely disadvantaged in this environment going forward.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, great. Well, a lot of uncertainty, but thanks for the color and helping us walk through that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein","Thanks. Just sticking with the theme, so Marty, one of your earlier comments, you mentioned refocus on the management obviously is one of the pretty critical criteria is the shelf space. For instance, people kind of rethink would stays in and stays off. So, can we drill down a little more into that? We obviously haven't seen any aggressive fee cut reductions from the active community yet. Do you anticipate that's coming and I guess more importantly, thinking through Invesco's product lineup, which products could be more susceptible to fee cuts and I guess do you anticipate yourself make any reductions to secure shelf space?","Marty Flanagan","So, again, it's - in the light of the environment and from a macro view, I think that's a good question. I think the reality is, if you look at the larger firms right now, their fees are already very, very competitive, because they have the scale to have lower fees. So I don't sense that there is going to be a massive - within those firms, I don't think, you are going to see much of a change. I think the firms that are disadvantaged are again back to, if you don't have scale in your asset levels, your fees are almost by definition, higher and you are disadvantaged. You got to solve that one where the other and there is no lesson to solve that. So again, specifically, and again, we do, like everybody else, see all the time. We know they\u2019re very competitive and we also have the added benefit too of adding the factor-based capabilities, so we can actually help also drive down the blended fee rate within these four financial adviser and we also have solutions capabilities that we have in that portfolio too.","Alex Blostein","Okay, thanks. And then just a second question, I guess about the robust solution offering you guys bought a couple of quarters ago, can you talk a little bit about the opportunity I guess to leverage that, as the distribution dynamics evolve, I\u2019m not sure there is a way to expand that or more of the B2B concept or is this still going to be largely targeted on that directly working with the client.","Marty Flanagan","Yes, no, so early days. We are thrilled with Jemstep and it is focused on reporting our business partners. And again, I would put this in the context again of firms need more and more tools to help clients meet their needs and it is definitely going to help us with that. We see that already with the interest in it and it\u2019s frankly additional tool that will help clients with things like onboarding in a more efficient and effective way with their asset allocation, if it is open platform. So again, it is very supportive what they\u2019re doing and we think it is important development for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, there. Just a quick follow-up on a lot of this. I'm curious in terms of the factor base of ETF world specifically, as the business evolves, you gave us some good stats on the importance of first mover advantage, but when you talk about code supporting your distribution partners, how important is the established 3 to 5 year track record in terms of not just being on shelf, but actually getting the flows because what we are all seeing is a huge proliferation of products being put out by everyone [indiscernible] these days, but given your presence, how much is that 3 to 5 year track record advantage?","Marty Flanagan","It's huge. Look, I think again, go to the macro point that we\u2019ve all talked about, don't extrapolate your knowledge on mutual fund development with ETF development, right. So there is a limit to how many ETFs there can be within, as you want to call it, a certain segment and it is typically three that are successful. [indiscernible] US Equity income fund, I don't know how many there are in the category, it's probably I don\u2019t know, 400 or something. So there is an inherent limitation right there and the other thing, you\u2019re looking at real track records with these factor based ETFs that have long track as opposed to extrapolating, back testing type experiences and no one needs to take that risk when you have a broad range of capabilities.","The other elements that again, we\u2019ve talked about and others have talked about, it's the total cost of ownership of those ETF's and it's just not the fee, it\u2019s the liquidity and those firms that have a presence, they\u2019re going to get the backing to create the liquidity, which is going to drive down the total cost of ownership also. So we have founded it to be a realism that the breadth of product, first mover advantage, but, by the way, the long track records really matter a lot, and I think as we have said before, the barriers to entry are very low that the barriers to success are very high.","Glenn Schorr","I appreciate that. Just one follow-up, you mentioned in your comments on Japan, the success in selling some REIT product there as you look for yield. Can you talk about just real estate demand in general, you\u2019ve got a big real estate business, but I didn\u2019t hear too much of it in the puts or takes in terms of the current environment?","Marty Flanagan","Yeah. No. It continues to be, as we look forward in that sort of institutional pipeline and qualify, it has been high demand globally. So again, I think it\u2019s one of the best teams in the business and they continue to be doing very, very well and we don't expect that to end any time soon.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Michael Cyprys","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Marty, if I could just follow up on your point earlier on the price sensitivity is real, just curious how Invesco is planning to deal with that over the next few years, particularly as DOL goes into effect, it just seems like there is more money shifting in to passive and lower fee products, just how do you think about competitively pricing active management and the elasticity of demand? And just the second point there is just given your scale, how do you think about the opportunity to be more aggressive?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. Look, again, those are broad questions, hard to answer broad questions like that, because it gets very specific, so how I would answer it is, we look at where we are priced, our prices are very competitive and they tend to be very competitive with again those firms that have a certain size and have very competitively priced products. And with solid, especially good performance, they\u2019re going to continue pretty well. I don\u2019t know how to answer it other than that. I think what you could see probably in future is I do think that the stronger only can get stronger. More money is going to go towards those firms with more money, more breakpoints, these will drop, but again, that would be a continuation of what's been in the past. Again, I just think it's the smaller firms that are under lot of pressure.","Loren Starr","I think their impact is probably going to be the share class that gets introduced, as we've seen sort of both costs, share classes that are stripped down, don't have transfer agency costs, all these things, I mean that's going to be the biggest sort of near-term impact, but I mean obviously the management team is going to get looked at as well.","Marty Flanagan","Yeah. Actually Loren does bring up a very good point. I don't know how much attention has been paid on it, but part of it in this low return environments, this active, passive movement that we've talked about and have seen dramatically active managers in packaged products have been at a real disadvantage just because of the expense ratio where frankly, it is a pass through a lot of expenses, whether they would be 12b-1, [indiscernible] and you are probably on average at a disadvantage and average fund of probably about 45 basis points every year and as these pure share classes come out, that's going to be benefit for active management also and the competitive returns vis-a-vis passive funds.","Michael Cyprys","Okay, great. Just last follow-up here on DOL, you mentioned more money moving from brokerage to advisory, can you talk about how you position to capture those flows and maybe you can elaborate a bit more in terms of marketing and sales efforts there that you are putting in place to capture that and also vehicle delivery changes?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. So I mean, it is vehicle and again everybody is going to solve that. I don\u2019t think that's going to be much of a competitive advantage one way or the other. You\u2019re going to respond to your partners as you\u2019re going to need. Again, I think the thing that\u2019s going to be differentiating is those firms that can help their partners make the shift from where they need to from brokerage to advisory and again it gets to firms like ourselves that have things like Invesco consulting, broad field support, thought leadership to help them work through those changes and again a broad range of capabilities. So we think we\u2019re positioned very well for that and with the money involved, we like the money in motion. That\u2019s going to be good thing and we think we are going to be a net beneficiary of it at the time we get through the other side.","Michael Cyprys","Okay, thank you.","Marty Flanagan","Okay. Well, thank you, everybody very much and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Have a good rest of the day.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, to Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco, and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin L. Flanagan","Thank you very much, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. And I'm going to review the business results for the first quarter and then Loren will go to the financial results more specifically and as is our practice, Loren and I will open up for Q&A after that.","But before I get into the results, I thought it'd be helpful to provide the sense of the macro environment and how it impacted our business after the first quarter. And in the first quarter, we did see modest economic growth in the U.S. Washington did take some initial steps to resolve the so-called fiscal cliff and consumers seem more willing to spend. As a result, there was enhanced level of optimism with our U.S. clients, which was reflected in the U.S. markets also.","This contrasts with client sentiment in the U.K. and Europe, which remain somewhat negative, given the prospects for a modest economic recovery in the U.K. and the likelihood of further economic contraction in the Eurozone during 2013. Asia-Pacific clients in Japan were very upbeat, given the government's commitment to fiscal stimulus and the strength of Japanese markets. In China, clients are not as upbeat as they are in Japan, but certainly, more so than a year ago. Growth in China has not been as strong as expected, but still very good as we all know compared to other regions of the world. And Chinese investors are looking forward to good growth under the new leadership.","In this environment, with continue to see early signs sales of investor rerisking but for various reasons, given the different prospects of the different regions of the globe, fixed income flows remain positive during the quarter, but at a smaller percentage than the -- year-to-date than the trailing 12 months. At the same time, equity flows were generally positive, which is an improvement from the months passed.","So with that as a backdrop, let me highlight the operating results for the quarter. I'm on Slide 3 now if you happen to be following on the deck. So long-term investment performance remains very strong across all time periods during the first quarter. Delivering strong investment performance, our clients contributed to the strong operating results. Optimism in the markets and our focus on delivering value to our clients helped drive net flows to a record $19.2 billion during the quarter.","Adjusted operating income was up $0.134 (sic) [13.4%] quarter-over-quarter and a continued focus on taking a disciplined approach to our business improved our operating margin to 38.4% from 35.6% the prior quarter. Reflecting confidence and in continued strength of the business, we're announcing today that we're raising the dividend to $0.225 per share, a 30% increase over the prior level.","Assets under management rose to $729 billion during the first quarter, up sequentially from $687 billion on the prior quarter. Operating income is $314 million versus $277 million in the prior quarter and earnings per share were $0.52 versus $0.45 from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we also took the opportunity to repurchase $45 million in common stock.","Now, before Loren goes in the details of the financials, let me take a moment to review the investment performance during the quarter, and I'm on Slide 6 now. So investment during the quarter was among the strongest we've seen across the global enterprise. 82% of assets were ahead of peers on a 5-year basis and 75% of assets were ahead of peers on a 1-year basis and a 3-year basis. And as you might expect with numbers like these, long-term performance for investment teams across the enterprise is quite strong with the number of capabilities turning in top [indiscernible] results. These numbers reflect our continued effort to build and enhance an investment culture that drives connectivity between our investment professionals, encourages intellectual exchange.","During the quarter, we saw strong active and passive flows across our global business. We saw uniformly positive long-term flows across Equity, Fixed Income, balance and alternative capabilities.","And on Slide 8. During the quarter, we also saw strong flows across all channels. Long-term flows into retail, where the record for the firm and long-term flows for institutional channel were also at a record for the firm, with the exception of one single quarter in 2010.","Turning to Slide 9, gross sales for our U.S. retail business remained strong at $22.1 billion for the quarter, a 34% increase over the same quarter a year ago. The annualized redemption rate remained very favorable relative to the industry. Flows into the complex were led by continued strength in traditional ETFs, balance risk strategies, UITs, diversified dividends and international equity.","Strong long-term performance of our Multi-Asset suite products continue to generate tremendous interest from our clients, who are attracted to a capability that aims to provide high level protection from the volatile market. We continue to see strong growth during the first quarter, across the entire suite of products, with net flows of more than $4 billion.","With a strong record of execute on our strategy, this enable us to deliver high level of value to our clients and consistent results for our shareholders for a long period of time. If you'll note, since 2006, our focus on building and maintaining a robust investment culture has yielded strong long-term investment performance on a very consistent basis during that period of time. As an example, Invesco's U.S. funds rated 4 and 5 star by Morningstar improves steadily starting at 23% of assets under management 2005 and climbing to 77% today.","The material improvement in investment performance coupled with sharp focus on climb engagement has enabled us to deliver improved and sustainable organic growth. In addition, a core strength of the firm's ability to manage the operating platform, we've been and remains sharply focused on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness across the platform working to create better outcomes for our clients and shareholders. The efforts importantly have enabled us to reinvest in the business at the same time.","As you will see on Slide 12, adjusted operating expenses per average assets under management have declined 33% since 2005. By delivering a high level of value to our clients, and taking a disciplined approach to running the business, we've delivered consistent results for our shareholders. As you can see on Slide 13, we've returned $3.5 billion of capital since 2006 and outpaced the return of the S&P by [indiscernible] consistently over time.","Our key priorities for 2013 will continue to build on the momentum and progress we've made over the past several years and execute on our strategy, to help further strengthen our business for the long-term success. As always, we will continue to enhance the investment culture that's focused on delivering investment excellence to our clients. We will further expand the investment capabilities and vehicles with particular focus on those that can be scaled globally to meet client's needs. Going forward, we will continue to focus on better understanding, anticipating and meeting the needs of our clients. We'll also build on our efforts to achieve greater efficiencies and effectiveness across the global platform. We believe that by achieving strong investment performance, meeting needs of our clients and effectively managing the business, we can deliver consistent results to our shareholders over the long term.","We've also seen a tremendous amount of discussion in the media about the great rotation. We prefer to position our capabilities more broadly where success can be derived without regard to which asset class is favored by the markets. Throughout the financial crisis and during the time when investors move away from equities in droves, we built the business steadily and consistently by delivering strong investment performance across a broad spectrum of asset classes. Although we would benefit greatly from a sustained movement to equities, we are seeing early signs that investors are rerisking, we spent considerable effort building a comprehensive suite of capabilities to meet a broad range of client needs, regardless of the markets that are in place.","Another key strength of the firm is developing a strongly based investment capabilities that can be effectively scaled to meet client's needs across the globe, such as we've done with real estate, Multi-Asset, Fixed Income, [indiscernible] bank loans and ETFs.","We are uniquely positioned to deliver on this approach with a significant competitive advantage for our firm. We feel good about momentum in the business, we feel good about our abilities to deliver a high level of value to our clients, we feel good about our record of providing consistent returns to shareholders. We will continue to look for opportunities to further strengthen our competitive and financial advantage over the long term.","And now with that, I'm going to turn it over to Loren for more in-depth discussion of the financial results.","Loren M. Starr","Great, thank you, Marty. Before I get started, I wanted to point out a minor, but I believe helpful change in our AUM roll forward. We've taken heed of the feedback from the investment community and we've isolated and removed the impact on long-term flows due to the Invesco PowerShares QQQ product. We hope you find this change useful in better understanding the long-term full picture of the firm.","Now getting to the results. You'll see that our AUM increased $41.6 billion quarter-over-quarter or 6%. That was due to positive market returns, which added $31.4 billion. Total net inflows of $19.2 billion, of which $14.8 billion were long-term. These increases in AUM were offset by negative FX of $9 billion.","Our average AUM for Q1 was up as well, 4.8% to $712.7 billion. Clearly, the long-term flows were a very strong element in the quarter. The strength was fueled in part by Q1 seasonality and the timing of several institutional mandates. We're pleased with the volumes we've seen so far in April, but we expect overall flows for Q2 to decline from the Q1 levels. Q2 tends to be lighter in flows than Q1 and I should point out that we have been notified of a $2 billion passive redemption to take place this quarter. This $2 billion outflow happily is only at 2 basis points revenue yield. So the P&L impact will be modest.","Our net revenue yield in Q1 was 45.8 basis points, an increase of 0.2 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Stronger performance fees were partially offset by 2 less days in the quarter, however, if you normalize our day count, we continued to see our management fee yield increase quarter-over-quarter.","Next, let me turn to the operating results. Net revenues increased $40.6 million or 5.2% quarter-over-quarter, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $13.4 million. Looking at this a bit more closely, you'll see that investment management fees grew by $27.4 million or 3.2% to $892.4 million. This increase was in line with our higher average AUM, but also the higher effective fee rate after allowing for 2 less days during the quarter.","FX reduced investment management fees by $16.2 million. Service and distribution revenues were up by $6.9 million or 3.5%, also roughly in line with the increase in average AUM. FX decreased service and distribution revenues by $1.3 million. Performance fees came in rather large this quarter at $38.6 million, that was an increase of $17.5 million from Q4. Performance fees in the first quarter were primarily driven by the U.K., which contributed $29.5 million and the bank loan team in the U.S., which contributed $6.5 million. FX reduced performance fees by $1.9 million.","Other revenues in the first quarter were $25.8 million, this was a decrease of $1.6 million versus the prior quarter. We saw a $4.9 million reduction in real estate transaction fees, but that was partially offset by a $3.3 million pickup in UIT revenues and retained front-end loads. FX reduced other revenues by $0.1 million.","Third party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $9.6 million, or 2.8%. FX decreased these expenses by $6.1 million.","Continuing on down the slide, you'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $502.9 million increased by $3.5 million or 0.7% relative to the fourth quarter. FX decreased operating expenses by $7.5 million. Employee compensation at $351.3 million increased by $9.3 million or 2.7%. The $9.3 million reflects seasonally higher payroll taxes and retirement costs, but these were partially offset by lower variable compensation in the quarter. FX reduced compensation by $4.7 million.","Looking forward, giving you some guidance here, assuming no change in quarter and asset levels, we would expect compensation to decline approximately $15 million quarter-over-quarter and then remain roughly flat through the remainder of the year, again, assuming flat AUM. The decline in compensation from the first quarter is due to the rolling off of the seasonally higher payroll taxes and bonuses linked to performance fees, which will be partially offset by a full quarter's worth of salary increases.","Moving on down, marketing expense decreased by $0.5 million or 2.1% to $23.3 million. FX decreased these expenses by $0.3 million. We would expect marketing to return back to the $27 million, $28 million per quarter run rate going forward.","Property office and technology expense was $69.6 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $2.1 million. FX reduced these expenses by $1 million. In the quarter, we recognized $1.5 million of lease expense credit, which generally don't recur. Further, we expect property, office and technology expense to increase as the European TA outsourcing projects finishes up in the later part of second quarter, leveling off so this line item will level off around $75 million per quarter in the second half of the year. And this increase will be offset, however, by decreases in compensation and G&A.","G&A expense came in at $58.7 million, that's down $3.2 million or 5.5%. The first quarter included a $2.5 million legal settlement credit. FX decreased G&A by $1.5 million. Taking effect for this credit, we would expect G&A to return to the $62 million run rate level going forward.","Again, coming down the page, you'll see that our nonoperating income increased $2.8 million, compared to the fourth quarter, largely due to the decline in interest expense as we had a full quarter's worth of savings from the refinancing transaction last quarter. From this tax rate on pretax adjusted net operating income or net income excuse me in Q1 was 26%, the increase in the tax rate was a result of changes in the mix of profits reflecting a higher proportion in U.S. and Continental Europe. Going forward, we expect the tax rate to continue to be around 2.5% [ph] to 26.5%.","And that brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.52. And our adjusted net operating margin of 38.4%. Assuming we can continue current quarter end asset levels, we would expect to see Invesco's operating margin continue to expand throughout the remainder of the year and be in excess of 40% by year end.","Now, before I turn things back to Marty, I just want to briefly comment on our accounting treatment for the sale of Atlantic Trust to CIBC to the transaction that is expected to close sometime before year end. Atlantic Trust will be classified as held for sale on Invesco's balance sheet and as discontinued operations when we release results in the second quarter. This treatment means that all of Atlantic Trust's revenues and expenses will be pulled out of our results, both for U.S. GAAP and for non-GAAP presentations. And we've included a slide in the appendix of the presentation that provides additional detail on the revenues and expenses of the business that should help you with your modeling of our ongoing operations.","And with that, I will turn it back to Marty.","Martin L. Flanagan","Thank you, Loren. So any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question does come from Michael Carrier of Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Marty, maybe just on flows. I guess a strong quarter you guys mentioned some of the drivers in terms of some of the wins, seasonality, you're just trying to gauge. And we've seen this across the industry as the companies are reporting. When you look at the products that you feel like you have like the sustainability in terms of flows given what you're seeing in the market right now, versus some of the areas where you saw like an institutional win or seasonality, can you gauge that in terms of where you see the outlook, where you see the growth opportunities versus where it will ultimately see some pullback for the industry?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. It's a fair question and you're not the only one who's wondering, we all are. So, I mean, I can give you some sense. I mean that it's -- and I think you probably seen it different magnitudes and different companies just because of the relative strength in them. But it was quite robust and at a macro level if you want to use the U.S. retail investors maybe some level of proxy. You did see -- I would classify it early stages of the rotation into equities and I would expect people to continue to be cautious throughout the summer. You've had 3 years in a row of right around this time that the markets pulled back quite strongly. And so for good reason, you would imagine retail investors should be cautious into the fall. So I think if you have sort of sideways to up markets through the summer, in the fall, you could have some level of confidence and you could probably see continuation of some movements into equity. Where I think if, again, if you just look at history, if you look at the different asset classes, it tends to be pretty stable in areas of asset allocation and the buckets of alternatives where you start to get the movements are between fixed income and equity and you did see this quarter, obviously, movements into U.S. equities, in particular, which has been quite different than what we've seen over the last trailing 12 months at the expense of taxable fixed income, in particular. And I would imagine it would be more gradual than not. So that said, I don't know if that's helpful, that's a perspective. What we are seeing specifically is just a continuing broadening of the asset classes that are interesting to our client base. Balance risk continues to be quite strong. I think the equity income type products continue to be strengthening, international equities continue to be strengthening, and again, I think those are all signs of people, real estate, and also if you look at our traditional PowerShares, again, I think all are very, very strong. So Q1 is traditionally the strongest quarter of the year. We saw that and I suspect others will have seen that too. But it does look that there could be some continue the momentum throughout the summer and into the fall.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, thanks, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Loren, maybe on just some of the numbers. You mentioned that you're trying to -- or you're guiding to that 40% margin by year end. I think you mentioned there was a few moving pieces. And I just wanted to understand, you said, calm down the $50 million sequentially. And I think part of that is you mentioned on the European kind of synergies coming through. So just, if you can just go through the comp versus the office and tech and then the G&A what the moving pieces are? And then I know it's impossible, but any type of outlook on the performance that you've just given how strong they were this quarter?","Loren M. Starr","So in terms of moving pieces, again, the biggest moving piece and the one that we highlighted just now has to do with payroll taxes, and obviously, it spikes up in the first quarter and then rolls off. So that's going to account for the biggest drop off. It is somewhat offset by having 3 months entirely of salary increases, which typically -- which happened this month -- or sorry, in February of last quarter so you only have 1 month of the impact last quarter and you have 3 months of it this quarter. So that difference is really the net 15. There is going to be some benefit in comp in terms of ultimately the TA outsourcing, which is going to bring comp down. Comp will, obviously, continue to expand as our operating income grows, and as we grow organically. So some of that's going to get offset. That's why comp really looks rather flat in terms of the guidance through the rest of the year because of those 2 things will be largely offsetting. So that's really all the moving pieces. We have a very stable, predictable accrual -- in terms of how we're recruiting for bonus this year. So there's no back end loading, no front end loading, this is going to be very predictable for everyone. So, again, that will help in terms of the transparency. In terms of the other line items. Property, office and tech, as I mentioned, is going to go up to about $75 million. That's because when we pay our third party provider to do the work for them and it falls into that line item, and that's why it's going up. And so in G&A again, even though it's up to from where it is right now, 62, it is going to be -- there's a net offset. Generally G&A has been going up because of the regulatory environment we're in. There's a lot of cost in terms of putting risk systems, but that will -- in terms of the impacts of the TA outsourcing, it will help offset that and that's why it will be staying flat at 62. So hopefully that's the level of detail looking for, Mike.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. Anything on the performance fees?","Loren M. Starr","So performance fees, typically where we earn our performance fees in the U.K., this -- first quarter is the big quarter when we would see that. So, again, looking a year later, I'm not smart enough to be able to tell you what it will look like other than performance is excellent in that team, and so if they can hold onto it, yes, there'll be more performance fees. I can't exactly say at what magnitude. The other place where we've seen performance fees and probably will continue to see performance fees is in the area of bank loans. Our bank loan business has continued to grow very rapidly, a lot of those products do have performance fees associated with that and they're doing very well. So again, how much maybe in the range of $2 million to $5 million could be that range and it could hit at any quarter. It's not, I wouldn't count on it every single quarter. And then the only point I would mention, because of a discontinued operations that we're going to need to treat Atlantic Trust as, all the performance fees associated with Atlantic Trust which we've traditionally seen in the fourth quarter are going to fall into the discontinued ops line and therefore won't be part of our operating results. So, again, that's something that you'll just need to model through. But the other thing that is worth pointing out is, when we do go to discontinued ops, which will happen in the second quarter, essentially margins will grow. So I think we've mentioned in the call before it's about 0.5 percentage point benefit on margin. That's not in any of the guidance I just given you. In fact all the numbers I've given you include Atlantic Trust. So you'll have to sort of exclude those amounts in your models, which you can do using the sheet in the back of the Appendix.","Operator","Our next question does come from Bill Katz of Citi.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just want to stay on the margins first. Sounds to me like your guidance for the end of the year is a tad more optimistic than maybe last time we chat on this, now you're sort of saying over 40%. Is there anything underneath the covers here in terms of the mix of the business or the core efficiencies on the expense side that's improved to the point where it feels like you are a bit more optimistic on profitability?","Loren M. Starr","Well, I mean, I think it's actually I would say markets have been still generally helpful for us and so that does give us a sense of confidence. Obviously, having the quarter completed and results and everything being executed as we hoped, it's helpful. Our guidance that we gave you was sort of x the Atlantic Trust transaction, too. So we feel that, that will definitely provide more lift in margins even than that I was talking about. So, overall, we are focused on the top line growth. We think we're seeing flows continue in a very healthy way. We're focused on operating platform effectiveness, efficiencies, as we always have been and that work is going well too. So again, I think maybe that is generating a greater sense of confidence that we can get to that 40% margin.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, it's helpful. And then Mike, a big picture question for yourself. Look at the business, risk premier business is doing well. I wonder if maybe you can talk about where you're seeing equal opportunity set for that. And then underneath that, I mean a part of that, in terms of Europe that also seems to be increasingly contributing to the flow story now. And maybe where you might be in terms of opportunity to fully leverage that footprint?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, so again, I think the balance risk capability is consistent with I think we're seeing broadly across the industry is really a post-crisis phenomenon, some ways where people do want to have some low volatility capabilities in their portfolios. And we continue -- it's not unique to the United States as you know, for us it continues to be built out. By the fall, we look to be introducing another capability with the team that's joined us in the United Kingdom. It won't be 'til the fall so we're going to continue to expand that. And we think that's here to stay. I think it's going to be just part of sort of the makeup of how people are building portfolios, Multi-Asset Strategies and the like. With regard to Europe, again, it has been a focus of ours as an organization over the last number of years and continues to be and it continues to get stronger. And we anticipate that it will continue to get stronger as we continue to focus on the things that we have. So again, it should be a net contributor. Also in time it has been probably at one level, with the macro environment there. It's contributed more broadly than one might anticipate considering that. But again, we still think we're early days of where we could end up on the continent.","Operator","Our next question does come from Ken Worthington of JPMC.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, on the institutional business. Can you give us some additional flavor on 3 things? First, what products and regions are seeing the greatest success? Two, maybe as you look out over the next year, where are you most optimistic? And three, maybe excluding staple value, how big is the pipeline either on an absolute basis or maybe how big is it relative to where it was 6 months ago?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So let me hit a couple of those and let Loren. So I'll have Loren talk more specifically about the pipeline but what we're sort of seeing. And I think this is important, as you to point out a number of years ago where it was pretty focused on staple value in particular in the United States. It's broadening quite a bit where alternatives heavily real estate bank loans are under just under half of -- but it's also brought in through the balance portfolios, the fixed income and also equities. And we would not have seen that breadth of asset classes being the pipeline 2, 3 years ago. And it continues to be really pretty broad not just the United States but in continental Europe we've actually been getting some good traction. We continue to get traction out of the Middle East, and also in parts of Asia. So again, it's as broad as we've seen in a number of years.","Loren M. Starr","So Ken, in terms of you wanted to talk about the pipeline and the pipeline is actually at 5% higher than it was over the last 12 month average, so it continues to be strong and healthy and stable despite the fact that we had a lot of fundings this quarter. So I think the institutional business is continuing to do quite well. I think, again, the products entering has been very much on alternatives, equities, fixed income balance and I mean it's across the spectrum, so there's quite a bit of diversity within what is in demand there and stable value is a small part of it actually. It's not enormous, I think it's maybe 10% of the pipeline in terms of what is being looked at. We do think stable values has the ability to grow going forward, but it's been a little bit concerning just due to wrap capacity recently. And so we're looking to find ways to increase wrap capacity. So overall, pretty good. And even more importantly, we -- the fee characteristics of the pipeline continue to improve. So the net revenue yield on the pipeline is improving, so all good.","Martin L. Flanagan","What I might add to it is that, and again, I think important that we talked about this over the quarters. We are not clear, the timing of it, right? We all have estimates, but, again, it tends to be -- clients will react when they react, and but if you look over the time period of the year, it looks really quite strong. And the other thing that I think is still on the marketplace, I think, which is interesting for the money-management industry, in particular, is that yes, we are seeing more interest in equities in some ways, but you also have a number of plans that continue to de-risk their equity exposure and I personally don't think that's the right answer when you're trying to close deficits, but maybe with more solid markets you'll continue to see some of that mind shift change and I think that would be real positive not just for the plans, but also for the industry and for us, in particular. But all in all, Loren said...","Loren M. Starr","Yes, and again, Ken, in terms of the actual dollar amounts, I mean, we've been hesitant to give out dollar amounts. So we look at it in terms of what's won and not yet funded, we look at qualified opportunities, but we're talking about sizable numbers, billions and billions of dollars in terms of won, not funded. But as Marty said, it can be a little bit of illusion because it takes a while, a lot of its real estate. It takes -- it could take a year. It could take even longer than a year to some of that stuff to fund. So you don't want people to presume that it's all coming around next quarter.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then in terms of Europe, U.K. performance is awesome here, yet the franchise and modest redemption, love your comments there. And then in Continental Europe, it's experiencing extremely, maybe even exceptionally strong sales relative to its size. Maybe what work -- can you walk through what's working there?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So let me start on the comment. I mean, we've obviously been there for years and years and years. And we weren't happy with the results that we were generating. And again, this is not sort of an overnight effort. It's been the past couple of years really where the performance is strong. It's as strong as it's ever been in that lineup there. That's reflective of a number of our investment teams from around the world being represented there. So it's just common sense, right? Much better product management, the lineup's much better. There's much greater focus on -- the sales leadership is very, very strong now. We're still, I'd say, early stages of where we want to be institutionally although we're seeing some very good success recently on the institutional business. So again, it's -- we've thought for some period we should be much more successful there than we have then, and you're starting to see that. In the United Kingdom, we're -- we just have a very large presence. And I think you're, with a good performance, you're seeing it's a combination of people sentiment in the marketplace about exposure to the equity market, but we also think there's an opportunity for us, again, with the multi-asset capabilities. We think that's not unique to the United States, but also something very, very important in the United Kingdom. And we think that is a future area for growth for us in a very strategic important way. And again, that's -- it's not going to come on until the fall just because it takes up long to get it up and running. But again, we think that is going to be another very, very important element of success and growth opportunities.","Loren M. Starr","And maybe just a little more color. I mean, one of the things, as you mentioned, maybe asset allocation capabilities have been strong in Europe, but they've been growing sequentially quite dramatically, actually. So it's been sort of 50% growth levels quarter-over-quarter. So it's definitely accelerating. Again, by the way, that stays -- it's hard to say, but it's just been very, very encouraging. We've also had very strong European corporate bonds, flows to that product has done very, very well, and it's been in great demand. I think we mentioned we had a $1 billion win with our Quant group in Europe, which, again, is -- really had the potential to draw even more flows going forward. So it's been multifaceted in terms of what's going on in Continental Europe.","Operator","Our next question does come from Jeff Hopson of Stifel.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, so questions on margin. I'm assuming that the ETF growth over the past 12 months as well as ABRA both, I guess, given that those are contained to some extent, businesses, how much are each of those, I guess, are contributing to the margin? And then, Marty, on ETFs, clearly, you've seen, I guess, the next level of success. The good news is the flows are consistent and strong. Now they're lumpy as are the industry flows to some extent, but it seems like that business has turned the corner, but it's only as good as ongoing product introductions, et cetera. Can you kind of give us your sense of where you think that business is, and then going forward, whether you have, in fact, turned the corner of present and product, et cetera?","Martin L. Flanagan","So let me -- maybe why don't I start with that and then Loren can address the margin topics. So we think the PowerShares franchise is a superb one, right? We know where we're competing, and we've been very focused on that. If you look at the recognition, the advisor channel, it's the second most recognized brand in the advisor channel. We think that's very, very important. The focus, again, on product development introductions over the last 3 years, in particular, I think, has been very sharp, very focused and something that has put us in a position for the success that you're seeing right now. We believe that's sustainable, and we'll continue to do more of that. We also think, again, the ETF market is, again, it's investment outcomes that matter, not the vehicle per se, but what you are seeing is, again, with good product capabilities within the -- or investment capabilities within ETFs, is the educational level goes up in the advice channel, you're just going to see greater use of that and that has been our whole theory since the beginning of getting into PowerShares. And so we're just expecting to continue very good things out of the Invesco Powershares business, and we think it's sustainable.","Loren M. Starr","And I tell you in terms of what's driving the margin growth, when I look at it, it isn't -- you can't just say it's ETFs. It has a lot to do with the very important theme of products that are beginning to go global, and that is true around some of the asset allocation products and the fact that you get that operating leverages as these products can go into different markets. But also bank loans, which has been the big driver of growth within the ETF space and outside of U.S. and has been a big driver too. So I'd say that is probably more the way I would think about the margin expansion as opposed to a particular product line or particular regions. And again, we're very hopeful that we're going to see more of those types of products sort of take off in -- through 2013 and 2014.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I could just follow up, for Marty. I believe that when you guys go to market to financial advisers, you are using both Invesco and PowerShares when you meet with them. I assume that helps you with overall leverage. And then secondarily, to what extent has ABRA, has PowerShares helped you with the halo effect? And should we expect -- for example, in equities, while the environment is still so-so, you have excellent performance there. To what extent do you think you're getting some momentum finally for the overall brand? And to what extent is that being helped by -- against a halo effect from ABRA and other products?","Martin L. Flanagan","So let me answer that this way. So I -- you're on an important topic. I think success through investment capabilities generally creates success across the organization, and we've said over the years, the Invesco brand was not known a number of years ago in the advice channel. I mean, it was a standing start into the advice channel. And so the effort to get it recognized in the advice channel has been very important. And it largely comes by creating strong performing capabilities that help advisors do what they need to do for their clients. Invesco PowerShares has been a very important part of that. Again, this is a multiyear conversation. It has been reinforced into the retail channel, not cannibalization, and it's how we present all of the capabilities to the channel. It's a combination of general wholesalers with specialists. We've had that model for years. We think that's what matters. It's focus on outcomes for the advisor. And again, you do some on top of that, the capability of a -- give-or-take capability, again, is reinforcing to the franchise. It was something that is needed for clients. And again, it just -- when wholesalers are talking to their clients, they talk about a suite, they listen to them very much to understand what their needs are, and they present the breadth of them, and for a number of years now, we have been very focused on the equity capabilities for the advice channel. We think it has been the right thing to do to have people forward-looking as they look into markets. And again, you've not seen the corporate rotation into U.S. equities. You've seen somewhat international on emerging markets, but we're still early days. So again, it all becomes self-reinforcing. And I think you're right on the -- you're on the right topic. And we think we have made great progress in that area as compared to just 3 years ago.","Operator","Our next question does come from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, just talking about the ABRA product, how many variations of it do you have now? And, I guess, is there any that are coming up that are coming on significant milestones like a 3-year track record you've -- which might lead to an acceleration in some of these newer products in new regions?","Loren M. Starr","So, Dan, so we have a few different configurations within U.S. and then other configurations outside of the U.S. So again, I haven't counted them all up, but we probably have close to 10, 12 different flavors of what we have, and also, I believe we're going to have more. I think in terms of ones that we're excited about but not yet onto any sort of landmark, timing is the premium income fund, which is -- does asset allocation across our brand of high-yielding asset classes. It has a very, very strong performance record for one year. And when you look at the flows, they are definitely getting stronger quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter. So again, early days to declare this is going to be the next big thing, but it is certainly a product that has a lot of appeal within U.S. and is actually now being looked at very seriously outside of the U.S. So we may be able to actually move this forward without sort of the traditional 3-year track record in certain regions more quickly. So that one's exciting. There's another product, which is the global strategies product, which was more of an alternative capability that is being targeted for high net worth individuals in the U.S. That has sort of generated some good interest. And again, early days, but it's one where it's certainly been growing more rapidly, more recently. So that one has a lot of promise, but again, no 3-year track records yet that I can call out and say, this thing is going to suddenly take off at this point.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And I guess, just on the revenue side, the other revenues, you flagged a few things this quarter. I guess, is this a decent run rate to think about this year? I know there's these transaction things that are happening, but I guess, any help there from an outlook perspective?","Loren M. Starr","I would use this as the best run rate forecast at this point. It's a consistent way that we're looking at it internally. It is proven to be a very hard line item to forecast because there are some things that run through it, and the actual transaction fees are very much a function of which fund may be doing a transaction as opposed to just a level of transactions in aggregate, so -- but I would guide you to use current quarter.","Operator","Our next question does come from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I want to come back to the ETF business for a second. Just wondering if you think that investors increasing their risk tolerance could potentially lead to a rotation out of beta neutral ETFs and more momentum into the kind of the active ETF product, which you guys have a great suite of products there. Is there any validity to that, something like that occurring? Are you seeing anything in the marketplace right now that suggests that could happen?","Martin L. Flanagan","It's a hard question to answer. But again, if you think of the prior conversations that we've had, we have thought a national progression from a conservative position of investors was from sort of fixed income type into passive equities. And we saw that movement very, very strongly. If you look at our core ETFs, they have continued to get stronger and stronger. So with this idea of investor confidence increasing, I think that's a realistic thought and you could see that continue in time. And again, it would be consistent with the idea that it's not the vehicle that matters, it's the investment outcomes that matter and what investment philosophy that you're trying to meet. And again, it's consistent with -- we think the very strong equity capabilities that we have there are going to do fine as people continue to get more confident coming into the market, and we expect that the ETF capabilities that will generate greater returns will also benefit. And so we would agree with the fundamental underlying point of your question.","Loren M. Starr","Yes. I mean, the one thing I would say, I mean, just some background topics, I mean, our active equity sales are up 26% quarter-over-quarter, so we are seeing increased interest in active equities. With that said, our ETF -- so traditionally ETF business are doing very well too, so we're not seeing any sort of cannibalization. I think people are just generally taking on more risk, and they do it in a couple of different ways and different proportions. Ultimately, if we get into a full-on grade rotation-type of scenario, I mean, you could certainly probably paint the picture where people will be gravitating less to index-type, pointed passive funds.","Martin L. Flanagan","Passive funds.","Loren M. Starr","Passive funds and more into active funds, and that will be great. I mean, I think we welcome that. The good news about our ETF line, obviously, is that it's obviously somewhere afoot in active and somewhat afoot in passive. It's actually probably going to benefit under all scenarios.","Operator","Michael Kim of Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, maybe to come at the flows from a bit of a different angle. Can you just give us any color on how the flows sort of trended through the first quarter as it relates to the underlying mix, so active versus passive, as well as looking across the different asset classes or strategies. Just trying to get a sense of how the demand trends kind of played out -- have played out thus far this year, and any implications going forward?","Martin L. Flanagan","Maybe I'll make a couple of comments, and Loren can too. I don't have all the details to answer that question. But I think what you saw here and consistent with much of the industry, January was uniquely strong, and we can debate the whys, but it was. It did continue for us vis-\u00e0-vis prior months and quarters at a very strong level. And again, we just -- again, I'm repeating myself, but it is reflection of greater investor confidence and the performance that's been generated by the investment management teams. And I don't know that I can get any more specific than that.","Loren M. Starr","Yes. I think there isn't sort of a distinct trend where suddenly we're active and then we went passive or vice versa. I do think sort of as we enter into second quarter, we'll continue to see the trends we saw in the first quarter. They'll probably have a little bit more orientation towards passive products right now than there has been the first quarter, but it's just one month. And so again, it's hard to sort of say that we're in any sort of permanent move away from active product at all. So early days into 2Q.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just second, if I'm doing the math right, it looks like less than half of your money market AUM is in kind of prime money market funds here in the U.S. So just be curious to get your take on how you see regulatory reform playing out? And then more specifically, if the FSOC or the SEC were to go down sort of that floating NAB route, does that change your thinking in terms of the value of that business to the overall franchise?","Martin L. Flanagan","Just on the broad question, you're all seeing the commentary, so everybody is expecting some guidance like here in the not-too-distant future from the SEC. As with our involvement, what we understand is that the range of proposals, we think, it is a manageable outcome for the industry and frankly, for us, and we would not change our stance on where we are. We think it is a very valuable thing for investors, the money funds. And we could see a path forward coming out of the proposed reforms that will stay intact. And we do believe that the general goal is not to negatively impact the money fund market at the same time. So we're cautiously optimistic, I would say.","Operator","Luke Montgomery of Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So just on the margin expansion you showed in the quarter, clearly, stronger revenues helped and, obviously, that the progress is encouraging. You've given a lot of detail already, but I was hoping you would give us a sense of how much of the margin expansion could be attributed to deferred compensation or other cash flow timing differences that smoothed expenses and might be expected to reverse in later periods. Was that like a modest impact or something more?","Loren M. Starr","No. I mean, I think it's steady as she goes. I mean, as we mentioned, we're accruing on a constant rate. So there isn't any sort of deferral and then suddenly catch-up going to happen later. So that is going help, I think, everyone in terms of their modeling. So going forward, as we talked about, the only real big moving piece is going to be payroll tax, and now from fourth quarter to first quarter. If you're looking at that change, obviously, we talked about sort of having a heavier back-end accrual in the last half of 2012. And so that has fallen to a lower rate quarter-versus-quarter. So that's certainly why variable compensation was able to come down. We also saw performance fees -- a different composition of performance fees in Q4 versus Q1. In Q4, it was Atlantic Trust largely, and that's at a higher compensation rate than the rate that we saw for Q1. So all those elements allowed comp to come in where it did.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then I think it's probably understood at this point that one of the reasons for your relatively lower margin is smaller product sizes and I think, specifically, the lack of 1 product or 2 to scale globally. And if I think about the firms that have done that well, typically, they have very strong distributions, especially on the retail side. So I'm wondering if you're satisfied with your global distribution networks? Do you think it might be one of the things that's kept your products from scaling globally? And what types of investments and distribution are you implementing or planning at this point?","Martin L. Flanagan","So again -- and you've somewhat -- being add-on to the commentary I talked about earlier, here in the U.S. in particular, we really had a lot of work to do to get recognized in the retail channel and to move it forward. And again, I think just from the results today, you're seeing continued progress and being impactful in that retail channel and that helps, right? There's no question about it. The commentary earlier about greater success on the continent, that is a very important thing and very helpful, and that continues to build on it. So again, it is just an absent focus of the firm, the capabilities are strong and the performance is strong, and just being very focused on ensuring that we get the opportunity to deliver those capabilities to clients is a very serious folks of the firm and has been for a number of years.","Operator","Our next question does come from Matt Kelley of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just coming back real quickly to the comp numbers, just factoring in the FX impact in the fourth quarter to the rolling forward to the first quarter, it sounds like you've kind of $20 million to $25 million lower core when you back that out in the variable nature of the -- sorry, the higher payroll tax. So when you look forward, that's a kind of delta. So I'm just curious, how much is kind of performance fee-related comp right now? And if your AUM isn't flat based on the strong inflows that you have, what should we be expecting for the type of leverage as AUM grows if we are modeling that for your comp line?","Loren M. Starr","So I think in the past, we've talked about incremental margins, and that is sort of in the range of 55%, 60% incremental margins, thinking about how much of revenue drops into operating income. And that's probably the -- generally the right range for you to be thinking about, and then largely that component is flexing into the variable compensation element. So hopefully, that will allow you to model kind of where comp would go if revenues and assets rise. The ratios on performance fees can be quite different, depending on which area generates them. So that creates a little variability, probably the biggest variation was with Atlantic Trust, and again, that's probably not going to be a topic that you're going to need to think about. So they tend to be more modest in other areas. But to the extent that we have our performance fees, through any part of -- or any quarter, that will drive up compensation clearly to some amount. But those levels are not as extreme as what we saw. Did that get your question, Matt? I'm not sure.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, it did, Loren. The other thing I wanted to ask you guys is about when you think about retail distribution, it sounds like increasingly ETFs and alternative products are increasing the penetration level. So I'm just curious with where you stand right now. You have a pretty diversified but maybe subscale in a couple of areas, alternatives platform in your ETF franchise that was -- is a top 5 player. I'm just wondering if you're kind of happy with what you have, or you think there are other products that you're not currently offering that you think could sell really well in retail and fit really well with your current product set as well.","Martin L. Flanagan","Well, it's an ongoing effort at the organization to understand our investment capabilities and what's needed by clients. And again, I think what I would point to is our success of identifying those trends and matching them whether it'd be things like ABRA, the premium income product, or...","Loren M. Starr","Bank loans.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, the bank loans and the like. So we don't see gaping holes in the organization. I mean, very, very different. There's fewer holes than -- but again, it's a very constant focus of ours, so...","Loren M. Starr","The only thing I would add and well, you can correct me, but, I mean, we have been spending a lot of time and effort and resources on thinking about fixed income generally, and it's becoming a bigger -- potentially bigger player in that space. Bank loans are great product. I think we're one of the top -- probably top 3, top 5 in that space. But there's certainly other opportunities within fixed income broadly that we probably have not participated as well as we can. And we continue to add capabilities and resources and technology that will allow us to be more effective there. So I think that's got to be an area of focus.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. I -- that's -- so if you look at the credit capabilities, as I've said, the organization's credit capabilities about as strong as you're going to find them in the marketplace. And that's a good thing for the environment that we're in, but what's coming off of that are sort of a multi-credit type capabilities or something that we think we should be much more successful in than we are. And I think you'll see those types of things create success over time. So that's a very good point.","Loren M. Starr","But that is a longer-term build. I mean, it will take years.","Operator","Our next question does come from Chris Shutler of William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","As you speak with institutional investors in the U.S. and abroad, are you guys seeing much difference right now in terms of product preferences or risk tolerances by region?","Martin L. Flanagan","It is interesting. I think there is a constant theme of seeking income within institutional clients and I'd probably put it more specifically, of moving out of perfective mode to how do we -- how can we generate the returns close to the deficits that we have or to meet our target of return with ideally not using equities? I mean, that's a real hard thing to solve. So that's why you see a lot of, again, things into real estate, things into bank loans, those types of capabilities premium income. Now again, with that said, there are some very smart investors moving into equities, and we are seeing that. But the theme is people, and I think it's a good -- ultimately a good trend that people are realizing they're going to have to generate returns to close the gaps. So that would be a few in Asia, broadly Greater China, Japan that would be interesting. In Japan, there's greater conversation in equities than you've seen in a very, very long period of time. How much takes through, we'll have to see. And again, here in the States, we've talked about that at some length. It is -- it kind of gets us with the conversations we've just had.","Loren M. Starr","The only thing I'd say there, a couple of interesting things. I mean, I think Quant is factoring much more strongly in Europe than it has in the U.S. And so that's probably still work to be done at some point sort of to see if that becomes more of a theme. And then things like private equity is probably more of a U.S.-focused product as opposed to necessarily having as much opportunity outside of the U.S., in Europe, in Continental Europe. So there's different flavors that work in different locations. So generally, most of our products are across the globe being offered.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up. So I saw the -- you put out a press release yesterday about income investing, and clearly, that's a trend you guys have been benefiting from for a while. So just curious what the takeaways from that press release would be for us, whether it's more just formalizing something we already know or if you're going to be actually making any changes to distribution strategy marketing, et cetera based on that?","Martin L. Flanagan","No. I think it's reinforcing the focus and factors that we've been on for the last number of years, so...","Operator","Our next question does come from Greggory Warren of Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I know you touched on the flows a bit so far during the call, but I'm looking at on a month-by-month basis. And if you strip out January, really for the industry overall, flows are looking not much different in sort of February, March, April than we've seen over the last 4 or 5 years where taxable bond funds are taking the bigger piece of the pie. There is some interest in equities, but it's mainly on the passive side. And I'm just wondering if that's the same sort of thing you're seeing within your portfolio. And then I kind of have a follow-on question about the Canadian markets.","Martin L. Flanagan","So again, we -- as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing it more broad. I mean, we are seeing people moving more broadly outside of taxable fixed income. For us, it'd be alternatives, asset allocation, international equities, equity income-type products, so again, I think it is broadening for us.","Loren M. Starr","And I think, Greggory, you're maybe looking purely U.S. in your view. And I'll say we're taking the perspective of the broader global sort of opportunity, which is quite different in some cases than what's going on. So a little bit hard for us to sort of draw a conclusion, and you get on specific plan, which is exactly what Marty said, is -- we're seeing strong flows into the products that you just mentioned, asset location, contingency growth and international equity and some other areas, so -- but hard to comment on the trend for the whole industry.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes. And then I think you're right, Loren. I think that's part of the issues worth -- tending to look a little bit more to U.S.-centered data, which skews it a little bit. But yes, that was the only thing I did bring up to as a moderate allocation growth over the past 4, 5 years. That's actually been one of the better growth ones besides taxable bond funds. So spot-on with that area. The thing about Canada overall, with I shares picking up Claymore last year and kind of building out a bigger piece of that pie up there on the ETF side and Vanguard getting a little bit more aggressive. How do you guys feel your position there? And where do you see kind of the growth from that market because it pales in comparison what we have here domestically?","Martin L. Flanagan","Again, I -- we think it's an opportunity. I mean, it's relative opportunity as you point out, but again, the ETF introductions that we have done in Canada have been -- they really have been successful. And again, it's copying the playbook in the United States. It's been very complimentary to the advice channel. It's worked very well with the advisors there. I think also importantly, whether it's hard to follow is that what happens is -- and it's just not unique to Canada, but also, investors start to come to the U.S. exchanges to buy the Invesco PowerShares, ETFs here in the United States. So again, the greater recognition of ETFs in the marketplace, it is beyond what you see locally. I mean, it tends to go to the home exchanges also. So for us, it's been a very nice contribution to the Invesco PowerShares franchise. But more importantly, broadening out our ability to meet investors' needs in Canada has been a very good development.","Loren M. Starr","Yes. Again, probably just worth emphasizing one more time, our goal is not to sort of own the ETF market in Canada or any location. I mean, we're focused on this type of ETF capability that's sort of this better beta enhanced access-type of capability, and that's where we want to be well recognized and well known. So in terms of what BlackRock might be doing up there, that probably is not as relevant necessarily to our strategy.","Operator","Our next question does come from Robert Lee of KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question, and I apologize if you had addressed this earlier, but I had gone to the call a bit late. On the balance sheet, I mean, I noticed that you had the sequential jump-up in the outstanding on the credit facility. And, I guess, a couple of questions related to that, understanding you have bonus payments and things like that in the first quarter. So should we really be thinking this is with this kind of a timing thing about when you can actually access cash in the U.K. and bring it back to Bermuda? So how should we be thinking about kind of capital management in the next couple of quarters, maybe pay that back down? Should we think share repurchase and maybe this is a better run rate in terms of dollars spent thing about share repurchase over the next couple of quarters?","Loren M. Starr","Great, Rob. I think I'm going to offer you a job in my treasury because you know my cash flow as well as anybody. So yes. I mean, it's exactly what you said, that our bonus -- that we pay out bonuses, and that was a the big component. We also completed the acquisition of the 49% equity interest in Religare, so that was another part of it. And we did not get a dividend in this quarter, which in the past, we have, and that's going to happen in the second quarter. And so that will bring those balances down, and pretty much, we're well on track in terms of our continued focus on sort of overtime deleveraging and bringing down the credit facility. So we feel with the one point -- more than $1 billion of cash flow coming through in our operating income this year that we're going to be -- we'll be successful at attaining our goals of bringing down the credit facility over time.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And I guess most of that $1 billion cost of the -- have being able to bring back that dividend, that tends to occur the last 3 quarters of the year as opposed to kind of even spread, so to speak?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, that's right. It can be lumpy. And so it will happen twice a year. Typically, it's the way that happens. So probably second quarter and fourth quarter would be our expectations. And that will help us. Obviously, it supports our dividends that we announced externally in terms of the 30% increase and as well as buybacks.","Operator","The next question does come from Marc Irizarry of Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Oh, great. Just on the passive redemption and the low fee redemption that you mentioned, is that kind of a one-off? Or if you look at what's going on in the passive business, is there sort of this movement, some more movement going on there in terms of that business maybe getting a bit more competitive, or sort of maybe the smart beta wave taking hold?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, Marc. I'm happy to say that is absolutely a complete one-off. It has nothing to do with anything, and it is -- actually it expected to go I don't know how many years ago and never left. So -- but we finally have been notified about it. So it's -- it is one that has been around for a while. We don't have too many more like that.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Marty, can you talk a little bit about your alternative strategy. We've heard a lot about the lines kind of blurring between traditional and alternative strategies. Maybe how, if at all, acquisitions might play a role, and how that business sort of shakes out in the future?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. It's surely very topical. And again, I think our view is we have been very much focused on the areas where we think we can do job -- good job and meet the investor needs. So I -- and if you look through the capabilities we have, whether we will classify them differently, but we want to be real estate, bank loans, different type of credit, private equity, private equity fund of funds. So things that we have and then elements, frankly, in -- with our Quant teams with -- long, short capabilities and some of those strategies. So we, again, are, with capabilities we have, just continuing to extend them as we think they make sense for our clients. I think it'd be a little too early to declare beyond those types of things that you're seeing already largely. And I think if I talk about it in the retail market, then blurring things like real estate, things like bank loans, things that are there that have done well, they'll continue to. I personally think of some of the conversation is beyond sort of ahead of itself. I -- things like, I don't know, risk arbitrage, global macro, those types of things being available and fully understood and accepted in the retail channel. I think you're -- some good ways away from it and probably for a good reason. So again, I think people are seeking different asset classes and also into commodities, those types of things. I think those are natural progressions. I think the full extent of some of the conversations are ahead of themselves if that is helpful. But that's our point of view.","Operator","At this time, I show no further questions.","Martin L. Flanagan","Good.

If you have any objection, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today: Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Marty Flanagan","Thank you very much, and thank you for joining us today. And I will give the highlights of the business review and Loren will review the financials, as we typically do, and then open it up to everybody\u2019s questions.","So let me begin by highlighting the firm\u2019s operating results for the second quarter. I\u2019m on Slide 4 of the presentation, if you\u2019re so inclined to follow us and that is on the website. Long-term investment performance remained strong again during the quarter, ending with 71% and 78% of assets ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year basis. And the strong performance contributed to solid retail inflows during the quarter, $1.4 billion. Retail inflows were offset by institutional outflows, which resulted in net outflows of $0.6 billion. Now, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 39.3%, up from 37.7% over the prior quarter and we returned $119 million back to shareholders.","Assets under management were $858 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $834 billion in the prior quarter. Adjusted operating income was $357 million for the quarter, up from $327 million in the prior quarter, which resulted in adjusted earnings per share, diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.64, up from $0.61 in the prior quarter. And based on continued strong fundamentals of the business, we\u2019re providing a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share, which represents a 3.6% increase.","And before Loren gets to the financials, let me spend a few minutes on investment performance and flows.","On Slide 7, you\u2019ll note the performance over 1, 3, 5 and 7 years, and again, our commitment to investment excellence, and the work that the teams have done to build out a very strong culture, continues to generate very strong investment performance across the enterprise. And as I mentioned, 71% of the assets were in the top half on a 3-year basis; and 78% of assets on a 5-year basis.","Moving to flows, you\u2019ll note on the active side, gross sales and redemptions were roughly in line with the same quarter in the prior year, but the second quarter did see continued improvement in the positive trends in net active flows, which you\u2019ll note on Slide 8. Flows continue to be strong in taxable fixed income and Core Plus Bond funds. Flows in the passive capabilities were offset for the first quarter, primarily reflecting continued weak demand in our UIT \u2013 with UITs and a single large low fee real estate redemption during the quarter. We did see, during the quarter, solid flows into PowerShares fixed income, and the Senior Loan Fund in particular.","Retail flows were solid during the quarter, reflecting continued strength in certain of our PowerShares ETFs, as well as Global Targeted Return, European equities and other funds. We also saw strong inflows into our cross-border retail funds in Europe.","Our pipeline of won but not funded institutional opportunities remains strong. The funding was slower in the quarter than we anticipated, and redemptions were in line with where they were in the prior quarters, which led to the $2 billion in institutional outflows. The outflows are largely attributed to a slowdown in sales in Asia and heightened redemptions at stable value as clients were changing their asset allocations typically within in the plan.","Although the flow fissure was mixed for the second quarter, it\u2019s important to note that the composition of the inflows has been driven towards highly active capabilities and month-to-date, long-term inflows of more than $1.4 billion post June 30, reflecting a strength in our cross-border business in particular. And as always, we\u2019re early into the quarter. It could change, but so far, I think we\u2019re off to a good quarter with regard to flows.","So Loren, do you want to...?","Loren Starr","Yes, very much, thanks, Marty. So looking at our schedule on total assets under management, we saw quarter-over-quarter, total AUM increase $23.5 billion or 2.8%. That was driven by market gains of $13 billion, positive foreign exchange translation of $8.1 billion, we saw $2.8 billion of inflows into the money market capability. Also $0.2 billion of inflows into the QQQs. But these factors were somewhat offset by long-term net outflows of $0.6 billion. Average AUM for the second quarter came in at $849.2 billion, 2.3% versus the first quarter. And then looking at our net revenue yield, that came in at 42.7 basis points and our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, was at 41.8 basis points, so that was an increase of 0.9 basis points over the first quarter.","The positive impact of foreign exchange and the change in AUM mix added 0.7 basis points. One additional day added 0.4 basis points. These positive factors were then somewhat offset by the impact of a reduction in other revenue, which acted to decrease the yield by 0.2 basis points.","Moving on to Slide 12, that provides our U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter. As usual, my comments today will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which can be found on Slide 13.","Looking at Slide 13, you\u2019ll see our net revenues increased by $39.2 million or 4.5% quarter-over-quarter to $906.3 million, which included a positive foreign exchange effect of $9.1 million. Within that net revenue number, you\u2019ll see that our adjusted investment management fees increased by $54.3 million or 5.6% to $1.03 billion. This reflects higher average AUM as well as an additional day during the second quarter. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted management fee by $10 million.","Adjusted services and distribution revenues increased by $4.9 million or 2.4%, reflecting our higher average AUM in the quarter. FX decreased our adjusted service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Our adjusted performance fees for the quarter came in at $18 million, and these are earned from a variety of investment capabilities, including $7.4 million from accounts managed by our U.K. team, $6 million came from our private equity business, $2.7 million came from our Asia Pacific investment teams. Foreign exchange increased performance fees by $0.3 million.","And in the last two quarters of 2017, I will just update my guidance here, we expect performance fees to decline to roughly $5 million to $7 million per quarter, which, again, is subject to my usual caveat, that forecasting performance fees is an imperfect science, and certainly one that we don\u2019t have a huge line of sight to.","The adjusted other revenues in the second quarter came in at $17.3 million, and that was a decrease of $3.5 million from the prior quarter. It was driven by lower real estate transaction fees, UIT revenues as well as other front-end load fees. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted other revenue by $0.1 million. Again, looking to guidance here, looking forward to the second half of 2017, we would expect other revenues to remain near the second quarter levels at $16 million to $17 million per quarter.","Moving on down to the third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, that increased by $16.8 million or 4.8%. That\u2019s consistent with our increased revenues derived from the retail-related AUM as well as the additional day count in the quarter. Foreign exchange adjusted our third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $1.2 million. And before I move to the expense area of the P&L, let me try to summarize the revenue guidance I just provided in terms of net revenue yield.","So looking at the second half of 2017, we have two offsetting impacts. We would expect to see our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, increase by roughly 0.5 basis points, and that\u2019s driven primarily by the increase in day count, as well as the asset mix in the second half of the year. This increase, however, is going to be offset by the acquisition of Source assets, which will be dilutive to the firm\u2019s net revenue yield. As we had talked about, that\u2019s about $25 billion, and somewhere between 16 to 17 basis points. As a result, the overall net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, should remain actually fairly consistent with the second quarter level at 42 basis points for the second half of the year. Again, this guidance assumes flat markets and foreign exchange from today\u2019s levels. All right, so let\u2019s move to the expenses.","If we move on down the slide, you\u2019ll see our adjusted operating expenses at $549.8 million, increased by $9.8 million or 1.8% relative to the first quarter. Foreign exchange increased adjusted operating expenses by $4.3 million during the quarter. The adjusted employee compensation line item came in at $360.6 million, that\u2019s a decrease of $0.6 million or 0.2%. This is driven by a decline in seasonal payroll taxes. That always happens first quarter to second quarter. But it was offset by an increase in variable and other compensation costs, a full quarter of higher base salaries effective March 1 and an increase in deferred compensation expenses for the awards that were granted in the first quarter. The foreign exchange impact for our adjusted employee compensation came in at $2.5 million.","Looking forward, again, to the guidance, we\u2019re assuming AUM and foreign exchange flat to current levels. We\u2019d expect compensation to increase ratably to about $370 million by Q4. This increase in forecasted compensation costs includes the \u2013 several factors, including: The impact of the Source acquisition in the third quarter; investments that we\u2019re making behind some of our key strategic initiatives, including building out our institutional business, solutions, ETFs and Jemstep as well as resources that we are adding to meet the growth in regulatory and compliance requirements on a global basis.","Our adjusted marketing expenses in Q2 increased by $4.7 million or 18.8% to $29.7 million. That reflects an increase in advertising and client events. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted marketing expense by $0.3 million. Marketing costs should stay roughly flat to current levels until Q4, at which point in time this could grow to somewhere around $36 million to $38 million, consistent with the historic seasonality that we\u2019ve seen in the past.","The adjusted property, office and technology expenses were $88.7 million in the quarter. That\u2019s an increase of $3.1 million or 3.6% over the first quarter, due to higher outsourced administration and software costs. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted property, office and tech expenses by $0.7 million. For the remainder of 2017, we see property, office and technology costs coming in between $92 million to $94 million a quarter. This is due to the impact of large technology-related projects that have and are coming into service as well as the outsourced administration expenses driven by the activity within our European cross-border business which should move the activity.","Next, we go to adjusted general and administrative expenses at $70.8 million. That increased $2.6 million or 3.8% quarter-over-quarter. The G&A increase was largely driven by professional services costs associated with the regulatory changes and compliance that we\u2019re seeing on a global basis. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted G&A expenses by $0.8 million. We would expect G&A as a line item to remain at similar levels as in the second quarter or slightly elevated levels for the remainder of 2017, somewhere between $70 million and $73 million per quarter.","So finishing on the topic of expenses, I\u2019d like to emphasize that I do believe the organic and inorganic investments that we are making will serve as key business differentiators for Invesco, and therefore, are critical for our long-term success in what we see as a rapidly changing competitive environment. With that said, we will continue to be highly focused on cost optimization efforts in order to remain as efficient as possible and to help fund these investments.","So finally, moving down the page, you\u2019ll see our adjusted nonoperating income decrease $10 million compared to the first quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the gain realized on our pound sterling-U.S. dollar hedges in the first quarter. And moving to taxes, the firm\u2019s effective tax rate on a pretax adjusted net income basis was 26.7%, which brings us to our EPS at $0.64 and adjusted operating margin, 39.3%.","So with that, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Marty.","Marty Flanagan","Thanks, Loren. I do want to do two quick updates before we turn it over to Q&A. One on Jemstep and the second on our EMEA business. And many of you probably saw the news that the Advisor Group, which is a network of independent advisory firms announced a new platform for its 5,000 advisers they support. The comprehensive digital onboarding advice and data aggregation program for their financial advisers was launched in alliance with Jemstep, which is our adviser-focused digital solution business.","We view \u2013 we view this as a further sign that Jemstep\/Invesco combination offering digital advice platform as tremendous value-added technology in our sector and it is resonating in the marketplace. The platform extends to both advisers and their end clients to strengthen their relationship and will be used to support advisory and brokerage business models, which as far as we can tell, is unique in the marketplace. And as noted on previous calls, it\u2019s early days, but we do see Jemstep as having meaningful potential in the market for us.","With regard to EMEA, we saw the fourth consecutive quarter of positive long-term net inflows in the region, which totaled nearly $3 billion in the second quarter, despite a large one-off sovereign wealth fund redemption. Quarterly gross flows for the region of $14.3 billion were the highest since the first quarter of 2015. Long-term flows into the cross-border retail totaled $4.1 billion for the quarter, and our Global Targeted Return fund remains in high demand, with inflows of $2 billion during the quarter.","We did not purchase any stock during the quarter, instead reserving a portion of our available cash for the planned acquisition of Source, the leading specialist provider of ETFs based in Europe. We are making very good progress on the regulatory approvals and remain on track to close the transaction at the end of the third quarter. Net inflows into Source have been strong year-to-date. We remain focused on planning the combination of our two firms, building on Invesco\u2019s significant expertise and track record of bringing companies together for the benefit of clients, employees and shareholders. We really are excited about this opportunity and we do think the combination of our ETF with Source, in Europe, will really be a meaningful addition to the company.","So with that, I will stop, and Loren and I will answer any questions anybody has.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. First, I wanted to dig more into the institutional sales. So can you give us a little more flavor about the slowdown in Asia, and how the Asian-specific pipeline is looking and maybe where the conversions in Asia have fallen off? And then, why aren\u2019t you seeing the weakness in Asia being offset by conversions of the strong pipeline elsewhere? Then lastly, can you give us maybe an outlook for the second half of the year on the institutional side? Any conviction in moving back to positive sales there?","Marty Flanagan","Yes, Ken, let me hit a couple of those and Loren can chime in. So just literally with regard to the won but not funded pipeline, that continues to remain strong and it is just a fundamental fact, we\u2019re not making the decision of when the organizations are going to finish their processes to fund. So we see it simply as a timing topic, nothing to do with a falloff in success of the business. Where it has gotten softer after a very, very strong 18 months is really in Japan, where it has been just \u2013 that big change in some of those big plans. We were a significant beneficiary of it, and literally was funding almost every single month. So at some point, that \u2013 it stops. So it\u2019s flattening off more than anything else. So those would be the two comments I would make. Anything you\u2019d add?","Loren Starr","I mean, I do think we\u2019re still pretty optimistic about the overall story on the institutional side, for sure. The fee rate on flows are at a much higher level, continues to be sort of record highs on the aggregate basis points. And then, that weakness, as you suggest, is being offset in other locations. Europe is quite strong. So again, we \u2013 I think it\u2019s more just an aberration around just a confluence of things that happened in second quarter as opposed to a real inflection point indicating that something\u2019s at a whole new level of decline. So the thing that I would say is we have pretty good line of sight on the won but not funded, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m referring to right now. When redemptions happen, which they can, that\u2019s harder for us to predict. And so we did get caught offsided by one large sovereign wealth outflow in the quarter, which was pretty sizable, $1.2 billion. And those are hard for us to really see. We don\u2019t expect those to recur, but again, we don\u2019t know.","Ken Worthington","Great. And then just on PowerShares, it looks like PowerShares is looking to launch some market cap weighted ETFs. Somewhat of a departure from the smart beta focus. Can you talk about what PowerShares is doing here and if there\u2019s any tie back here to Jemstep?","Marty Flanagan","Yes, good question, Ken. So it is two things, it\u2019s not just Jemstep, but also solutions. And really, as we build the models, in line with what clients are trying to accomplish, they do use cap-weighted indexes in there. So it\u2019s not as a single solution but as a part of a total portfolio. And we\u2019re very capable of managing cap-weighted indexes, so it\u2019s for solutions and frankly, also into Jemstep, where a number of models have been built to give various choice to the different participants. So those are the two focuses there.","Ken Worthington","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Your line is open.","Patrick Davitt","Thank a lot. First question is just around the broader European kind of regulatory environment, particularly as so much of your growth is coming from that region. Do you have any change in position or more specificity on the impact of MiFID II on your business and\/or profitability? And then, more recently, any kind of initial reaction to the FCA review and your positioning for their major proposals?","Marty Flanagan","Yes, let\u2019s \u2013 with MiFID coming on, like everybody, it\u2019s been \u2013 an awful lot of work, heads down. We really see no different \u2013 we do not have a different point of view today than we have over the last number of quarters. It is more work, it\u2019s not going to dramatically change our business. I would say, this and also in combination with the FCA work, it ultimately does favor larger firms that are capable of working through these topics and frankly, can afford the additional costs to meet the regulations. Back to the FCA, it did make a number of recommendations. Some of the principal regulations we\u2019re already in line with. So one of them was to have a single fee. We did that a couple of years ago.","So we\u2019re beyond that, and I think some of the areas that they\u2019re focused on, greater transparency and the like, some of the early suggestions, again, we are supportive of those types of things. We, like others in the industry, will be commenting during this period and try to help give greater guidance, but again, it is something that we feel very well-positioned. They were also focused in particular on really, what they would sort of call closet indexers. Needless to say, that\u2019s not even close to a topic for us, and the investment performance of our teams over a very, very long period of time is just really outstanding. So again, it\u2019s a burden for the overall industry, but again, with the idea of making it a better industry, which is we are very supportive of. But again, we think we\u2019ll be fine once we get through this.","Loren Starr","And Pat, just to remind you, I mean, we did come out, I think it was last quarter, in terms of our position with respect to the use of commissions on research, and so we said that we were going to continue to focus on, within the \u2013 of our ability within MiFID II, to use CSAs to fund RPAs, which would mean that there\u2019s not a substantial impact on cost for us, as long as competitively that\u2019s still, and from a regulatory perspective, that still makes sense.","The other thing is, just in terms of positioning, and we have a substantial number of people on the ground, have for a long time, in Continental Europe. So the idea of what would ultimately happen, in terms of having risk and foreign oversight of capabilities in terms of this passporting topic and so forth, is another thing that I\u2019d say we feel probably better position than most others in the region. So overall, I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s no cost there. There\u2019s probably some cost, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a substantial material cost at this point in time.","Patrick Davitt","That\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Carrier","Maybe just one on the expense outlook and then just thinking about kind of the incremental margin in this environment. I just wanted to get a sense, it seems like some of these investments you guys are picking up or ramping up, like how much flexibility do you have there? Are you doing more, because the market environment, you guys have been a little bit more constructive? I just wanted to get your sense on how you\u2019re thinking about the margin in this operating environment?","Marty Flanagan","Let me make a comment, and Loren can, too. So as we said, there\u2019s no question that the industry is going through quite a bit of a change. And clients are demanding different things from organizations. So simply having a range of capabilities perform well is not going to get you over the goal line, regardless of retail and institutional. And you absolutely have to have the ability to meet client outcomes with things like solutions. This movement into Jemstep to support our financial advisers, we think, is very, very important. Things like thought leadership, they are not optional value-added capabilities.","And so we think it\u2019s really important that we continue to responsively invest against those, which we are doing. We think it\u2019s just making the firm much more competitive and better-placed for the longer-term. And yes, it does make it easier to make the investments in a strong market. We\u2019re trying to get them done as quickly as we can, but again, with very much a responsible lens on being financially sound during the process.","Loren Starr","Yes, really not going to add much more to what you said, Marty, other than, I think, quantifying. In terms of incremental margin, I mean, I think we\u2019re probably at a level that\u2019s more in the 40% to 50% range incremental margin, as opposed to sort of the 50% to 65% right now, just because of our imperatives to make sure that we build out the capabilities that are going to be critical to our success and trying to do that now, but responsibly in the sense that we\u2019re continuing to find opportunities to save and to fund those. So you\u2019re going to see operating leverage, you\u2019re going to see margin expansion as we grow. All those things should absolutely continue to be in place, but maybe not quite at the level of lower investment type of positioning.","Marty Flanagan","And I just might come back and add. Ken was asking some questions a few minutes ago. So we look at things like the institutional pipeline over quarter-to-quarter. That\u2019s not the way we look at it. From our perspective, we look out 1, 2, 3 years, and we look at it as a very, very important part of our future success. And as I said, I feel very good about the leadership in place. I feel very good about the responses we\u2019re starting to get from clients as we are dealing with them in a more robust way. And again, it is not a \u2013 the assets just don\u2019t go straight up. They are choppier, just by the nature of the long-term, our fee process, et cetera, et cetera. So again, that would be another area where we just think it\u2019s really important that we do a good job.","Michael Carrier","Okay, all that makes sense. Just on capital, so post the Source deal, just wanted to get a sense, anything changing on how you guys are thinking about you know, kind of buyback activity, just given that we\u2019ve been in this lull between the deal?","Loren Starr","So I think it is our capital policy and approach remains in place. Obviously, we smartly, I think, are pausing on the buyback just so we can fund this acquisition. The opportunity set for things in this industry around consolidation is at a high level, too. So I\u2019ll just generally say that we\u2019re seeing probably more inorganic opportunities than we have in the past. Certainly, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to do something else other than Source. But I think our general position is one of this is a unique and extraordinary time, and so we may continue to be thinking about the balance of cash to return, versus opportunities in the market that might not show themselves again, so. And again, it\u2019s a little bit hard to say exactly, but we are generally, I\u2019d say, back in our normal return mode post-Source.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. I guess, just another question on expenses. You have this business optimization plan that\u2019s also in place, where I think you in the press release, highlight sort of more run rate savings going into 2018 now. I guess, if we think about the guidance you\u2019ve given for the remainder of this year, how much of this is reflective of some of the new \u2013 the incremental spend of compliance and growth, but then you obviously have Source and you\u2019re offsetting this with some of these business optimizations. So I guess, is there a way to kind of bucket some of these in terms of categories of the incremental spend?","Loren Starr","Well, I tell you, I mean, into the second half, certainly a substantial part of the expense pickup is just related to Source. Again, you probably have a reasonable sense of kind of the revenues and expenses for that business based on what you know about that business, so you can kind of do the math and see where that\u2019s breaking out. The optimization impact is going to be most felt in 2018, because we have some very large-scale projects that are not going to get completed until 2018. And it\u2019s only until that happens will we see sort of the remainder of the \u2013 to the full 50 run rate show up. So I\u2019d say, through the second half of this year, there\u2019s definitely some offset of the investments through optimization efforts, but not incrementally a lot. So I don\u2019t know if that fully answers your question, but I\u2019d say at least half of the expense pickup is due to Source and the other half is just due to the investments that we\u2019ve been making, generally.","Dan Fannon","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then, Marty, I think in the press release and in your comments, you mentioned stable value as being kind of a source of redemptions. Can you talk about that and why that wouldn\u2019t be, or are you anticipating that to continue to be a headwind, given some of the client reallocation in that bucket?","Marty Flanagan","I don\u2019t. Look, I think it\u2019s just the normal course of people doing their allocations with their 401k plans and here we are, 2017 and what has been more or less an extended bull market and people seem to be in some of these plans, moving out of stable value into some higher risk\/return products. Whether that\u2019s the right timing or not, I\u2019m not sure, but that\u2019s not my decision. I think what I would point to probably is the \u2013 and this is no new news to anybody following the company, but the headwinds of the UIT business, I mean, that continues to be one that is not immaterial when you look at the relative flows quarter-to-quarter. And again, we\u2019re just going to have to see where that goes as things settle out with the \u2013 as the platforms rebalance what they want to do in light of the DOL fiduciary rule. So I would point to that as the more topical area than stable value. Stable value, I think, will continue to be solid.","Dan Fannon","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Bill Katz","Thanks for taking the question. Just a technical question before I get to the meat of the question. Did you mention that the marketing spend would be in that $38 million range in Q3 or it sort of tip-toes there by the end of the year?","Loren Starr","Marketing\u2019s going to be roughly flat to what it was in the second quarter, and it\u2019s really just in Q4 where it goes to that higher level.","Bill Katz","Got you. So the other question was, just sort of staying on the expense theme, what\u2019s the life of the incremental spend here? So I appreciate you\u2019re taking the incremental margin down pretty substantially, and I guess half of that is from Source, but is there a more structural change in the business model here, maybe for you and maybe the industry at large? Because it seems you already have some in terms of the investment spend. So when you get on the other side of this hump of spending, are you back into that north of 50% incremental margin or are you just now at a structurally less incrementally profitable point?","Loren Starr","I think this is not a structural topic. I think it\u2019s more building around what we see as absolutely key points of differentiation in growth that we want to be ahead of as opposed to sort of running behind competitors and the industry trends. So I think we\u2019re doing a lot and we\u2019re really, I think, getting through the bulk of what we need to get through. It will probably persist into 2018, I\u2019d say, for us to get to sort of an equilibrium point, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a structural ongoing theme in terms of incremental margins for us.","Marty Flanagan","Yes, I agree with that fully, Loren\u2019s comments. And again, I\u2019d just come back to we all thought it\u2019s been a competitive business, over our careers here, but I will tell you, I mean, this is a very different time. And if you are not investing for the future, in a very rapid way, you\u2019re going backwards. And so again, we are \u2013 we think we\u2019re being very responsible. We are seeing the results in very different areas and I think if you look at what we\u2019ve done over the years, we have a track record of the investments paying off in a pretty material way and that\u2019s what we think we\u2019re doing right now. Are they all going to be perfect? No, they\u2019re not. But we feel quite confident the vast majority of them will be very important to the firm.","Bill Katz","Okay, and then also looking at some of the flow matrix, sort of focusing in on U.S. equity. You look at some of the slide decks and performance trends, they continue to be somewhat checkered. How are you thinking about that business in light of just the ongoing commoditization risk to passive. Is this an area that \u2013 is this an area you could accelerate on the investment spending side to potentially enhance returns? Is it just a timing or cycle issue, just sort of work through some weaker performance? Just trying to get a sense of what would alleviate that pressure point.","Marty Flanagan","Yes, look, I feel really good about our investment teams. And yes, has there been a headwind in U.S. equities in particular? Yes. Do I think \u2013 I personally think it\u2019s an incredible mistake to be putting your 100% of your U.S. equity exposure into cap-weighted indexes. There\u2019s going to be some very disappointed people that have done that. And if you look at the U.S. value capability in particular, relatively underperforming, they are doing exactly what they should be doing, being 100% committed to their investment process, they will do very well. And when we saw the spike at the end of last year, after \u2013 if you want to call it after the election, through the end of the year, it picked up 1,000 basis points against cap-weighted indexes. So again, it\u2019s very easy to say it\u2019s different this time, and I just \u2013 we\u2019re supporters of passive and factor and active in a \u2013 very clearly, but I think it\u2019s a mistake to give up on active at this part of the cycle.","Bill Katz","Got you. Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line open.","Alex Blostein","So just staying with the expenses and the margin dynamic. Just one point of clarification. Do you guys expect to be at the 50% to 60% incremental margin in 2018? Or the investment spend that you are seeing in the back half of the year is likely to continue beyond that point?","Loren Starr","Yes, I think the 50% to 60% is probably post-2018, based on what I just mentioned in terms of the higher level of investment and we\u2019re probably setting expectations, realistically, that would be in the more 40% to 50% for this year, next year. So that is kind of where we are right now. We haven\u2019t, obviously, fully completed our plan around what we\u2019re doing in 2018, and a lot obviously will depend on where the markets go and where the mix of products go. We\u2019re definitely, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a good thing that\u2019s very helpful for us is the fee dynamic is working in our favor, with the strength that we\u2019re seeing in the cross-border business, and as Marty said, it just continues through July, very strong flows, that is very helpful. And the fact that the pound is now at 1.31 and strengthening, also is going to be extremely helpful for our yield. So that could actually help our net \u2013 my incremental margin discussion. But assuming flat markets and flat FX is what I\u2019m referring to.","Alex Blostein","Right. Okay. And I guess, bigger picture question, so you guys \u2013 I totally understand why you\u2019re spending where you\u2019re spending and the segment changes in the space, but at the same time, the \u2013 a good chunk of the equity business in the U.S. is underperforming on a 5-year basis. I mean, U.S. core business is struggling. So I guess, why not pull back and create a little more of a cost reduction on that part of the business to fund some of the initiatives that you\u2019ve highlighted?","Marty Flanaga","Yes, I think that could be just about the biggest mistake somebody could make, as far as I\u2019m concerned right now. They are high-quality teams, they are very, very good at what they do. And investors, our clients are going to do very fine with them through the market cycle, and that\u2019s how I feel.","Alex Blostein","Fair enough. And I guess, just the last one, on Source. I don\u2019t recall if you guys gave us the amount of cost synergies that you anticipate to have from that business once that closes. Just kind of perhaps how long it will take to get that out of the run rate?","Loren Starr","Yes, we have not provided a lot of transparency into the synergies topic. Again, in terms of the materiality, it\u2019s all going to be within our guidance that we\u2019ll obviously provide for 2018 and beyond. And certainly, some of it is already baked into the estimates that we provided you. It\u2019s mostly a growth topic for us, as we said in the past. There\u2019s definitely some overlaps that will allow for some cost take-out, but the real benefit for this platform is us growing through flows, and as Marty mentioned, it is flowing beautifully, right, very nicely. And so we think we can actually significantly improve flows out of that business. We are looking at a lot of new product launches, so really, the \u2013 it\u2019s going to be more of investing behind the business than taking cost out. So that\u2019s why we really have been focused on it.","Alex Blostein","Great. Thank guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell","Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just an update \u2013 some updated thoughts on DOL fiduciary rule timing, maybe both in how you think distribution partners are currently positioned and will react on the active mutual fund side, including financial adviser views. And your view of, to what extent do you think that clean shares will become much more dominant in the marketplace? And maybe just long-term views on whether the BIC gets restructured for January 1, 2018?","Marty Flanaga","Let\u2019s see. So maybe let me try to put it in context of the big picture and I \u2013 and again, we\u2019ve said this before and other have. It\u2019s just very, very clear that the fund \u2013 the distributors are moving to a financial advisory model across the board and that was a direction of travel anyways. I think the DOL fiduciary rule really just sped that up. So I think everybody sees that clearly. The \u2013 I think with regard to the BIC, I think there\u2019s anticipation that it will be modified quite materially to ensure that financial advisers and investors have choice, because it really does get in the way of investors having choice, which means it gets in the way of people building robust, meaningful portfolios with a combination of active, factor-based portfolios. So I think that is important. I think I would put it in the category of people are hopeful that it\u2019s going to happen and it really needs to happen before we move into the next year. So I think the best top of mind on everybody\u2019s to-do list is we continue to try to support that change.","Brian Bedell","And any commentary on clean shares and or T shares, I guess?","Marty Flanaga","Yes, it feels like clean shares, over time, make an awful lot of sense. I think it\u2019s going to follow the transition to the advisory model where I think that would be a really good thing, because right now, mutual funds are disadvantaged from the standpoint that they are really a paying agent, so it makes the expense ratio really inflated when you look at it vis-a-vis something like an ETF, because you are literally paying for service and distribution costs in that model. In the advisory model, the overall fee is what is paying for the financial advice and the mutual fund within it would have the clean share lower expense ratio, and frankly, would be on a more level playing field with things like ETFs. And again, vehicles are not ways to meet investment objectives, but they are \u2013 they have different attributes which are helpful to different situations. So that\u2019s probably where it\u2019s going to end up, but it\u2019s probably going to take a couple of years to get there, I would guess.","Brian Bedell","Okay, that\u2019s great color. And then, just maybe your updated views on large-scale M&A. First of all, it was interesting, I think, Loren, what you talked about, potential opportunities or the market getting to a point where there, looks like there might be more opportunities for you guys to acquire things. And maybe just some commentary about what you may need to fill out an already, pretty diversified product set. And then, broader picture for Marty. You commented on this before in the past, so just maybe your updated views on large-scale consolidation in the active \u2013 or in the asset management industry. Given active performance actually has improved this year so far, but keeping in mind like what you said in terms of investing for the future, if you\u2019re not doing that, you\u2019re falling behind. So do you see that, I guess, environment for large-scale consolidation even more appealing now, than say, 6 months ago?","Marty Flanaga","Yes. Let\u2019s see. I still believe the likelihood of more combinations and meaningful combinations is more likely now than probably any time in my career for all the dynamics that we all know that we\u2019ve been talking about. It continues to be difficult to do successfully. And \u2013 but I would say, firms that combine when they both are strong, much better likelihood of outcome. I think it\u2019s those firms that are two struggling firms and you put them together, that I think is a very difficult situation, quite frankly. So the good performance might actually enhance some of these combinations or the likelihood of them. But again, I think it\u2019s really the firms that are U.S. retail-focused firms that are midsize are probably the most challenged, and with all the dynamics that we\u2019ve been talking about. So yes, we\u2019ll just have to see what happens and it\u2019s hard to predict and it always takes longer than anybody would imagine. But Loren, would you add something?","Loren Starr","Yes, and the only I would just say is when I was talking about \u2013 I wasn\u2019t necessarily referring to large-scale opportunities, because I think we\u2019ve talked about those are hard to do, there\u2019s a lot of risk, there\u2019s a lot of complication. So I think the types of things that are most attractive to us would be things like Source, that are smaller, that we could plug in, gives us a platform or capability that we didn\u2019t have before and that we can grow quickly. So that\u2019s really, I think, in terms of what we would be thinking about more, than large-scale.","Brian Bedell","Okay, its great color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And now we have Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is open.","Chris Shutler","Given that expenses are a popular topic today, maybe just summarize the major incremental investments that you\u2019re making. I think you mentioned institutional solutions, Jemstep, there may have been others I missed. Can you just walk through those one by one and give us a few more details on each of them?","Loren Starr","Yes. So I mean, and Marty, you can pick up on the theme, building our institutional business is something that we\u2019ve been talking about in the past. You know, I think we have been more retail-focused as a firm and for us, in terms of getting to being seen as a premier institutional player, requires a lot of dedicated support and infrastructure, risk and analytics and reporting and a variety of infrastructure that we just didn\u2019t have in the past. That really, [indiscernible] manager, there\u2019s a whole infrastructure around building that out. Thought leadership is another kind of element.","So that\u2019s \u2013 handful of the people, but very capable and good people, that help drive that cost. Solutions is another area that we talked about and that is, again, a very \u2013 an area we\u2019ve been in, but really haven\u2019t built a lot of strong capabilities around, particularly around the technology, and as I mentioned, the analytics for us to be able to sort of go off and really, almost like in a lab, figure out how to solve our clients\u2019 problems through a variety of folks that are a lot smarter than me, PhDs and others, that are thinking about those issues. So that\u2019s really that group and that appeals to both the institutional side, but also the retail side.","And then they are very helpful, in terms of thinking about Jemstep as well, in terms of providing models and solutions to the retail clients. ETFs was the other area that you \u2013 we mentioned, and that\u2019s more inorganic, and obviously Source, for us, but certainly, the ability to take some of those capabilities and port them over to the U.S. and think about the digital platform and being the best-in-class provider of smart beta and differentiated ETFS is still kind of what we\u2019re trying to do and being \u2013 not be a distant fourth but be a strong fourth, at least a bit in that space. And Jemstep, they\u2019re really savvy in digital advice, which I think is going to continue to be a major opportunity and certainly, firms that have it are going to being differentiated from those who don\u2019t. So we need to have a state-of-the-art capability and it\u2019s one that requires a whole different set of skill sets, and so that\u2019s kind of the other big bucket. And the other one I mentioned, which you know, is the regulatory and compliance, which is just never-ending.","Marty Flanagan","Yes, I\u2019ll just add a little color, just on the solutions piece. Again, I think it\u2019s a common word and I think it\u2019s misunderstood. I think people tend to think of it as dealing with large institutions. I mean, we look at it at 3 levels, as Loren was saying. So it literally is at the large institutional level, that\u2019s a fact. What has been surprising, the opportunity of solutions at the retail level, because as all the channels are moving, the financial advisers are moving too to be much more solutions-oriented or outcome-oriented with their clients. And our ability to build portfolios for them, whether they be in models or literally help them with their books through our range of passive, factor, active capabilities is really, really important.","And so \u2013 and the third leg is Jemstep, right? And really, building these models for Jemstep is really quite important. And let me go back to, I just mentioned one group. So the adviser group of 5,000 advisers, so it\u2019s more likely than not, and I\u2019d say very likely by next year. So those are 5,000 advisers we\u2019ve never worked with before. It\u2019s very easy that we can be working with 20,000, 25,000 advisers next year that we\u2019ve never worked with before, because of things like Jemstep. So the combination of these things that we\u2019re doing is broadening our distribution channels, serving our clients in a very different way, which really creates the robustness of what the future could look like for the organization.","Chris Shutler","Okay, and just one other one on the fixed income area. Looks like flows there in active fixed income been okay over the last few quarters, but I guess I\u2019m wondering why they haven\u2019t been better, just given the really \u2013 the terrific performance you have in that area. Is it investors adjusting durations in their portfolios or is there some other factor going on?","Loren Starr","That\u2019s all, I mean, really, the biggest detractor from that category has been stable value. So that was substantial outflows this quarter. So it\u2019s a very low fee, 10 basis points kind of -ish. So again, when I think about the flows in versus out, our net revenue yield is, by far and away, moving up in that category. So I wouldn\u2019t take too much out of that stable value outflow.","Chris Shutler","Okay, it make sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Chris Harris","Another one on the investments you\u2019re making. In a perfect world, how quickly do you guys think some of these investments are really going to start pay off and potentially start showing up in flows? Is it a short lead time do you think? Or is it sort of a multiyear effort that\u2019s going on?","Marty Flanagan","I\u2019ll try to hit some of them. Institutionally, you\u2019re already seeing it. Solutions, it\u2019s happening. Is it at the level that we think it\u2019s going to be? No. It\u2019s early on. But you\u2019re literally getting payback. Jemstep tends to be the longer-dated one because, again, you\u2019re actually doing an installation of an application, which I think we\u2019ve all lived those experiences. It just takes time. And so that would probably be the timing, and I say you\u2019ll start to see, in each of those 3 different levels, flows will continue to pick up in the quarters ahead and next...","Loren Starr","ETFs will be almost immediate, right, because we have Source coming online.","Marty Flanagan","Yes.","Chris Harris","Okay, great. And then a follow-up on the fee rate. Loren, I thought I heard you say the second half sort of flat with Q2. Is that correct?","Loren Starr","Yes. Really, a result of these two dynamics. One, we\u2019re seeing the fee rate improve due to the mix and foreign exchange, so that\u2019s like a 0.5 basis point upward tick, which has been getting flattened out, just purely from the consolidation of the $25 billion, at 16 to 17 basis points of Jemstep \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, of Source.","Chris Harris","Yes, okay. I mean, it would seem to us that Source would have overwhelmed the other positive, but I guess, apparently not. I guess, the fee rates sound like there\u2019s an incremental positive going on into Q3 that offsets the Source, I guess, is what the message is, is that right?","Loren Starr","That\u2019s correct.","Chris Harris","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is open.","Brennan Hawken","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First, on clean shares and the outlook for this becoming a solution in the \u2013 particularly in the adviser broker solo channel. Who do you think or how do you think the sub-TA piece would be funded? And how have negotiations with your distribution partners gone on that point? Is that something that you think might have to be funded by the P&L of the sponsoring asset manager? Or would it be something that the distribution partners are going to be okay with losing that revenue source?","Marty Flanagan","It\u2019s a good question. I\u2019d say you\u2019re ahead of really all the conversations and there\u2019s not a direct \u2013 it\u2019s not clear where everything is going to settle out. And I think much of it depends on where the DOL settles out. So again, I would just be totally speculating on what the structures might look like at the end. So wish I could be more helpful, I just can\u2019t right now.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, that\u2019s fair, that\u2019s fair. And then, can you give us \u2013 I know that you guys have said that you expect pretty much everybody signed up for RPAs and it sounds like you\u2019re continuing to reiterate that point. So I\u2019m guessing that early-stage negotiations with clients are supportive of that. Is that true? Are there any early reads you can give us, particularly on the institutional side, in how that\u2019s going and what your expectations are for any application of some of these practices globally for Invesco?","Loren Starr","So based on what we understand in Europe, which is where this conversation has been most focused and relevant, client reaction has been pretty much absolutely accepting of that perspective. We\u2019re not alone in terms of the global \u2013 a lot of the global managers have come out with a very similar statement. So it\u2019s actually been pretty much accepted. Ultimately, I think, when \u2013 the real trick will be in terms of the actual disclosures. And when it will ultimately get implemented, we\u2019ll have to see how all that goes. But certainly, in terms of the position, it\u2019s been accepted without much of a, any pushback. In terms of the global side, I don\u2019t know, Marty, if you think that we\u2019re thinking about doing that globally? I don\u2019t think at this point we\u2019re in a position to say what we\u2019re doing in the U.S. different than normal.","Marty Flanagan","Yes, no, we\u2019re continuing down the path that we\u2019ve been on.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Mike Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Mike Cyprys","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the question. Just coming back to the investment spend. You spoke about a lot of the challenges that the industry faces and the need to invest. So I guess, why not invest more than the amounts that you guided to? What was the thought process behind that? And what gives you confidence that you\u2019re investing enough to be successful and drive future growth?","Marty Flanagan","Yes, look, that\u2019s the right question, we ask it all the time. And again, we think we\u2019re on the right topics. We think we\u2019re making progress on the right topics. And the fundamental base is just that. Are you investing enough and what we really constantly are doing is ensuring that we try to free up, reallocate dollars to the things that are making a difference. Loren has spoken in particular about the various areas that we try to create room for investments, and that is our process. Can\u2019t answer it specifically, because it\u2019s what we do each and every day. But we are thinking the way that you\u2019re thinking.","Mike Cyprys","Okay, and if you were to expand the investments and the pace, what other areas could make sense? And then just on the regulatory compliance spend versus the others, how should we think about the split in terms of how much of the spend is going for regulatory compliance versus growing the business?","Marty Flanagan","Yes, the majority of it these days is going for growing the business, which \u2013 and I think we\u2019re on the right topics. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re missing. We are investing on the things that we think are going to make a difference. The regulatory spend is no different than any other of our competitors. It just seems to be constantly an area where you have to invest in, and not just regulatory, but I would put cybersecurity in that category, too. I mean, there are areas that we just, 5, 6, 7 years ago, it was just not an area we had to invest at this magnitude.","Mike Cyprys","I guess, what\u2019s changed on the regulatory side over the past 12 months? Because certainly, this has been a theme that you and others have been speaking about for some time in terms of driving spend. What sort of changed in terms of what you know differently today versus 12 months ago versus two years ago?","Marty Flanagan","Well, part of it is, as the regulations come out, they\u2019re proposals, and you work through the process of having them put in place and then implementing them. So you\u2019re actually \u2013 you\u2019re now in the implementation stage of a number of these regulations in different parts of the world, and that\u2019s really why you\u2019ve seen the costs start to hit more recently, the last 12, 18 months, more in particular. And I\u2019d say the same thing. I just look at where we\u2019re spending money, on cybersecurity and security, generally, over the last couple of years in particular, it\u2019s just ticked up to a degree that, yes, we were spending before, but it\u2019s just at a different magnitude that you have to spend to stay ahead of the issues. You don\u2019t want to read about yourself in the paper, right?","Loren Starr","Penalties, like I mean, that privacy rule, where, if you get it wrong, it\u2019s 2% of total revenues could be your fine, right. Pretty substantial element. So I think it is the regulatory \u2013 the number of regulatory changes plus, I think, the amount of resources that regulators are putting behind the asset management business now relative to two years ago has also increased, and so the level of being absolutely on top of it is \u2013 the bar has risen across the globe in terms of what is required.","Mike Cyprys","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Kenneth Lee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line open.","Kenneth Lee","Thanks for taking my question. I just had a question on the Source acquisition. My understanding is that ETFs right now don\u2019t have the same level of penetration in Europe as they do in the U.S. due to market structure. Just what sort of milestones do you see ahead before you see, like a meaningful increase in penetration in ETFs within Europe?","Marty Flanagan","You\u2019re right. The penetration is not there in Europe. Our anticipation is that it will continue to see greater penetration in the years ahead. If you look at the history of the growth in the United States, and you look at the path where Europe is on now, it\u2019s some years later, but it seems to be following the path, with greater adoption. There was also an important evolution with the ETFs, too, where they were derivatives-based, and now there\u2019s more physical ETFs, too. And so you\u2019re broadening the potential users of derivatives in Europe, so we\u2019re anticipating that\u2019s going to continue to be a growing marketplace for ETFs and the penetration to \u2013 of ETFs to increase.","Loren Starr","Yes, and probably even with some of the rules around MiFID II and the transparency on fees, and whereas there maybe not has been as much, and certainly, the idea of no inducements provided for manufacturers, distributors and how that gets implemented, feels sort of like RDR part two...","Marty Flanagan","Yes.","Loren Starr","In Europe in some ways, and we know that that\u2019s focused on just pure management fees. It will probably drive more adoption of lower-fee products, still within the hands of European retail clients as opposed to institutional clients who are using ETFs predominantly.","Kenneth Lee","Great. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And now we have Robert Lee of KBW. Your line is open.","Robert Lee","Thank you, thanks for taking my question. I have \u2013 maybe just want to go back to, Loren, your MiFID comments, because I may have missed some of it. I guess, two parts, and number one, is it still your expectation, I know it\u2019s still somewhat in flux, that you won\u2019t have to fund, outside of spending on systems and stuff, you won\u2019t have to fund it off your P&L at this point? Or how do you kind of think of that as a go-forward risk?","Loren Starr","When you talk about outside systems, are you talking about...?","Robert Lee","Well, reporting systems. I mean, I know you\u2019re spending money on the compliance side of MiFID, right, but I meant more just in terms of the commission side of it.","Loren Starr","Well, the commission side, again, that\u2019s the part that we\u2019re saying would probably stay in terms of being paid through these RPA accounts funds and clients paid for, and transparency for research. So that\u2019s the current approach. So that would be largely sort of a continuation of existing P&L and practices other than sort of having those structures in place. So there would be no significant P&L impact to Invesco.","Robert Lee","Okay, great. Just wanted to clarify that\u2019s your current thought. And I guess, if I look at flows, I mean, maybe thinking of them in a different way. You\u2019ve kind of, I think, talked to this, but if we look at the modest outflow this quarter in aggregate, what\u2019s the \u2013 how should we be thinking about that, really, from kind of a net revenue contribution perspective? So I mean, stable value, as you pointed out, is low fee. You\u2019ve maybe had some other things. So how should we be thinking of your expectation for the net revenue contribution of the quarter and also go-forward?","Loren Starr","Yes, positive. So the net revenue, the flow mix dynamic, given the headline was kind of not great in terms of the net flow number, I was actually really pleased. If you peel that back and you understand what\u2019s flowing in terms of the strong flows coming into cross-border \u2013 into alternative opportunities which are certainly at a higher \u2013 being very active capabilities. So yes, when we were talking about sort of a 0.5 basis point pickup into next, the last half of the year, that\u2019s all due to the positive trend around the flow dynamic that we\u2019re seeing, even though it didn\u2019t really show up in terms of the headline flow number.","The big outflows, as I mentioned, stable value, which was single \u2013 10 basis points, and we had the individual real estate passive outflow, which was a single point kind of \u2013 UITs as well, which is something that, I think we all understand that dynamic. It\u2019s something that continues to be a bit of a detractor to the flow story, but not one that I think materially impacts our yield. So overall, I\u2019d say that people should be looking beyond that headline number and focus on what\u2019s going on, in Europe in particular, because that is going to have the biggest impact on our net revenue yield.","Robert Lee","Okay. And then maybe one last question, just kind of maybe bigger picture. The one place in U.S. retail that seems to have some positive trend is clearly the SMA business, whether it\u2019s model portfolios or whatnot. Can you maybe give us a sense of how you feel about your positioning in that business? Is that business a part of your retail business that you feel like you need to kind of make more investment in, that you have the right products in the right places? If you can maybe update us on that?","Marty Flanagan","It is an evolving opportunity, there\u2019s no question about it. We have the capability with mechanical SMA structures. We also have the ability through \u2013 to build the different models, and like everybody, it\u2019s these models, I think, that are going to be taken up. In a number of the channels, there are opportunities right now without decisions being made, so we should do pretty well in that. But again, we\u2019re not going to know until decisions are made in those areas. So again, it\u2019s another area of growth as you look to the future. I think you\u2019re right.","Robert Lee","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And we have no more questions in queue. I would now like to hand the call over back to our speakers.","Marty Flanagan","Thank you very much, on behalf of Loren and myself, appreciate the engagement and the questions and we\u2019ll be in touch.","Operator","Thank you, and that concludes today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director of Investments. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you very much and thank you everybody for joining us. And today we will cover the first quarter results as we typically do. We will spend some time on investment results during the quarter, and an update on OppenheimerFunds combination, and then we will open up to questions. The presentation is available on the website, if you're so inclined to follow and I'm going to start Page 5 and just make a couple of comments before turn it over to Loren.","So assets under management rose more than $66 billion from the fourth quarter, ending the quarter at $955 billion. We saw net flows increased nearly $22 billion from the fourth quarter resulting in long-term total net inflows of $3.5 billion. And we saw investment performance rebounded very strongly from the fourth quarter, and this is something we would expect in the type of market we've seen post 2018. There is really a combination of these factors resulted in adjusted earnings per share increasing 27%.","So in summary, the quarter is a marked improvement as compared to the fourth quarter of last year quarter. Also during the quarter, we made significant progress on the integration at the OppenheimerFunds. We anticipate closing now at May 24th. And we expect to recognize 85% of the $475 million synergy target by 1,231 of this year, resulting in $0.24 of accretion in 2019. But most importantly, this combination will be extremely beneficial for our clients and our shareholders. So with that is highlight, I am going to turn over to Loren to go in the financials.","Loren Starr","Thanks very much Marty. So on Slide 6, you'll see a summary of the results for the first quarter, 51% and 57% of actively managed assets. We're in the top half of peers over the three and five years, and one year numbers improved by nine percentage points versus the prior quarter to 50%. Greg is going to go into greater detail on the performance later in the presentation.","Out total long-term net outflows were $5.4 billion in Q1. That's an improvement of nearly $15 million when compared to the prior quarter. This improvement was largely driven by stronger ETF flows globally, and a significantly improved redemption picture across both the retail and institutional channels. Our adjusted net operating income was $284 million for the quarter, down from $300 million in the prior quarter. This decline in turn drove our adjusted operating margin down 0.6 points to 0.32% in Q1.","We've returned $170 million capital to shareholders during the quarter through $120 million of dividends and $50 million of share buybacks. And additionally, we announced a 3.3% increase in our dividend this quarter to $0.31 per share. An overview of our long-term flows can be found on Slide 7 with additional detail on the flow highlights from the quarter on Slide 8.","The net flow picture improved in the first quarter across both active and passive capabilities and across all channels. The redemption rates normalized while sales levels remained generally strong for the firm as a whole. Our institutional pipeline grew about 6% quarter-over-quarter with new one, but not funded claim mandates and real estate, stable values, fixed income and quantitative equity products. In the Americas, we saw institutional net flows improvement as we gathered more than $2 billion in Direct Real Estate. While outflows continued in our U.S. retail equity products, we did see marked improvement in redemption rates resulting from stronger investment performance as well as more stable markets.","Global ETFs displayed renewed business momentum in the quarter with more than $4.2 billion in net flows and market share gains in multiple regions. In the U.S., we saw more than $2 billion in ETF flows for the quarter followed by the S&P low volatility suites and the bullish share ETFs. In Europe, our ETFs also experienced improved net flows across both equity and fixed income products, resulting in net inflows of more than $2 billion. In Asia Pacific, we saw strength in sales across several fixed income capabilities, however, the net flow results in the quarter was impacted by single client redemption of the bank loan mandate. I\u2019d also note that we benefited from continued flows into our Great Wall JV money market products with more than $3 billion in inflows for the quarter.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 next, and you\u2019ll see our assets under management, which increased by $6.6 billion or 7.5%. And that primarily reflects the impact of positive market returns offset by long term outflows.","Our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, dropped 1.5 basis points to 37.1 basis points. The dip in the fee rate was primarily due to two fewer days in the quarter with remainder of the decline driven by a change in AUM mix.","Slide 10 provides the U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter. My comments today, as historically we\u2019ve done, will focus on the variances related to non-GAAP adjusted measures, which we found on Slide 11.","For the non-GAAP results, you'll see that net revenues decreased by $32.1 million or 3.5% quarter-over-quarter to $887.1 million. This decrease primarily reflects the reduced day count and the lower average long term AUM for the quarter. Our adjusted operating expenses were $602.8 million, decreased by $16.4 million or 2.6% relative to the fourth quarter, and we're largely in line with the guidance that I provided last quarter.","Despite the positive snap back in the market in Q1, we maintained the expense discipline outline last quarter and we will continue to focus on expense management in the occurring operating environment. The expense decrease quarter-over-quarter was driven by lower marketing and G&A expenses both of which were particularly at high levels in the fourth quarter. That was offset by the seasonality of taxes and benefits that increased compensation expense in Q1.","Our adjusted non-operating income increased by $73 million versus Q4, largely reflecting the positive mark-to-market on our seed investments during the quarter compared to negative market movements in the fourth quarter. Firm's effective tax rate at 23.8% was elevated by approximately 3.5 percentage points refract the impact to the annual share awards vesting in the first quarter. We\u2019d expect our tax rate to decline to between 22% to 23% after the Oppenheimer close. This brings us for adjusted EPS of $0.56 and our adjusted net operating margin of 32% for the quarter.","And with that, I'm going to turn it now over to Greg, who will talk about investment performance.","Greg McGreevey","Loren, thanks very much. There were three things I wanted to cover on my top level review of investment performance in the next four slides. So first I\u2019ll provide an update regarding Invesco\u2019s performance improvement that builds on our expression from last quarter\u2019s earnings call. Second, I wanted to highlight performance improvement at OppenheimerFunds. And third, I\u2019ll review performance on several key investment strategies for both Invesco and Oppenheimer.","If you turn to Slide 13, you\u2019ll see both Invesco and OppenheimerFunds, one, three and five year performance on the pure relative basis based on total assets under management for each firm. As you can see from the top of the chart, Invesco's long-term performance remained strong with 57% of our actively managed assets in the top half of their respective peer groups on a five year basis, 38% of which is in the top quartile. At the bottom of this chart, 60% of OppenheimerFunds total assets were in the top half of peer groups on a five year basis, about a quarter of which was in the top quartile. These result on both an individual and combined basis, highlight our long-term focus and the high-quality nature of our investment teams.","Now let's look at performance improvement for both firms on a quarter-over-quarter basis. As we're become evident on Slide 14, both firms reported significant quarter-over-quarter improvements in performance in total U.S. mutual fund assets. These chart show three month performance on a peer relative basis at the end of the first quarter of this year compared to three month performance at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. 76% of Invesco's mutual fund assets were in the top half of peers at the end of the first quarter compared to 40% of the end of the year, an increase of 36 percentage points.","In a similar vein, 72% of OppenheimerFunds mutual fund assets were in the top half of peers at the end of first quarter compared to 8% at the end of 2018, an increase of 64 percentage points over this period. Off note, Invesco maintained a solid proportion of its funds in the top quartile, while Oppenheimer improved its assets in the top curtail from 5% to 35% between these two time periods.","While this performance is short-term in nature, the chart shows the significant improvement on a peer relative basis over this period for both firms, and is indicative of an ongoing trend of improvement performance as well as the strong desire of both firms to drive the strong investment results. These teams are focused and not distracted in any way.","Now let's examine performance over a longer period as well as performance improvement from notable funds for both firms. If you could please turn to Slide 15, I wanted to provide a couple of touch points that highlight performance improvement from November 2018 to the end of March 2019 for Invesco. The upper left hand portion of this slide shows Invesco's performance improvement in the top half of peer groups increased from 11% to 44% on a one year rolling basis. We used November as a time period for consistency. So that was used in last quarter's earnings call and we thought that would be helpful for ease of comparison.","We have also seen significant improvement in the performance of several of our largest mutual funds. Over this time period, we've improved the number of our 16 largest funds in the top half of peers from one at the end of November to seven at the end of March 2019, as shown at the bottom left hand portion of the slide.","To fuller illustrate at this point, we've shown material improvements in the one year peer relative rankings for several notable strategies as highlighted on the right hand portion of this slide. Many of these strategies experienced significant flow challenges in the past year. And let me highlight a couple of these improvements. Diversified dividend moved from 84th percentile to 43rd percentile, high-yield units from 64th to 33rd, international growth from 66th to 32nd percentile, and balanced-risk allocation from 70th to 45th percentile. We continue to size the mutual fund assets in each strategy on the right hand side, which combined, represent 26% of Invesco's total U.S. mutual fund asset base.","I\u2019d now like to share the results for OppenheimerFunds, mutual fund assets using the same methodology and time period as we move to Slide 16. The peer relative performance for Oppenheimer\u2019s mutual fund assets remained strong and stable in total as well as for several of their key strategies on a one-year rolling basis.","The upper left hand portion of this slide shows performance in the top half of peer groups on one year trailing basis remain solid at 53% at the end of March 2019, up slightly from 51% at the end of November of last year. As expected from these numbers, the total number of their 16th largest mutual funds in the top half of peer groups remained about the same over this period.","The following observation can be made when drilling into some of OppenheimerFunds notable strategies on the right hand portion of Slide 16. On a one year rolling basis at the end of November 2018 and March 2019, developing markets continued to deliver superior results for clients by maintaining performance at the 13th percentile for each time period.","Main Street large cap core improved from 79th percentile to 32nd percentile, International small and mid cap maintained outstanding performance at the 4th percentile for each time period, and Rochester High Yield Muni also maintained outstanding results for clients by delivering 2nd percentile performance for each period as well. You can also see the size of mutual fund assets here for each strategy, which combined represent more than a third of Oppenheimer\u2019s U.S. mutual fund asset base.","Let me wrap up this section with a couple of high level summary points. So performance in aggregate is strong and improving at both firms. Performance in the largest mutual funds is improving and or remaining solid at both organizations. We\u2019re extremely exciting about this performance improvement and working hard to ensure this performance will continue. Leading more excited in our believes that the combination of investment capabilities of OppenheimerFunds with Invesco will create a truly unique all weather portfolio across passive, active and alternative capabilities to better serve the various needs of our clients. These firms will have this broad set of complimentary capabilities in the industry, which we believe will drive stable long-term investment results as well as provide greater sources of outflows to better align with clients across the globe and in different channels. This is exciting for us and for our clients where we continue to focus on delivering strong performance that will help them meet their long-term investment objectives.","I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Loren, who will walk through the financial returns and post combination revenues, expenses and details on synergies.","Loren Starr","Thanks very much Greg. As Marty mentioned, during the quarter, we made significant progress towards the integration of the OppenheimerFunds. We've highlighted a few of the key activities completed to date on Slide 18. I'm not going to spend too time here, but I just wanted to say that we\u2019ve completed a process of defining the leadership teams and the organization for the go-forward business, and we\u2019re making significant progress obtaining fund shareholder approval for each of the funds that we\u2019re bringing over.","Finally, I should mention that a key area of focus between now and May 24th is to ensure that the combined sales teams are ready at close to execute a single transition and provide enhanced experience for clients on both sides.","Next, let me provide a quick update on our deal economics based on the information effective by the end of March, which now reflects a May 24th close date, full clarity on the timing of synergies and current levels of AUM. And for those of you who are following along, I'm now on Slide 19.","So we now expect to recognize, as Marty mentioned, up to 85% of the cost synergies by the end of 2019, and that is earlier than originally anticipated. The ETFs accretion numbers for both 2019 and 2020. And now estimated to be $0.24 in 2019 and $0.58 in 2020, similar to the way we showed this in Q4. These accretion numbers are calculated looking at the combined firms relative to Invesco on a standalone basis, assuming no Oppenheimer combination were to take place.","The updated IRR for the deal is now expected to be 17%. And finally, by the end of 2020, when we realize the full impact of the $475 million of synergies, Oppenheimer will add more than $900 million in EBITDA. The combined firm will have an operating margin in excess of 41% and the annual EBITDA of the combined firm will be more than $2.6 billion.","Other than the update to reflect current AUM, the May 24th closing date and the timing of synergies, our expectations have not changed around the total amounts of the synergies, the integration costs or slower revenue assumptions for the Oppenheimer post close.","So let me next turn to review what the financials of the combined firm will look like. So on Slide 20 through 22, we provide a pro forma look at the financial position of the combined organization. On Slide 20, we show the combined organizations run rate, net revenues and net revenue yield after the combination. Again, this is based on March 31st information.","The combined firm will have a net revenue yield, excluding performance fees of 41.5 basis points after the close, and estimated annual adjusted run rate net revenues of nearly $4.9 billion, on a pro forma basis. This assumes assets are flat to the end of March levels.","Next turning to Slide 21, you'll see the pro forma view of the combined expense base before and after the full cost synergies are captured. After the impacts of the full $475 million in cost synergies, the combined organization would have approximately $2.9 billion in annual adjusted run rate operating expenses. Once again, I'd like to point out that this run rate assumes that AUM is flat to 3-31-19 levels.","The $475 million in cost synergies represents approximately 14% of the expense base of the combined firm. As we discussed last quarter, this expense reduction is directly related to the inherent benefits of scale of this deal as we will leverage a single operating platform for the combined businesses, manifested in the areas of the middle and back office, enterprise support, technology and distribution, in particular.","Slide 22 provides further detail on the synergies, including a breakdown by line item and quarter of realization into the run rate. As you will note from the chart, we expect to recognize roughly 50% to 55% of the cost synergies by the end of the third quarter. Additionally, by the end of 2019, we will anticipate capturing approximately 85% of the synergies or more than $400 million in the run rate savings. You will remember that we had previously guided to capturing approximately 75% to 85% of the synergies by the end of the first quarter of 2020. The progress we've made to get the go forward team in place and the integration work that we have completed to date has positioned us to deliver on the higher end of our original target range in one quarter earlier.","Remaining synergy capture, which largely represents property and office-related costs, and the remaining compensation synergies, will come in over the following year so that our 100% of the synergies should be captured by the first quarter of 2020. In subsequent quarters, we will continue to provide you with updates on our progress against these targets.","And now with that, I will turn it back to Marty.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you, Loren. Are as we've discussed on previous calls, what truly makes Invesco unique is the combination of the leadership we have in core markets and our ability to continuing invest in high growth areas. Our strategy remains unchanged. The combination with Oppenheimer meaningfully accelerates our strategy expanding leadership in core markets in U.S. wealth management, in particular, while strengthening our ability to execute in high growth areas, we focused on in the past, including China, ETFs, multi-sector solutions. This approach is helping us deliver on lean set up of capabilities, which will help drive sustainable and broad base growth aligned with where our clients were the industry is heading, while further benefiting shareholders.","The addition of OppenheimerFunds will create a $1.2 trillion global investment manager that provides significant benefits to both clients and shareholders. The combined firm will be the 13th largest globally and the 6th largest investment manager in the U.S. wealth management channel, and importantly providing greater scale and client relevance.","To further expand our comprehensive range of capabilities in a number of highly differentiated investment capabilities. And we\u2019ll provide compelling financial returns to shareholders, as Loren pointed out, in opportunities for growth from day one post closing. We\u2019re very confident on our plans to bring the two organizations together. We could be more excited about the tremendous potential of the two firms and for the benefit of both clients and shareholders.","And with that, let us stop and open it for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Loren Starr","Operator, will you open up the line for questions?","Operator","Our first question comes from Dan Fannon with the company Jeffries. Your line is open.","Dan Fannon","I guess, I think you guys have gotten some comments about this as we have around just kind of the leverage post the transaction. And so wanted to talk about how you\u2019re thinking about capital post close? How we should think about maybe net debt considering, obviously, the long-term bonds you could pay, but they aren\u2019t necessarily as really callable or as financially attracted to do that. So just wanted to think about how you\u2019re -- get some comments on how you\u2019re thinking about kind of leverage and excess liquidity over the next kind of 12 to 24 months?","Loren Starr","I\u2019ll pick that one up. So, good question. So given the continued improvements in markets and our AUM levels, so we actually feel comfortable maintaining our plan right now, our current capital plan, which as you know, sort of suggest that we\u2019re going to buyback $1.2 billion of our stock by the end of Q1 2021. However, I will say, Dan, we will continue to evaluate both the timing and the pace of the buyback in light of, obviously, any subsequent market actions as well as any significant shareholder inputs. Again, we feel that the firm is continued to strengthen -- both firms are continuing to strengthen in this current market. And firmly the combined firms are going to be stronger and more effective together than we are currently right now.","Dan Fannon","Got it. And then just in terms of kind of the flow picture, I recognize some of the performance improvements you guys are talking about. But, obviously, flows for first quarter is typically better for the industry, and we saw that improvement with you guys. But if we think about kind of the combined benefit and the distribution efforts, how quickly do you think you\u2019re able to start to manifest an improvement and actually the net organic growth rate as you kind of go through this integration?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, Dan, this is Martin. So let me start with, and Loren has mentioned this. So what now is in place on the distribution side is all the leadership is in place and everybody in the go forward organization is in placed and notified and already been trained, and very focused on the day after close really making an impact in the field with clients. We've done this in the past, I think, it will be better than we have done historically, and the talent is representative of -- the best talent from both of the firms. But we will literally have better talents and more resources against the distribution than we ever had before. So that's where I would start. I think, you are right, historically. The first quarter is one of the strongest flow quarters. And we saw some quite a bit of change ourselves. But let's remember, coming out of 2018, in the fourth quarter, in particular, people were not very confident about where the markets are going. And so was really slow in a relative sense to the uptake. So we're continuing to see increased demand, frankly globally. And Loren pointed out, in particular, we're seeing that's the improved set of flows from our ETF business, and we would anticipate that. Again, I think, Greg also pointed out we're seeing a marked improvement in our equity investment performance, which we would anticipate because we intended to have a value bias, and that really hurt us last year. But again, we're seeing some really strong performance. So, all the leading indicators would suggest that we're heading in a very good direction and quickly.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ken Worthington","I just got to know, MassMutual better. How are the conversations going in terms of cross-marketing? So it seems like you're going to be hitting the ground running in terms of the cost synergies from the deal. I was wondering to what extent this team can be set in terms of revenue synergies and cross marketing?","Martin Flanagan","Ken, great question. So, we were very specific to focus on what are the financial outcomes that we're delivering right now. The vast majority of people following the company, that's really all that wanted to hear, and it was show with what's happening. Now the reality is great conversation with MassMutual. We are making very good progress. We will update people at the next call on sort of the go forward revenue opportunities across the organization, just not limited to MassMutual. And again, so that our definite scale benefits here have to retaliate from our perspective is, we\u2019re very stronger firm with greater capabilities and greater upside in revenue opportunities and meeting client demand. So we're not ignoring it, we're just responding to what has been the very specific focus of you and other analysts following the company right now.","Ken Worthington","And then can you talk about the sales environment in the UK? So given Brexit has been push back, but it's still an issue and given current performance, may be what is your outlook for the rest of the year or the go forward here in the UK? And I think you guys called out the big GTR redemption in the quarter given the performance track record there, may be more specifically, what is the outlook for this strategy and the assets? Thanks.","Martin Flanagan","Yes. So, Ken, very good point. And what we look at the fundamentals strength of the organization is the UK and EMEA, in particular, frankly last year turned to a headwind as Brexit became very, very real. And if you just look at -- if you want to look at retail flows across the continent and the UK, the industry level after they just dropped like a rock. And those people went absolutely risk off, and that hurt us quite a bit. It continues to be a risk off-environment. Brexit is actually a headwind. And I'm sure everybody in the EU that would like to get some clarity here, I think, as soon as there\u2019s clarity, you\u2019re going to see quite a bit of change. I don\u2019t think anybody else will answer the question when that\u2019s going to happen. So don\u2019t have a specific timeframe, obviously, but we will anticipate marked improvement inflows post any decision, quite frankly. And with regard to GTR, the performance has been improving, which is a very good thing. As you know, it\u2019s been a very successful capability for us. But as the relative performance veined last year, it absolutely did slowdown. So again, we would look forward to really improved performance, I think, is really going to be the key for us as we go forward there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Patrick Davitt","Just a quick follow up to Dan\u2019s first question. All of that commentary, would you say that suggest an increased willingness to delever post deals kind of the same willingness or lower willingness to delever versus repurchase?","Loren Starr","I mean, I think, we\u2019re open to it. We actually feel very comfortable with the financial leverage that is effectively part of the preferred in light of the strong operating EBITDA that we\u2019re going to be generating through the synergies and with the combined business, with close to a $1 billion of EBITDA coming on board post synergies relative to the coupon. It does not really presents in our mind a significant financial risk, but it is one that we continue to listen to shareholders. And we certainly believe there is a little bit of work to be done just. So we make it clear kind of our perspective on the financial risk associated with the preferred -- actual preferred, which is again non-cumulative. It doesn\u2019t have a call until the 21 years. There\u2019s no it\u2019s just professional so there\u2019s no principal repayment. And so there are aspects to this preferred that is a little bit unique and different than I\u2019d say more traditional preferred.","Patrick Davitt","And then on the flow picture, what about the GTR redemption mix you feel like it\u2019s one-time? And then on the Japan side, how much more exposure do you have to bank loan clients in Japan? And then maybe more broadly, could you speak to more detail how the April flow picture is tracking?","Loren Starr","In terms of GTR, we\u2019re getting wins on GTR. There are a couple of potential ad risk accounts as well. So in terms of size there isn't seen to be anything quite of same magnitude that we saw in the first quarter, but ultimately it\u2019s a big pool of assets and there could be further determination. But we\u2019re defending it well given what Martin mentioned in terms of the performance having improved. So again, it\u2019s -- we\u2019re going to continue to watch that closely, but nothing that we know about that is depending. In terms of Japan and bank loans, I mean there\u2019s still probably some potential bank loan outflow that we see nothing significance. I mean it could be an aggregate, maybe I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s - about a $0.5 billion issue in that time -- in that amount. But ultimately, we\u2019re continuing to do solid client engagement with those clients. And ultimately, I think, we\u2019re seeing a strong sales pipeline that could offset some of the outflow associated with that particular category. And again, the bank loan category just in general has been an outflow. So it is nothing unique to our capability. It's really just been sort of the lack of interest in that.","Martin Flanagan","Yes. I think it\u2019s interesting enough in Japan outside of one client. There's been some increased demand. And we're seeing out some quite strong interest in the pipeline even in Japan for bank loan. If you know the performance of that strategy, is incredibly strong. And so there is most of that stuff is separately managed accounts, but there's also big buyers of what we do on the CLO front that also coincide the interest in bank loans overall. So we'll have to see. We kind of think the worst on the bank loan side from a flow standpoint is probably behind this.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Carrier","Thanks. Good morning. Just on the net flows, you saw the improvement in the quarter, some seasonality in environment, but even if you look over the past, three or four quarters, it's a good kind of level of improvement. It still seems like the redemption levels are a bit elevated, close to breakeven. So when you look at what's driving that whether it's on the RECO side or the institutional, you called out the GTR and then the bank loan, but is there anything else that's kind of weighing on the redemption that you think can start to improve as we get later into 2019?","Martin Flanagan","Let me just make a comment for some perspective from our point of view and then Loren can get specific. So you can earlier -- we were making a point. So last year, if you looked at fundamental strengths of the organization, we would say it's the UK, it's the continent, it's Asia-Pacific, and quite frankly a number of the capabilities that Greg highlighted here in the U.S. All of that led to the nine years of net flow before last year. Brexit became a tremendous headwind for us as an organization last year. At the same time, the trade war actually became quite a headwind for us also in our Asia-Pac business in this risk-off environment. And then finally, we are just sort of value bias here in some of our equity capabilities in the space where the bank concentration really hurt us. So all three of those lining up at one time was something that we wouldn't ever have imagined that could have happened. What we're seeing coming out of it is really the improved performance because of the market. The pipeline continues to grow. But there is an absolute focus on the redemption side for us as people are assessing where they are and their sort of risk-off or into the market. But everything that we're seeing and the interactions are as strong as they've been over a year. So we're very happy to leave 2018 behind, and it looks like heading in the right way. Loren?","Loren Starr","Yes. I mean, I wouldn't add much more to that. I think in the institutional side, obviously, there have been one-off redemptions. There have been very large. Certainly, we saw that in the fourth quarter. The idea that we're going to be avoiding any large one-offs in future is probably unrealistic. But we do see the pipeline strengthening significantly as I mentioned. They were up, I think, about 6% quarter-over-quarter with probably about 15% year-over-year improvement on AUM as well. Again, revenue mix in terms of what is coming in relative to what's going out is superior, so all those dynamics are very positive from a flow perspective. You can certainly get sort of fixated on the absolute numbers of the flow amounts. But when you actually look at the revenues, that is what I am most focused on, and I actually really think that we're seeing continued interest in products that we really have great capabilities in that are higher fee. And certainly with Oppenheimer coming on board that is another feature. And I would mention that there\u2019s always been a continued thought about the fee rate on Oppenheimer is going to be at risk. And when you look at Oppenheimer\u2019s fee rate, all the way back to 2011, I mean, it\u2019s only increased, and it\u2019s been absolutely steady for the last six years. And it really is not been a topic of the fee rates been challenged. So I do think our opportunity to slow at a reasonable rate with good economics is something that we\u2019re very focused on post-transaction.","Martin Flanagan","One thing I\u2019d add maybe just -- fully because outflow for a second. This is a real positive story. I think is our gross flow picture is remaining very, very strong. So especially strong, and I think an increase in a couple of key markets. But the redemption picture to the question is really kind of spot on. We\u2019re also seeing how that redemption began to decline. So if we can focus what Marty mentioned is really impart, and we're kind of all over the ability to get the focus that we need, especially in post the combination of firms in the U.S. wealth management business. We can do that and continue to drive an investment performance. We don\u2019t have some of these one-off events. That\u2019s kind of a flow trajectory, but I think we could see from a net basis going forward.","Michael Carrier","All that color is helpful. And then just a quick one, just on the Great Wall JV, given the strength that you\u2019re seeing in the money market, just update is there on like you came you broaden that relationship? Or what would get more of the long term product flows in over time?","Martin Flanagan","Look we are incredibly uniquely placed in China. And as you know, we were the only foreign manager that is kind of the financial network and it is broadening into other capabilities. And it\u2019s started with -- they had a very specific need around money front. Quite frankly, that is going to slow down here for a quarter or two as we\u2019re going to be introducing another -- money funded to that and the broadening of channel. And again, we\u2019ll get into further detail in the quarters ahead. But the ray has just came out in China. And we are right the number two well successful firm in China as of foreign money managers. So we are incredibly well placed, and that platform is just one of many. And we\u2019re seeing almost half of our flows -- retail flows through the joint venture coming through where they refer to e-commerce channel. So that is the future for us there. Again we continue to be very well placed. And this is going to continue to give us proportionate area for us an organization.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just to start off with the cost save side of things, thanks for all the granular detail, but as I asked this before a couple of quarters ago, just wanted to sort of get refreshed view. But Marty and or Loren, obviously, this all of the cost saves here are back office in nature. So what are your thoughts about potential product rationalization where I think last time you said as you get into the deal, you may revisit that, maybe some updated thoughts there? And then what portion of the combined sales force was cut?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. Let\u2019s see with regard to products rationalization, that's something we do on an ongoing basis. And we have to be very clear. We have not been able to focus on a lot of client rationalization while the proxies on the market. So we have no insight to pass on to you. What I will say back to the comments we made from the beginning, vast majority of the capabilities are supplementary. We don't see an awful lot of rationalization there. And where it will be -- it will be on the margins. So we'll not be disruptive to clients, which is really very important. We wouldn't have done the transaction if you thought it was. But again, that will turn our attention to that after closing. And needless to say, we will grow as rapidly as we can with that.","Loren Starr","We provided, obviously, what percentage of the synergies is coming from sales and distribution in the last call. That level of detail in terms of kind of what we're doing is really the most we want to provide at this point, Brian. So hopefully you can pick that on. But we feel that a combined sales organization is going to be stronger, clearly than what each of us individually had. And we are going to be able to invest in areas that each of us individually have not been fully able to invest in with, I think, great results, brand innovation, thought leadership, practices around education, the client engagement that are going to be superior to one of our individual capabilities.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Okay. And that's a good take to the revenue synergy side. So I don't know if this has asked before. May be just more specifics on the plan for branding, are you getting with the Oppenheimer name or you keeping it for a while? And then on product creation given that there is opportunity, if you create new products for existing mutual funds on the Oppenheimer side, especially, what are your initial thoughts there? And also whether you would license the upper city in active ETF may be just your thoughts on the approval of that active nontransparent ETF?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, lot of [indiscernible] Brian. So let me -- with regard to product capabilities, if we're just focused on Oppenheimer, again, what we said very complementary the vast majority of capabilities are in the U.S. wealth management channel. There are opportunities institutionally for number of the capabilities. There is opportunity for retail outside of the United States for number of the capabilities. There will be likely product extensions into Asia, really off the Emerging Markets team like this, as Greg pointed out the performance. It's really quite spectacular. Global equity is something is very interesting institutional clients outside the United States. So again, it's -- we're on that same path that we talked about in October. We just have a greater degree of confidence in that. With regard to the proceeding in ETFs, I think that the SEC approval that I think that's a very good development. I think the other reality is -- there is going to be, I think, a long tail before that becomes successful in the marketplace. And when you look at the totality of the ecosystem, and I think the firms that are most likely well placed and the firms like us that have a strong active capability along with the ETF franchise because it\u2019s that performing other need is really -- it's a true skill set that needs to be within the organization. So again, I think, that's good news. I don't you're going to see a rapid change though in that area from that perspective.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And then just on branding?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. So at close, the combined firm is Invesco. The funds will -- the OppenheimerFunds will the Invesco Oppenheimer something for a period of time. And the clients will tell us what they want that ultimately to be, but that would be some time in the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeremy Campbell","And thanks for the helpful realization timeline you guys put out on Slide 22. Just a point of clarification on that one, are these -- the synergies you\u2019re expecting to be embedded in the quarter or the exit run rate? So I mean like 3Q, are you doing costs between now and like July 1, still 3Q will reflect like 250 of annualized synergies, so basically $50 million in the quarter itself or exiting 930 at that run rate?","Loren Starr","Yes. It would be the exit run rate that\u2019s the way to think about that.","Jeremy Campbell","And Loren, maybe I misunderstood you, but I think when you\u2019re talking about the synergy timeline earlier here you kind of noted that it assumed AUM as flat to 3.31. If AUMs move kind of up or down from here, should we expect the cost saves changed at all or are you just referring to the accretion math overall and the impact on the top line?","Loren Starr","It\u2019s really related to the accretion amounts and the top line. I mean, we\u2019ve been consistent with the 4.75 through kind of different AUM levels as well. So we\u2019re not going to change the 4.75 markets go down or go up. It\u2019s really the number that we\u2019re going to be focusing continue to report on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.","Glenn Schorr","Quickly on the net revenue yield and passive sale like 7% year-on-year and more than that quarter-on-quarter. Is most of that just mix in end markets? Were there any material price changes in the quarter?","Martin Flanagan","So it\u2019s going to be mix. There\u2019s substantial amount of non-fee earning AUM in the passive category like the leverage associated with our mortgage REITs when we do an equity offering that shows up. So that will definitely push those fee rates down relative to what you might see on a quarter-on-quarter basis.","Glenn Schorr","And then one other one on, there\u2019s a lot of changes on those, obviously, on the retail distribution side and just in terms of how they\u2019re approaching their business and move towards more portfolio construction. But I think that has a long tail. So the question I have for you is what are you doing to capitalize and change with them meaning to your answer to last question? You\u2019ve a lot of the tools between your ETF franchise and your broad diverse product set. But they\u2019re changing portfolio construction. And they have different means. So I'm just curious if you\u2019re seeing big changes and are you changing in a big way on how do you approach that channel?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. So I'm going to make a couple of comments and let Greg. And so, absolutely, we've not been clear. So under the banner of solutions that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. It is really creating models for platforms with platforms, working with just want to say wealth management platform where your question was. Also with the big teams, working directly with the big teams, helping with analytics, helping with them within the various systems, within their approved list and what they\u2019re trying to accomplish has been a massive undertaken for us. And that is the way the future. I think, if you don\u2019t have the resources to compete there, I think you\u2019re superiorly disadvantaged. And we have a very talented team. And maybe Greg, you want to talk about.","Greg McGreevey","Yes. I don\u2019t think we need to add a ton to that. I mean effective solutions team. We've really put a significant investment in over the last four years. We've got a couple of components to it. The client engagement piece really to go out and do a superior job of kind of understanding the need that both platforms as well as prevent to the institutional side of what their needs might be. And then we have an analytical team to really come back and try to create outcomes for them whether that would be in the case of retail where we have model portfolios and other things that we can create. And we're doing that -- we've done that pretty extensively even over the course of the last couple of years where we partnered with a number of platforms that we think could be helpful whether they're using or directly our model portfolios are in some cases are going to use that to modify what they're doing. But I think, the question is spot on and what we think the retail market ultimately is going to go. And we think with the solutions capability and what we are doing from an engagement standpoint, we are going to be extremely well positioned there.","Glenn Schorr","Just kind of a follow up. Is that Invesco branded or do you private label that within just when you deliver that model and then eventually deliver the solution to the end client?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. It's all different, right? I mean, it really depends on what client -- so it's a full spectrum which is just fine for us. Let's say on that for a second. So I -- this is one element that we've been talking about, so where the industry is going? That's where scale and relevance really matters. I mean to have the wherewithal and the financial resources and develop those capabilities, it's real and it's meaningful. And by the way, we don't have them right now. It's too late, right? I mean it's going to be very hard because there are -- small number of firms that already have those capabilities, and there with these platforms as you would know. The other feedback they will get from big platforms is, if you don't have data analytics capabilities with regard to -- on the distribution site, you are going to be severely disadvantaged. And again, that's money and that's resources and that's where firms like ourselves are going to be a material advantage to those firms with less resources going forward. So I think we are on a very important topic. And we feel very well placed against where that setting.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question and also appreciate the very specific line on details. It's especially helpful. Loren, may be a question for you just on the -- I think, I understand the dynamics driving the higher year one accretion for 2019. What I am trying to understand where the excess success or so is coming in the second year, just given some of the statements around some of your underlying assumptions?","Loren Starr","Yes. So when we disclosed in end of Q4 results, we had, I think, it was $0.53, I don't know exactly. But that was based on Oppenheimer assets at $214 billion. So Oppenheimer assets at $230 billion at the end of March is what provides that operating leverage and earnings opportunity for us across both years.","Bill Katz","And then I don't know for yourself or Greg, or Marty. Just going back to the gross sales dynamic a little bit, it sort of sound like there are some ins and outs as you think about geography, by asset class, by distribution channel some bigs and small. How should we think about -- what's the characteristic of the gross sales moving up from here? Is it sort of pro forma or the full of impact of Oppenheimer and so leveraging that to the U.S. retail distribution channel? Or is it something else that you can do beyond that just like the legacy book of business to get the instant franchise accelerating?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. A couple of comments. First come back to -- for the industry and probably investor again that the environment that we came out of 2018. It was really creating this very form, call it unique set of ins and outs with all the sentiment so that the various reasons I talked about in the different parts of the world. Going forward, I mean, it\u2019s really no different for us. It\u2019s within the institutional business, but we\u2019re seeing not much different than what you\u2019re seeing in wealth management platform's clients are working fewer organizations. And what we\u2019re seeing is a dynamic of more mandates for institution than we had in the past. That\u2019s going to be one of the elements that are driving up to growth flows. China is another area that we\u2019re looking. You can see it. So it\u2019s really just more blocking and tapping as we\u2019d expect for us, but Greg really pointed out if you look over the number of years. Our gross flows continue to increase at a pretty strong rate. And I think -- that\u2019s a very important part of health as an organization by far. We have turned our attention to very much on how do you -- how can we minimize the redemptions. And as we said in the past, that\u2019s one area for all the work that we try to do to understand it. We\u2019re not great at understanding one institution hopefully make some of those decisions, some are clear, some just literally happen overnight. But \u2026","Loren Starr","The only thing I\u2019d add to that is I think some of the blocking attack when it is marrying demand with capabilities and having a clear go-to market strategy. I'd like to focus that we have the stronger teams that we\u2019ve got in from a distribution standpoint in most markets is going to be quite helpful to that. I think when Oppenheimer comes onboard, we\u2019ve done a lot of work to kind of look at the capabilities that they have into existing markets that they compete, and also where can we take those capabilities into new markets. And we think that\u2019s going to be quite additive. And when we talked about solutions a minute ago, there\u2019s a lot of parts of the industry that are going to outcomes away from products. So we\u2019ll probably hit the product side and the ways that we just kind of talked about. But we\u2019re ramping up dramatically what we\u2019re doing on the retail and on institutional side of having outcome-oriented conversations with clients using our solutions capability and partnership with distribution to really have different conversations. So we think that\u2019s going to take some time to generate flows. But clearly that is the direction of travel. And I think, as we talked about before, we really well positioned, I think in that space. So the combination of those, it\u2019s kind of building a mosaic, a combination of those things is really what\u2019s going to continue to drive our gross flow picture.","Greg McGreevey","And I'm just hoping like we mentioned most of the other things that are what we call our growth engines, but obviously the digital distribution opportunity is one that we\u2019ve talked about for a while. And it\u2019s not one that\u2019s going to sort of go from zero to 100 overnight. But it is one where it is something where we\u2019re seeing demand for these types of capabilities. And it is one where I think it does uniquely position us within opportunities for us to grow sales in a way that we go into new channels that we're currently not in.","Bill Katz","Okay. Just at this point of clarification, I think one of the questions was about April flows, and I apologize if you shared that number. But if you can just repeat what that was or?","Loren Starr","We didn\u2019t actually share the numbers. So I think we've said that going forward. We\u2019re really not going to be sort of ramping discussions about flows into the next quarter or so. We\u2019re going to keep our commentary to March ending quarter. And so my role would be having our April AUM released. And we\u2019ll see those numbers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.","Brennan Hawken","A lot of mine have been actually answered, but just one on your -- on Slide 20. You guys laid out the Oppenheimer state with an update, which is great. But I looked at it and compared to the original numbers that you gave when you announced the deal. And then you had flagged a gross management fee of 61 bips. And now we've got -- it looks like you've got labeled as a neck of 61 basis points. I know Loren has spoke to the stability in Oppenheimer's fee rate for the past five or so years. But did Oppenheimer actually see their fee rates increased from 930 to 331 or is that just a definitional adjustment. Could you may be clarify that?","Loren Starr","It is more of just an accounting kind of impact. So what we originally disclosed was net revenue yield, which was 56 basis points after breakage for Oppenheimer. That was on the October call. And right now, we're showing kind of 58.5 or 59, just looking at that number. And the difference between those two numbers have to do with the fact that Oppenheimer netted certain expenses against their revenues based on the way they accounted for their P&L.","And so, we took their numbers and we've reposition them where we have actually gross up our revenues and those expenses I would otherwise been noted or shown as gross expense for us. So that's the difference kind of a technical aspect. But, what happen, it has not impact on the bottom line, operating income what so ever.","Brennan Hawken","Got it. So Slide 20 of your current deck is apples-to-apples with the way Invesco report.","Loren Starr","That is correct. Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Kenneth Lee","Just one on the model fund flows post-close for the OppenheimerFunds. Any update on the previously assumed 1% to 2% organic growth target longer-term? And when you look across the combined complex between both companies, what would be the key drivers for the longer-term organic growth target? Thanks.","Loren Starr","So in terms of the assumptions, no, we did not change any of the flow assumptions. We still have the same that we historically have discussed, which again suggests $10 billion outflow is going to take place. And I think that's still a very conservative number, but it is in the model. In terms of the Oppenheimer sort of disruption in terms of the client flow outlook and that would happen at close or really last half of the year close. And then for 2020, we said, sort of they would go to 1% to 2% organic growth rate. Again, our view is that once we are able to bring them in combined the two firms together, and with performance sort of moving into a more stabilized position that we're going to be able to grow both of our businesses more effectively. And then we were individually to do so. So that is our current thought. There is no reason for us to think otherwise at this point. We are obviously something -- is a key -- key aspect of the still but we are very focused on, as I mentioned, sort of at close really gearing up our sales force and having much more successful outcome.","Kenneth Lee","Got you. Thanks. And one -- just one follow-up, and this is potentially a follow-up to some earlier questions regarding solutions business, granted a lot of the focus on the expense management side of things as well as the integration in the cost reduction efforts. But when you look at the need to reinvest in the business, and once again this is, I think similar to previously, not separate, to build up the institutional side of business with solutions business, what the potential impact to the needed expenses to reinvest on that side? Thanks.","Martin Flanagan","That\u2019s a good question, I want to clarify that. The $475 million that we\u2019re talking about where there is going to be deliver period. But what -- the real point is it's not a cost saving story. It\u2019s a story of being able to more competitive for our clients, doing a great job for our clients. So when we talk about the U.S. wealth management business and commentary. We had earlier it is repositioning of distribution capabilities, its more challenged, greater resources than either of the firms have before. Against it\u2019s a literally -- this net number is after we\u2019re making investments that we need to continue to accelerate our growth whether it\u2019d be true needs for the investment teams, whether it would be digital analytics, whether it be for product developments, building up the institutional business. So that $475 million is going to be delivered. And all at the same time, we are a stronger organization. We\u2019ve made the investments that we need to make going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Lee with IBW. Your line is open.","Robert Lee","I guess a couple of questions. Marty, you've point out one of the drivers behind the transaction as to be more relevant for many of your distributors. And that\u2019s -- can you measure not just by the kind of the size of the AUM base and breadth of -- under-strategies, but a lot of firms also focused on, say different product structures and obviously of the ETFs you have the funds. But one of the things that maybe I think I would find helpful is you think you have a full product array in the sense of the SME business or CIT? Just trying to get a sense if there\u2019s other area that you would see a need for investment or maybe or not aware of fully appreciating possible momentum you may have to other product structures?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. Look there\u2019s -- reality the variation, especially post closure, very few product capabilities that we don't have, right? And so that\u2019s one place to start. By the way, there\u2019s a very few vehicle structures that we don\u2019t have. An opportunity for growth for us going forward in the U.S. wealth management channel will be SMAs. That is something that has been an area of focus for the wealth management platforms. We would look to that as upside project. I think Greg and Loren have talked about it earlier. It\u2019s really the solutions capability as the other area that it\u2019s going to be meaningful and real as we go forward. But what I will say and you\u2019re hitting on it and it came off some of the other questions to some degree, just having capabilities is not enough to be successful with these firms anymore. I mean, it really is a level of resources whether it would be through thought leadership for building models or education or we\u2019re currently developing products. It is broad and it is deep. And that\u2019s what\u2019s demanded. It\u2019s the largest segment of assets under management globally, but it\u2019s also the most competitive. And you really need to be resourced holistically across that and we think we are.","Robert Lee","And may be the follow-up. And Loren you've touched on this a little bit earlier. I'm focused on revenue versus flows. So with that in mind, if we are to think of kind of may be the pipeline you have, if we're think of kind of the revenue or maybe, in the perfect world, the EBITDA contribution of flows. I mean, how -- from where you could today, I mean how was the leasing quarter compared to kind of the net flow picture? How are you anticipating that playing out over the coming quarters? And may be as part of that, any thoughts that that would be a metric that you would consider sharing the future.","Loren Starr","It's a great question. We do look at that. I mean it's very important to us to understand the revenues coming in versus potential revenue coming out, as I mentioned. So our fee rate for the institutional pipeline is some 20 basis points in excess of the firm's overall fee rate. So that is a very, very positive kind of contributor of EBITDA, and certainly the fee rate of what's going out is a much lower rate to the overall firm's fee rate. So we haven't quantify that. It is an interesting question. It gets into how much discloses too much. We've debated this internally quite a bit, and probably will continue. But it is something that I do feel is a very legitimate question because people get very focused on just the absolute value of assets won or loss. And that's really kind of missing the big picture in some cases where you really understand what is it contributing to the bottom line. And I think our story is not well understood and is a good one.","Robert Lee","Great. And if I have time for one more quick one, Jemstep.","Loren Starr","Yes.","Robert Lee","I mean just kind of curious. I mean this was, I think, suppose to be a year where you start to see kind of all the investments start to pay off as the year progresses, may be an update on that. And I know there were some big clients that were potentially are expected to come onboard just kind of where that stands?","Loren Starr","Yes. So we are still anticipating both Jemstep and Intelliflo starting to kick in more materially this year. We will anticipate after the second quarter to be able to give you more robust insights into that with Jemstep, specifically and in Intelliflo. In Intelliflo continued to grow both the combination, but the next step of Invesco being a part of the product offering that will be the second half of the year.","Martin Flanagan","Just to be clear. So for Intelliflo, which again most people may or may not know, but they have -- they're talking about $440 billion of client assets. We are implementing this model of portfolio system that will allow them to offer models to their clients and similar to Jemstep. It has the opportunity for Invesco products to be featured in those models. That's a very significant opportunity for us. That, as Marty mentioned, is coming on line in the second quarter. Similarly with Jemstep, we have been working through a very significant commercial bank, it's a global bank in terms of penetration. And so that is something that we will be able, hopefully, to provide more detail at the second quarter call in terms of where that sits. But it is all very positive trends for us. And there are very substantial clients that are also in the pipeline. Well, again, with our focus being mostly on commercial banking relatives to may be some of the other competitors who are focused warehouses or other venues.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Blostein","A question for you guys on Oppenheimer. What were their flows in the first quarter this year and Q4 of last year from kind of the fund data it looks like generally flows got to worse a little like kind of six month, but wondering what the whole franchise looks like? And I guess, more importantly, do you think these outflows were largely a function of the deal? So kind of slower sales kind of the difficult stuff that happens or relative performance issues that they seen a little course of the last kind of six months. And the deal related to dynamic is still kind of on the come?","Loren Starr","Yes, so, good question. In the quarter they were outflow on long term about $3.3 billion. And so that was certainly worse results relative to their prior year-to-date of about $0.6 billion. So if you look at what that is, again, obviously, is included really rough fourth quarter like everyone had. Oh, sorry, it will coming off of the rough first quarter. But it is something where we\u2019re seeing sales have declined a little bit. So here our quarter-over-quarter sales declined about 20%. I think that is a little bit of function that was going on with the transaction. It\u2019s hard to actually say that that is the case. But I think we saw with the Van Kampen deal similarly when funds are going to be transferred over people. They probably don't sell them quite much. So we\u2019re hoping that that\u2019s a temporary situation and when that will get fixed as in the close happens.","Alex Blostein","Great that\u2019s helpful detail. And then the second question just quickly up. And again, thanks for the expense guidance and kind of the outlook you guys provided on the slides. So I heard you loud and clear on the $475 million, and then that\u2019s going to be delivered. But curious to think about the investment spend from there as you look the organization as a whole. Where do you guys think is sort of the reasonable growth in the expense base from there right as you kind of go back to normal?","Loren Starr","I mean, Alex, with -- I don\u2019t think it will be much different in a way you\u2019ve seen us operate in the past. I mean we\u2019ve made significant investments in areas around institutional, ETFs, solutions. That\u2019s all happens, obviously, excluding the Oppenheimer deal. As it all been a very fundamental part of what we\u2019ve done, and then something where we made a lot of investments already and they are sort of in the run rate at this point. In terms of kind of expected future big lifts on investments, I think it\u2019s going to be more incremental building on top of that current base. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see big step-ups in a way that we probably saw through 2018, which was where you probably saw the greatest need for investments on the short term basis. Definitely, we\u2019ll be able to give more color around guidance as we put them together. But one of the great things about this transaction, as Marty said, is that we are actually able to invest significantly behind our business through this transaction because we\u2019re ultimately creating stronger capabilities of talent, that is unparallel level for us, and technology and systems that is taking the best of both of their worlds and our worlds and bringing them together. So it is like an upgrade that is happening already through this transaction, and should substantially into at least a few years we would expect that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Chris Harris","Guys, just one question on the Oppenheimer EPS accretion. After the market rally in the first quarter, it looks like Oppenheimer AUM is only down now about 8% since the deal announcement, but 2020 EPS accretion number at $0.58, up nicely from December, but still down about 28%, since the time of the deal announcement. So can you guys walk us through that the disparity between those two numbers?","Loren Starr","So I mean, there is a significant amount of operating leverage that is inherent in the Oppenheimer deal. And so there is no question if we got to the level that we disclosed previously at the 250. That number would be back up at $0.80.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open.","Chris Shutler","I need your thoughts around rationalizing the company's combined product portfolio post close. And I guess on a similar point, you give the AUM-weighted investment performance on Page 13 of the slide deck. But I'm guessing the numbers look less favorable on an equal-weighted basis. So is that fair and how does that play into your thoughts on our rationalization? Thanks.","Greg McGreevey","I'm going to be a little repetitive from before. Post close, will turn our attention to product rationalization. We're not allowed to spend time on that when proxies are out in the marketplace, we, as always, we were always looking at product rationalization. We'll do that here. Our view is it will be on the margin, the vast majority of capabilities coming over our complementary. And so you will see a very little client instruction from our perspective.","Loren Starr","I think, on the -- where you're seeing about the first base, I don't think our performance is dramatically different versus the asset-weighted basis. So there aren't a lot of underperforming small funds or things that need to get. But from those do happen every year. We do go through product rationalization efforts and trim. And so there's never one where we kind of let the attic too full. So again, really subsequent to the close we can address that question in a more detailed way.","Chris Shutler","Okay. And just to be clear, rationalization is not in the EPS accretion.","Loren Starr","That is correct.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Michael Cyprys","Most of my questions have been answered. Just may be curious if you can talk a little bit about the integration of the technology and systems perspective. And how many systems are you guys operating today? How many systems you are going to operate post integration? And what's the opportunity to rationalize all of the technology systems to do something entirely new greenfield and may be even leapfrog ahead in terms of technology?","Martin Flanagan","So, it's two phase, as you would imagine we looked at something else getting to date one. So at close, we will be on a single transfer agency. That's always very critical because that's the client facing element, so that a principal factor in choosing the closing date. 90 days after that the operating platforms will be all rationalized. We are then looking over the next two years to do exactly what you're talking about. We have a unique opportunity to totally leapfrog and number of the operating platform capabilities that we have. We are well into those conversations. And I think that's going to be real opportunity for us in complementary to a lot of additional things that we talked about earlier. So we're very excited about it.","Michael Cyprys","And when you mentioned that the next two years, that's something that you're to be looking into? Any additional color you could provide in terms of goalposts, objectives there and how you\u2019re thinking about that sort of saving into the expense growth in that post to your backdrop?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. As we\u2019ve already said in the past, things become material and interesting. We\u2019ll definitely share them.","Loren Starr","Yes. I would say that that none of that should have any impact on the $475 million that ultimately we\u2019re going to deliver that. And so if there\u2019s opportunity to invest further, it will be completely offset by extra saving.","Martin Flanagan","Okay. Thank you everybody for your time and questions. Appreciate it. And we will talk to you shortly.","Operator","Thank you all for joining. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."],"12555":["Invesco Ltd.

All participants will be on listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I'd like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco, and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you very much and thank you everybody for joining Loren and myself, and I'll briefly review the 2015 highlights before getting into a review of the business results for the fourth quarter, and then, Loren, will go into the more depth of the financial results and then of course we will open up to Q&A as we always do.","So let me start by providing a brief overview of the operating results for the full-year, and if you're so inclined, I'm on page 3 of the presentation. Long-term investment performance remained very strong in 2015, 79% and 85% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers over three-year and five-years respectively at the end of the fourth quarter. Strong investment performance, combined with a comprehensive range of strategies and solutions we offer, helped clients achieve their desired investment objectives contributed to long-term net inflows of $16.2 billion for the year.","Our efforts to deliver for clients while taking a disciplined approach to managing our business resulted in an operating margin of 41% for the full-year, off just slightly from the very strong prior year. The annual dividend totaled $1.08 per share which represents an 8% increase over the prior year. We also returned more than $1 billion to shareholders during 2015 through dividends and stock buybacks.","Assets under management were $775 billion at the end of 2015, down from $792 billion at the end of the prior year, mostly reflecting some late-year volatility. Average assets under management were $794 billion for 2015 versus $790 billion for 2014.","Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $2.44 versus $2.51 in the prior year. As you can see on Slide 4 foreign exchange had a significant impact diluting earnings per share by $0.15 per share from the prior year.","During 2015, Fitch upgraded the firm's credit rating to positive outlook and we repurchased $549 million worth of stock.","So let me take a moment and look back over the achievements over the past year, which will provide insights into our continued long range plans. First and foremost of course we made focus on delivering strong long-term investment performance, which continued to drive to grow our business. And as I mentioned 79% and 85% of the assets were ahead of peers on a three-year and five-year basis respectively at the end of 2015.","By delivering strong investment performance and focusing on clients needs, we achieved further growth across the business. In the U.S., Invesco was the only firm to appear in the top 5 over one, five and 10 years in the Barrons Best Fund Family Annual Ranking. Our Asia-Pacific business continued to grow and we saw strong inflows and a range of strategies resulting in net sales of $5.7 billion, the stronger showing in the region since 2011.","Institutional sales of $14.2 billion nearly doubled to prior year. We also saw continued growth in our EMEA business, driven by a focus on delivering strong investment performance and meeting our client needs. Cross-border and institutional were particularly strong with $7 billion and $4.5 billion in net inflows respectively and we remain in a very dominant position in the United Kingdom.","We continue to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by hiring world-class talent, upgrading in our technology platforms, launching new products, and providing additional resources where necessary in 2015. The ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm and we will continue to bring the best of Invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients.","By delivering strong investment performance, Invesco Global Targeted Returns achieved strong flows in its second year of offering, with assets under management surpassing $11 billion globally at the end of the year. We continue to invest and strengthen our fixed income platform in 2015, which is enhancing our ability to meet our client needs. We also invested in our institutional business in 2015, refining our global strategy, bringing on additional highly regarded talent to more effectively aligning ourselves to the opportunities in the marketplace.","We are seeing some early successes from this work, institutional flows, during the first quarter were amongst the strongest in past several quarters, in spite of a very volatile market. We are very focused on bringing together the full range for our capabilities to help meet our client investment objectives; the Road Island mandate of $7.2 billion is an example of the success we are achieving with our Invesco Solutions effort.","Throughout the year we continue to innovate and expand the range of alternative products we offer, leveraging our strong teams and capabilities for the benefit of our clients globally.","Two years ago, we began leveraging our presence in China to explore and better understand the opportunities in digital and mobile technologies in the marketplace. We've also been exploring the possibilities with market leading firms in Silicon Valley.","Our acquisition of Jemstep in mid-January is an outcome of this research. Jemstep is one of the first digital platforms that focus exclusively on advisors, and is the market leading provider of advisor focused digital solutions. Invesco Jemstep platform enables wealth management, home offices, and their advisors with a full suite of technology solutions that are highly flexible, customizable, and easily integrated into their existing systems. This acquisition represents an investment in our partnership with the advised community and highlights our efforts to participate in the technology evolution within our industry.","Turning to the fourth quarter let me take a moment to highlight the results which you'll find on Slide 8. Strong investment performance contributed long-term net inflows of $3.9 billion for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 40.1% versus 41.4% in the prior quarter. Quarterly dividend remained at $0.27 per share. We also returned $329 million to shareholders, during the quarter through dividends and stock buybacks.","Assets under management were $775 billion at the end of the fourth quarter compared to $755 billion we reported in the prior quarter.","Operating income was $356 million in the quarter down from $373 million in the prior quarter reflecting the very volatile markets we saw in the quarter. Earnings per share were $0.58 versus $0.61 in the prior quarter. We repurchased $214 million of stock during the quarter representing 6.5 million shares.","Turning to page 11 and looking at investment performance, as I mentioned during the quarter it continued to be quite strong was 79% of the assets in the top half over three-year basis and 85% were in the top half on a five-year basis. We also improvement in the one-year number which was 60% of assets beating peers.","Turning to flows on page 12, you'll see that active and passive flows were positive during the volatile quarter. Active flows during the quarter were driven by a variety of capabilities including Global Targeted Return, Investment Grade Fixed Income, Real Estate, and Quantitative Equities to name a few.","Passive flows were positive with renewed strength in Invesco's PowerShares ETF which saw net inflows of $2 billion. These flows were offset by $1.2 billion outflows associated with the Invesco Mortgage Capital deleveraging. This did have an impact across a number of categories. If you look at passive institutional fixed income in U.S., and if you add $1.2 billion each of those categories, you will eliminate the impact of the deleveraging of the Invesco Mortgage Capital during that quarter.","Retail flows were relatively flat during the quarter, impacted by the macro environment as investors waived their options during the very volatile quarter. Institutional flows were particularly strong driven by inflows in the fixed income real estate and reflecting our continued focus on this part of the business. The pipeline of one but not funded mandate remains at near all time highs and is up more than 28% versus the prior year. Notably this excludes the previous announced $7.2 billion Rhode Island 529 win which is expected to fund sometime in the third quarter.","Hope we feel good about the results for the year and the fourth quarter and that puts us in a strong position heading into a volatile year 2016. Continued strong investment performance, our focus on meeting client needs contributed solid operating results despite a very volatile environment. We continue to see strength across the global business, in particular in Asia-Pacific and EMEA.","Our focus remains on strengthening our efforts to deliver strong long-term results and help clients meet their investment objectives and enhancing our comprehensive range capabilities. But given the very volatile markets, we are taking a disciplined approach to managing our business, balancing our goals of reinvesting the business for the benefit of clients with a need to run our business effectively and efficiently as we have in past very volatile markets.","I would now like to turn the call over to Loren to go through the financials in more depth.","Loren Starr","Thanks, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $19.8 billion or 2.6%. This was driven by market returns of $21 billion, long-term net inflows of $3.9 billion, and inflows from the Q of $2 billion offset by negative FX translation of $5.3 billion, and outflows from money market of $1.8 billion. Our average AUM for the fourth quarter was $783.7 billion and was down 0.7% versus the third quarter. Our net revenue yield came in at 45.2 basis points, a decrease of 0.6 basis points versus Q3. FX translation reduced the yield by 0.4 basis points and change in mix reduced the yield by another 0.4 basis points. These impacts were offset by an increase in performance fees and other revenues in the quarter, which in combination added 0.2 basis points.","Next let's turn to the operating results. You'll see that net revenues declined by $16.9 million or 1.9% quarter-over-quarter to $886.1 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $8.1 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees fell by $29.3 million or 2.8% to $1.01 billion. This reflects the lower average AUM during the quarter as well as changes in the AUM product and currency mix.","Foreign exchange decreased fourth quarter management fees by $10.1 million.","Service and distribution revenues decreased by $7.2 million or 3.4%, again reflecting the change in mix and lower average AUM during the quarter. FX reduced service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million.","Performance fees came in at $18.8 million in Q4 and this was earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.8 million from real estate, and $3.2 million from UK equities. Foreign exchange decreased performance fees by $0.1 million.","Other revenues in the fourth quarter were $29 million, an increase of $1.4 million driven by a higher real estate transaction fees. Foreign exchange decreased other revenues by $0.1 million.","Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, fell by $17 million or 4.3%. This movement was in line with our lower retail management fees and service and distribution revenues. Foreign exchange decreased these expenses by $2.3 million.","Moving on down to slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $530.4 million increased by $0.8 million or 0.2% relative to the third quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $3.9 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $338.8 million, a decline of $8.1 million or 2.3%. This was due to lower incentive compensation for the quarter. FX reduced compensation by $2.3 million.","Marketing expenses increased by $8.8 million or 34% to $34.6 million. This is a function of seasonally higher expenditures for advertising and other marketing costs particularly in EMEA. FX reduced marketing expense by $0.4 million in the quarter.","Property, office and technology expenses were $80.4 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.5 million over the third quarter. FX decreased these expenses by $0.5 million.","General and administrative expenses came in at $76.6 million and that fell by $0.4 million or half percentage points. FX decreased G&A by $0.7 million.","Going on further down the slide you'll see that non-operating income decreased $3.3 million compared to the third quarter. Included in the fourth quarter were a $7.3 million loss on the disposition of private equity partnership interest, as well as a $2 million mark-to-market on paid money investments. These were offset by gains from consolidated sponsored investment products compared to a loss in the prior quarter.","The firm's effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income in Q4 was 26.6%, up slightly from 26.5% in the prior quarter which then takes us to our adjusted EPS of $0.58 and our adjusted net operating margin of 40.1%.","And before I turn things back to Marty, I would like to provide a little more detail on the business optimization work that we began to implement in Q4, in light of the current market volatility and as well as in light of our lower AUM levels. We believe this optimization work will make Invesco an even stronger company further increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating platform. The business optimization work that's underway is primarily focused on our use of our shared service centers, outsourcing, automation, and office location strategy. In the fourth quarter, U.S. GAAP results we recognized $16.2 million of expenses primarily in the form of staff severance cost and we expect costs associated with the optimization initiative to continue through 2016. Total costs for 2016 are estimated to be up to $85 million.","Reducing our run rate operating expenses in 2016 and in future years is an important outcome of this work. And we expect the ongoing benefits of this project will be well in excess of the projected one-time implementation cost I just discussed. We anticipate the project will achieve cash payback within less than three years and it will add an estimated $0.06 to $0.08 EPS accretion in fiscal year 2017 and beyond.","Finally, in terms of reporting and consistent with our past approach to dealing with material one-off expenses, the incremental optimization charges will continue to be adjusted out of our non-GAAP presentation but will be detailed and tracked each quarter in the U.S. GAAP reconciliation table within the earnings release. Additionally we will provide you updated estimates of the implementation cost and benefits of this initiative to the extent that these change in any material way.","So one additional item for me to note is that new for this quarter we've included a schedule detailing the impacts that the change in foreign exchange rates had on our non-GAAP operating results and expenses for the quarter. The amounts presented on Slide 17 represents the impact of the change in exchange rate movements in the quarter and the year and were calculated by applying the prior period FX rates to the current period non-U.S. dollar earnings. Going forward, the schedule will include each quarter and can be found in the Appendix of our earnings presentation.","And with that, I will now turn it back to Marty.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you. And so Loren and I happy to answer any questions, people might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question is coming from Mr. Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Sir your line is open.","Michael Carrier","All right, thanks a lot. Hey guys may be just first on the flows in the quarter and then I guess the outlook. It seems like a lot of the strength, Marty, you highlighted you're coming from the institutional side of the business. And then, Asia, you mentioned a pipeline near at all time high. Just wanted to get a sense from a mix standpoint what's driving may be that pipeline. And then when we think about it may be for Loren like from a mix shift on products obviously the market or the beta side is having an impact for everyone. But just wanted to try to get a sense on how that pipeline is relative to the current mix or the fee rate?","Loren Starr","I will be happy to pick that up, Mike. So the pipeline is being driven really in four big buckets, probably one of the biggest is direct real estate probably 30% of the pipeline continues to be strong driver. Fixed income generally, across broad fixed income, alternative fixed income, stable value, probably another 30%. And then, the remainder is split between asset allocation and multi-asset solutions and then quantitative and regional equities would be other.","So it's fairly well diversified and generally high fee. And so when we look at the fee rates of the pipeline, it's actually at one of the highest levels we've ever seen it, it's well above our current net revenue yields for the firm as a whole. And so, as these assets come in it will be accretive to our fee rates, which is great news. Obviously the negative that we've seen in our fee rate is due to the compression on equities just given what's happened in the market and then foreign exchange has also had an impact as well.","But in terms of the mix overall on the pipeline, institutional pipeline we think it's very positive for our fee rates.","Martin Flanagan","Yes, so I don't know if I could add much to it, other than it is a part of the business where we turn our attention. It's really seemingly getting stronger and stronger, frankly in each region in the world in the Americas and EMEA and in Asia-Pacific, and it is really quite broad-based. So it's a very positive.","Loren Starr","And the other thing I would just mention I mean we would expect our fee rate I mean given stability in assets and stability in FX to grow across 2016.","Michael Carrier","Okay. That's helpful. And then just quick follow-up, Loren, usually or sometimes you will give, some guidance just on like the expense lines and I don't know if it's because of some of the work that you guys are doing here to streamline the expenses, as you get into '17. But just any, I guess color I think comp you typically had the 1Q seasonality but may be the marketing you have some 4Q seasonalities. So any color on the expense outlook just given the volatility in the markets right now.","Loren Starr","Yes, I would say given the volatility we're probably going to not give any explicit guidance around line items at this stage. There is a lot of work obviously that I discussed being done around some of this optimization work which will have some impacts on those line items as well. Generally, we are working hard to bring expenses down. Right, as you can imagine year-over-year decline in expenses. Our compensation generally moves and flexes in line with operating income, so those will be down. Some of the optimization work especially around, we just mentioned some of the severance, will also help bring some of the compensation line down. But the benefits of the optimization work will probably spread across most of the other categories other than marketing explicitly.","But looking at marketing that's another interesting topic for us, it is one of these conundrums when you're in this market, your clients want to hear from you and you want to be out with them, but at the same time it certainly is a discretionary expense in this format where we're continuing to look at.","So I'd say we're obviously going to be very vigilant to making sure that we manage expense very smartly in this environment with no presumption of snapback or some reversal.","The other thing I would like to just mention there is some impact just to the acquisitions that we discussed in terms of Jemstep and in terms of Religare Asset Management completing our 100% ownership there. It's absolutely immaterial in terms of the earnings impact, so you don't have to worry about EPS impacts, but it does add probably roughly $15 million of expense and although bit more in revenue in 2016.","So you will see some of those line items go up just as a result of those acquisitions but offset by obviously higher level of revenues. So we normally wouldn't be surprised by that. The optimization work that we're doing should have a benefit in 2016 that you will see. So again we will quantify that as we get through it. But that will help drive expenses down year-over-year.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Martin Flanagan","Yes, I would just add to Loren's point. I mean, we feel like we're really quite capable at this, and if you look at our history, we use these volatile periods to really advantage of opportunities as they show up. It is a period where I think '16 for the industry is going to be quite interesting, where clients will be looking for those firms that are in a position of strength and we're one of those firms and we feel we're operating from a position of strength right now. And so we're going to be very responsible on the expense side but we have some real opportunities that we want to continue to advance at the same time.","So that's what we're working through and we will continue to make sure that we're communicating very clearly with everybody.","Operator","Our next question is from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies. Sir your line is open.","Daniel Fannon","I guess first can you expand upon the 529 mandates. I think the $7.2 billion you mentioned is going to fund in the third quarter. Is that -- can you talk about the mix of products that's going to be and then also it's obviously very large is that something that is a new channel for you guys or can you talk about how that evolved and may be the other opportunities within that sub-segment?","Loren Starr","Yes, so it will fund in January --","Martin Flanagan","July.","Loren Starr","Excuse me, in July. It's two plants. The vast majority of the money is in one plant is just the Rhode Island alone that's ETFs alone sort of a broad range of ETFs. It was -- it's driven by our Solutions team, so they are building the portfolio consistent with what's Rhode Island the CIO has set their as a set of investment objectives with a much larger part of the plan which is probably $6.8 billion of that is a broad range of active and passive capabilities again managed by our Solutions team. And from my point of view Rhode Island has been very, very thoughtful and it is really well constructive approach and again as our Solutions team is managing the capabilities.","With regard to the channel, it is new channel for us; from the standpoint of as we all know many, many people use 529s for kids and et cetera, et cetera. And so it will be available in the advice channel throughout the country and it's one of the largest 529 plans in the marketplace and we just think it's going to be that much more competitive.","Our goal is to help Rhode Island meet the needs of the people in the portfolio but frankly they also want to grow their plan too and we work very hard to do that.","Daniel Fannon","Great. And then you mentioned part of the strength in the fourth quarter has been in Asia and Europe, I think that has been for some time, I guess. Given the volatility to start the year, as this demand changes, as this demand kind of trends changed at all or kind of how would you characterize the start of the year?","Martin Flanagan","It's really hard to -- I think we all know the psychology day-by-day, week-by-week changes. It does feel like it's, as the markets are seeming a little more calm, and you're getting some more clarity, I will say business in Asia last week and all the business I have were all very, very strong, so I would anticipate continued strength there, as Loren said, in EMEA but it feels like we're starting to see a little bit more positive reaction to the environment. But again it's so early to say anything with dollar.","Loren Starr","I mean I think your point that you made before Marty is good, I mean institutional the strength on the institutional side is actually strong across every region.","Martin Flanagan","Right.","Loren Starr","Great pipeline. The retail behavior has been sort of hard to gauge sort of in and out as pharmacy go off. But generally I would say in EMEA we feel very, very comfortable and confident that the retail side is going to be quite strong. The GTR product is doing very, very well, pharmacy has been quite strong, and we think that will help continue to allow us to grow both in the UK and in Europe on the retail side.","Daniel Fannon","Great.","Loren Starr","And the other thing is the quantitative product as well is unbelievable off the chart performance, so also very, very strong performance and demand.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Sir you may proceed.","Glenn Schorr","Quick follow-up on the 529 I'm just curious on how the fee structure works. Do you get a fee on each of the underlying assets is it a wrapper up top and is it at a normal institutional rate?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, it's -- I can't remember exactly where it comes. But just think of an institutional rate on the whole, on the portfolio --","Loren Starr","And that's down to somewhere around 35 basis points.","Martin Flanagan","Right.","Loren Starr","Something like that. Yes, that's going to, sorry net down to something around 35 basis points on the basket.","Glenn Schorr","Got it. Helpful. And then a question on Jemstep, I saw your details and rationale for growth in the slides. I just had a follow-up question. How do you expect the distributors to use it, and then more importantly, how do you differentiate because I'm assuming there's going to be many large asset managers having their version and may be even the distributors doing their own version. I'm just curious as to say early mover advantage that it makes their lives easier but just curious how you expect that to shape up?","Martin Flanagan","Yes that's a great question. So I think you\u2019re going to and we are expecting the large distributors will have some version of their own. That's historically what we've done in the past. We've still contacted them and but that would be our -- what we're going to anticipate. It's really just sort of the other channels, though there is a high degree of interest in this. And really what it is, it's just partnering up with our distribution partners and more effective we can be with them, at the end of the day, that's a good thing for their clients and for us also.","I don't believe that they're going to be, let me say it the other way, I believe strongly there is a first move advantage to this, because quite frankly multiple distribution partners are not going to have yes, multiple I think, three, four, five, six, 10 of these within the system they don't need it. And it's like any other application is, it's education and investments to move it forward. So that is our other core belief.","Glenn Schorr","To that end, is that your point with we have 300 people on the ground selling and educating as we speak?","Martin Flanagan","Yes.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, good. Last one, Loren, with the cash balances hitting your internal hurdles and the valuation in my words at a ridiculous level. How you think about the payout ratio relative to the past like can we start seeing 100% payouts even through you have a lot of things going on?","Loren Starr","I think you saw something probably very close to that this last quarter. So again we certainly have demonstrated our willingness to respond when the stock is, as you call ridiculously low, and we would tend to agree with you on that one, just given our sense of optimism around our ability to grow over the long-term. So you should expect us to continue to pay a lot of attention, you know our needs for internal organic growth CDs and so forth are still pretty sizable, lot of opportunities, so we need to balance those against returning capital. But you should certainly expect us to be operating in the stock buyback around in a non-business as usual approach which is somewhat similar to what you're seeing in the fourth quarter may be not at the actual level but something between business as usual and what you've seen us do.","Operator","Next we have Mr. Bill Katz from Citi. Sir, your line is open.","Bill Katz","Just trying to reconcile some of the numbers on the optimization program you delineated a little bit, Loren. You mentioned that you spend; I guess roughly $100 million between the charge in the fourth quarter and then what you expect for this year, and sort of in the three year payback, $0.06 to $0.08 accretion in '17. Is it accretive to non-GAAP earnings for '16 and the reason I'm asking is I guess you got to run the expenses through the GAAP line. I presume if it's a three-year recovery either you really back ended in '18 or you would get some pretty sizable savings this year as well. I\u2019m just trying to figure out the cash flows?","Loren Starr","So the execution of the optimization is going to happen all through 2016. So the three-year payback is really going to be in, at full throttle in 2017 and beyond. We will get savings in 2016 probably somewhere around $15 million is what our non-GAAP run rate, positive impact would be -- are -- is what we expect and that would certainly ramp up significantly into 2017 and on.","So again our estimate is based on what we know today based on the activities that we're engaged in today. But we're going to be pretty that's the way we do believe that it won\u2019t be no more than $85 million in terms of what is required for us to implement that long-term run rate savings which again is somewhere $30 million to $45 million in run rate cost savings post 2017.","Bill Katz","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, Marty, may be both of you guys you gave a nice delineation also where by region and by product but the one area that seem to sort of not be within that list was more traditional equity mandates. What are you hearing from clients on the institutional side, is a still more this barbell notion or is there any sort of interest in more traditional playing vanilla type of mandates?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, so there are actually I mean this again I'll just use the A structures because I was there but I wouldn\u2019t limit it to there. I mean you\u2019re actually seeing institutional clients recognize this is probably the time to increase their exposure to the equity markets. So you\u2019re actually hearing very constructive things and also you\u2019re starting the year by the way this is a time where active management can really start to add value in a way that was harder from sort of a beta run from 2009 on.","So I think you're at a point where you're actually going to see, if you're a high conviction manager, you're going to continue to start to do well. So I don\u2019t know what you put in traditional but clearly international equities are high, we\u2019re seeing a lot of regional capabilities people are interested in. So I think it's just where we're in the market cycle and I think you're going to continue to see, excuse me, you will begin to see much more commitment to active management.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Mr. Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Sir, your line is open.","Patrick Davitt","I have another follow-up on the Rhode Island mandate. One, maybe I misunderstood how you frame this. But does this mean that there is a $7.2 billion of outflows coming from other people ETFs and funds on this fund?","Martin Flanagan","Yes.","Loren Starr","Yes.","Patrick Davitt","Yes. And then two, I imagine that that approval of capital like this has a pretty stick inflow stream. Is that the case and if so can you kind of help us frame what the organic growth of it has been kind of over the last few years?","Martin Flanagan","It's a very good question; I don\u2019t think I have a satisfactory answer. What I would say is that the first decision was to engage us to meet the program of the investment that they had in place that was the first desire. Secondly, they recognized the depth and breadth of our retail distribution capability with some very important distribution partners throughout the country, and so their anticipation of growth in the plan is part of what the decision was, and obviously we\u2019re very interested in it and we think it will be a new channel for us and we think we'll be quite successful with it. And I guess the other way to put it in context and again I don't have to assist -- they were successful enough to become I think as the third largest 529 plan in the country, and we would look for growth to be stronger than what it had been in the past.","Loren Starr","And I would agree with your characterization about it being sticky right?","Martin Flanagan","Right.","Loren Starr","As long as performance, everything else continues right.","Martin Flanagan","Right.","Patrick Davitt","And finally I guess on that again. Was this kind of a broad, kind of beauty show, what was kind of the decision process in terms of that?","Loren Starr","Yes, you've to think about it as typical, institutional, beauty show, and obviously you -- we have the choice of anybody they wanted to work with in the country and who is very competitive and because we know this is the largest 529 transfer that's happened in the industry.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Kim of Sandler O'Neill. Sir you may proceed.","Michael Kim","First any early read into quarter-to-date flow trends particularly given the seasonal step-up we typically see in retirement accounts in the first quarter. And then related to that, I think in the past you sort of targeted may be a 3% to 5% organic growth rate. So just assuming a more cooperative market backdrop going forward which realizes a big assumption these days. But in that sort of environment is that still sort of a reasonable range to expect?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, I'll make a couple of comments and Loren continue. So we still look at that 3% to 5% organic growth rate is very achievable. And again, as Loren and I have talking about such as this ever previously we just continue to see ongoing strength throughout the regions, both retail institutional, so we think that is fully in place.","You're now talking about a few weeks of January very, very hard to anticipate the quarter quite frankly and this week is a whole lot better than the first week of January. So I wish I could give you some great insights I really can't. That said, I do know and Loren made this point very clear that the institutional investors are continuing to move forward, the retail investors tend to be more risk on, risk off, depending on the daily movement in the markets although it feels like that's coming down probably the best I could describe at the moment. Could you add?","Loren Starr","Yes, Marty, I think that's about right. Probably say there is lot of risk cost behavior in the early part of January and so it's getting healthier.","Michael Kim","Okay, fair enough. And then so if we focus on kind of the alternatives bucket net flows have been consistently positive for a number of years. I know the real estate business represents a big chunk of those assets but there is also number of different strategies that are in there. So just wondering if you could sort of give us a sense of where you're seeing the best growth opportunities. And then, as it relates to fee rates, any sort of color there because I think the range of the respected fee rates within that bucket can be pretty wide?","Loren Starr","So Mike, I think the other probably even larger in terms of what we're seeing certainly in the fourth quarter is GTR I mean just continues to grow. I think it's brought in about $1.5 billion in net flows in the fourth quarter; it's about $11 billion in total size to-date. So that is one that certainly outside the U.S. has really taken on a lot of good momentum and I think the product that it competes with in the marketplace had some issues around its performance. And so the positioning is even better probably now than it's ever been. Still early days in the U.S. for us and so we like nothing more to see GTR sort of reach its appropriate timeframe and sort of get through all the hurdles that we need to get through for it to be on the platform.","But I think that in real estate and then perhaps as well alternative fixed income is still an area where we believe we can play at a much more significant level than we have in the past and there are lot of products that are still sort of early days in terms of their track record.","So I think it's really GTR and real estate right now are the primary drivers for us and where the demand is.","Michael Kim","Got it. Okay. And then just one quick one you mentioned or you called out the $7.3 million realized loss related to the disposition of private equity partnership interest. Can you just sort of give us some more color on exactly what that related to?","Loren Starr","Yes, so that was previous time where we were warehousing partnership in just before they were put into a vehicle for our clients and unfortunately the mark-to-market on that really hit us before I got into the vehicle and so that's what that is. Normally we would be able to get it in there faster but there was just again some exposure to a pretty volatile market and that's what you saw.","Operator","Next we have Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Sir your line is open.","Craig Siegenthaler","I was looking for a little more color on excess capital. I think historically you would like to provide a sort of guidance here in terms of cash and investments versus long-term debt and they're pretty close here. So could you just provide an update here and may be you're pretty comfortable where it is right now?","Loren Starr","Well so I think you'll see that we had about $1.85 billion in total cash at the end of the quarter. The amount that is required from a regulatory perspective in the UK and Continental Europe is around $550 million. So we are about $1.3 billion in excess of our rate capital requirements we've talked about in the past that we want to be at least $1 billion. So again we are feeling strong in terms of our cash position and our ability to use our capital to the benefit of our clients probably better than we have in a long time. And with that said, assets have dropped a little bit and so our cash flow is definitely having some -- there is some impact to our operating cash there.","But overall we are feeling very, very strong and then optimistic about our ability to deploy our capital for the benefit of our shareholders in terms of return on capital.","Craig Siegenthaler","That's very helpful, Loren. And then just my follow-up on Jemstep. I just wanted to get a better understanding for how this business will function, how it will generate profits and sort of what really attracts you to do this business?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, well, I probably said what's the attraction, as I said we -- our view is, it's a mistake not to pay attention to what's going on in the digital world and it\u2019s really easy to just ignore, we think that's a mistake that's why we went and spent some real good time researching what is happening and we came to the conclusion that a digital mobile tool that could help us with our distribution partners will be a very wise thing to do. It's a simple thought and your thought is that. There will be a combination of and I don't want to get into pricing on Jemstep where there will be a combination of things that we think will be accretive, if you want to call it to the organization.","First of all, the most important thing is well deeper relationships with our clients; we will be able to do better job with our clients. We'll be able to offer more effectively the broader range of investment capabilities we have to our clients, and those at the end of the day will ultimately result in increased assets under management if we again that we have to be performing et cetera all the obvious. But we think that's the fundamental thoughts of why we try Jemstep was very important development for us.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Mr. Ken Worthington of J.P. Morgan. Sir your line is open.","Ken Worthington","First also on capital management. We're getting to the point in the year where I think you will be recommending to the Board the dividend increase for the coming year. In recent years the dividend increase has been particularly big. But given where the stock price is, how are you thinking about the kind of the mix of capital return between dividend and buyback as we look forward to the next year?","Martin Flanagan","I think it's probably not great for us to be talking about this in event of our discussion with our Board. But generally it's I think our sense of more modest, a modest dividend could be appropriate stride in light of the fact that that will create more capital for buybacks which I think given the market pricing of our stocks may be the better way to use that cash. But again we need to wait before we get in front of our Board, before we sort of signal anything quite honestly.","Ken Worthington","Okay. Thank you. And then just little ones the pound hedge, the pound obviously fell a lot in 2015, can't really tell how much you made at the end of the day on that. Bill said in your release you're hedged out to March, I thought you were actually hedged out to May. How are you thinking about hedging out the currency as we think about 2016 and actually what did you end up making in 2015 on it? Thank you.","Martin Flanagan","Yes, great question. So the hedge as you know was structured, hedges were structured 1.493 that is reflective to the average rate for the quarter and so there was no quarter in 2015 that had a rate that averaged below 1.493. So we made nothing this year or last year in 2015.","On the current quarterly hedges definitely in the money and again, so again more to come on what the value there is it's moving around. But it's certainly something we would see at this rate noticeably, notable number. We are expecting to hedge our currency going forward around the pound. In particular, we believe that the pound is potentially going to be still a little volatile in light especially with the BREXIT discussions that are going on.","And so those are again as we've done in the past hedges we put in place that would be out of money puts that really will protect us from the downside, allow upside to occur and again would protect our cash flow in particular as opposed to operating results which we can't really protect against.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is open.","Brennan Hawken","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just one left as far as the U.S. equity performance you saw some deterioration here this quarter. Could you speak to that? And I think that you referenced last quarter that there was some loading up in energy stocks did that play a part here?","Loren Starr","It did. And again my perspective on that is overall the performance is still very, very strong and is very short-term in nature and frankly it didn't improve last quarter to this quarter. But it's -- then again it's all very short-term. But yes, moving into this year, it just continued to strengthen. So those portfolio sets will have the energy exposure we think that plays very, very well and they are going to do hopefully do very, very well for our clients.","Martin Flanagan","And the other thing I would say is that the improvement that we saw in the one-year numbers relative to Q3 were due to our small cap growth equity team as well as our growth in income products. So there were definitely some equity capabilities that can show improvement in the quarter relative to last quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Lee of KBW. Sir your line is open.","Robert Lee","Hi I have got two questions. The first one is kind of curious --","Loren Starr","Hey Robert, it's hard to hear you.","Robert Lee","Sorry. Is it any better?","Loren Starr","Good, thank you.","Robert Lee","Okay. Couple of questions you did mention in the release a couple of regulatory targets strictly private equity. Kind of curious what that is and even though adjusted that for EPS should we expecting quarters, a filling quarter it's kind of --","Loren Starr","Hey Rob we're really having a hard time in hearing you. I don't know you kind of grabled.","Robert Lee","You know what I will call you offline. I'm on a cell phone that's probably not working well.","Loren Starr","Sorry about that.","Martin Flanagan","Sorry, Rob.","Loren Starr","We're getting every other word.","Operator","Next we have Mr. Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Sir your line is open.","Chris Harris","A few questions on PowerShares. Are you guys seeing any fee pressure at all in that business? And then sort of related to that given how competitive smart beta is and it just keeps getting more and more competitive, do you think ultimately we might see new pressure in that area?","Martin Flanagan","So a couple of things. I think when you want to think about us, think about it beyond smart beta it is really factor investing. So one of the delivery mechanisms are PowerShares, ETFs but factor investor team is really the one team you\u2019re seeing real demand for factor investor team outside of the United States both retail and institutional, institutional in particular in Europe, institutional in particular in Asia, and we\u2019ve been doing it for 20 years. And I think the other thing if you look at the PowerShares line up what is important is that differently than mutual funds you really can\u2019t have more than three in a category.","So there is a first mover advantage topic within ETFs is something very, very real. And if you look at the length of the time that our smart beta ETFs have been in the market, they have liquidity, they have real track records and when you're the incumbent you're really in a strong position.","So we think other people come in into smart beta areas, it's a confirmation that it\u2019s a better way to create exposure and to passives. And again, we're just seeing continued strength within PowerShares in particular in fact investing outside of the United States.","Chris Harris","Okay. My one follow-up would be on the cost optimization plan. Can you guys give us a little bit more detail about what those costs really are; I mean is it a combination of project spending and layoff comp or is it something else. And then sort of related to that, I\u2019m wondering why the spending is taking sort of it's sort of backend loaded if you will, you would think it was layoffs are something of that nature it would -- benefits would be pretty immediate?","Martin Flanagan","Okay, yes, it's good question. Thank you. So we will make sure it's clear. These are long dated infrastructure type program. So many years ago we have a low hanging fruit is we call that's long on it's been long on for long time. So these are efficiency related undertakings hardcore system upgrades, process improvements type things. So it's large projects by having all of our institutions but they're pretty broad right now.","Loren Starr","Yes, in many ways they are transformational around processes and the way we do things. So it's not just trimming people that kind of behavior, you're right. That could be done very quickly. This is very thoughtful that will make us a stronger better company at the end of the day. And again in an environment like this, we will move more quickly to get those things done, they have been on our list, and we have all these things that we would like to do to continue make ourselves a better company. But we\u2019re absolutely accelerating a lot of these activities right now but they do take time to implement thoughtfully.","Operator","Next we have Mr. Chris Shutler of William Blair. Sir you may proceed.","Chris Shutler","So on U.S. and Global Fixed Income, you have really terrific performance, over $10 billion of active flows in 2015. Can you may be just talk about that area with rates may be rising a little bit here with changes in the credit markets and how you see the pipeline shaping up for '16 and beyond?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, so I'd say the effort that we started three years ago broadening our fixed income capability, probably almost four years ago now is really proving to bear real fruit and as you said, if you look across the fixed income performance it is very, very strong. And we're seeing growing demand all channels, all regions within fixed income and some of it is still not at the level that we anticipate because some of the capabilities don't have three-year track records. So getting close but we're starting to get new commitments on them simply because the performance is quite frankly institutions in particular looking for another high quality provider of fixed income capabilities. So not just the performance but we do think it's -- we're not seeing the highest level of contribution, yes from that area. So we're very positive on it.","Loren Starr","It's only growing for us. I mean, it's such a big market and we're still underpenetrated that our opportunity to continue to grow, even if there is some rate impacts. I think they is significant.","Chris Shutler","All right. And then may be a last one topic. The DOL fiduciary standard, just given the increasing thought that that's going to through; I just want to get your latest take there on. And realizing that the final rule is not out, what could be the impact to Invesco's strategy and may be any impact on expenses that we should think about?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, it's a good question, and again I think we're all -- we're imagining right, so it's hard to imagine. But what I can say and this probably gets back to some of these other topics that we talked about. The breadth of capability, depth of capability matters a lot. We think quite frankly high conviction managers in fundamental investing and factor investing is really important. We think we're obviously one of very few firms that has and do the range of those types of things.","And quite frankly the other thing that Jemstep does it's an enabling tool for our advisory clients to get broader deeper relationships with their clients and serve clients that may -- yes, individuals that could ultimately totally disadvantage by the fiduciary role that's been put in place, so that's part of the work we\u2019re thinking of how Jemstep can help us and our clients with a rule that we don't know exactly what is going to be at the moment. But so that's how we've been thinking about it and so hopefully that's helpful.","Operator","Next we have Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Blostein","Bigger picture on the expenses. When you take a step back, I understand that the initiative may have been in the works for some time but the revenue probably accelerated some of that. But when you take a step back and you look at your fixed expense base versus the variable expense base, to achieve that kind of 3% to 5% organic growth, what kind of inflation and investment do you need to see in your fixed portion of the expense base to achieve that target?","Martin Flanagan","Nothing more than what we have quite frankly so.","Loren Starr","And we\u2019re just leveraging in many ways capabilities that are in our view sort of not -- and we can scale much more than they are today and taking capabilities that are some are focused in a particular region and unlocking them on a global basis, we can use existing sales people, we can use obviously existing teams. So there is no sort of new infrastructure that we necessarily need to put in place to support that activity. It's more a matter of coordination and education and sort of making sure that our teams, our sales teams in particular understand these products and can articulate the benefit to their clients.","Alex Blostein","Got it. And then I guess along those lines, when you think about the product dynamic and the sources of organic growth that we've seen in the industry this quarter and frankly for the last couple quarters, European retail, UK retail has been a source of strength for you guys, for BlackRock to some extent, for Threadneedle to some extent. So some of the bigger US players. What -- when you take a step back, how has the competitive dynamic evolved in that market? And I guess more importantly, are you seeing share gains from other firms, or is the pie kind of still growing from whether it's bank deposits coming into the investment products or some of the captive asset managers just continuously losing market share?","Martin Flanagan","So is this in particularly in the UK?","Alex Blostein","UK and the European market.","Martin Flanagan","So if you look over the last four years and let's do kind of Europe first, I mean it has been really the independent global asset managers largely U.S. that have been continuing to take greater share on accounts. I know there are some other good competitors -- very good competitors that participate but that has been the fact for whatever reason. And over the last number of years as you've seen, I mean we just continue to make stronger and stronger inroads on the continent, we still think that is the case, we still have, we think quite a way to go to penetrate the market and that continues for us.","In UK it's really quite different. I mean it is really competitive markets; very few, very few non-UK firms are successful in the UK. And it is really that the heritage of our presence in the UK is why we're so strong there and again it just continues to be competitive, but we're very well placed there and we think we will continue to do well. But that would probably be another market that largely driven by regulatory developments and really what I would say what's starting to happen here in the United States, very difficult to be a smaller firm, and I think we're strong just going to get stronger in UK that's going to be the case in the United States too.","Operator","Next we have Mr. Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Sir your line is open.","Brian Bedell","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Most of them have been asked. Just this one on the solutions asset Marty, if you want to talk a little bit more about that. I guess first of all, would you consider that Rhode Island wins one of your best successes in the solutions effort? And how do you think you might be able to leverage that, whether you will use this as a template to further broaden the effort across your sales force.","Martin Flanagan","Yes, so Rhode Island would be the highest profile in the United States I would say. But again we're seeing -- one of the components of being able to do that, I mean it is really those combination of broad range of capabilities and from our point of view high conviction factor and fundamentals. So we have both of those and I think that is actually really important if we\u2019re going to be successful in solutions and it\u2019s continuing to carry on through us in each of the regions so the U.S., Asia-Pacific, frankly China in particular, and on the Continent in particular. And so will this continue to go down that path and there is growing opportunity in the area. And again I think it's you really have to be a broad gauged set of offerings to be successful and that's where we start and then the overlay of very some talented people that can do the solutions work for the clients.","Brian Bedell","And would just say in terms of the effort going forward on this and your 3% to 5% organic AUM to organic growth targets, would just say solutions is a very substantial part of that?","Martin Flanagan","So it is hard to when we, probably like you and everybody else we do our looking forward to try and understand where the strength will come. It's -- it will be a contributor for sure and a growing contributor over the two or three years out from where we are right now. So that's another reason why have such confidence in sort of the 3% to 5% range.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And just may be just lastly, on the solutions side, do you feel that's more fixed income oriented or really completely broad --or I should say fixed income alternative oriented or really completely broad across your asset classes?","Martin Flanagan","It's been 100% broad across the asset class utilizing anything from as I said really factor based capabilities two alternatives. So it\u2019s client dependent but it has used the full range of capabilities in most cases.","Operator","No further questions sir.","Martin Flanagan","On behalf of Loren and myself, thank you very much for your time and look forward to talking to you next quarter. Have a good rest of the day.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"12660":["Invesco Ltd.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today; Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer.","Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Marty Flanagan","Thank you very much and thank you for joining us everybody, and if you are so inclined, you can follow the presentation that's available on the web site. So I will spend a few minutes reviewing the full year results and the fourth quarter results of 2017, give an update on where we are with the two acquisitions that we are involved in and Loren will go into the financial results and we will open up to Q&A.","So let me start by talking or highlighting our firm's operating results for the full year, and I am on page 4 if you are following along. So investment performance continued to be very strong throughout the year, and looking on the back, a very strong investment performance, really our movement to focus on outcome oriented Solutions contributed to long term net inflows at $11.5 billion during the year. Organic growth rate was 1.7%.","I do want to highlight that 2017 represents the ninth consecutive year of positive long term net inflows from Invesco, and I will come back to that in a minute. But again, the combination of all these efforts, performance, the capabilities and delivery for clients resulted in achieving record earnings per share for Invesco of $2.70 per share, that's up 21% year-over-year. The adjusted operating margin was 39.4% for the year, up from 38.7%. We did return $472 million of dividends throughout 2017.","So if you turn to page 5, this is where I want to come back to, the consistency and the diversity of our long term flows, which really is in the context of nine years of net inflows. So this chart on page 5 shows the relationship between organic growth rate and the variability of that growth. The vertical axis is the average organic growth rate over the prior five years through 2017 and it's the public company peers. The horizontal axis was a standard deviation of those flows and it reflects the sustainability or the variability of the organic growth rate.","So if you look at Invesco against our peers, it's evident that the diversification is benefitting Invesco. Invesco has the lowest standard deviation of flows of the group, reflecting a high level of flow consistency, and additionally, we are just outside the top third of the average organic growth rates of that peer group, something that we absolutely intend to close.","Having strong and diversified sets of offerings and assets under management really does put us in a position to better serve our clients. But as a business, it absolutely makes us strong, by not being overly reliant on any one geography -- any distribution channel or asset class. So again, diversification is good for portfolio, it's great for business, and this is not a concept anymore, this is proven in these results. We do believe that this diversification of the business does lead to better flow consistency and represents a strong opportunity for us to reach that targeted growth rate of -- organic growth rate of 3% to 5% in the near future.","And lastly, I do want to point out, despite our continuous inflows and the low volatility of those flows, Invesco continues to sell at a discount versus peers. We do not believe that our current valuation fairly reflects our ability to grow organically. As measured by history, well, what we think is based on the future potential of Invesco.","So now let me turn to page 6 and take a minute to talk about the achievements over the past year, all of which were intended to strengthen our ability to help our clients meet their needs and further advance our competitive position.","Investment performance is very strong during the year, as I mentioned. 64% of our assets, beat peers on a three year basis and 75% on a five year basis. And this was really what was one of the principal drivers, good performance over the past nine years, that generated the flows that we talked about and in particular, in this year, the record earnings per share of $2.70.","But throughout 2017, we continued to build our competitive range of active, passive and alternative capabilities, that is really important for future success of any money manager. We did complete the acquisition of Source and announced the acquisition of Guggenheim Investments ETF business, both of which I will talk about in just a minute.","In 2017, we continued to expand our Solutions business, which brings together the full capabilities of the firm to provide outcomes for clients. And again, this is a really developing and very important thing that we are seeing, that clients are looking for, from money managers. One of the things that highlighted or closed within the year, as everybody knows, was Rhode Island, about 29 accounts. But also importantly, we are seeing success with Solutions and traction within the Wealth Management platform, and our different opportunities in different parts of the world, institutionally also.","Regarding our digital advice platform, Jemstep, we announced partnerships with a number of large enterprises in 2017, and we are well down the implementation path with several of them, and the sales and onboarding pipeline continues to be very-very robust. In particular, we saw strong demand from banks, which view digital advice as a really important means for them to strengthen the relationship with their clients, as they build comprehensive Wealth Management services. Jemstep differentiates itself by offering advisor-powered technology, enhancing human touch, not replacing it, but enhancing them. So the partnership with our partners is really very-very important and it works quite well.","We also continue to drive savings through our business optimization program, delivering more than $43 million in annual run rate savings, as of the end of 2017. We will use the savings to offset the investments in key initiatives that help us better meet client needs, strengthen our competitive position and help us grow the business, as we look to the future.","A handful of the initiatives I might highlight, for example, we have improved factor-based investing, which would also improve things like self-indexing and complement to our ETF business, with a continued effort to advance our institutional business globally and expansion in China, all of which we have talked about in 2017, or we will get further updates in 2018.","So now let me take a minute to update you where we are on our acquisitions in 2017. Again, both of which we are focusing on expanding and improving our global ETF platform. Both of which, we think enhance our competitive position in the upper growing ETF business, and the EMEA platform has been -- helped with the closure of Source and Guggenheim, also here in the United States.","Our EMEA ETF business totaling $27.9 billion at the end of 2017, up from $26 billion at the time of acquisition. This really is a strong result of our efforts to successfully manage the integration post acquisition, which typically we did not see any of the integration issues that often happen with acquisitions. The EMEA acquisition expands the diversity of our ETFs across equity fixed income and commodities, smart beta and active ETFs. So really complementary to our platform. We did launch 10 new ETFs in the fourth quarter, the point being, we looked to take advantage of the platform in a very rapid fashion.","The Guggenheim investment ETF business continued to expand assets under management and it had strong performance within that platform. We still intend to close in the second quarter of this year, and again the Guggenheim platform will add equity fixed income, alternative ETFs, again enhancing the range of capabilities we have and also will be able to create client directed proprietary indexes through self-indexing capabilities.","Spending a minute on the fourth quarter results on slide 10; you will see again, the strong investment performance helped drive assets under management to $937 billion, up from $917 billion in the prior quarter. We had solid retail and institutional demand, led by the long term net inflows of $4.4 billion, and organic growth rate of 2.3% during the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $399 million as compared to $397 million in the prior quarter. The adjusted operating margin was up slightly to 40.7% and we had earnings per share of $0.73. We did return $119 million to shareholders through dividends during the quarter, and the quarterly dividend remains constant at $0.29 per share.","Talking about performance, why don't we turn to flows on page 13; we saw solid demand for active and passive capabilities during the quarter. Gross sales and net inflows of active capabilities in the fourth quarter, building on solid demand in the prior quarter. You saw solid flows in a taxable fixed income, international equity firms and domestic equity.","Turning to passive, we saw strong flows into domestic equity fixed income, international equity ETFs and as noted in the presentation, our ETF acquisition in EMEA is contributing to net flows and building up strong demand for ETFs in that region.","We did see very strong retail and institutional demand during the quarter, as you will see on slide 14. As an example, this was a sixth consecutive quarter of net positive flows for EMEA, led by strong institutional and cross-border flows. And as you can imagine with markets continuing, ever rising as they have over the last number of months, demand for risk mitigation strategy remains strong, particularly amongst institutional investors and the pipeline of one, but not funded institutional mandate also remains very strong. We saw strong flows in the global targeted return funds, led by institutional investors, and we also saw solid flows in the Pan-European High Income as well as commodity in emerging market ETFs. So again, the flow picture continues to be quite robust and ever increasing, as we look to the future.","Let me turn it over to Loren, so he can give you more specifics and then we will open up to Q&A.","Loren Starr","Thanks a lot Marty. So quarter-over-quarter, we saw total AUM increase $20.1 billion or 2.2%. That was driven by market gains of $14.9 billion, long term net inflows of $4.4 billion, which included $5.9 billion of reinvested dividends and capital gains in the quarter. We saw a positive foreign exchange translation of $2.5 billion and inflows into non-management fee earning AUM of $1.6 billion. These factors were somewhat offset by outflows from institutional money market products of $3.3 billion.","Our average AUM for the fourth quarter was $930.3 billion, that was up 4.4% versus the third quarter and our annualized long term organic growth rate in Q4 was 2.3% compared to 3% in the third quarter.","Before turning to net revenue yield as I do typically, I wanted to provide one quick update on the change in this quarter and how long term inflows are being calculated. Beginning with the fourth quarter, our flows and AUM of our unit investment trusts or UITs as they are known, as well as changes in product leverage are no longer going to be classified as long term, and instead are being presented with -- alongside with the Invesco PowerShares QQQ product, categorized as flows and non-management fee earning AUM.","Since none of these products earn management fees, somewhere to the QQQ, we thought it was more accurately reflecting the nature of long term flows in AUM to exclude these products from those flows going forward. All prior periods have been restated to allow for a consistent presentation and comparability.","So now let me get to the net revenue yield; our net revenue yield came in at 43.2 basis points and our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees was 41.3 basis points, so that was a decrease of 0.6 basis points versus Q3. The impact of a full quarter of results for the acquired European ETF business reduced our yield by 0.5 basis points, and we also saw a non-recurring reduction in service and distribution revenues in the quarter. That decreased the yield by 0.2 basis points. These were then somewhat offset by a positive impact of foreign exchange and on mix, which added 0.1 basis points.","So ultimately, the mix improvement that was anticipated when we provided the net revenue yield guidance last quarter, did not fully materialize, to the extent that we had expected, as we did see higher outflows from some of our U.S. retail equity products, as well as a somewhat modest slowdown in flows, versus what we were expecting from our cross-border fund range in the fourth quarter.","Let me move to slide 17, just quickly; that provides our U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter. As is customary, my comments today will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which are found on page 18.","So let's move to that page; so net revenues increased by $28.3 million or 2.9% quarter-over-quarter. Just over $10 billion, which includes a positive foreign exchange impact of $2.6 million. Within the net revenue number, you will see that adjusted investment management fees increased by $37.3 million or 3.4% to $1.12 billion. This primarily reflects higher average AUM for the quarter.","Then we had adjusted service and distribution revenue, which decreased by $0.1 million compared to the third quarter. Adjusted performance fees came in at $43.3 million in Q4, and were primarily earned from real estate and bank loan products.","Going into 2018, we want to give some guidance here. We do expect that performance fees will be up versus our prior guidance, and we would say roughly $10 million to $15 million per quarter. Our adjusted other revenues in the fourth quarter came in at $18.4 million, that was an increase of $1.7 million from the prior quarter, and that was primarily due to increased real estate transaction fees.","Looking forward to 2018, again providing guidance here; we would expect other revenues to remain at a similar level to the fourth quarter, at around $16 million to $18 million per quarter, through the remainder of 2018.","Next, dropping to the third party distribution service and advisory expense line item, which we net against gross revenues, that increased $10.6 million or 2.8%, which is consistent with the increased revenues derived from our related retail AUM.","Before turning to expenses, let me just summarize all the revenue guidance I just provided in terms of yield. Looking into 2018, we would expect to see our net revenue yields, excluding performance fees decline modestly, by approximately 0.5 basis points year-over-year to about 41 basis points. This decline is driven by our full year results from the acquired European ETF business, as well as inclusion of the Guggenheim ETF assets, that we would expect beginning in the second quarter of 2018, and that will reduce yield by roughly 1.5 basis points. These impacts will be somewhat, but not fully offset, by the improving foreign exchange rate that we are seeing, as well as the sales mix trends that is occurring in the business.","Let me then move on to expenses; so moving on to the slide, you will see that our adjusted operating expenses at $605.7 million, that increased by $26.5 million or 4.6%, relative to the Q3 foreign exchange, with an impact on our adjusted operating expenses of roughly $0.9 million during the quarter. Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $376.3 million, that's a decrease of $70.6 million or 2%. This is driven by lower variable compensation and the $5.5 million non-cash charge related to company's U.K. defined benefit plan, which we recognized in Q3.","Looking ahead into 2018, again providing guidance here, we would expect compensation expense of roughly $410 million to $415 million per quarter. The increase in the first quarter reflects the seasonality of payroll taxes, as well as the one month impact from the base salary increases, as well as the impact of higher foreign exchange.","The seasonal taxes should then drop off in Q2, but they would be offset by the costs for the Guggenheim ETF business, as well as variable compensation being reflected. So note that this guidance of course is based on flat markets, consistent to foreign exchange and as well as the revenue guidance that I provided earlier around fee rates.","So our adjusted marketing, moving to that line; in Q4, increased by $9.7 million that's 32.2% higher or $39.8 million. That was related to marketing campaigns, related to the acquired ETF business, as well as the cross-border funds and normal seasonal increases in advertising, client events and other marketing costs. So looking forward to 2018, we would expect marketing expenses to come in at roughly $32 million per quarter.","Dropping down to the adjusted property, office and technology line item, that came in at $100.8 million, that was an increase of $7.1 million or 7.6% over the third quarter. This reflects increased outsourced and administration costs associated with MiFID II reporting, as required, and other regulatory compliance costs, as well as higher software costs. Looking forward to 2018, we would expect property, office and technology expenses roughly in line with the fourth quarter levels, around $102 million to $104 million per quarter.","And next, our adjusted G&A expenses came in somewhat higher than we had guided. As we know, $88.8 million, that was an increase of $17.3 million or 24.2% more than Q3. The fourth quarter reflected an increase of $9.3 million, primarily related to regulatory -- preparing for regulatory changes. There were business growth initiatives, which included product costs and legal, consulting, and professional services costs within that line item. These increased costs also led to increase overall of $1.7 million in irrecoverable taxes as compared to the third quarter.","In terms of the guidance, while we would expect to see our G&A run rate decrease, going into 2018, this decrease will of course be partially offset by the costs incurred related to the MiFID II hard dollar payments that we have talked about in the past. But overall, the guidance is that quarterly rate should be around $80 million to $83 million per quarter for 2018.","So based on the guidance provided today and assuming flat markets and foreign exchange, we believe our margin is certainly sustainable at current levels into 2018 and our incremental margin target for the year, remains at that 40% to 50% level, consistent with our prior guidance. Looking into 2019 and beyond; we certainly believe that our incremental margin could return to the 50% to 65% level consistent with our historical guidance.","So back on to the current results, going down the page, I will just quickly finish this out. You will see that our adjusted non-operating income increased $2.2 million compared to Q3, driven by mark-to-market gains on seed money investments. And then moving to taxes, the firm's effective tax rate in the quarter came in at 26.8%. As expected our 2018 effective tax rate will be impacted by the Tax Cut and Jobs act which was enacted last month. Given our domicile in Bermuda, we have always paid tax under territorial system in the jurisdictions where our income is earned, but we will benefit from the lower U.S. tax rate on our U.S. generated earnings, and therefore, our current analysis guides us to an overall effective tax rate for Invesco, that is going to be between 20% to 21% for 2018. This estimated rate could be impacted, as we continue to review of course, the rules, and if there are additional guidance provided on the legislation.","Other point is just on the GAAP results; you will note that we had a onetime benefit of $130.7 million in the quarter, that was reflecting the revaluation of our deferred taxes at the new lower corporate tax rates. This amount of course was adjusted out for purposes of our non-GAAP results and our intention, just in general, as these questions come up, about the cash related to the benefit on the tax rate, is to use this cash to reduce our anticipated outstanding balance on the credit facility, which will be used to fund the majority of the Guggenheim acquisition, beginning of Q2. After the acquisition is completed and our leverage ratio is reduced to the pre-acquisition levels you see today, any residual excess cash will certainly just follow our stated capital priorities. And as a reminder, these priorities that we will reinvest cash back in the business, as needed through seed money and co-investments, but then it goes to dividends and finally, share repurchases.","So that brings us back to the current quarter, [indiscernible] EPS to $0.73, adjusted operating margin of 39.7% for the quarter. And before I turn things back to Marty, I just wanted to offer an update on net flows as we have always done. In January, we continue to see significant strength in our EMEA business, as well as Asia-Pacific, both on the retail and institutional side. This has been somewhat offset by some weakness in the U.S. flows, largely in the retail space. But overall, we have seen through January 29, $1 billion of long term net flows. So we are not done with the month, and certainly there is an institutional activity that happens during the month. So that number hopefully could improve from the number I just gave you.","And with that, I am now going to turn it over to Marty.","Marty Flanagan","Thank you, Loren. So operator, can you open it up for questions please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And speakers, our first question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I guess maybe first, in terms of ETFs in Europe, has MiFID II impacted the conversation on ETFs and factor-based investing yet? How is the conversation changing, now that rules are in place? And then can you talk more about the marketing effort that you are putting behind Source in the U.K.? And then maybe lastly, what are the lessons you have learned so far from Source, that you could apply to Guggenheim? Thanks.","Marty Flanagan","Thanks Ken. So look, everything at the time of the announcement that we talked about, the landscape in Europe advancing, MiFID being very supportive of ETFs being even a more important part of the investing landscape, it's all in place. So we think it's going to result in a very important business for us. So nothing has changed there, we are just moving strongly ahead.","As I mentioned earlier, the integration has gone very-very well. It's a very talented group of people. It really is complementary to what we have. So we think we are going to see the results that we talked about. And from a marketing point of view, again, it just expands what we have been doing as an organization, using a combination of active-passive and alternatives. So again, very-very supportive.","Let me back up even more, before I come back down to it. As a firm, I talked about the flows and the consistency of the flows. We have a stated target of 3% to 5% organic growth rate. We are absolutely focused on driving gross sales to get the net flows that we want, and we are pulling every lever that you can imagine. So focus on distribution excellence, so not just limit it to Source, but throughout the organization, retail, institutional and also looking very much at the brand positioning of the firm and anything that we can do to further strengthen, ultimately outcomes for clients, resulting in net flows is what we will do.","But again, Source becomes a very important part of our overall global ETF business, and again, nothing has changed from what we thought at the time of the announcement.","Loren Starr","And the one thing I would mention too, is I know our institutional salespeople are extremely excited about the prospect of using ETFs within the Solutions context. It's something that is not really had available to them, and so, as we have added more resources around Solutions and being able to provide Solutions to institutions, the ETF business is absolutely factoring into those conversations. So again, it's a little bit early days to say, where it's going. But it's absolutely becoming a different part of the conversation than we have been able to have in the past.","Ken Worthington","Okay. Thank you. And then Marty, you have highlighted a couple of times in recent calls, the investment made in Europe, Asia, and U.S. institutional sales. I believe that, Asia institutional sales have weakened somewhat, but we are not yet seeing kind of improved net or gross sales in the institutional side yet, at least it's not material, and it seems like gross sales are sort of flatlined around this $8 billion, $8.5 billion level. So is the good news coming? When the good news comes, what level of gross sales we should expect? Are you thinking like, 9, 10? Like how good is good when good comes? Thank you.","Marty Flanagan","Yeah. So I am going to make a couple of comments and then turn over to Loren. So good is coming, and it's real and we expect the -- if you look out a couple of years, quite material. Our aspiration and intent is to have a very different set of outcomes net income what you are seeing, and from my perspective, everything is in place to have that happen. Again, it's things that we have been talking about. The factor capability, the alternative capability, the Solutions capability, the quality of the team and what we are and again, it's not a plan. We are actually executing the plan. So Loren, do you want to make a couple of comments?","Loren Starr","Yeah. Ken, I mean, if it's any indication, I know we don't get into exact numbers, but our one, not funded pipeline is up 34% through the course of 2017. The fee rates is well above the firm's overall fee rate, up 35% higher than the firm's overall fee rate. I think again, good news, we have seen outflows have been a little bit of a topic around the institutional business. The things that we see in terms of termination are down 33% versus last year, so down significantly. And by the way, the fee rate on what is likely to terminate is about 45% lower than the overall firm's fee rate. So significantly lower impact in terms of the outflows versus the ones coming in.","So I mean, based on what we are seeing, and by the way, that is robustly distributed across all our regions, both U.S., Asia and Europe, it's extremely good.","The other thing I'd say that's even more exciting just to look at, is another category of things that we track around qualified opportunities. And so those are active dialogs that we are having with our clients and that is at an all time record, double, literally versus where it was last year, and probably the largest growth right now is happening in Europe and then Asia as well. So very-very exciting with what's happening. Lot of resources have been -- continue to be added to our institutional business, and it is certainly seeming to pay off. So again I can't tell you exactly which quarter. And again, the line of site to things flowing, which was a lot of things in the fourth quarter moved into the first quarter, just because we felt that might happen with some volatility, and I believe it is happening. So we certainly would expect to see some near term benefits from some of those mandates going into Q1.","Ken Worthington","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Jeremy Campbell of Barclays. Your line now is open.","Jeremy Campbell","You guys changed your influence to contemplate kind of reinvested dividends and capital gains. I am just wondering, is if you got to separate out what's kind of gross sales and what's reinvestments? I know you have the footnote from the total flow profile, but not really stratified on a product or active-passive basis and I think the incremental disclosure is probably pretty extremely helpful for us on the sell and buy side?","Loren Starr","I think the first part of your question got a little bit cut off. But I heard your question about providing detail around capital gains and the reinvestments at a more detailed level. We can certainly look at that. Some of it is hard to actually obtain, because of -- we don't sell to third parties, and so getting the data that we just got, took a long time. So it is something that we can aspire to, to try to give you more detail. We did do that, of course, because we felt that it was more consistent with some of the largest industry peers that we have done, and we will look to see, if we can get more details, that's helpful.","Jeremy Campbell","Sure. Yeah, I mean, even something simple as like, using what your old disclosures were and then adding that extra line to get to what you are defining as flows, now would be --","Loren Starr","Yeah we have -- absolutely. We are not trying to do anything cute [ph] by distributing this. I think we can get you more detail.","Jeremy Campbell","And then I just wanted to know; I don't know if I missed this or not, but what do you guys expect for kind of full year MiFID expenses in 2018?","Loren Starr","Well we said, in terms of the payment of hard dollars for research, we have said tens of millions, which is the quantification, not very specific, because it is a very dynamic and fluid discussion, as we go through this process. So I will leave it at that, other than, it is our hope and certainly early indications may prove out that it's not just a hope, that some of the costs associated with payments for hard research may decline over time, as the industry kind of corrects and adjusts and reaches an equilibrium level, in terms of pricing for research.","Marty Flanagan","Right. I think the point is also though, the full impact is included in the guidance that you gave in G&A for this --","Loren Starr","Absolutely. Yeah. So we have included that tens of millions impact in the G&A line item, which is where it sits today and that's at a reduced level versus Q4.","Jeremy Campbell","Great. And just finally, I guess, related to Guggenheim, how has that been perform as a Group, since we had our last call here, that talked about kind of the flows at AUM level? Is it kind of tracking in line with what you guys expected, as sort of like that compound growth?","Loren Starr","It has certainly grown. I think it's at relatively $40 billion in size versus 27 something when we announced.","Marty Flanagan","$37 billion.","Loren Starr","I am sorry. $37 billion, excuse me. I think in terms of flows, since announcement, it's about $700 million of long term flows, which is roughly in line with where it was historically. I think it actually, prior to the announcement, it may have gone negative, and then it seems to improve a little bit. Obviously, there is not anything we can do to improve the flows right now. We certainly believe that once it becomes part of Invesco, we are going to be able to accelerate its growth trajectory significantly, and that is our hope and our plan. Right now, it's more than tracking, what we hoped in terms of a higher AUM level.","Jeremy Campbell","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line now is open.","Craig Siegenthaler","Hey, good morning Marty, Loren.","Loren Starr","Hey Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","So just starting on Jemstep; and I know you already announced a few wins here and some of these wins are already on the path to implementation. But can you help us just on timing, when will the related business win start to show up in flows and revenues?","Marty Flanagan","Yeah. So I think you have to look to 2019, right? So I keep coming back to -- it's very exciting. We think this is a strategic competitive strength that we are developing. We think it will be -- really enhance our business in the future, but again, these are just -- it's just low. I mean, from the standpoint of implementation, it is -- it is just the nature of what it is. But again, we couldn't be more excited about what's developing.","Craig Siegenthaler","Got it. And then, it's also in the comment in the slide deck on Jemstep, that you know, the sales pipeline. You noted as especially robust among banks. I am just wondering, what is the characteristic of sort of the average bank in that pipeline? What does it look like in terms of size, client base, things like that?","Marty Flanagan","Yeah. I would be a little careful, because the [indiscernible] announcement. But I mean from regional banks to very large banks, it is really quite broad. So it's, again, something that we think is a very important development for us and the partnership between ourselves and the banks seem to line up very-very nicely.","Craig Siegenthaler","Got it. Thanks Marty.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Your line now is open.","Patrick Davitt","Good morning. There has been a little chatter about troubles with the new all-in expense reporting with MiFID II. I'd like to get your thoughts on that and within that theme, how you think you came out on those metrics?","Marty Flanagan","Sorry, I have not kept up with the chatter. But what I can tell you is --","Loren Starr","Never heard about it.","Marty Flanagan","[Indiscernible], because I have not heard about it. Sorry about that. I wish I had more color. I just don't.","Patrick Davitt","Sure. And then just as a follow-up on the earlier color, all of the -- I guess, institutional pipeline data you just went through; is that just Europe and Asia or is that the total pipeline?","Loren Starr","That's the total pipeline for all of Invesco. But as I mentioned, it's about a third in each region.","Patrick Davitt","Great. And then, the $1 billion of long term net flows in January. Is there a lot of reinvested dividend and capital gains in that?","Loren Starr","None. None that's reflected right now in that number.","Patrick Davitt","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line now is open.","William Katz","Okay. Excuse me, apologize for the voice here, having a little flu. Just coming back to some of the expense guidance; parse out for us, how much will be contributed by Guggenheim versus how much is just sort of core investment into the business? And then relatedly, as you think about the drivers for the incremental margin to 2019, is it a function of bending down the expense curve or is it bending up the revenue growth? Just trying to get a better understanding of what the driver will be?","Loren Starr","So Guggenheim is, as we said, is coming in at incremental margin about 85% we are assuming is coming in, really at the beginning of Q2. Total expenses associated with Guggenheim are a little in excess of $10 million for that period of time. So that's one element of the spending, and that's coming through.","The other amounts of investment are sort of incremental to that, related to funding the growth in Jemstep, institutionals, factor-based, these are the things that Marty was talking about earlier, as well as further growth of our existing ETF business above and beyond just the Guggenheim business, to name a few. And that's ultimately what's driving down the incremental margin, by roughly, no more than 10 percentage points for the year. So hopefully, that gives you some color of what that is.","I do think, revenue trajectory, because of the mix of the products that we are selling, also hope to accelerate the growth, is what's going to be driving our margin expansion going into 2019 and beyond.","William Katz","Okay, that's helpful. And then Marty, just a question for you a little bit off the run from the [indiscernible] topics, but how are you thinking about the institutional cash business at this point in time? How critical is it to you and how you sort of think that that business, more broadly evolves for the industry? Is it more of a commoditized service or is there a real growth opportunity here?","Marty Flanagan","Look I -- it's an important business for us. We think it's a growth opportunity for -- there is a need. There always has been a need, there will continue to be a need. But really what's happened then, though you know this well as anybody, the consolidation of the players has just been striking with the money fund reform. And so, they are just -- have lost track of the numbers, but down by 50% of the people, who have spiked down more than that right now. So to be in the business, you have to be really committed to it. You have to have some scale, and we think it's an important business for us, we do it very well.","William Katz","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line now is open.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question guys. First, Loren, a follow-up on your effective tax rate guide. Does the 20% to 21% here in 2018 include the impact of the share based comp accounting change that went into effect last year?","Loren Starr","Yes it does. And good that you bring that up, because I do think there is typically a first quarter impact that you see there, and that will happen again this quarter.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, terrific. And then if we were to back that out, what would be -- what sort of order of magnitude do you have embedded into that 20% to 21% for 2018, just so we can think about longer run run rate, ex that noise?","Loren Starr","Well that noise always will be there, every year. So I am not sure, if it's something to factor in. So again, unfortunately, I don't have the exact calculation. Certainly [ph] something we could develop. But I can't imagine it's more than a percentage point.","Brennan Hawken","Sure. And we can follow-up later on that, that's no problem. And then, the guidance, just a quick question here; so the revenue guide was better than we were looking for, expense guide maybe a bit worse. So I just wanted to -- being the optimist I am, I wanted to follow-up on the expense guide; it seems like the tens of millions that you spoke to, included in G&A, but I think you also referenced, and might just have not heard it correctly, that the property and tech line also included an uplift from MiFID. So was the idea that tens of millions guide was more purely to fund the research, and then incremental investment and expense for technology from MiFID was exclusive of that. So all-in costs is going to be a little bit above that baseline, is it the right way to think about that?","Loren Starr","Well on the G&A, I mean, that's a run rate elementary [indiscernible] for research. Again, there may be some benefit over some period of time, as those numbers drop. But that includes the tens of millions. In the property, office and tech, this is really related to what we need to ultimately pay our third party provider, who helps us with a lot of the transfer agency services and so forth. And unfortunately that does not go away, that is a run rate as well, that gets just -- the cost of business has gone up due to MiFID II. So I'd like to reflect it in that guidance, that we gave you over $102 million to $104 million per quarter.","So unless the regulations themselves change or get sort of -- made less stringent, I think that number is a good one.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Robert Lee of KBW. Your line now is open.","Robert Lee","Great, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Marty, could you just update us maybe on -- you know, [indiscernible] larger intermediaries and others, that contain a kind of whittle down there, shelf space. I guess, Morgan Stanley is going through another round soon. So could you maybe just update us on how you kind of feel like you are faring in that, and also, maybe to what extent your ETF platform is helping you kind of sustain shelf space or giving you opportunities in those distributors?","Marty Flanagan","Yeah. Your question almost summarized it very well. We continue to -- again, it is a fact, the big platforms are narrowing, who they are working with and the number of funds. So far, we have done quite well through that. We expect to do that in the future. That's not to say that our smaller funds or underperforming funds are going to suffer during that. But it tends to be a very-very small percentage of our assets under management.","So you can contrast that to our ETF business. I think really what's important is, as you would imagine, we have a very strong conviction. I mean, the opportunity of factor and [indiscernible] smart-beta, and it has really not been fully embraced by the platforms yet. But we are already starting to see more of our ETFs, just really in the last quarter, start to go on to these platforms. So again, we are early days in the opportunity. And so we really do strongly believe that, the strength of the firm is really kind of a -- the range of the factor capability with our alternatives and traditional active capabilities to the platform.","So far so good, we are confident about the future.","Robert Lee","Okay. And maybe a follow-up on the Guggenheim transaction. I mean, as you pointed out, since you announced the deal, assets are up some, but at the same time, you have also had a decline in the go forward tax rates? Now that clearly will reduce the value of the tax yield, but can you maybe update us on how you are thinking about the incremental accretion from Guggenheim at this point, or does some of that get kind of priced away, so to speak, in terms of your purchase price? Just trying to get a sense on where that stands?","Loren Starr","Yeah. I mean, it largely offsets one another. The value of the tax yield is half the value. Obviously, that was, like I think roughly $30 million in tax benefit a year. But obviously the value of the purely U.S. based operating income is significantly more. So it ultimately is not impactful to the full value of the business to us, if it goes off [indiscernible].","Robert Lee","Okay, great. And then one last simple question, I am just curious with the U.S. changing to a more territorial tax system, still benefit from being domiciled in Bermuda?","Loren Starr","I mean, I think -- there is no impact really. They are both territorial. So it's an equal level playing field now, which I think is absolutely fine. Doesn't impact us, doesn't make us need to change where we are. Ultimately, I think we need to continue to look at what happened with legislation, understand it fully, before there is any reconsideration of do we like where we are domiciled or do we think about changing it. But it is something that certainly is on our radar screen.","Robert Lee","Great. That was it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Marty Flanagan","Thanks Robert.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Michael Carrier, Bank of America. Your line now is open.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Loren, just on the expense guidance, if I put that [indiscernible] to the outlook, it seems like the expense growth is maybe in the low double digits, call it 10%, 11%. Just wanted to break that down, and you gave us some color. But I am just trying to figure out, you have got the deals, you have got some of these investments, and then you kind of have your core run rate. And I know, 2019 is way out, but when I think about the core run rate of what you think the business needs, post the deals in some of these investments, is there any way for us to think about that versus maybe the elevated level that we are seeing in 2018?","Loren Starr","Your estimates really look out in the future a lot. I mean, all I can say is, in terms of our forecast and what we see, the good news is, I mean, expenses aren't accelerating through the course of 2018. We think they are roughly stable and fixed. I think that's very good news in terms of the expansion that we would expect to see in margin through the course of 2018, without any further benefit of market or foreign exchange. So I think for us, as it has always been, we see a fairly large incremental margin, more fixed than variable expenses. We have said, we have stated, that we have invested heavily around certain things. This is building out a run rate. But I'd say, that run rate, we think we are going to manage it, so it's going to be roughly, sort of flat expenses through the course of 2018, and you know, you are into margins that are well above 30% by the end of that year. So I mean, no market increase from here.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then, Marty, just on the opportunities in Asia, and particularly with China. Just given the market continues to look like it's opening up more and more? How are you guys positioned and how do you see that playing out over the next few years?","Marty Flanagan","Look, I think we are as well positioned as any manager in China. If you look at the institutional, you'd probably point to China as being one of the absolute strengths. We have multiple mandates with all the organizations there, institutions that we'd want. The joint venture is very-very strong in China, and it just continues to get stronger. We have the same view that you do. We look at the next three to five years, as a huge opportunity, and we have been there for almost 20 years now, and longevity and knowledge and experience really does matter in that market. And we think that's a very important opportunity for us and we intend to continue to pursue it.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line now is open.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Just back on MiFID II, I think if I recall correctly, the tens of millions was based on the adoption for European clients only? And correct me if I am wrong on that, but if you were to adopt that globally, how would that impact the tens of millions run rate, and over what kind of, I guess, timeframe are you looking at that, as potentially nothing [indiscernible]?","Loren Starr","I think the rate is, we have certainly looked at the potential of this regulation being applied on a more global basis and what that impact might be. Similar to what we did in Europe, when we saw this potentially happening, I mean, we had started to rationalize and effectively, optimize our use of research in advance of that. We are doing that right now in the U.S. and elsewhere. Again, without full view of this, actually will happen, but ultimately it could. So I think it'd be premature to put out a big number that really had no bearing on reality at this point. I mean, obviously it's more than my tens of millions. But I don't think it's anything that at all would be enormously material to our financial position, and if we see the sort of benefit of being able to take, what was a pretty large number when we first started in Europe and bring it down to something, maybe half the size. That would make me feel pretty comfortable, that it's not going to be a big deal to what happens in the U.S.","Brian Bedell","In other words, it sounds like you are able to scale some of that investment essentially?","Loren Starr","Absolutely. With the same rigor and discipline that we are using in Europe, we are now applying into the U.S. and there is more to come and more work to be done. I don't want to declare victory at all. But it is something that we believe and everyone agrees, it makes sense for us to do here.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. And then Marty, just maybe a broader question, just on factory based investing broadly. Obviously, there is a lot of compelling components of that, but more recently, we have seen a lot of the ETF flows really be abated now. I think it's about -- and once it's [indiscernible], it's about 20% of the ETF industry and you only captured about 10% of ETF growth in 2017 in January, according to our measures, more like just 1%. So I mean just broadly speaking, what do you think it's going to take to get factor based investing to become a stronger flow category broadly?","Marty Flanagan","It's a good question. The flow, since, whatever, the market bottom in 2009 has really been cap-weighted indexes and we can all identify the issues with cap weighted indexes in this market too. I think back to this concern that I have and I think others, that too many people aren't understanding the risks that they are taking within the cap weighted indexes today.","That said, that's your question. More and more what are we seeing clients do, and it doesn't matter if it's a retail client or a large institution. More and more, they are building their portfolios, with a combination of, just want to call it, cap-weighted factor based, [indiscernible] act as an alternative, and they are moving up the risk-return spectrum, and what correlates to that, is the level of fees. And so it is the way of the future, and that's very consistent with our effort and Solutions also. So it's really a combination of the breadth of capabilities we have, the Solutions capabilities put together, and really I mean, the clients, not just to build the portfolios they want, but just also be responsive to the totality of the effective fee rate that they want to build.","So what we are seeing and coming back to what I said earlier, the bulk of, if you are going to say, in the ETFs in particular and the retail channel specifically, the platforms have been focused on cap-weighted indexes over the past decade. Every single one of them have turned their attention to factor they look at as an important tool and building blocks for their advisors going forward. But it is really having the muscle memory, and the skill to just wanting to intellectually understand it. It's another thing to put it in a manner, that financial advisors can build the portfolios that they want. So again, this goes back to our factor capability that I had mentioned -- sorry, the Solutions capability, and we are actually seeing success with it on the Wealth Management platforms, because there is a need to do that. And again, we are seeing this type of thing actually in China, some of the insurance companies are looking for organizations that can help them build these portfolios very holistically.","So I'd say early days with the success, and again within factors in particular or smart beta with an ETF, by the time Guggenheim closes, we will be the second largest active player, very close to the top player, and we think it's again, an important part of our future.","Brian Bedell","And do you think Jemstep could be a material contributor to flows in 2018, or is that also more like a 2019?","Marty Flanagan","I guess, 2019. And again, so this is really -- the point is connecting all the dots. And what is Jemstep, it is open platform for the platforms. It really helps the -- helping the financial advisors within our partner clients, but also what they have asked for, many of them -- we have built many-many models, a combination of active and passive and just factor based alone. So again, it's going to be these models that are available on these platforms through Jemstep. So again, it's a combination of all of these things, but really, put us uniquely in a position to where we think our clients are moving. And I think it's very hard to turn a switch and catch-up to do all the things that we are doing right now.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Marty Flanagan","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line now is open.","Chris Harris","Thanks. Can you guys remind us how your fixed income business is positioned with respect to higher rates? And then a related question to that, I believe you have a lot of income and dividend strategies. So how might higher rates affect the demand for those strategies in particular?","Marty Flanagan","Maybe I will take the equity piece of line, and you take the fixed income. I think what you are seeing, largely, if you look at our value suite, it is from where it has been historically, a lot of investments in the dividend strategies. What you have seen with some of the markets with the relative performance falling off, that has been traded off to really the deep value capabilities, just getting much stronger. And again, we have said that all along. It is something that we have anticipated and we would anticipate the flows to switch accordingly. Though again, as you would predict, that's what we are beginning to see.","Loren Starr","Yeah, I think in the fixed income discussion, we were fortunate that we have a substantial amount of our assets, money markets, bank loans, all on a more floating type of basis. So they don't play necessarily, significantly impacted by rising interest rates. I think the part of our business that is more long duration, would be in Europe, where we have the corporate bond offshoring. But they tend to position their portfolio with lower duration. So on a relative basis, as and when rates start rising in Europe, that would be well positioned.","So there isn't any significant exposure. We do have some core longer term fixed income. And also there is none that could be effective. But it's not a substantial part of our business. The majority of our business is actually more short term and floating, than it is -- and stable value is not a component of that by the way, which is in excess of $40 billion too. So also that helps.","Chris Harris","Yeah it does. And the other question I had really is just on your organic growth. I mean, you guys absolutely do rank very competitively versus peers. You pointed that out. But just wondering where you guys think you are in terms of organic revenue growth? That's a little bit harder for us to see?","Loren Starr","Yeah. I mean, I think we have a lot of things moving around in our mix. But I do believe, that given the significant growth on the institutional pipeline as we talked about, and certainly our cross border fund range, which is the fastest growing part of our business, certainly one of the fastest growing part of our business, is at a much higher fee rate than the firm overall. Our mix impact on revenue yield is actually a positive. But obviously, we are sort of going through some large step function changes with these acquisitions, that cloud trendlines. But I would say, the overall mix of the flows of the assets that are coming in, will still provide a higher list on our fee rate over the course of the years to come than being driven by more commoditized multi-product.","Marty Flanagan","Let me answer that; and the way to think about it for us as an organization, I mean, I was talking about this earlier. So if you just think about the continuum of investment capabilities from upgraded indexes being very low fee, so you get what you paid for, and factor higher fee, high conviction, active higher alternative higher fee again. And so, when you see the mix of our business changing, where with the acquisitions of Guggenheim and Source and to factor sort of lower effective fee rate, but it's the response of the clients and it is a much more scaled business, where there is limited capabilities at some point with active capabilities, you know you close them down.","So it's really, we think what's important about our business is, a range of capabilities and the fees that we have, they are competitive fees, and I think that's the other point, right? So you need that competitive fees and you have to have that continuum to meet the client needs. So that's really what Loren is getting to, where if you just looked in at our overall fee rate, it's quite difficult to ascertain and that it really gets back to the thing that Loren has pointed out, is our overall margin, as we are building the --","Loren Starr","We have said this before. I mean, the fee rate is one measure. But I mean, obviously the margin on some of these lower fee products are as good, if not better than the -- from an overall margin. So it requires scale and growth, which is what we plan to do with these products. So there is really a lot of things going on, that will drive cash flow or value going forward, and we are not trying to maximize fee rate, as a single kind of objective, if we will, we would probably not be as focused when going into ETFs and some institutional areas. But we do know that if we get good scale and growth, these things are going to provide huge upside on our margin.","Operator","Thank you. Next question speakers is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line now is open.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Just two quick follow-ups; on the whole MiFID cost conversation, I just want to make sure, have you seen any evidence, have you had any client dialog that would suggest it would take on a more global nature in the coming two years?","Marty Flanagan","No We know what you know, right? You have seen the public dialogs. I think just back to what Loren said, it created a complicated situation, the MiFID regulation versus the U.S. regulation, that's where you had really all the debates, publicly. I would just come back to what do we do? We are a responsible consumer of research. We will continue to be. We are well aware of the possibility of becoming a global event. And it is something that we think we will do very well, and I'd come back to. The good news is, a firm like us, we are in a position to do quite well with changes like that. The bad news is, if you are not a firm with scale, you are really disadvantaged, and I don't think that's a great outcome, but it is a fact of the matter. So we really don't know what the outcome is going to be, but we are adopting all the techniques that we did during MiFID, globally for us as a firm.","So I wish I could be more specific.","Glenn Schorr","No, that's helpful. I appreciate Marty. The last one I have is, I am just curious on how the rebalancing dialog is or is not happening with clients and consultants after such a divergence of returns in 2018 between equity and fixed income. I know it's more complex than that. I am just curious, if it is hot and heavy right now, if we expect, given the growth outlook for people to have equity allocations run higher? Just curious what you see?","Marty Flanagan","Yeah. It's a good question. I can't say that I have any -- I have not picked up sort of the energy that you are describing. But I think a lot of institutional clients, I mean, they tend to have a longer term view and to react to that quickly, to environments like this. But I wish I had some more insights, but I really don't.","Loren Starr","The only thing I could say, I mean, this seems to be just an increased appetite. So both on the retail and institutional side on asset allocation products. Ultimately it provides the flexibility and the nimbleness to navigate through these changes, which certainly are current in different ways in different parts of the regions that we operate in. So that is factoring in a big way, in terms of our pipeline of one not funded and potential opportunities, and certainly in some of our sort of recent positive activity around the retail side in the U.S. and also, I think asset allocation --","Marty Flanagan","That's a very good point. That's probably a good way to expand your opportunity with ETR and the likes. So I guess at some level, outside the conversations, individuals are -- institutions are really -- sort of both want to [indiscernible].","Glenn Schorr","Right. All right. Thank you both. That's awesome.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Kenneth Lee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line now is open.","Kenneth Lee","Thanks for taking my question. Just stepping back, looking at the flow volatility organic growth chart; how do you think about any potential trade-offs between attaining higher organic growth rates and the impact on flow volatility potentially? And relatedly, wondering if the shift towards increasing exposure to institutional clients, would potentially impact flow volatility down the line?","Marty Flanagan","Yeah. It's a good question. We would look forward to that problem. But [indiscernible], our intention is this. So underlying -- the fundamental fact is, the global diversification of the institution, the global retail institutional channels and the asset mix, those are underpins that will not change and I think that is really what is going to continue to keep this low volatility. Our focus is really by -- if we do a good job for clients, driving the gross number up and that is our focus. I really don't think you are going to all of a sudden see a switch to a very volatile environment.","Now we all do know, the good news is when you win a large institutional mandate, you are very excited about it and then when you get terminated, you are less excited about it, because of the banks. But that is just the nature of what it is.","Loren Starr","I mean the other thing I would say is, we are obviously -- in terms of the low standard deviation, I'd say a function of just the breadth of the capabilities that we offer in different regions, and I would say we probably have one of the greatest breadth of capabilities of the peers that we compete with. And we also have very focused approach around managing the portfolio and the investment teams will close them down, when they see that performance is being impacted by too much growth. And so you are not going to have huge concentration of assets in any particular capability, just because of the nature of sort of diminishing returns to clients.","So we do think, we will probably be always be at the low end of the volatility side. What we are really trying to do is, through greater capabilities and effectiveness on our institutional platforms and also, scaling the capabilities that we have on a more global basis, so we can move the growth rate up.","Kenneth Lee","Great. And just one bit about the performance fees; I think in the past you mentioned that real estate bank loans, private equity, these kind of products generate a lot of the performance fees. Just wondering, what drove most of the fees in this quarter, and also what's potentially driving the potential increase in guidance or performance fees in 2018? Thanks.","Loren Starr","Yeah. So in terms of this quarter, we saw mostly, coming from real estate. About half of it -- bank loans was -- about the rest of it between that and global asset allocation. So those were the primary drivers.","In terms of the buildup for 2018 and the guidance that we gave, it's going to be a very similar profile. We believe it will be coming from the similar places we have seen in the past, and so, again, and we continue to grow each of these areas in a very nice way.","Kenneth Lee","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Loren Starr","No problem.","Operator","Your next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line now is open.","Alex Blostein","Thanks for taking the question guys. Just one around the product specific issue; the performance in the U.K. business faced some challenges recently. I know they had a tough 2017 as well. Can you remind us, I guess, when you look at the equity business in the U.K., what the asset base today, sort of kind of what are the fee rates channels, and more importantly, I guess the sensitivity, you think the customer base there could have to such a meaningful underperformance, albeit over the short term basis?","Loren Starr","So I think on U.K. retail is about $65 billion in total, and that is not all equity income, I think maybe less than half was equity income. So there is about 30 of that. Also we have some other places where that -- those products and that team operate. But it has become a much smaller part of the overall business, and in terms of impact, it has actually been really stable in performance, even though it's a little bit challenged, has not really driven outflows in the business in any material way. I mean, just -- I think, more than offset by what's going on in terms of the cross-border situation. So ultimately, there is some underperformance in that equity income capability, but it is certainly not stopping the growth of the overall U.K. retail business, given the GTR capabilities, the fixed income capabilities, pan-European equity capabilities. So at this point, certainly not creating enough business topic for us.","Alex Blostein","Got it, great. And then just bigger picture going back to the full discussion, and just some -- really more of a clarification. But I guess, when I look at your target of 3% to 5% organic growth, I am assuming that follows the new convention of disclosing flows and I guess, based on 2017 results, reinvested dividends at about a percentage point or so to the organic growth, the way you guys describe it now. So is apples-to-apples, is this really kind of 2% to 4%, if we were to compare that to the way you guys used to talk about [indiscernible]?","Loren Starr","Yeah. I mean, it would put us probably at the higher end of our aspirations of that range, sort of immediately versus the lower end because of that. So yeah, we certainly factor that into our thinking about, trying to get into that target. I mean, we have not reached that target, even with the capital gains investment. So we are feeling, in terms of getting to that level. So that I mean, we still think 3% to 5% would be a good place for us to get to.","Alex Blostein","But the 3% to 5% is with the reinvested dividends?","Loren Starr","It is.","Alex Blostein","Yeah. Got it. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line now is open.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Just a follow-up on the institutional. I guess, looking at the slide on -- slide 14, I just want to reconcile this year, kind of the quarterly growth sales being down each quarter year-over-year. But if I recall, your comments generally being close to record backlogs or backlogs all being up. So just throughout the year. So just curious as to kind of what -- just kind of connect the dots there for us?","Loren Starr","Well I think the flow picture, as I mentioned, we had a lot of one, but not funded business that probably is going to come into fourth quarter, that has -- that got moved into 2018, and so it was actually surprising how many things moved. And I think it was just a little bit of the volatility around tax rates and knowing what was going to happen versus not. So that's my explanation, is that there was uncertainty which caused a slowdown, which should then be offset by a pickup in Q1.","Dan Fannon","Okay. But I guess that's the 4Q, but if I recall throughout the year, you guys did talk about kind of high or record levels of backlog, and the gross sales were down throughout the year. I guess, I am just looking at the year-over-year dynamic, so is -- are the funding periods across the board, just taking a lot longer to materialize?","Loren Starr","I mean it's a good question. I mean, a lot of the funding will take six months, could be longer in terms of what they ultimately require to get done. So there has been some movement within the pipeline around timing. That was probably more than we had expected generally. So granted, I think we do not see as much materialize on the sales side on the institutional business in 2017, as we would have originally expected based on the pipelines that we were looking at. We could say, well that's maybe the case, and possibly it is, other than I'd say our themes seem far more -- feeling like they [indiscernible] that the business is going to fund in 2018.","Dan Fannon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from Greggory Warren of Morningstar. Your line now is open.","Greggory Warren","Yeah, good morning guys. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the retail distribution platforms. You noted that you wouldn't have that much of an issue, but just kind of curious, how much pressure is there on you guys or the industry on, I would say fees and performance, especially with a lot of the calling we have seen in the last two years, both from Merrill and Morgan Stanley. And then just, on top of that, how much of your actual platform is really exposed to what's going on within that particular part of the business? You have 68% of your business in retail, but I know it's not that much, as [indiscernible] opposed [ph] to say, what's going on with U.S. third party platforms?","Marty Flanagan","Let me try to address some of it. So what are the factors that the platforms are looking at, it's really what they determine of the asset classes that they want on their platforms. They are looking at the quality of the managers, the historical performance and the competitive fee rates. And that is criteria, generally that is used, and also, once they get beyond a specific, if there is a -- if they can end up using fewer providers, that is also a factor, so those are sort of the criteria that we are judged on and we have done quite well. Taking on top of just the fund-by-fund analysis and I am going to lose track of the magnitude. But the last update I had on some of the platforms, more than a third of the managers, in total have been terminated. So it's just not a fund consolidation, but a manager consolidation at the same time.","So that has been so -- I'd be repeating myself a little bit from the prior conversation. So it is the totality of the offering, so it's just not mutual funds, it is ETFs, it is also alternative capabilities, all of which that we have. So again, if we continue to have high quality capabilities, and we conserve our clients, which I think we do well, and we will continue to be one of the firms that will do quite well out of this.","I think the other part of the focus, where the focus has not turned to, those managers that remain on the platform will be net beneficiaries, because of the obvious, there will be fewer managers and money will ultimately go to the managers and remain on. Now, that's not going to happen quickly, because your math -- [indiscernible] your math, if you have been taken off the platform, the client is not forced out of their holdings, which is exactly the right way to do it.","So again, I don't know if I am telling anything you don't know, but that's our analysis.","Greggory Warren","No I was just kind of curious, if there was any real pressure at all on you guys on that side. And I guess to follow-up on that, you talked about the smart beta products being sort of a newer entry for you guys on a lot of these platforms. And I am just curious, you were kind of earlier to the market with a lot of these products, but there has been a lot of additional competing products that have come on the market, since you guys bought PowerShares in the beginning. I am just wondering, do you feel like you are appropriately priced relative to what's going on? I mean, the fee compression hasn't been dire, and that part of the business has been in plain vanilla index. But I just wonder if you guys feel you are well positioned with that product set as well.","Marty Flanagan","We do. And I think going back to my comments. If you just follow the notion of taking the investment capability and what are the returns are those meant to generate, so you just follow that right? Cap weighted index, which you shouldn't get much for it, it doesn't do much right. It was an exposure, it's important, a lot of money is gone into it. Probably too much money has gone into it. And I think also importantly, just because you launch an ETF, doesn't mean you are good at it. And I think there has been a lot of ETFs that will just fail. There is a low barrier to entry, a very high barrier to success, and it's much more than launching an ETF. And if you look at our smart beta ETF, it's one of the broadest range of ETFs with long track records.","So 10 year track records, and I think that's also what is important. And it's just not the fee itself, it's also the liquidity with the ETFs, and I think that also has lost on a lot of people. So it really makes it difficult for new entrants and so if you have a long track record and some liquidity, it's a really important set of combinations, when you consider what clients are ultimately looking for. And so I think that bodes very well for factor investing as you look to the future on these [indiscernible].","Greggory Warren","Perfect Marty. That's good insight on that side. I just had one quick follow-up too on the MiFID II stuff. How much of your AUM is -- because you talk about tens of millions in class, but how much of that AUM does it really sort of relate to? Does it relate to everything that's in Europe, U.K. and Europe exclusive? I mean, I know some of that is probably institutional, so probably not as exposed. But I am just sort of curious, how much of your AUM is really sort of exposed to the MiFID II rules, and that's going to cost you more to pay for the research?","Loren Starr","Yeah. I mean, it's largely the European business, so you'd have to look at the full value of that AUM, which is hundreds of billions.","Greggory Warren","So probably about -- you have $238 billion right now.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to turn the call over to the speakers for today, Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin L. Flanagan","Thank you very much, and thank you, everybody, for joining us. This is Marty Flanagan and I am with Loren Starr, who was just introduced. Today we'll provide a review of the business results for the third quarter, including a discussion regarding the United Kingdom. Loren will go into greater details in the financials, and as always our practice, we'll open up for Q&A.","So if you happen to be following the presentation, I'm on Page 3. And let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter. And they were very, very strong. First, it started with very good long-term investment performance. And it remained strong across all time periods during quarter. The strong investment performance, with the broad diversity of flows and continued focus on clients, contributed net inputs of $9.1 billion during the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up 34% compared to the third quarter of last year, and a continued focus on the disciplined approach to our business drove improvement in our operating margins to 40.2% from 34.5% in the same quarter a year ago. This is a 5.7% -- percentage point increase, so a very, very strong quarter.","Assets under management were $745 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $705 billion in the prior quarter. And you'll remember from the second quarter that assets under management in the financial results during the quarter reflect our decision to treat Atlantic Trust as a discontinued operation, given that this is a pending combination with CIBC. Operating income was $328 million versus $311 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.55, up from $0.50 in the prior quarter.","The quarterly dividend remained at $0.225 per share. And we returned just over $100 million to shareholders during the quarter. And reflecting confidence and the continued strength of the business, the Invesco board authorized $1.5 billion of additional share repurchases.","And before Loren goes through the details of the financials, let me spend a few minutes first on the investment performance in the quarter. I'm on Page 6 now. Investment performance in the quarter was, again, amongst the strongest we've seen across the global organization. 82% of assets were ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year basis, and 72% of assets were ahead of peers on a 1-year basis. And as you might expect with numbers like these, long-term performance of our investment teams -- for investment teams across the enterprise, were quite strong, with a number of capabilities achieving top desk [ph] outperformance.","Performance of our cross-border fund range remained strong during the quarter with 87% of its assets in top half of peers on a 3-year basis and 84% of assets on a 5-year basis.","Turning to flows. You'll see on Page 7 that gross long-term sales remained stronger during the quarter. In addition, redemptions tapered off, which led to an improvement in long-term net flows of $5 billion this quarter versus $1.4 billion in the prior quarter. These numbers also reflect the broad diversity of flows we saw across the global business during the quarter, which included strength in equities and alternatives.","Continued strong gross long-term sales and improvements in gross long-term redemptions led to net flows in our retail channel of $6.5 billion versus $4.9 billion in the prior quarter. The institutional channel saw continued demand in real estate bank loans and IBRA. During the quarter, there were -- there was a $2.5 billion note fee outflow related to a decrease in leverage in our mortgage REIT. The institutional pipeline of one but not funded mandates continues to look very strong.","Turning to Page 9. I would just like to put things in perspective. And before the showdown in Washington undermined consumer confidence and put a damper on growth, we saw solid strength in the U.S. economy during the third quarter. As a result of that, although clients continue to show interest in our Asset Allocation strategies, we saw a shift towards risk-based assets during the quarter, which resulted in a slowdown of IBRA sales. I wouldn't characterize this as a great rotation, but there surely was a mild rotation of investors feeling more confident enough to take on additional risk, and you'll see on Page 10.","Gross long-term sales for our retail business remained strong at $21.6 billion for the quarter, a 26% increase over the same quarter a year ago, which was also quite strong. The annualized redemption rate for Invesco remained favorable relative to the industry. And redemptions also eased during the quarter, which led to net sales of $3 billion.","Flows into the complex were led by strength in U.S. value equity, international, global equities and traditional ETFs and alternatives. Our U.S. business has become increasingly diversified as allocation and alternatives grew to 38% of sales in the quarter, versus 25% during the same period 2 years ago.","We saw 18 funds with net flows of greater than $100 million over the trailing 12-month period ended September 30, 2013, and this compares to 6 in the same period in 2011. So you can start to understand the broadening of the flows and the benefit that we keep talking about the broad diversity of investment capabilities where we can meet investor needs in different environments.","We feel good about the momentum in our business. We remain confident in our ability to deliver a high level of value for our clients, and we believe the firm is well positioned regardless of where the market takes us next. As always, we continue to look for opportunities that further strengthen our competitive advantage and our financial position over the long term.","And before I turn it over to Loren, I would like to go more in-depth into a discussion of our position in EMEA. So I'm on Page 12, if you are following the slides. First, as everybody on the call is aware, we announced earlier this month that after 25 years with the firm, Neil Woodford will be leaving Invesco Perpetual on April 29, next year. We appreciate very much Neil's significant contributions to our firm. He's leaving on very good terms with the company, and he has been an important part of creating this well-thought-out succession plan and is committed to helping transition the funds. We have planned for succession for many years and frankly, we've never been better positioned to manage this transition. We have a very experienced, highly tenured team that has built a world-class investment culture, strong investment performance of the team, their focus on clients and the tremendous breadth of capabilities have led to strong organic growth across our EMEA business.","So to put this in perspective, total assets under management for Invesco are $745 billion. We've seen $20 billion of net long-term flows into the business so far this year. And this represents an annualized organic growth rate of approximately 4%.","Assets under management for our EMEA business totaled nearly $165 billion. So far, through 2013, through the September quarter, net flows into EMEA, excluding equity income, are nearly $9 billion, representing annualized organic growth rate of 12%.","The U.K. equity income assets equaled roughly $48 billion at the end of the quarter, but we've seen net flows taper off over the past year, which resulted in a slightly negative organic growth. Given our assets have thoughtfully managed the transition, we're pleased to report that client reaction to departure -- to the departure of Neil has been calm, professional and highly supportive of Mark Barnett. The combined total of the 2 largest funds managed by Neil is $38 billion. For the 11 days between the announcement and today, redemptions from these funds above the historic redemption rate were less than $1.5 billion, or slightly more than 4% and let's put that into perspective just for the month of October.","For the month of October, total Invesco had net flows of $2.7 billion, which includes the redemptions that I was just speaking of. It's early days, but the redemption experience has been very much towards the positive end of the scenarios we modeled and planned for, and considerably less than what we've seen reported in the media. We find the results encouraging and we continue -- we will continue to do everything we can to deliver good outcomes for clients, retain the assets and grow our EMEA business.","As I mentioned, we believe we are very well positioned to manage through this transition. Invesco Perpetual as a deep, well-tenured team that has consistently delivered investment excellence for clients.","We've talked in the past about the investment team's phenomenal performance. In the third quarter, 98% of the assets across the business were above peers on a 5-year basis. And if you look at equally related investment performance, 87% were above peers over a 5-year period also. And 49 out of the 52 of Invesco Perpetual's managed funds achieved positive returns over the past 5 years, in spite of the financial crisis. The team has been named the Best Investment Group of the Year and of The Decade by numerous publications and organizations.","Mark Barnett, who will assume the leadership at the U.K. Equity Income funds, has a phenomenal track record. He will lead an exceptional team that has helped manage the funds over the years. We're focused now on introducing Mark to clients and sharing the very positive facts we have with clients, the media and others.","And to give you further perspective on Slide 15. It shows you the debt and breadth of our investment capabilities within Invesco Perpetual, as well as the experience and tenured team supporting those capabilities. The average industry experience for the entire team in Henley is 17 years. The average length of time with Invesco is more than 8 years. We continue to build on our highly experienced, capable and stable team to meet clients' needs. We added a multi-asset team in late 2012 that we launched its first product, Invesco Perpetual Global Target Return fund, in early September. The team takes an unconstrained, conviction-led approach to multi-asset investing, consistent with the approach taken by the Henley based funds across equities and fixed income and using Invesco Perpetual's highly experienced investment capabilities. We look at this as an important additional investment capability to the organization.","And as you'll see on Slide 16. Invesco real estate has a significant profile in EMEA, with more than $6 billion under management and 6 offices across the continent. Additionally, as the leadership for Invesco Quantitative Strategies is headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany, IQS oversees approximately $23 billion in assets under management and offers a full range of strategies. And as I mentioned earlier, investment performance for our cross-border fund range has been quite strong, with 84% of the assets ahead of peers on a 5-year basis, and you can see also, 87% of beating peers on a 3-year basis, so very strong.","Strong investment performance and efforts to bring the best of our investment capabilities to continental Europe have resulted in organic growth rate of 26% year-to-date for the cross-border fund range.","We have very strong facts to share with clients. Let's start with Mark Barnett's excellent track record and the 17 years of working alongside Neil. Mark has a truly exceptional performance record and we are extremely confident in his ability to succeed Neil as Head of the U.K. equities team. We also have a robust investment culture in Henley that is focused on delivering strong, long-term investment performance for our clients, a brand that is very well recognized.","We have a strong business in EMEA. Highly experience, talented investment teams, market leading capabilities and the resources of a global organization to support the success. We've planned for succession for many years. Our primary focus is to manage through the transition in the most thoughtful, disciplined way, with the goal of continuing to doing an excellent job for our clients and thereby ensuring long-term success.","I have every confidence in our investment team and the business to manage this succession in a very thoughtful, meaningful way, and we'll have great -- continue to have great outcomes for our clients and also for our shareholders.","So with that as background, I'd like to turn it over to Loren to go through the financials.","Loren M. Starr","Thanks very much, Marty. So quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM increased $39.9 billion or 5.7%. This was driven by positive market returns and FX of $30.8 billion and total net inflows of $9.1 billion, of which $5 billion were long term. Our average AUM for the quarter was $729.4 billion, that was up 1.3% versus the second quarter average. And our net revenue yield came in at 44.8 basis points. That's an increase of 0.9 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and this increase was a result of improved mix, one extra day for retail assets and the higher other revenues as compared to the second quarter.","Now let's turn to the operating results. Net revenues increased $26.1 million or 3.3% quarter-over-quarter, which included a positive FX impact of $4.9 million. And within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees grew by $32.8 million or 3.6% to $938 million. This increase was in line with our higher average AUM and an improvement in the effect of fee rate during the quarter. FX increased investment management fees by $6.4 million.","Our service and distribution revenues were up $5 million or 2.3%, and that was roughly in line with the increase in average AUM. FX increased service and distribution revenues by $0.5 million. Our performance fees came in at $8.5 million, a decrease of $0.5 million from Q2. Performance fees in the third quarter were driven by a variety of products and regions, and FX had no significant impact on this line item.","Our other revenues in the third quarter came in at $33.1 million, and that was an increase of $4.2 million versus the prior quarter. And this increase was driven by higher real estate transaction fees. And FX increased other revenues by about $0.1 million.","Third-party distribution service advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $15.4 million or 4.2%, and that was roughly in line with the increase in retail investment management fees. FX increase these expenses by $2.1 million.","Moving on down. You'll see that adjusted operating expense at $488.3 million increased by $8.6 million or 1.8% relative to the second quarter, and FX increased the operating expense by $1.4 million.","Employee comp at $328.3 million increased by $5.6 million or 1.7%. This increase was due to higher variable compensation, which was slightly offset by a decline in sales commissions, seasonally lower payroll and retirement costs and a full quarter's worth of staff cost reductions from the outsourcing of our European transfer agency. FX increased compensation by $0.8 million.","Marketing expense decreased by $0.8 million or 3.3% to $23.5 million. FX increased these expenses by $0.1 million. Several new product introductions had been expected in the last half of this year, spread evenly between Q3 and Q4. And this is the basis for our original guidance for marketing expenses of $27 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4.","The planned launches are on track but now are expected to occur mostly in Q4, and as a result, we would expect marketing expenses to increase in Q4 by approximately $5 million to $6 million.","Property, office and technology expense was $72.7 million in the third quarter, which was up $4.3 million. The increase was driven by a full quarter's worth of expense associated with the outsourcing of our European transfer agency and by continued investment in technology systems.","Foreign exchange increased these expenses by $0.2 million. Consistent with our guidance in Q2, we expect this line item to level off at about $74 million in Q4.","G&A expenses came in at $63.8 million, down $0.5 million or 0.8%. FX increased G&A by $0.3 million. This line item is affected by new product introductions and accordingly, we would expect to see G&A increase by approximately $2 million or so in Q4.","Continuing on the page, down the page you'll see that our nonoperating income increased $10.6 million compared to the second quarter. The increase was due to unrealized gains on certain of our real estate and private equity partnership investments, as well as a realized gain on our investment in a CLO, which liquidated during the quarter.","The firm's effective tax rate on a pre-tax adjusted net income basis in Q3 was 26.6%. Going forward, we continue to guide the effective tax rate to be around 26.5% to 27.5%.","And that brings us to our EPS. Our adjusted EPS of $0.55, and as Marty mentioned, our adjusted net operating margin of 40.2%.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Marty.","Martin L. Flanagan","Thank you, Loren. So operator, we'd like to open up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Marty, as you -- it looks like you got to your margin target a little earlier than expected. And maybe some unusual items along the way in the P&L, but really not so much from my perspective. As you look out into 2014, just given the flow dynamics that you're seeing between EMEA equities, alternatives, active, if you will, versus maybe some further attrition in the U.K. footprint. How do you see the margin dynamics playing out next year? So I guess, the root question is, is there still nice incremental margins from here?","Martin L. Flanagan","So using the framework that you laid out, so if the market continues that way, we are anticipating continued expansion in the margin. As we said in the past, we don't -- there's no reason that we don't continue to have margin expansion. And as you point out, the flows are broadening, the performance is very strong, but for a market pullback, something like that, we just don't see that we can continue on the path that we've been on.","Loren M. Starr","And Bill, this is Loren. And the only thing I would say, and Marty highlighted it on some of the slides. Some the fastest-growing parts of our business are cross-border, in EMEA, also in Asia-Pacific. And these have very high fee rates, similar to equity income fee rates. And incremental margins are excellent on those similar. So I'd say, it is certainly a reasonable expectation that our incremental margin guidance or whatever, outside of 60%, 65% is absolutely intact.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. I guess, the new news is the $1.5 billion repurchase authorization. How should we think about deployment of that, particularly where the stock is trading right now? Would you expect the share count to ratably go down? Or it's still open-ended as I see from press release, but what are your thoughts in terms of usage of that?","Loren M. Starr","The $1.5 billion certainly gives us room to run around, so to speak, on the buyback. And we're watching our relative stock price compared to competitors closely. Certainly, the stock took a fair beating in the recent last quarter, and then we're paying attention to it. We were out of the market in Q3 because of the realization that we have obviously of Mr. Woodford leaving. And so we weren't in a position to buy back stock, but we are certainly now in a position to do so. And you certainly would expect to see us, at a minimum, be back in the market at -- in a strong way.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just the last question. Just in terms of very tactically, in your G&A as you look into the first quarter of next year, some o f these launches, if you will, is that G&A level -- should that trend down a little bit or is that sort of a new starting level to which you'd grow off of?","Loren M. Starr","I think it will trend down. So there's clearly -- these product introductions got bunched up in Q4 versus Q3, Q4 which is what we originally thought. So that extra $2 million would certainly move down.","Operator","The next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So a couple of just quick questions. On Woodford, it certainly is good to hear that the outflows have been better than the press reports. But it'd just be helpful to hear about what you guys think, as far as the drawn out -- sort of 6-month time period, if he's going to stick around. Do you think that might mean that there's going to be a couple of waves of outflows? Or how do you think about that?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, it's a good question. So I'd answer it this way. As I've said a minute ago, this has been very thought-out, we think the best way to transition is to have -- through April next year, Neil will be very, very involved. And it allows Mark Barnett, who again, has been there 17 years, spectacular track record, adjust to -- work into that. And so we think, if you look at history, when do you have good transitions? You have very good transitions when the funds are performing well. You have a thoughtful succession plan with very, very capable individuals that have very good track records. And that's what's in place. And beyond, we talk about Neil, we talk about Mark, but it's very deep team that has been in place for a very long time. So we can't predict what the outflows are going to be, but what I can tell you from my experience, this is intact to be a very, very successful transition for clients.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, is the idea behind the 6-month period that it will give the team a chance, both Mark and Neil, to get around and get in front of clients and therefore make the transition easier? Since the announcement, obviously, there's been a lot of discussion around the thought process behind this transition because it seems rather unconventional to a lot of investors. So maybe if you could help us understand that, too?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So that is exactly the case. As I've said, Mark has done -- he has been part of Neil's team, worked side-by-side with Neil, know each other very well. Exact same investment philosophy, as you would imagine on a team. If you look at their portfolios, they're not wholly different as you would imagine. So the knowledge of the stocks is very, very high. And what it really is doing is just allowing investors a chance to get to know Mark some more thoroughly. And that is what we are doing.","Loren M. Starr","And the other thing I'd just say is obviously, to the extent that people felt the transition was shorter, the impetus to make a decision and move obviously becomes greater. And so time is our friend here for sure. And as people get to know the team, and they're very impressive, it is certainly our hope that we will be able to retain significant assets in this process.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Cool. And then the last one on this, and sorry to have so many questions on this, it's just been a very big topic on the mind of investors here, as you can imagine. Can you help us understand what he's going to be doing, Neil, in his new venture? Is this sort of going a different of direction strategically, or is he going to be courting sort of very similar client base as to the current fund. Can you help us maybe understand that a little, too?","Martin L. Flanagan","To your third question, the answer is I don't know. I mean, as Neil said in the press release, he does intend to salvage new business after he departs on April 29. And there've been no discussions of what his plans are. So I really don't have any insight into that.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on the flows. On the institutional side, it looked a bit weaker than maybe what we expected, and part of it was just the pipeline. You mentioned, I think $2.5 billion, that was -- and I might get this wrong, but something on leverage on one of the products. So I just wanted to understand that, maybe it was with the liquidation of the CLO, but understand that. And then just when you look at the institutional pipeline and the outlook, where is the demand? Where are you seeing some of these outflows? I'm just trying to get better gauge on the outlook because it sounds like the pipeline is still pretty healthy.","Loren M. Starr","Michael, this is Loren. I'll take that question. So there was $2.5 billion associated with a reduction of leverage in our mortgage REIT, IDR, as you would know it by the ticker symbol. And that's -- there's no fee associated with the leverage. So it is one of these passive assets that is counted in our AUM and in our flows. But it really has no -- it has 0 impact on revenues. And so if you back out the $2.5 billion, we're in positive flows and active flows and institutional, and that is coming from real estate, bank loans, as well as our IBRA capability and I think commodities capability. So we're continuing to see in the pipeline consistent strength along largely those same asset classes. And so we feel that and obviously, the leverage was noise, but you back it out, we're on a good trend.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then just on the expenses and the margin, the only area where it seems like it's been trending differently is just more on the distribution margin, if you want to look at it that way, just the revenues versus expenses. I think you hit on it. Like you just mentioned, just on the retail, it's driving some of those expenses higher. But I just want to get a sense of -- when I look at the revenue line, the expense line, even just the outlook for those 2. Just could seems like the expenses are trending a bit higher than the revenues.","Martin L. Flanagan","There is no trend of increasing distribution expenses. That does move in line with retail, AUM and there was an extra day there, so again you'll see a pickup in retail management fees, as well as those types of expenses. So that was in line and even although it looks a little bit off compared to the total management fee line item, again it's just sort of disconnect between retail and institutional. So there is no trend. We wouldn't sort of guide you that this is going to continue to increase. In fact, there'll be 1 day less in Q4. So you're not going to see -- actually no, it is a similar day. Forgive me, so it's a similar ratio of Q3, Q4 based on retail assuming that we maintain fee rates.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, just last one. On the retail side, in terms of the flows in the quarter. It seems like it came in a lot stronger given what we saw on the industry on the muni side. And then also on the IBRA product, that is moderate. I just wanted to get any granularity because the strength that we've seen on the retail side just seems -- is just better than expected. So which products are working? What's the traction that you're seeing there? I mean, you hit a lot on the U.S. distribution front. But I just want any other color there.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, and that's the point that we have been making historically and we continue to make. IBRA is a very important capability here and will continue to be. But as we always said, as investor confidence comes back, they're going to go more risk assets. And we've said, we're prepared for it. And the point I was making was just that if you -- the depths of -- the broadening of the capabilities in the retail channel that is gaining traction is very broad. And as I pointed out, literally, 18 funds had net flows over $100 million, and that compares to 6 funds 2 years ago when you do that comparison. So we just continue to get stronger in that channel and we would expect that to continue.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I think there's a lot of focus here on the loss of potential AUM and revenues from Neil Woolford. But not as much focus on the other side of the equation, expenses. I know this is very difficult kind of to talk about, but is the best way for us to sort of estimate the offset here, sort of a comp ratio basis when we think about the offsetting expense here?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. I mean, I think if you think about incremental margins, it's the best way to think about it. The 65 -- 60% to 65% is the right way to think about what is the impact on expenses. It's going to be largely managed in aggregate for the firm as a whole. It's not one particular team. And so thinking of that on a team basis is not the right way to think about the impact overall. So that's how I would guide you, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it, got it. And do you see your expectations really deviating here? It may even make sense to provide sort of comp guidance at some point next year. But just a follow-up question here. Is there any other kind of unique expense initiatives you sort of have in the plan, sort of like, the European transfer agent that you did this year?","Loren M. Starr","Craig, I mean, there are always things that we're looking at, I guess 2 off-hand that I know about. One is, I don't want to call it an expense initiative, it's more just the way we operate it. But it's our continued use of enterprise centers, which have been a real asset for Invesco. As you know, we have a 650-person group in Hyderabad, India. We just took on more space that would allow us to bring that up to close to 1,000 people. So we think that overtime, that scenario where we're going to continue to see leverage overall in terms of keeping effective and efficient operations. The other part I would mention, and we may have talked a little bit about it in the past, is just around our footprint in terms of properties. Again, if you had a clean sheet of paper where we have every single office, every single location that we have today, probably not. And ultimately, there is a need for us to continue to rationalize our location and our footprints to reflect the business today. And so that's something that you'll probably hear more from us in the near term, about how we plan to continue to manage that line item, which ultimately, if it's unmanaged, it continues to escalate. So it's certainly on our radar screen.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Loren, I saw you guys had about 50 more employees quarter-over-quarter, roughly. Was most of that India?","Loren M. Starr","No, it's fairly seasonal. There's a ramp up typically around transfer agency activities, and those numbers will go down too overtime. So I wouldn't read that as a sort of permanent headcount.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Kim of Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, just based on management commentary that we've been hearing from some other firms and some of the data we've seen across the industry more recently. It does seem like retail investors are starting to move up the risk curve, so maybe more of a mild rotation, as you put it. So just wondering, assuming that, that sort of environment persists and investors are coming back into more traditional equity strategies, where you could see the biggest step-up in flows and then also how you might be thinking about the organic growth profile of the firm, particularly versus prior cycles?","Martin L. Flanagan","That's a good question, and I think we'd all love that day when that's a challenge for us. But again, what we've said in the past is, we've all anticipated at some point, people will take on risk assets and we couldn't be more well-positioned for something like that. And again, not just in the United States but as Loren is pointing out, kind of [ph] Europe that's a big thing for us. And quite frankly, in Asia it's a very good thing for us. And you started to see that in this quarter. So it would result in just stronger outcomes for us, that's for sure. But if you're asking, so what could the organic growth rate be? It's really hard to answer the question without knowing what the environment is. But I would just come back to the facts that we keep pointing to. Broad range investment capabilities, strongly performing set of investment capabilities, available through the Americas, through EMEA and through Asia-Pacific and I think that just sets us up very well for that environment.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then, just coming back to IBRA. Any color on the relative returns, particularly versus the other risk-parity strategies? And then also, can you just give us an update or some color on flow trends for the IBRA strategies and the institutional channel and outside of the U.S., just trying to get a sense of the prospects for the overall business assuming U.S. retail net flow trends remain sort of flattish here?","Martin L. Flanagan","So I don't have the most current data on the relative performance of IBRA versus peers, but it had been really quite strong. And I would imagine it would be very difficult that, that has fallen off really much at all during that period. So that's the important thing there. There is still continued interest in IBRA institutional and that is pretty broad. I think also that we've talked about in the past, we have a team that's very strong, there are natural extensions of the team's capabilities, those are things that we are looking -- we are spending more time with clients on. And also, as I've mentioned earlier, early days, but we have just started with the Invesco professional multi-asset team with the global target return fund and all of those things are going to be -- they're -- we just think they're permanent parts of the landscape going forward. We're strong in the area and we just intend to get stronger.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, just a question on the $2.7 billion you mentioned in October, just wondering if there was anything lumpy in there with regards to institutional wins. And then also, we've been reading a fair amount in the press about what the intermediaries in the U.K. have done subsequent to the announcement. Just curious as to anymore color around feedback you've had from either consultants with a small component that is institutional and\/or those intermediaries that have sold Neil's products in the past thus far.","Loren M. Starr","Dan, maybe I'll pick up the one, the first part, then Marty, I don't know if you want to address the second one. But ultimately, it's pretty diversified in terms of where the flows are coming from. It's across Asia Pac, retails that will be local equities, sort of Asian capabilities, EMEA is strong. Real estate is a good chunk of it as well, so I'd say that's about $800 million of it. Americas continues to do very well. So it's got within the traditional PowerShares, it's definitely factoring in there, up $550 million. So it's spread over lots of different capabilities, probably not too unsimilar to -- just similar to what we did in Q3.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. I just -- I don't know if I can add much more color to the feedback of the change that I've mentioned. The feedback so far from advisors and clients is, those that know Mark, have a lot of respect for Mark. They're very aware of his very, very strong track record. And so as I said, the engagement has been very professional, very thoughtful and back to the point we made earlier, the whole idea of having a long transition is it allows those that don't know Mark and the team very well, a real good chance to understand the depths and capabilities and track record that they have. And we think that is just an important part of the plan that has been put in place.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow up on -- does the timing of the Atlanta sale is that -- in the proceeds we should assume that those should be a directly applied to a buyback upon closing?","Loren M. Starr","Dan, yes, definitely, that is our intention, for sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Curious on your comment earlier on the increasing investor confidence, many, many move into riskier assets and its impact on IBRA flows. Do you -- are you able to track what goes out and what you actually capture into your own equity funds. Obviously, equity and retail was strong performance, but can we assume that you're actively courting the third-party distributors and managing that transition, do you have any metrics that you can throw at that?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, so let me answer it this way. So it is -- the engagement with the advisor community is very broad-based and we try very hard to understand what their needs are and offer a range of capabilities to meet those needs. So it's not like the old days, 15, 20 years ago where you're sort of pushing this fund or that fund and the like. And so for a long time, we've been putting for a long time meeting last few [ph] years. The range of capabilities from IBRA through the equity capabilities and always has been the commentary that we've had with you and others and the clients is that you'll have different allocations during different times. And that's exactly what we're seeing, the numbers bear that out and that was the point I was trying to make, whether or not I did it very well. That as people get more confidence, so probably have lower allocations to IBRA right now, and increasing their allocations into things like value equity or international and that's exactly what's happening.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. And can we talk alternatives for a second? If you look at your performance slides, it's so strong across almost every product, that is one area where performance has lagged and you had some outflows. Anything you can talk to in terms of any visibility on the outflows, ebbing, what your plans are a little longer term in terms of broadening the product set there?","Loren M. Starr","So Glenn, this is Loren. So I mean, alternatives, we saw in this quarter, $1.4 billion of positive net inflows. So I think we -- we're actually seeing strength, it's in bank loans, it's in real estate. The -- what you're seeing on the performance side is misleading, so -- but it is consistent, we sense that. A lot of these capabilities don't have natural benchmarks. They're not available to peer groups, peer analysis that allows us to compare. So you're actually not seeing the true [indiscernible] relative performance of our direct real estate, for example. There is no comparable direct real estate benchmark that we can use, and that's $50 billion. So I obviously would guide you not to look closely at that. I think that particular one may be around some of our REIT capability, where there is a benchmark. But honestly, our REIT capability has been flowing strongly in this quarter and for the last several quarters. So it's certainly a conservatively positioned product relative to some of the competitors. I think that's exactly what clients have been looking for.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. And I think, Loren's speaking on this, but the one in particular, the real estate capability is just so, so strong. And again, it's this benchmark that leads you to thinking there's a problem there, and it's just quite the opposite. If you look at alternatives, generally it's about $87 billion right now within the organization. It is a growing part of our capabilities. And we're very, very focused on it, and I'd say over the next 6, 9, 12 months, you'll just continue to see greater extensions of our existing institutional capabilities into retail channels in different parts of the world. So we think we are uniquely positioned in the area.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Very, very helpful. The last quickie was -- I'm sure it's a short period of time, so I'm the answer is retail, but I just figured I'd check on the outflows that you have seen in the U.K. products. I'm assuming it's all retail at this stage?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I mean I think the U.K. is predominantly retailer-oriented in terms of the funds, there may be sort of pseudo-institutional relationships. But it's all relative to the retail products really.","Operator","The next question comes from Patrick David of Autonomous Research.","Unknown Analyst","I've heard some speculation that because of the nuances around RDR, there could actually be a financial incentive for at phase not to move their money from Woodford's fund because they'd lose their trailing commission. Could you give us an idea of how much of the AUM has significant trailing commissions attached to it in Woodford's fund?","Loren M. Starr","Patrick, I think it's a great question, it's one that I think is a bit of a difficult one to answer on this call because I think the RDR rules and how those trailers work, it's more complicated than what you just said. I think -- I'd say, first off though, from a high-level, you're correct that, that is fundamentally the right way that it will work, so if someone moves out of the existing products, they will -- they'll lose their trails. So you can decide whether that's going to be a motivation or demotivation for that to occur. I mean, most financial advisors will be doing what's right for clients, as they should. And there's a lot of regulatory requirements for them to do that. So I don't know I want to read a whole lot into that rule as to where that's helpful and not, other than I think it's a good point and one that's probably -- we'll see to what extent it actually has an impact or not. But it will be a little hard for me to speculate whether it's really going have an impact.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, understood. And then more broadly, I think a key component to the growth of your margin would be the scaling of non-QQQ PowerShares. Could you kind of help us a little bit with a better framework around what the margin experiences is for a fund, given how many newer funds you have as it moves from, say, $500 million to $1 billion AUM to $2 billion, to $3 billion, to $5 billion. How powerful is that margin expansion?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, it's powerful. So I'd say it's a major help in terms of the incremental margins. It's been helping our margin expansion, as we've seen the traditional PowerShares grow. And so the fact that we have more size and scale in our existing set of products, as opposed to a lot of new smaller products, which is the case right now, is very, very helpful. So I would expect it to continue to contribute very positively to our margin expansion story as those products are continuing to grow. The other point is certainly a lot of the products that have been growing have been at a higher fee rate. So that has also been net helpful for us as opposed to on the lower end of the scale...","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I mean, would it be fair to say that a lot of those newer products are coming from something close to 0% in accelerating to something about what your current, firm line [ph] margin is?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, when you start out with a new product, I mean, typically it's not a big moneymaker right off the bat. Probably think of it more as break even, as you said. But yes, as it goes to $500 million or so, it becomes extremely powerful in terms of incremental margins and that whole business as a whole, which has improved significantly in terms of its overall margin characteristics just in last year.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMC.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","To -- I guess, to beat a dead horse and maybe a follow-up on Craig's question. On Perpetual, how does what may or may not happen at Perpetual influence the setting of incentive awards on PCBOI? I think you and the Board set incentive awards each year and there's been a reasonable range over time, so might a change in profitability at Perpetual influence the setting of that ratio? And then Marty, how do you think about balancing the needs of employees versus demands of shareholders with regard to an incentive comp year?","Martin L. Flanagan","Right. I think the best way to answer your question is look at what we've done in the past. The facts and circumstances is what drives our actions, and we will continue to have that as the driving force. And we just -- are absolutely committed to be staying on the same path that we are and that's do great things for clients and great things for shareholders and again, I think the best way to -- I can't speculate of what's going to happen as I've been saying the whole time, but what I do know is look at what we've done in the past and we'll continue to do that and just be very thoughtful.","Loren M. Starr","Yes. Maybe, just to be more clear, I mean, Ken, under a reasonable set of scenarios and assuming -- because you mentioned you assumed some asset outflow, but it's over some period of time, it's more of a business-as-usual type of situation for us, right? So there's not a need to knee-jerk to something different, right, we can manage through it. And particularly as we're able to grow strongly in areas like cross-border in Asia and other parts of the firm, it is quite feasible that you'll continue to see -- just -- it's all going to be revenue growth, asset growth and you won't even see this, right? And then that really, obviously would be a great outcome for everybody.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, maybe just a follow-up on, I think, it was Patrick's question, in terms of RDR rules have gone to -- into effect for some of the channels but not for others. And I think in terms of platforms, the rules have not yet gone into effect there. So how big are the platforms for the U.K. business versus the other channels where RDR may have already gone into effect?","Loren M. Starr","So again, it's a very good question, a little specific -- sorry, I'm losing my voice here, but I would say platform business is a pretty big part of our business, so I don't want to minimize it. So it's probably in excess of, I don't know, 50% perhaps?","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You talked a little bit about new products driving some of the expense lift next quarter and just wondering if you guys can talk more broadly about the pace of new products, how it's compared today versus maybe the recent past and where you see the most opportunity to launch new products?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, we are probably again in sort of a unique phase on product development. Largely, as I've seen an earlier, these extensions of existing capabilities within the team really focus on the alternative area. We have strong capabilities there. We think broadly in most parts of the world, it is an important area and a growing area. So you're going to see, as Loren pointed out, through this quarter, through the first quarter of next year, probably some of those comprehensive product introductions that we've had in a very long time. And the question was asked earlier, the way we understand -- we have conviction on where the need is and where the growth is in this area. So that's where we're going and it does take -- the way that we think about is -- think that it's served 3 years before you see success broadly within any product capability. That's the typical timeframe that you would look to and every once in a while, you get something very successful before that timeframe like in IBRA and the like. But we'll be very thoughtful about it and we think we're positioning the firm very strongly to a growing opportunity.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, excellent. Maybe a few follow-up questions then also on Perpetual. I'm kind of curious to get your thoughts, you mentioned this, but it didn't -- it doesn't really sound like the business was growing and data we looked at, even back in 2012, it didn't look like Woodford's business was growing. And the performance was kind of there. So just wondering why you guys think that is and then when you get the PM changes, what's going to be the strategy to actually get Perpetual in the growth mode again?","Martin L. Flanagan","Well, I think you talking about 1 asset class and 1 category. And the equity income category is a very important one and we're very, very strong in it because of the history. It has not been a growing part of the sector of the overall industry. In fact, it's -- if you look back from '06 until -- through this past year, if you looked at that sector's -- the gross sales have dropped in half basically within the sector. That said, it's very, very important, but again, what we're trying to point to is we want to be as strong as we've ever been and we think we absolutely are with the team that we have. But no different than anywhere else in the world, you have to understand what clients' needs are and expand those capabilities and address them and the point that we were making, if you look at the depth and breadth and investment management team at Invesco Perpetual across a broad range of capabilities, they're very experienced with very, very good performance. And quite frankly, during this past quarter, the global team has had some really good, not just results, but actually flows coming into the area. So we're expecting broadening of the flows across Invesco Perpetual with -- where investor needs are and desires are against the capabilities we have. In addition, we also thought that introducing a multi-asset team with -- into Henley was very, very important because a core capability in the global total return fund is that they literally use the existing investment teams in Henley. So if you think of the asset classes that they manage with the absolutely outstanding performance and you put that in sort of the knowledge in the history of the multi-asset team, we think we are positioned ourselves very, very strongly within the United Kingdom alone, to say nothing of Continental Europe and that's why we brought that out. It is into the cross-border capability, which we think -- we're early days of where our success is there. And there are a number of those capabilities in Henley that we'll be using in different parts of the world. Whether it be the global equity capabilities and they are already, the Asian capabilities, or the multi-asset capabilities, so we're very, very excited about the prospect.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Lee of KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And I apologize upfront for going back to the topic of the day, but I'm just curious, Marty, I guess in the announcement, it's kind of hinted that, at least I took it this way, that maybe Neil thought there certain things he wanted to do in the fund business that maybe couldn't do at Perpetual or at least within the existing fund company structure. I don't know if you have any sense of where that difference kind of came up or what that may be, and then as a follow-up to that, while you've certainly prepared for this and have a transition in place and have prepared for the transition personnel-wise for a while, is this episode causing you to go back and kind of look at other teams around the world or other team managers and maybe think, rethink or approach, start to approach differently how you have them under lock and key, so to speak, or any other place just thinking maybe to make some changes?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. I appreciate the question. And I really can't -- obviously, Neil and I and others have had very broad range of conversations. I would be totally speculating on what his interest is with his new business. And again, he is very dedicated to being focused through April 29 of next year on the business at hand and that's really -- I wish I could give you more insights, I can't. Secondly, the idea -- let me answer it this way, it's an organization where we want -- when is this organization successful? When people are proud to be there, when they're excited about coming to work, when they're doing good things for clients, they enjoy the camaraderie of being with one another, and what we call the total employee value proposition. Now no question you have to get compensation right, I understand that, everybody does, we think we do. That said, it's got to be the total environment that is exciting, so the idea of even thinking that -- locking people down and the like, we just don't -- we don't want to be an organization like that. The reason why people stay is when they're proud and they can do very, very good things, and I think that's the organization that we are and we'll just continue to do that. And we do a number of things and I'll just, for example, every 3 months we do employee surveys. We've been doing them since I've come here. The employees certainly [indiscernible] obviously against history, against global financial organizations, what they call global high performers. This last one, the employee engagement was higher than the global high performers, has been for the last 3 times we've done it. The employee engagement's off the charts, we are at or higher at every single measure over the global high performers, and that's what's creating the excitement at the organization. And those are the things that matter, you have to look at it holistically, and that's what we do. But I'm glad you asked the question, it's a fair question, but that's how we look at it.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I appreciate the color. I have a easy one for Loren. I save the easy ones for Loren.","Loren M. Starr","Thank you.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I apologize if you've mentioned this earlier in the call, but could you give any guidance about what you're thinking for performance fees next quarter?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, we haven't given guidance on performance fees because it is hard. Obviously, the one thing that we can say is that you're not going to see the traditional performance fee coming from Atlantic Trust because that's now in discontinued ops. So performance fees have been good generally because performance has been excellent. And so I think, again if you look at our run rate, I mean you can probably discount it at a little bit because I'm not sure if you can -- I mean, I can't forecast it perfectly. But there's some level, $5 million-ish that probably is a reasonable amount to put in one's model for Q4.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Kelley of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask first, Loren, actually one for you, kind of easy as well, but on the distribution margin. We talked last quarter about some institutional mandates funding could help that. And I'm just wondering where we stand now with retail sales remaining high. Should we expect the current quarter to be kind of a run rate for the distribution margin or is there anything that could bring that down or actually take it up?","Loren M. Starr","I think the ratio -- I mean, again, we don't break out retail management fees from our institutional management fees. But I would say that, since we're talking about the same day count going from Q3 to Q4, they won't be this disconnect of the retail management fees being up more than institutional management fees inherently because retail management fees are based on day count and going from Q2 to Q3, there was that extra day. So that really was the big driver of the difference. So again, you just have to pay attention to the day count. But the ratio should be about the same assuming everything else is flat.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then, one for either of you guys. In terms of -- I've heard a lot about active managers potentially looking to launch actively managed ETFs recently and I know -- I think T. Rowe [ph] had put out a comment letter to the SEC about the transparency and disclosure required. I'm wondering if -- where you guys stand on that, given the PowerShares, that's kind of a unique, differentiated products set. Where do you kind of see that evolving? And if active funds are launched into the market more frequently, is that something you're going to look to participate in?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, so we've had the ability to do active ETFs for a number of years. We're one of the very few firms that had the license in place to do it. And we launched an aristocratic, [ph] but calling it to react [ph] to ETFs. It must be almost 5 years ago, now. You don't hear much about it because it's not been very successful. And so I know there's raging debate on how successful it will be and won't be. I still question the success and growth in active equity ETFs. I think it's more likely to be successful with fixed-income products. Quite frankly. And you can see some evolution where -- some movement on use of indexes and those firms that can create their own indexes and the like. So there will be some evolutions, but I -- is it the great next thing? I would be skeptical at the moment. Not to say, it won't evolve over time.","Loren M. Starr","I think most of our active equity managers would not want their portfolios disclosed daily. And so there is work that's been done to see if you can create an active ETFs without disclosing daily sort of holdings. So that's just an evolution of that. If it turns out that the rules change in some way, it's something we could certainly pursue. But right now, it's a little too conceptual to be interesting.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then one last one for me, just another product kind of question here. You had an announcement out recently on liquid alternative launches. And I'm just wondering, what areas within the liquid alts, because it's a very kind of broad description that the industry tends to use, but what areas do you think will be the strongest sellers there? And do you feel like you have everything you need here or there could be more product launches from here for you?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. I just have be careful of where we in various registrations. You can look at the registrations, I'm not trying to dodge the questions, but I'll take it back to a higher level. As I said earlier, if you look at our investment teams, they've been managing a number of alternative capabilities for a very long time. And we think there are a number of capabilities that make sense to be in a mutual fund wrapper [ph] and those people are referring [ph] to more liquid alternatives. And we think we're going to be very well-positioned in that category. And again, it's not a great secret and it's just more of the registration process than...","Loren M. Starr","Probably more to come on this in the future. And this is the best way to describe. But certainly, everything you've said is correct in terms of our interest in the opportunity.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Marc Irizarry of Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Loren, can you just give a little more color on the incremental margin targets or guidance that you put out there? What sort of organic growth expectations are sort of embedded in that or and market -- and\/or market expectations? And then also you -- how should we think about performance fees and\/or transaction fees when it comes to that incremental margin?","Loren M. Starr","Okay. Good question. So when we are thinking about incremental margins, obviously we don't manage to an incremental margin, it's more of a result of what has been flowing and what's happened with markets. And I think we've said on -- generally, when we're seeing strong market supports, FX, whatever those types of elements that are boosting our asset base, the incremental margins are at the high end of the range. So you're probably at 65% or even higher. If it's done through new product introductions and sort of organic growth, as we talked about, there's some cost associated with that. You're probably at the lower end of the range, which could be more of the 60%, even 55% to 60% range depending on what type of product it is. So again, it's a little hard to say exactly what the right guidance is. But I'd say based on everything we're seeing, we're -- let's say, market is flat, but you're seeing growth in excellent products in terms of their characteristics and margins, ETFs, cross-border, Asia, you're probably in that 65% range, right? And you probably could do that on organic growth without 60% to 65%. And then in terms of your -- I'm sorry, your second part, which is performance fees and transaction fees. Again I find it really difficult to predict these, so I do apologize. I'd like to be more clear, if I could. But again, our performance as you've seen, is pretty, pretty good. And so there is an opportunity to generate good performance fees. How much will come? The biggest providers in the past have been in the U.K. Performance is excellent there still. So that still is an opportunity possibly in Q1. But I don't want to give out a number as to what's the right number because it obviously can shift quite a bit, depending on what is happening in the marketplace. And in terms of transaction fees, also little hard to do -- to predict, but we've been seeing good growth in Europe, in Asia, in real estate and a lot of the funds that operate there do have transaction fees. So again, if we can continue to see that type of activity, I'd say the path that we're on, on the other revenues side is constructive, right? We think it's probably at similar levels, maybe a little bit lower, just to be conservative.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just getting back to Perpetual for a second. I think you've said that's probably about 50% or so, with the assets sort of platform-driven. Where are we in the cycle of you being put on watch, if you will, or on hold for many of those platforms. I mean, is this something that you expect over the coming quarters to be revisited or sort of did all of that sort of happen up front?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. Marc, I guess maybe it's obviously very fluid situation right now. And so getting into minute detail as to the number of platforms or who was saying what to whom, it's really not something I think we're wanting to go into at this point in time. I guess the good news, if there is good news generally about this, is the reaction has been one of conservatism and not to sort of knee-jerk to leave the fund and that we believe is absolutely a favorable result and gives us time to get people comfortable with clearly a big transition, which we can't underestimate and everyone you're seeing leave is obviously wanting to meet the new team. And so they're going to sort of say stay put, but let's meet the new team. So we're in that process right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greggory Warren of Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just -- again, not to beat a dead horse here. On the Invesco Perpetual thing, there's a lot of numbers floating around on AUM levels and stuff. And I know you guys touched on it a little bit this morning, noting that Neil had $38 billion in the 2 funds. What is his overall responsibility on Invesco Perpetual from a numbers perspective? And then I guess the other thing is you were just talk about being conservative and cautious, and we really appreciate that sort of attitude when you did the Invesco deal. Do you expect to be giving us some sort of update 4Q earnings on sort of where you're feeling the outflows might be or is it just something that's going to be trickling out over time?","Loren M. Starr","Greg, I'll answer and then Marty, if you want to take the other part. It's about $50 billion is the total size of assets with Neil directly named. So pretty close, I mean the 2 large funds are the predominant pieces as you might imagine. So that's the amount.","Martin L. Flanagan","The information will continue to be available, as it has in the past. And so people will be able to come to their own conclusions, and obviously each quarter if there's something material or additional that make sense to discuss, we're happy to discuss it and we will bring it up, if necessary. [indiscernible]","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. Just switching gears then. I noticed on the fixed-income side, you guys had a bit more of an outflow issue that I was expecting, given the shift in the Fixed Income markets mid- to late-September there. Was there anything responsible as more of an institutional issue during the third quarter, and I guess the question is, how are you feeling about flows this quarter and as we get through next year, given that rates are likely to go up and nobody knows when.","Loren M. Starr","So Greg, that fixed-income outflow is actually similar to the -- what we were talking about on the institutional side, which is this leverage related to this one product, the mortgage REIT. So that was $2.5 billion of outflow in fixed income, with no fee associated with it. So again, I would caution people not to read too much into that. And ultimately, fixed income continues to do very well on the active side, as we've seen positive flows in third quarter and we're continuing to see good flow in Fixed Income capability into October. So we do think active Fixed Income still has got legs and certainly we have great capabilities in that space.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I was hoping to get a little bit more color, not on Perpetual, but actually on the bank loan market. So I know that's been a strong area of flows for Invesco over the last several quarters, and so just curious what you're seeing in terms of supply in that market right now because I know there are conflicting views out there as to what extent supply maybe getting constrained and what that might mean for flows down the road?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. You're right, it's a very strong team here and they continue to do very, very well and there continues to be -- lots of client interest quite broadly in different parts of the world actually. So I wish I had more specific information. I have not had any feedback that were running into sort of capacity constraints.","Loren M. Starr","We've heard this question a few times, and so I think the topic is an interesting one. We're still not the dominant player in that market. And then so maybe others who have been seeing sort of order of magnitude differences in flows have had a greater -- more difficulty in terms of finding how to invest in our market. Our team I think is feeling very comfortable that given the flow pattern, that they have enough opportunities.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.","Martin L. Flanagan","Good. Again, Loren and I would like to thank everybody for engaging in the questions, very robust. We appreciate it very, very much, and we look forward to talking to everybody in the near future. Take care.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"12766":["Invesco Ltd.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today; Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Draper, Global Head of ETFs. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Marty Flanagan","Thanks very much and thanks everybody for joining us. And I\u2019m going to spend a couple of minutes just on the results for the quarter. Dan is actually going to spend time to give further context around the acquisition of Guggenheim\u2019s ETF business, and Loren will go into the financial review. And of course, we\u2019ll open up to Q&A.","So let me touch by hitting a few highlights for the third quarter results, which are on Page 4. Long-term performance continued to be very strong in the quarter. 67% and 75% of assets were ahead of peers on a three and five-year basis. This resulted in very strong long-term flows, $6.3 billion during the quarter. We saw this both in retail and institutional channels, and this resulted in organic growth rate of 3.4%; so all very strong during the quarter.","The adjusted operating margin was up meaningfully during the quarter. It came in at 40.7% and operating \u2013 adjusted operating income increased 10% quarter-over-quarter and up 18.5% as compared to Q3 2016.","So let\u2019s spend a few minutes on flows, and that\u2019s on Page 8. So we did see solid demand for both active and passive capabilities during the quarter. And as many of you know, we completed the acquisition of Source ETF business in August. Source has contributed to net inflows since the close of the acquisition, and it is going to continue to be a meaningful addition to our ETF business, our competitive positioning in EMEA and the greater ETF business globally.","If you take a look at the active capabilities, growth sales and net flows were the strongest since third quarter of 2016. We saw solid flows with taxable fixed income and international equities as well as alternative capabilities. Taking a look at passive, we also saw strong flows in the fixed income commodity currency and international equity. So literally, by both active and passive, we saw very broad set of capabilities being in demand by clients.","Taking a look at both retail and institutional channels during the quarter, on Slide 9, again very strong again on both channels as you will note. And as an example, this was the fifth consecutive quarter we saw net positive flows in EMEA, which were driven by nearly $3 billion of cross-border retail flows and strong institutional demand.","And given that markets continue to test new highs, demand for risk mitigating strategies remain strong, particularly among institutional investors. And the pipeline of one but not funded institutional mandates also continues to grow and remain very robust. We did see strong flows into global target of return led by institutional investors, as you would imagine. And we also saw solid flows into European equities taxable fixed income and fixed income ETFs.","So let\u2019s spend a couple of minutes putting context around the acquisition of Guggenheim Investments, and I\u2019m on Page 11, if you happen to be following. So as we have made very, very clear, we are intensely focused on helping clients achieve their investment objectives. And we built the entire firm with this notion in mind, the single focus on helping clients meet their needs.","And so as you imagine, the investments that we make in the business are designed to position us ahead of client demand. And over the past decade, we\u2019ve continued to expand the comprehensive range of capabilities, which has resulted in a very broad and deep set of active, passive and alternative strategies.","An example of this would be if you take a look at our factor investing capabilities, we have over $200 billion in factor capabilities and have 40 years of experience. It is a real strong part of the organization and continues to grow, and we expect that in the years to come.","We also have focused on enhancing our client experience. And Jemstep is an example of that, which is our digital advice platform for advisers. The demand for the Jemstep application continues to be very strong and robust. And it\u2019s really our ability to draw on our comprehensive range of capabilities to provide solutions for our clients, which really differentiates Invesco in the marketplace and positions us for long-term growth.","Turning to the Guggenheim acquisition, the ETF business from Guggenheim, it really strengthens Invesco\u2019s global ETF platform while also accelerating our growth in the quarters and years ahead.","I would like to highlight a few of the elements of that on Page 12. The acquisition will expand the depth and breadth of Invesco\u2019s traditional and smart beta ETFs and further diversifying our offering while firmly placing us as the number two smart beta provider in the United States.","We\u2019ll also provide additional scale that will strengthen our competitive position in the U.S. while enhancing our relevance in the growing ETF business marketplace globally. Lastly, the acquisition brings scale benefits that will begin from our existing platform in investments, distributions and operations, and the addition will also build upon the momentum in the ETF business to help drive further financial performance for Invesco.","With that as a backdrop, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Dan, and Dan is going to talk about our positioning and how Guggenheim\u2019s ETF business will enhance that as we go forward. Dan?","Dan Draper","Thank you, Marty. As we\u2019ve reviewed possible ETF acquisitions in the past, the Guggenheim ETF business has always stood out to us as a really complementary to Invesco, something that\u2019s been of interest to us for some time. So I think if you look at the business today and the ability to help us continue this global growth that Marty\u2019s talked about, the current franchise with Guggenheim\u2019s ETF business is about $37.3 billion in assets under management. About 60% of that crucially for us is in the smart beta product suite, which I\u2019ll go through in some more detail in a couple of further slides.","Overall, they have 79 ETFs on the platform and their top five flagship products will help about half of those assets. If you look across their ability to help us, as Marty mentioned, really to continue to build out our solutions capability. This acquisition brings us multi-asset class ETF capability across equities, fixed income and alternatives. Also looking at kind of pricing and margin, very much in line with \u2013 especially in the smart beta space.","If you look at the performance of the products, very strong performance. Around three quarters of their ETFs have Morningstar ratings of 3 or higher. And then I think also you just look at a very strong organic track record on the platform seeing the compound annual growth rate of 26.5% over the past five years. And also, we continue to currently see good flows. We had net inflows across the platform since we announced the transaction a few weeks ago.","If you\u2019re following on the presentation, moving to Slide 14, this is really where the addition and I\u2019ll get into some of the additional products where a lot of the synergies come in. So if you look at Invesco\u2019s global ETF platform, with a high focus we have on smart beta and factor investing, this is really where Guggenheim has had one of the flagship ETF products in smart beta for a number of years, and that\u2019s the S&P 500 Equal Weight. So again, this will give us a leadership position in that category.","Equal Weight is one of the simplest but, quite openly, one of the most effective smart beta strategies. And we\u2019ve been very interested in getting this S&P 500 Equal Weight exposure really for quite some time, but additional licenses were not available, therefore, this is going to be, we think, very, very complementary.","Alongside equal weighting, we are also going to have the pure style ETFs, which again very complementary to our factor capabilities. And then we think in fixed income where today PowerShares offers the third most fixed income ETFs in the industry, the BulletShares is extremely important to us. These are defined maturity products, and they also are able to utilize self-indexing.","And we want to continue that, but also leadership positions where we\u2019ve been first to market in fixed income areas like senior bank loan and others. We believe this is going to be extremely powerful and allow the ETF business at Invesco to partner even closer to Invesco\u2019s fixed income team. Also, you have additional leading CurrencyShares product that are listed there.","If we move ahead to Slide 15, again, we feel that this acquisition is going to be very, very strong for us to leverage at Invesco. Particularly a number of key factors that we think where we can actually help accelerate the already fast growth of the Guggenheim ETF franchise, notably looking at our distribution capabilities really around the world that Invesco is able to offer.","Also, Marty had mentioned the solutions capability, which is one of Invesco\u2019s biggest organic growth focuses at the moment, our ability to bring additional capabilities, customized solutions, particularly in the form of model portfolios, we really feel like these Guggenheim products will fit in very well there.","Also, Invesco\u2019s very well-known consulting business, the ability to educate clients again around asset allocation and the utilization of important vehicles like ETFs. And increasingly, as we have more of those clients really looking to access our solutions digitally, this is where again we see a lot of potential synergies through these new ETFs through our Jemstep platform.","Overall, we continue to see the very strong secular growth in fixed income ETFs. We believe that many investors who previously didn\u2019t really look at ETFs, particularly in some institutional segments, are really starting to see the benefit of the wrap [ph], or the ability to have a single ticker, a single icing solution for rebalancing a portfolio with individual bonds. And in particular, we think again having the maturity defined, our BulletShares line up to be much, much better for us to be able to engage with those types of clients.","Also looking at the ability to manage the total cost of an ETF, we believe bringing our world-class capabilities and capital markets, working with a lot of sell-side firms, but again we\u2019re going to be able to bring that value through the acquisition. And overall, if you just look at the four years of factor experience that Invesco\u2019s built, and then also the 15 years of experience, particularly in smart beta ETFs, again we see this as extremely complementary in terms of the acquisition.","Looking ahead to Slide 16, I just wanted to emphasize here. We continue to talk about the real importance of first mover advantage in the ETF space. And here\u2019s just a quick lineup of really where the PowerShares business has been of the pioneer in getting first to market across some really important categories, including our senior bank loan ETF, looking at low volatility, bringing the FTSE RAFI range into market over a decade ago, sovereign debt, looking at high-dividend, low-volatility alternative areas like commodities, looking at innovations like variable-rate preferred, and et cetera.","So I think for us to have this strong track record and layering in a lot of the pioneering ETFs such as the S&P 500 Equal Weight from Guggenheim, I think it just demonstrates I think the type of innovation that we\u2019ve built and really what now Guggenheim is going to add even more to that. I think more demonstration is showing the $25 billion of net assets that we\u2019ve actually raised from new products since 2011, which is the third highest in the industry. So I think the ability for us to continue to build going forward and really add innovation to clients is going to be a crucial synergy in this ETF.","We also continue to believe that the barriers to entry, while they may be low, we do think the barriers to success remain very, very high. Having first mover advantage, having legacy, having track record as well as a very strong brand, we believe are absolutely crucial to investors. And as I point out on Slide 17, you can see that since 2010 or I should say 98% of the U.S. ETF industry\u2019s AUM does belong to issuers who entered the market in 2010 or before.","On a comparable metric, 96% of industry flows over the past 12 months also have gone to issuers who\u2019ve been in the market since at least 2010. And then as we go to our targeted segment area, which is smart beta, you see a very, very similar story where 94% of the smart beta ETF AUM again belongs to issuers with track records in 2010 or prior and again net flows of 74% over the same time period.","And as you move to Slide 18, I think it really shows again our core focus around smart beta and factors, and this acquisition is going to help us increase \u2013 incrementally increase our market position there by 46% and can actually \u2013 puts us just under 20% of market share in smart beta. But importantly, having the largest number of products in that category with the longest track record of being able to offer again multi-asset class solutions, equities, fixed income alternatives, 70% of those ETFs having more than a five years worth of track record that we believe positions very well for growth in this really fast-moving smart beta segment.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Loren Starr who\u2019s going to highlight the operating results for the quarter. Loren?","Loren Starr","Thank you very much, Dan. So quarter-over-quarter, you\u2019ll see that our total AUM increased 59.2 billion or 6.9% and that was driven by the acquisition of Source ETF, which added 26 billion, including approximately 18 billion of Source-managed AUM and 8 billion of externally managed AUM.","We also benefited from market gains of 15 billion. We had long-term net inflows of 6.3 billion, positive FX translation of 6.7 billion and inflows into our money markets capability of 5.4 billion. And these factors were somewhat offset by a small outflow from the QQQs of 0.2 billion.","Average AUM for the third quarter was 890.8 billion, up 4.9% versus the second quarter. And our annualized long-term organic growth rate in Q3 came in at 3.4% compared to negative 0.3 in the second quarter.","Before turning to net revenue yield, I just wanted to highlight one quick update on a change this quarter and how our long-term inflows are being reported. In previous periods, any dividends or capital gains that were reinvested in the funds were included in market gains and losses line item.","So beginning in the third quarter and for future periods, these flows will now be included within our long-term inflows to conform Invesco\u2019s flow reporting with general industry practices. As you also note from the footnote on Slide 20, the amount included in the long-term inflows related to this particular item was 1.1 billion.","So let\u2019s now next turn to the net revenue yield analysis. You\u2019ll see that our net revenue yield came in at 43.9 basis points and our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, was 41.9 basis points. That was an increase of 0.1 basis points over the second quarter.","Now looking at what the causes were, we had sold one additional day in Q3 that added 0.4 basis points and we also saw the positive impact of FX and mix added 0.2 basis points. So these positive factors are within somewhat offset by the dilutive impact of the Source ETF business, as we discussed in last quarter, which reduced our yield by 0.4 basis points. And we also saw a decrease in other revenues which reduced the yield by 0.1 basis points.","So next on Slide 21 is our U.S. GAAP presentation. My comments today, however, are going to focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP presentation adjusted measures, which are found on Slide 22. Net revenues increased by 70.3 million or 7.8% quarter-over-quarter to 976.6 million, which included a positive FX rate impact of 13.4 million.","Within that net revenue number, you\u2019ll see that our adjusted investment management fees decreased by 54 million or 5.3% to 1.08 billion, and that reflects our average \u2013 higher average AUM, an additional day during Q3 as well as incremental management fees from the acquisition of Source. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted investment management fees by 16.2 million.","Adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by 6.3 million or 3%, reflecting higher average AUM in the quarter and FX increased our adjusted service and distribution revenues by 0.5 million.","Our adjusted performance fees came in at a much higher level, obviously, 43.3 million in Q3. And they were earned by a variety of investment capabilities, but most notably 37 million from Invesco\u2019s mortgage recovery fund. Our FX increased adjusted performance fees by 0.2 million in the quarter.","The adjusted other revenues in the third quarter were 16.7 million and that was a decrease of 0.6 million from the prior quarter. FX impact on adjusted other revenues was 0.2 million positive.","And next, third-party distribution service and advisory expense which we net against gross revenues, that increased by 14.7 million or 4% and that\u2019s consistent with increased revenues derived from the related retail AUM and the additional day in the quarter. FX increased our adjusted third-party distribution service and advisory expenses by 3.7 million.","Now let\u2019s move to expenses. As you move down the slide, you\u2019ll see that adjusted operating expenses at 579.2 million increased 29.4 million or 5.3% relative to Q2. FX increased our adjusted operating expenses by 7.3 million during the quarter.","The adjusted employee compensation came in at 383.9 million. That was an increase of 23.3 million or 6.5%. And this was driven by higher variable compensation, primarily related to performance fees and as well a 5.5 million non-cash charge related to the company\u2019s UK defined-benefit plan. FX increased adjusted employee compensation by 5 million.","The adjusted marketing expenses in Q3 increased slightly by 0.4 million, 1.3% up to 30.1 million in line with the guidance that we provided last quarter. FX increased our adjusted marketing expense by 0.5 million.","The adjusted property, office and tech expenses came in at 93.7 million. That was an increase of 5 million or 5.6% over the second quarter and this reflected increased depreciation cost on long-term technology projects that were recently brought into service. FX increased the adjusted property, office and tech expenses by 0.9 million.","Next on to G&A, the adjusted G&A expense came in at 71.5 million. That was an increase of 0.7 million or 1% up, in line with the guidance that we provided last quarter. FX increased G&A by 0.9 million.","And then going on down the page, you\u2019ll see that our adjusted non-operating income increased 1.5 million compared to Q2 and that was driven by increases in earnings from our real estate investments that was somewhat offset by lower earnings from our private equity investment.","And then moving to tax, the tax rate, effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income in Q3 came in at 27.6%, a little bit higher than guidance. We do believe going forward that our tax rate should drop to again roughly 27%. That brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.71 and adjusted net operating margin of 40.7%.","So let me just quickly touch on business optimization. This is an ongoing multiyear kind of effort. As you\u2019ve heard, given the opportunity on a number of initiatives, including those around outsourcing or back office functions, we expect the optimization work to actually exceed our original target for run rate savings.","We\u2019ve achieved the run rate savings in Q3 of 38 million and we expect to deliver an additional savings by the end of 2018 of a total run rate savings of about 65 million, which is up.","And then finally, because I know we\u2019ll get questions, we\u2019ll just address it. Quarter-to-date, net flows through October roughly flat. We do continue to see very strong net inflows from Europe as well as from Asia Pacific.","These were somewhat offset by outflows in the U.S. on the institutional side, largely quant, as well as some sub-advised U.S. retail early days, October we are obviously feeling very good about the flow picture. Marty had mentioned the robust pipeline. So again, we think the trend is going to continue.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Marty.","Marty Flanagan","Operator, so we\u2019ll open up to Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Mr. Brennan Hawken from UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Brennan Hawken","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Wondering if you could maybe comment on an updated view on the impact, base it [ph] given the adjustment in applying via for the RPAs. And I know it\u2019s really, really short notice, but we did get a no action letter out of the SEC this morning. Do you have any early reads on that and what kind of relief that might apply?","Marty Flanagan","This is Marty. I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and Loren can chime in. So it clearly is a moving target at the moment. We know where the end state is going to be. So from our perspective in Europe, the financial impact would be very manageable. The U.S., the early read is it looks like it\u2019s contained a MiFID topic to Europe, but that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a 30-month review so we\u2019ll have to see what happens there. But I take it back to a bigger topic. I mean it is an industry topic. I do think that the notion of paying attention to impact on capital markets has been missed in Europe. This will have a negative impact clearly on liquidity around small cap stocks, mid cap stocks, which is not a good thing. So hopefully, the U.S. will think of capital market impact and capital formation around this topic. And I\u2019d also say what it does is firms like us, we\u2019re financially very strong. We have 700 analysts throughout the world. We have every resource necessary to ensure that our analysts have everything they need. It will continue to put firms like us in a competitive advantage to smaller firms. It\u2019s just a real challenge, the onslaught of ongoing regulatory costs and cyber costs, et cetera, et cetera, on smaller firms. So as this evolves, again firms like us will just end up in a competitively stronger position. Loren?","Loren Starr","Yes. In terms of quantifying, I think it\u2019s a very much moving target in terms of what the impact is. I think we\u2019ve sort of indicated it was not material, maybe tens of millions kind of without negotiations really taking place around the pricing. All that is sort of happening as we speak and therefore you\u2019ll have a clear view as we sort of get into 2018. But I do think even as we get through 2018, it\u2019s going to be a moving target because there is no expectation of setting sort of one price in the last \u2013 it\u2019s locked in. I think it\u2019s going to be an evolving topic over time.","Brennan Hawken","Sure. That\u2019s all very fair. And then for follow-up, you made reference to the fact that this is going to of course disadvantage some of the smaller firms in Europe. I guess, do you think that\u2019s going to lead to opportunities for acquisitions as you see some of the smaller firms come under more and more pressure? And also more broadly, after \u2013 now that you\u2019ve completed two smart beta ETF deals, should we assume that you would have continued appetite in that space, or do you feel as though you\u2019re satiated at this point? Thanks.","Marty Flanagan","I think I\u2019d answer the question this way. Our strategy continues to be no different than in the past. And our first effort organically \u2013 is to focus organically in organic investments. And we would then approach inorganically when we see an opportunity or a gap somewhere in the lineup. We see very few gaps within the organization right now regardless of investment capability or some of these platforms. The last two ETF acquisitions really put us in a very, very strong spot in the ETF market. And in particular, the factor and smart beta where we think there is the greatest value for clients at the end of the day. Look, we all have been talking about the impact of the changing dynamic. It is just the fact that if you are a smaller money manager anywhere in the world, you have pressures that are at a level that you\u2019ve never seen before and common sense would lead you to believe that there should be more combinations. They continue to be complicated to do because the fiduciary nature of the businesses and the people that are involved, et cetera, et cetera. So there will be more. The pace has probably been slower than what people have thought. But you could also see quite frankly organic growth for the more competitive firms pick up at the expense of smaller firms, quite frankly.","Brennan Hawken","That\u2019s fair and helpful color. Thanks, Marty.","Marty Flanagan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Bill Katz from Citigroup. Sir, your line is open. You may begin.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thanks very much. I did join a few minutes late. It\u2019s been a busy morning, so I apologize if this is redundant. Loren, I was wondering if you could tie together your commentary that you\u2019re running a little bit ahead on the optimization with the pro forma impact of the margin contribution from Guggenheim investment spend MiFID and all that. How are you sort of thinking about the incremental margin both for '18 and '19 versus where we were at this time last quarter?","Loren Starr","Good question, Bill. So we certainly had indicated on the last call that the Guggenheim impact itself was probably going to add 10 percentage points to our incremental margin. That\u2019s a very positive thing to the original guidance that we provided, which was in that 40% to 50% range. We\u2019ve also benefited from stronger markets, which has been helpful. Foreign exchange has generally been a positive impact as well. The MiFID II quantification, as I mentioned, is a moving target. And so at this point, I think we\u2019d be hesitant to sort of give real numbers around that. If we gave you the worst case, it would be probably a reasonable offset to some of the good things we were just talking about. We\u2019re hopeful that\u2019s not going to be that case. So our thought is that we\u2019d be in a better position as we get into year-end and maybe the next call or the one after that to provide much more solid guidance around incremental margins. But I\u2019d say the overall trend to incremental margin has been more positive than negative for sure relative to that original guidance.","Bill Katz","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a little surprised by your flow commentary for the quarter. Could you maybe peel that back a little bit and talk a little bit about maybe active versus passive and maybe go around the regions in a little more depth? Some of your peers are seeing a little more robustness and just given your product mix and your repositioning, I would have thought you\u2019d be a little bit better, all else being equal. So where are you seeing the weakness versus some of the strength?","Loren Starr","You\u2019re talking about October, right?","Bill Katz","Correct. I thought I heard flat quarter-to-date.","Loren Starr","Okay, it\u2019s a partial month. So again, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into and I was hesitant to even talk about it. But I knew if I didn\u2019t, people would misread it. We\u2019ve actually seen very good strength into Europe. I think about 1.2 billion of flows just coming into EMEA on a long-term basis. We\u2019ve also seen very solid long-term flows into Asia Pac. So again, where is it coming in Europe, it\u2019s the same elements that have been flowing before well across a wide range Pan-European equity, corporate bond, GTR, all very, very helpful. Institutional pipeline in Europe is the highest it\u2019s been I think ever. And so they\u2019ve had really great success. And so we think that is an accelerating positive thing. Asia again had a little bit of a slow down as we mentioned earlier, but they seem to be sort of recovering from that into the third quarter. The U.S. in particular, we\u2019re just a little bit lumpy. So I talked about sub-advised. So there was one sub-advised termination that was kind of lumpy as one sub-advised client went to index, as we\u2019ve seen that happen a few times. So that\u2019s sort of episodic, not a trend, I would say. And then quant, we\u2019ve seen some outflow on quant in the U.S. but that\u2019s been offset by quant inflows elsewhere. So again, I think it\u2019s really just too soon a timeframe to really draw a conclusion about anything. And so as I said, we\u2019re pretty optimistic about the flow picture into Q4.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good morning.","Marty Flanagan","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","You guys have completed two acquisitions in a pretty short period of time. I\u2019m just wondering, are you still looking at building scale in the ETF space via M&A? And are there other capabilities you\u2019d like to add, maybe in the technology or alternative space?","Marty Flanagan","As I just mentioned a minute ago, we feel that the combination of both Source and Guggenheim put us in a very, very strong spot and we don\u2019t see many gaps. And as Dan talked about, if you look at the number of ETFs that we have and really important the long-term track record really position us quite uniquely. And so the platform is very strong, very robust. And our ability to product development off that in response to client needs is very strong, and it does go back to this heritage of 40 years of factor capability and applying that to some of the work that Dan and the team does in product development. So we don\u2019t see much of a need to continue to participate in that market. If something obvious comes up, we pay attention as we always do, but it doesn\u2019t seem likely from that perspective. I did mention around technology like earlier. Jemstep continues to be \u2013 the demand for the Jemstep product is very, very strong. We will start to see probably impact from the middle of next year because they\u2019re long-duration installations as all applications are. It will be very, very supportive of our solutions business, our model business. And as I\u2019ve said, right now, we would estimate that latter part of next year, we\u2019ll probably be working with 20,000 financial advisers in the United States that we have not before. So that\u2019s the early indication of what\u2019s possible in time. And we continue to invest strongly in technology, things like predictive analytics and big data for our research teams, et cetera, et cetera. So we look at that as more continued evolution of use of technology than anything else. Its core to what we do and we\u2019ll continue to do that. Can I just add Dan? Would you add anything to that?","Dan Draper","No, Marty. I think that\u2019s absolutely right.","Marty Flanagan","Okay.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks, Marty. And then just as a follow up on pricing, there really hasn\u2019t been much fee pressure across your business as you look at the fee rate this year. And I think a lot of us were concerned that it could be a difficult year for fees, given the DOL rule. How do you think about product pricing? When would you consider reducing pricing? And have you been tweaking breakpoints to some of your products over the last year?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. Look, it all starts by why is there not pressure because we\u2019re priced fairly. And I think that\u2019s really the way to think about it. If you are delivering the results that you would expect at a competitive rate, you\u2019re going to do well. And I think the way to think about it is just sort of imagine a continuum of investment capabilities and at one end, you have cap-weighted indexes. You don\u2019t get very much formed. They\u2019re an important tool in the toolbox, but you don\u2019t pay much. By definition, there\u2019s no alpha generation. If you go to actives, you\u2019re going to expect more alpha in outperformance. The fees will follow that and they would be higher than that end. In between the two would be factor and at the highest in alternatives. And so it makes sense that the more alpha you expect, the more you would be willing to pay a fair fee and that\u2019s how we think about pricing as an institution. And I think it resonates with clients. But it is just clarity of what clients are trying to expect and any firm\u2019s ability to meet that performance result over a market cycle, which is very important.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thank you, guys. Thanks, Marty.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","Glenn Schorr","Thanks. ","Marty Flanagan","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Hello. A further question on the Guggenheim side. So I get and like the BulletShares, the pure style of the current ETFs and a lot of those products. And it\u2019s just a question on pricing on the Equal Weight side. Plenty of people that feel like it\u2019s not a race to actually zero, but that there\u2019s constant price pressure on that side. So I\u2019m just curious on how you get comfortable with the recent price adjustment as the right price for now. And I\u2019ll ask a follow-up, if I could.","Marty Flanagan","Dan, you want to take that?","Dan Draper","Yes, sure. Just to state upfront that obviously the two businesses as they\u2019re under regulatory review continue to operate separately. So kind of any pricing discussion adjustment on the Guggenheim side, that\u2019s really done by \u2013 there\u2019s executives in their fund board. So we\u2019re not involved in that at this stage. But that said, if you look since the price adjustment was made in our SP, which is that ETF you mentioned, there has been a positive response in net inflows into the product. But I\u2019d say overall, if you\u2019re thinking about \u201cpricing,\u201d we feel very strongly that you have to think about pricing in a broader context. Number one, outside of pricing is performance. Particularly more sophisticated, if you will, institutionalize clients always start with performance. And while indexes or ETFs may sound similar, quite openly, the actual difference is that in index construction methodology, rebalancing can lead to substantial differences. So as we always do with clients, we start with performance first. Secondly then when you get to cost, there are a couple of different areas of cost. First, move really to the entry and exit cost of an ETF i.e. liquidity and being able to work with our sell-side partners to make sure there\u2019s a lot of liquidity. And I think that\u2019s where the first mover advantage, the scale, everything we\u2019ve emphasized is crucial because you really \u2013 it take time to build the ecosystem. And as the AUM grows, the liquidity becomes really enhanced. When I think third, the other area of cost is obviously the annual management fee. And I think this is where \u2013 not just within ETFs but across Invesco, we\u2019re very diligent, always monitoring trends and making adjustments where possible. So I think looking at in total, that\u2019s where the ability for us with especially those clients who look at asset allocation, look at solution, those diversification benefits we have in the products around performance and risk, this is where we\u2019re excited. And then I think we also feel we\u2019re going to bring a little bit of enhancement we hope around capital markets and the liquidity, and then clearly we\u2019ll continue to monitor pricing. But right now we think we\u2019re in a good place and we\u2019re obviously excited, especially with the adjustment in the Equal Weight S&P 500 to really see a positive response from clients thus far.","Glenn Schorr","I appreciate that. Another quickie on the equity side, it could be a super short timeframe, but if I did the math right, it feels like equities might have flipped back into inflows in September for the first time in a long time. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the great performance at equity income. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something we can count on, but curious your thoughts on the equity side.","Loren Starr","Glenn, I think you\u2019re probably picking up something that we are seeing, which is certainly a continued interest in a fair amount of our equity. If you\u2019re talking about in the U.S., it\u2019s probably going to be more on the PowerShares side than necessarily our value capability. And then in Europe, absolutely the case and we\u2019re also seeing that in Asia as well. So I think the interest in equity seem a little bit stronger globally and perhaps most in terms of the active most strong outside the U.S.","Marty Flanagan","Glenn, I would just add. You\u2019re hitting on a specific topic, but there\u2019s something broader here. So it has been a very unique period of time since 2009, and we feel very strongly that this is a very important role for active investment management. Clients cannot hit the return objectives and manage their risk without the use of active, and it\u2019s really a combination of passive, active and alternative. That\u2019s how you create the best portfolios in these markets when it starts to turn like that, hopefully people will pay attention to it.","Glenn Schorr","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, guys. Good morning. When I look at Asia and Europe, you pretty consistently have had healthy growth in those markets. In the U.S. obviously, it\u2019s been more challenging. When I look out over the next couple of years given what you\u2019re doing on the ETF side, on the technology side, it seems like the retail part of the market you should have more momentum. So I just wanted to kind of get your take on how much can that offset some of the core industry pressures that we\u2019re seeing going from active to passive. And then in the institutional side, it seems like it\u2019s still been healthy, a little bit spotty from time to time but just where you\u2019re seeing demand from the U.S. institutions across the product offering?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. So, look, the U.S. is probably \u2013 market is probably going through the most changes in the retail market in particular. As providers are changing how they\u2019re reforming their businesses, it is a period of change. I think the important thing is the assets to manage are not going to go away. And so it\u2019s a transition period. And it is those firms, we believe we\u2019re one, that have the broad range of capabilities, good performing products and this range of active-passive alternatives, those are the winners. And so we think we are positioned very, very well. What are some of the headwinds that Loren has talked about? So UITs and some of the movements with the insurance company and the sub-advised, those are headwinds in, what do you want to call it, the intermediate term. But we look out in the next year and a half or so, some very strong things are heading our way. And again, we\u2019ve been talking about them. The solutions capability is real. It\u2019s meaningful for us. We\u2019re uniquely placed to be able to do that. Jemstep is an important tool for our distribution partners, is a very important tool along the way. And as Loren started to mention, the institutional capability region by region is probably as strong as it\u2019s ever been and that would include the U.S. The U.S. is probably behind Asia and Europe in its development for us. We feel very good about the team there. And the same thing we\u2019re seeing in one but not funded is growing quite materially. So we look at the U.S. as a very important part of our business and the opportunities are material, and we think we\u2019re managing to where we see the client needs are.","Loren Starr","Yes. And in terms of the U.S. clients, I think it\u2019s around the normal things we\u2019ve seen in the past. Real estate would be a big continued draw. We certainly see continued interest in some of our fixed income capabilities including stable value, multi-asset capabilities as well and then increasingly GTR-type offering has been of interest. So it\u2019s certainly a third \u2013 at least a minimum, a third of our pipeline is coming from the U.S. and the rest from Europe and Asia.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then just \u2013 Loren, just a quick follow up on the P&L. So just anything \u2013 it seemed like the expense lines were fairly normal, ex-comp because of performance fees and then just the performance fee outlook. I guess just given which products have performance fees and given how strong the backdrop\u2019s been, any indication just going forward in terms of what to expect or any nuances whether it\u2019s fourth quarter or going into '18.","Loren Starr","Mike, you know how good I am at forecasting performance fees. So yes, I think the performance has been quite good on the alternative side. The idea that we may continue to see some good performance fees into 2018 is something we would certainly support and offer up. In terms of the actual guidance and when they hit, very, very hard for us to really nail that down. I think obviously this one very large performance fee coming from the mortgage recovery fund I\u2019d say is a little bit unique and unusual and isn\u2019t something that I would necessarily say is going to happen again with certainty into 2018. But real estate bank loans continue to offer performance fees, as does some of the private equity offerings that we have as well. So I think the level of performance fees maybe ex what we\u2019ve seen in this particular mortgage recovery is certainly something you should build into the thinking for next year. And into Q4, again, I just don\u2019t have a line of sight that I can offer with great certainty other than sort of \u2013 I think we said 5 million to 7 million is kind of the guidance. And I know it\u2019s not helpful, but that\u2019s what I would offer again for Q4.","Marty Flanagan","And I just might come back to your bigger questions and put in context of beyond a quarter. If you go back \u2013 as a firm, we\u2019ve been in net inflows since 2009 in total. And if you look at the strength of the organization by \u2013 if you look at flows by region, it has always rotated. 2009 UK was a leader; '10, '11, '12, the U.S. was the leader; '14, '15 Europe was; last year, Asia; back to Europe. It\u2019s a fundamental strength of the firm and you\u2019re starting to see it now with the organic growth rate above 3. And again if the market sort of \u2013 without a shock to the market, we anticipate \u2013 we see it growing and so you\u2019re seeing evidence of it this quarter.","Michael Carrier","That\u2019s helpful. All right, thanks a lot.","Marty Flanagan","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.","Ken Worthington","Hi. Good morning. My question\u2019s on ETF distribution. So can you talk about your expectations for how ETF distribution evolves and maybe how access to ETF distribution evolves, particularly in the U.S. and Europe? It\u2019s been sort of interesting to see Vanguard eliminated from a number of platforms, based seemly due to its unwillingness to pay platform fees. So talk about the evolution of payment for shelf space in ETFs, either directly or indirectly in the context of DOL rules, RDR, MiFID, so a lot of rule changes. And is there any extent to which having an active platform really helps secure or maybe even subsidizes distribution for ETFs. Thanks.","Marty Flanagan","Let me take the last part of the question and then maybe Dan can pick up and Loren. So our basic view has not changed, right? We really believe strongly what are clients looking for and think of intermediary clients, whether it be a distribution platform or a consultant or a large institution around the world. A firm that has a depth of capabilities is much more attractive to those firms because it\u2019s easier to work with firms that way and the more you can get from firms like ourselves, whether it be thought leadership or a client experience that\u2019s differentiated. And so where that takes you is there\u2019s no question in my mind that as the business evolves, those firms that have a range of active, passive and alternatives are uniquely placed, and it does reinforce the ongoing success \u2013 distribution success of an organization. But Dan, do you want to pick up on your thoughts maybe on the ETF revolving landscape distribution?","Dan Draper","Yes. Thank you very much, Marty. I think it\u2019s a great question. Let me just start from the top. I think if you look at kind of global regulations whether it\u2019s DOL, MiFID II in Europe, you previously had retail distribution review in the UK, I think all of those have clearly been net positives for ETFs for different reasons. As you look at distribution, I think it\u2019s really important to kind of separate out the U.S. market from, say, Europe and EMEA. In particular, the U.S. is heavily and always has been dominated by the wealth management intermediary space, particularly areas like RIAs. But what we\u2019ve now seen is with DOL in particular in the U.S., the stronger focus by many segments like the Wirehouses, for example, as the focus on more advisory accounts, fee-based moving there, and I think that\u2019s where Invesco\u2019s long-standing strength covering those clients, those home offices and having access, I think the ability to educate, position our products in those areas as more advisory business grows, not just wires but IBDs and other areas that we see. That\u2019s a huge advantage to be able to leverage those long-term relationships. I think overall in the U.S, we continue to see, as Marty said, the portfolio of model builders and others in this new fee-based world really focused on combining the best of active, passive and alternatives. So there\u2019s a huge amount to leverage and I think that we\u2019re obviously in the midst of adapting and working on that way at Invesco. If you move to Europe, Europe is very different. Europe, I would estimate probably has over 80% of the current demand for ETFs in institutional space. Now by definition, we would include discretionary portfolios to private banks in that institutional definition, but that\u2019s why scale is absolutely crucial in Europe. You have yet to see broad-based retail demand emerge for ETFs in Europe. I think MiFID II, quite clearly, with a lot of the focus on transparency of fees, but particularly for ETFs. ETFs were actually omitted from the original MiFID. By including ETFs, this is actually a big advantage. You\u2019re actually going to have \u2013 the requirement now for market makers to have pre and post-trade reporting, for example, of ETFs. So a lot more transparency around the liquidity, which is an important building block step to eventually getting bigger retail demand in Europe. So we think that\u2019s positive, but I think that\u2019s where the crucial step for us to buy Source to really get the bigger platform, because these bigger institutional investors in Europe, they have concentration limits normally. They need to have bigger ETFs, bigger platform, bigger scale before they can engage with the provider. So hopefully that helps with that overview.","Ken Worthington","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","Alex Blostein","Great. Hi. Good morning, everybody. Marty, question for you guys around Jemstep. It seems like it remains a pretty big source of investments for you guys. You increased headcount there substantially, and Guggenheim I guess is supposed to further kind of enhance growth profile there. Can you help us better understand and really kind of track the progress you guys are making in that platform? I heard you say earlier 20,000 FAs and that\u2019s obviously a lot of access but anything with respect to assets that those FAs have that could come onto the platform, what percentage of those you hope to get Invesco product in and where that could go sort of over time, and when the platform is ultimately supposed to break profitability? It seems like an important element here without a ton of color yet.","Marty Flanagan","We\u2019ve not colored it yet on purpose. So as we\u2019re moving through this from the standpoint of \u2013 again, the demand is very high. We are taking on clients. We, as an organization, do a much better job of telling you what the answers are as opposed to predicting, but here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. So you\u2019re seeing a pipeline that is growing and very strong and the challenge is the lead time. It\u2019s application install. So I think six months to nine months for a large institution, that\u2019s the tail. So you have to invest to get \u2013 to have the application come on line. It is open platform and can use a range of capabilities, ETFs for mutual funds. So it is a very attractive part of a digital strategy for a number of firms. And secondarily, it will be default models in those portfolios. And our \u2013 what we are seeing is more likely than not if you think of the relative market share of a firm like Invesco\u2019s model that a existing platform versus what could happen out of Jemstep, you could see materially different asset levels or market share of models on those portfolios. So we are anticipating an Investor Day first part of next year that we will give a much deeper communication of the strategy and where we are.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Thanks for that. And then just wondering if you guys could give a bit of an update on GTR and sort of where things stand there? Obviously it\u2019s been a big growth initiative that could drive outflows for you guys outside the U.S. I think in the U.S., things have been a little bit slower. I think the product has a three-year track record right now, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been a big contributor to flows just yet. So maybe just speak to the reception and different channels to the product, what\u2019s sort of been the hurdles and what do you guys need to see to accelerate growth of GTR in the U.S.? Thanks.","Loren Starr","Yes, we\u2019ve seen GTR really grow much more rapidly outside the U.S. than in the U.S. right now. Although I\u2019d say on the institutional side it\u2019s beginning to get rated and so we\u2019re actually quite hopeful that we\u2019re going to see growth maybe on the institutional side even faster than the retail side in the U.S. The take on has been extremely robust, as you know, over the last year and plus. We are in the midst of launching new product GTI, which is the income-oriented flavor of GTR in the UK and that\u2019s a fair amount of marketing is going to be put behind that effort in Q4, and we\u2019d expect to see some takeoff if the performance has been good. Asia has really been the door that has opened much wider now in terms of using GTR and we\u2019re seeing some big wins in places like Australia and China in terms of the use of GTR. On the retail side, I think the story around GTR is still excellent, but it\u2019s not probably as well known or understood as it is in the UK. And I think generally, we\u2019re seeing the product get through kind of the gatekeepers and get a better understanding of that, but it\u2019s still been slow, which has generally been the case I\u2019d say for alternative offerings in retail that we\u2019ve seen sort of a slowdown of the take-on of the alternative retail product. And so I think that\u2019s somewhat consistent with an overall theme in the U.S. as opposed to a GTR-specific story.","Marty Flanagan","And I think the reason for that is by twofold. Some of the headwinds would\u2019ve been \u2013 what is the derivatives\u2019 role, what was the impact on a product like that. So the platforms were very cautious and slow to take it on. That was one of the headwinds. And then secondarily most of the platforms are focused on product rationalization at the moment, not product additions. And so again two basic headwinds that are somewhat intertwined there. But again, we think it\u2019s a very, very strong good capability and we anticipate in time we\u2019ll continue to have success in the United States too.","Alex Blostein","Makes sense, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Sir your line is open.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Can you talk about the early traction with Source and kind of what they contributed to flows? I know it was a link close for partial quarter. And then I guess from an integration perspective, can you talk about what you\u2019re doing with distribution with the three brands now and how we should think about the sales effort? How that might change?","Loren Starr","Dan, do you want me to \u2013 Draper, do you want me to handle the flow part and then you can talk a little bit on the other aspect?","Dan Draper","Yes, that\u2019s great.","Loren Starr","Okay. So in terms of flows, it\u2019s been good, probably not off the charts good. I think they contributed about 0.5 billion in the last two months, which is about a 12% organic growth rate. I think there has been some degree of slowdown just as the integration has been going forward and the repositioning of the brand and so forth is being contemplated. There are a number of new product launches that are in the pipeline, which I think will help really sort of reboot the growth and the efforts there. So there\u2019s a lot of work that\u2019s being done right now to sort of improve the competitive positioning of the products and the lineup and really sort of accelerate the growth opportunity around Source. And certainly, some of the synergies that we haven\u2019t explicitly been talking about have taken place. And so I think in terms of the profitability of the business, as we originally said it wasn\u2019t really making money, is beginning to sort of all come into play in a positive way. So Dan, I don\u2019t know if you want to get a little more explicit about kind of some of the things that are happening around repositioning of the brand overall on a global basis.","Dan Draper","Yes. So I think just to state upfront, I think clearly the intention, Invesco has one ETF business and I think it\u2019s going to be reflected through one brand. Guggenheim, for example, they\u2019re clearly \u2013 Guggenheim Asset Management will remain in mutual funds. UIT is another area. So that\u2019s probably the most apparent. So they\u2019re clearly keeping that name for the overall business. So you\u2019ll probably see a little bit more of a rapid transition. But again, we have kind of a longer lead time to closing into next year on that. The Source, obviously a strong brand within this space, but again we\u2019re in the middle of transitioning that into 2018. They\u2019re currently co-branded having Source and PowerShares. But again, you\u2019ll see a single brand emerge from that in 2018. I think, overall, looking at how Source, the integration, and Source actually had quite a strong pipeline even going into the sales process. So they continue to execute well, as Loren mentioned, net inflows since we announced and closed the deal on August 18, and those flows are fairly well diversified, commodities have been strong for them this year, picking up equities. What we really have been focused on is on product development. That\u2019s where the product development pipeline in Europe had slowed a bit during the sales process with Source. And particularly looking at fixed income, and we also launched our first joint \u2013 or not joint, but the first product since the close a couple of weeks ago in preferreds. There was no preferred offering and we were able to take kind of our U.S. capability and launch it in the usage fund in Europe, and that\u2019s gotten off to a really good start. I think you\u2019ll see us continue to fill up the new product pipeline with fixed income being a headline. So I think really continuing the momentum that Source has built with clients in Europe, I think getting more products to those clients is a big priority and then just continual integration in larger Invesco in EMEA.","Dan Fannon","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then Loren, can you \u2013 just looking at the balance sheet and thinking about capital return from a buyback perspective, as you look into 2018, how should we think about capital return?","Loren Starr","Dan, thanks for asking that question. Again, I think as we described related to the Guggenheim acquisition and similar to what we\u2019ve done with respect to financing the Source acquisition, we\u2019ve curtailed the buyback program as we are building up cash right now in order to largely pay for the acquisition through the use of our credit facility and also through spare cash. So our thought is through the course of 2018, we\u2019re going to curtail the buyback \u2013 continue to curtail the buyback, still being opportunistic if certain situations present themselves. But largely, we want to make sure that our leverage ratios are going to be, by the end of 2018, in line with where they are pre-Guggenheim acquisition. So I would say, generally, put in minimal, if any, in terms of buyback expectations through the course of 2018 until those leverage ratios get back in line.","Dan Fannon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much. A question for Loren in the short term and then a longer one for Marty. Just on the fourth quarter, Loren, I might have missed some of these. But did you give \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you gave color on the non-comp expense outlook for 4Q? And then also what your overall fee \u2013 your core free rate, ex-performance fees, would be with a full quarter of Source? And then also just on \u2013 I appreciate the 1 billion of dividend inclusion into the total flows, but fourth quarter can be seasonally higher in that. I don\u2019t know if you have an --","Loren Starr","All right. So the last part of your question I didn\u2019t quite get the full thing. Let me get the first parts and then you can just clarify the last one. So in terms of the guidance, I think we\u2019re roughly in line with what we provided before. The only sort of deviation in guidance this quarter relative to last quarter was with respect to compensation, which was really due to the some of the outsized performance fees. So I think we originally said around 370, and so that\u2019s roughly kind of where we would expect. All the other elements are in line with what we prior guided, which again was, if you need it was, adjusted marketing was 36 to 38. We provided guidance on the adjusted property, office and tech of 92 to 94 and then G&A was in the range of 70 to 73. So all that is kind of roughly in line, barring some FX and other things, right, which obviously have a little bit of a inflation factor on those levels. So that was kind of your first question. Could you just make sure I cover the other two?","Brian Bedell","Just the \u2013 for fee rate now that we have the full quarter of Source for the fourth quarter?","Loren Starr","Yes. So I think we had said the fee rate was going to \u2013 in the second half was going to be largely in line with the second quarter. Obviously, it\u2019s slightly off. There was more money market and some other sort of passive lower fee product growth coming into play. So I think sort of in line with current levels ex-performance fees is probably the right guidance for now.","Brian Bedell","Is it the 41.9 basis point?","Loren Starr","Yes, exactly.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And then longer-term question for Marty. I guess with the Precidian application and with the SEC sort of getting \u2013 moving a little bit closer, I think Legg commented last night they were a little bit optimistic on that. Always tough to predict what the regulators are going to do. But as \u2013 I guess broader thinking out loud a little bit but more broader, Marty, what\u2019s your view on active non-transparent ETFs? And if that does get approved \u2013 I think PowerShares is included in that application if I\u2019m not mistaken. But if that does get approved, obviously a different angle than the factor-based strategy that you\u2019ve embarked upon. But what would your view be on the potential growth for nontransparent active ETFs longer term for the industry?","Marty Flanagan","Yes, I\u2019ll make a comment, but then I\u2019m going to ask Dan because Dan spent more time on it. Look, it\u2019s hard to predict. At one level, you could say \u2013 you can imagine a take-up there. I just point to our experience where the active ETFs that we launched now \u2013 I\u2019m going to lose track of time, maybe eight years ago, there is no traction behind them at all. And so all we can point to is our experience historically. But Dan, why don\u2019t you comment?","Dan Draper","Thanks, Marty. So yes, we know Precidian very well. We had \u2013 we were included in an earlier filing. As you are aware, the SEC has asked them previously to kind of remove filings. So there\u2019s been a couple of swings, if you will, at this in the past. We continue to monitor closely and we\u2019ll be \u2013 remain engaged in those discussions. But I don\u2019t think we feel there\u2019s anything that\u2019s going to happen urgently in the development of that space. But clearly, I think \u2013 the ability for Invesco to participate in that if it evolves. One thing I would point out though, that if you do see nontransparent active evolve, you\u2019re still going to have the same kind of financial [ph] situation you have with active today where particularly some strategies are going to be capacity-constrained, because it\u2019s really being driven \u2013 or seeking out for around security selection. So I think that\u2019s where you see the predominance of ETFs really coming more from an asset allocation and particularly the larger products which are much more scalable. So absolutely could there be demand, should we, if you will, technology be approved? Yes, and we\u2019d clearly be participating in that. But I think, again, the big growth in ETFs and the large products that we see continue to be much more asset allocation-focused. But quite frankly, the transparency is much more of a requirement and the ability to go out and build more scalable products, that\u2019s the core of the range. Again, we\u2019ll continue to monitor and engage. But again, at this stage we don\u2019t really see the approval being imminent really in the short term. But again, we\u2019ll remain engaged and I think adjust our business model, if necessary. One thing I would say though is away from just the nontransparent active, we do see as we mentioned in the Guggenheim transactions, self indexing becoming a bigger part of our business. As Marty mentioned, we do active transparent. We obviously work with leading third parties and I think really for us to bring forward the self indexing piece we think is probably a more immediate growth opportunity that we\u2019re excited about.","Brian Bedell","Okay, that\u2019s great color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Chris Shutler from William Blair. Sir, your line is open.","Chris Shutler","Hi, guys. Two questions. First on the equal weighted ETFs at Guggenheim. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of those assets today are in the retail or adviser channel relative to institutional?","Marty Flanagan","Dan, do you know that?","Dan Draper","Yes. I can\u2019t give you a specific number, but I would say a high \u2013 a very high percentage is going to be in what we\u2019d call the wealth management intermediary space, particularly in the hands of RIAs and some of the other platforms, home offices, what have you. But a very high percentage is retail today.","Chris Shutler","Okay. And then secondly, a different question. On the UK equity franchise, maybe just talk about \u2013 they have great long-term performance but the one and three-year numbers are challenged. What are you seeing there from a flow standpoint on retail and institutional? I think it\u2019s mainly a retail franchise, but just give us an update there. Thanks.","Loren Starr","Chris, it\u2019s actually quite benign. The flow picture is not \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen accelerated outflows at all. Sales may have come down just a bit. But overall, the levels of flows in that product, in those products are as good as they\u2019ve ever been in terms of history. So I think people understand the rationale. Mark Barnett and his team have described their position and why they believe some of the holdings that they have are smart and are going to ultimately pan out. And so they\u2019ve been through periods of underperformance in the past and have gone through that with significant outperformance following it. So I think people are being patient and not sort of reacting on a short-term basis.","Chris Shutler","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next one is from Mr. Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","Michael Cyprys","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back on some of the investments that you\u2019re making in the business, in particular on the institutional side if you could just update us on that front and how you see that business evolving over the next couple of years in terms of your positioning and some of the initiatives that you\u2019re putting in place?","Marty Flanagan","Yes, so a little bit of a repeat. So the way that we look at the business is, first of all, you have to have a set of capabilities that the institutional market wants. And so over the last decade, that has developed very, very strongly; a lot in the alternative area, a lot in the fixed income area, strong performance, strong reputations. So that\u2019s the first critical building block of the whole thing. Now with the leaders that we have in place in each of the three regions, I think they\u2019re some of the strongest leaders \u2013 they are absolutely the strongest leaders we\u2019ve ever had and I\u2019d say they\u2019re some of the most talented people in the industry. And as Loren had spoke of, the won but not funded pipeline globally has really never been higher and it continues to grow, so I would use that as a proof point. We would say that we\u2019re not where we want to be or need to be, so we see it as a rapidly growing part of our business and it\u2019s beyond an aspiration, it\u2019s actually happening right now and I think we\u2019ll look back in three years from now and see if it would have been an important contributor to our success as an organization.","Michael Cyprys","Okay. Maybe just circling back on performance fees outside of private equity and outside of real estate and those sorts of alternative strategies, can you just remind us how much AUM is subject to performance I guess in some of your more traditional strategies and how that\u2019s changed and evolved over the past couple of years? And then if you were to kind of look out over the next couple of years from here, how do you see that evolving, in particular with asset owners we\u2019re hearing seeking more performance fee structures and better alignments. Just curious and any color you could share on that front.","Marty Flanagan","We don\u2019t have a large \u2013 if you look at percentage of assets, not very large at all. And this topic of performance fees, there are vehicles where it makes sense. There are others where it does not. You talk about alignment of interests and some of the things that are emerging, I think they do not align interests really at all. I\u2019d get back to my comment earlier. I think what you really need to have a fair competitive fee and what you really want to do is hold the manager accountable to their investment philosophy and process and measure them over a period of time. The issue with performance fees is that \u2013 how does the misalignment come, because they are based on various measures that are based on where by calendar quarter or performing against an index or a benchmark and it almost always goes counter to what you want the portfolio manager to do and what the organization to do. And the risk of the investment organizations, you would hope not, but making bad decisions because of the economics being so difficult in the downturn really I think is quite dangerous, personally.","Loren Starr","In terms of the trend, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing a significant trend one way or the other in terms of use of performance fees. Certainly on the retail side, not. I think on the institutional side as we continue to build out our capabilities, it\u2019s probably growing in line with our overall institutional business. So we may see more performance fees just generally as we become more institutionally-oriented. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that has a philosophy where sort of saying let\u2019s deliver more performance.","Marty Flanagan","Let me be clear. I want to clarify the point that Loren is on. There are vehicles or strategies where it makes sense and \u2013 whether it be in the number of the alternatives, in private equity, in real estate, it makes sense. You get the alignment. It makes a lot of sense. We do that. It makes sense, very supportive of it. To me it\u2019s this fulcrum fee notion that tends to happen in the retail environment that is really countercyclical typically to what you want to have happen. So thanks for the point there.","Michael Cyprys","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","Kenneth Lee","Thanks for taking my question. Just want to focus on the Guggenheim ETF business. From the earlier comments, it sounds like the business is mainly focused on the retail side. Maybe tell us more about the opportunity for expansion to institutional customers? What would need to be done before you can start getting traction on that side?","Marty Flanagan","Dan, will you take that?","Dan Draper","Yes, sure. So I think just looking at kind of legacy strength and focus on distribution, I think that\u2019s \u2013 at Guggenheim, that\u2019s where you\u2019ve seen a lot of the strength and their success thus far. I think as Marty and Loren both have mentioned, I think the growing strength of our institutional business at Invesco I think just plays into that bigger, wider distribution opportunity we have taking this business in-house. So I think frankly getting more education, I think particularly in fixed income. So if you look at these BulletShares products, having a final maturity date on the ETF is very unique. Having an open-ended fund but with a final maturity, that allows for things such as asset liability matching, which clearly plays very strongly into the insurance space, for example. So I really kind of hope that we\u2019d be able to particularly get in front of some of Invesco\u2019s strong insurance relationships with the BulletShares existing products but perhaps even more importantly, building new products for some of those. And I don\u2019t want to limit that. I think the BulletShare also would have interest, particularly with endowments, smaller pensions, other areas in institutional. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re really keen to look for additional kind of synergies through that. I do think also if you look at the way that many institutions have been looking at factors really for decades or longer for us to really introduce some of this factor exposure in the ETF wrapper. So the wrapper may be new to them, but helping, again educating with white papers, research, overall thought leadership to institutional clients we think is pretty exciting. But I\u2019d definitely put my finger on the fixed income BulletShares as the area that we probably start with expanding and leveraging the institutional capabilities at Invesco.","Kenneth Lee","Great. And just a follow-up question on ETF sales in Europe. It sounds as if post-MiFID II, there could be some material pickup in ETF retail sales due to the increased transparency. Would that be a fair statement or are there still some additional structural changes that are needed in the European market before we see more rapid adoption of ETFs? Thanks.","Marty Flanagan","Dan?","Dan Draper","Yes. So I think our view overall if you look at growth trends, we believe that overall AUM growth in Europe is probably seven to maybe ten years behind where the U.S. was in that growth curve, but obviously growing quite rapidly. As we have mentioned, broad-based retail demand is not yet present. I think with the MiFID II impact, we do think medium to long term, it will be significant, and ETFs will be a beneficiary. However, short term, if you look at \u2013 there was a regulatory change in 2013 in the United Kingdom, so retail distribution review had an impact, very similar, with transparency, eliminating conflicts of interest, for example, in certain product areas. ETFs did get a bit of a boost but it was fairly modest. I think it continues to grow. I think our expectation therefore for MiFID II is that this is a crucial cornerstone change I think particularly improving the liquidity. On-screen liquidity of ETFs will hopefully happen sooner under MiFID II. As I mentioned, there were no requirements for market makers in Europe to put up pre and post-trade reporting. So those indications are really important to encourage liquidity. So I think if you get liquidity moving earlier, then I think you\u2019ll get more confidence, more visibility for ETFs with retail investors and their advisers. So just to manage expectations, we do think it\u2019s a medium to long term, very positive. But short term, based on kind of the RDR UK experience, it will probably be modest out of the gate, but we\u2019ll continue to monitor. But I think this is where, again, having the scale platform that has been built largely through institutional demand in Europe that Source brings, that\u2019s really where, when the retail demand does come, they\u2019re going to be looking for scaled products, good liquidity with the track record. And that\u2019s where everything that we\u2019re doing now with the distribution business, ETF business in Europe is really crucial when that retail demand does come.","Kenneth Lee","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open.","Chris Harris","Thanks. Hi, guys. Just a couple of follow-ups on Jemstep. So things are going well there. You highlighted that. Yet Jemstep isn\u2019t the only platform of its kind, I don\u2019t believe. So can you guys talk to us a little bit about what differentiates Jemstep, why an adviser would choose Jemstep over another offering? And then related to that, as the market evolves, do you guys envision advisers coalescing around just a few of these digital offerings, or do you expect the market to be a lot more fragmented than that?","Marty Flanagan","So the characters that are unique to Jemstep, first of all, the digital technologies are being adopted quite broadly all throughout our industries in different ways. The robustness of the Jemstep infrastructure is unique. It was eight years in development and that really becomes, all of would know being in this industry, the piping in the industry is complicated and it\u2019s necessary to be robust and strong. So that\u2019s one. But really, it is the open architecture nature of it so \u2013 and it\u2019s directed to advisers only. So it is not available direct to consumer. So there is no channel conflict. It is to support our clients\u2019 business, and that\u2019s very attractive. It also can use a range of vehicles, which is more unique, so ETFs, mutual funds and the like. Those are absent in most of the competing capability, and its ability to be embedded in an organization\u2019s infrastructure is unique. So it\u2019s not a black box. So those are some of the characteristics that make it unique. And so think of it as a \u2013 we\u2019ve all been through it. You are installing in an application and we all know it\u2019s hard work, it takes time. The notion that an organization would have more than one of these is hard to believe. And so there really is a first mover advantage to it and we think we\u2019re in a very strong position and just the demand would suggest that. Coming back to a prior question of how big can it be and the like, it\u2019s just a long tail. And we never put our chin out there to speculate about the possible impact, but it has all the makings of being a very, very strong contributor to the firm.","Loren Starr","The one thing I would just add too, that really makes it even more unique is the fact that we\u2019ve got this incredibly robust offerings around models and solutions that we can bring alongside it. So it\u2019s just not a technology solution that is being offered, it\u2019s actually \u2013 some of the most valuable part is the ability to tailor models to the clients\u2019 needs at a very attractive price. And so I think when you add all those things in, in terms of the open architecture, the fact that we\u2019re integrating this into people\u2019s systems, and it\u2019s not a black box, and we\u2019ve got the models actually positions it almost in a way that is \u2013 does make it stand out as a unique offering.","Chris Harris","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Mr. Robert Lee from KBW. Sir, your line is open.","Andy McLaughlin","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. This is actually Andy McLaughlin in for Rob. I just had one quick question, a lot of mine have been asked already, but I appreciate the update you gave on the business optimization. Kind of how should we think about those balancing between needed investments going into next year and what line items in particular might we see the optimization in?","Loren Starr","So I think, again, in terms of the guidance on the ultimate need for investment, I think we\u2019ve already built-in into that guidance our need for investment. More savings helps offset some of the \u2013 or boosts the incremental margins. So that\u2019s a positive thing in terms of the things that help improve our incremental margin outlook. We still think we\u2019re in a situation as a firm and the industry that there\u2019s so much change going on that the need and the criticality of investing behind some of these trends are key for success in the future. But again, there\u2019s only so much you can actually invest in at once and do it well. So that\u2019s kind of some context to thinking why generally the things that we\u2019re talking about are helpful for our incremental margin story. In terms of \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the other question that you had was --","Andy McLaughlin","Just kind of where we might see --","Loren Starr","\u2026see the savings. Yes, so because of the \u2013 a large part of it has to do with outsourcing really in looking at moving expenses out of compensation and then moving them into that property, office, tech, which is where we have all the third-party payments for outsourced services. And so it would really be a movement into expenses, into that category off of comp.","Andy McLaughlin","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, we'd like to turn the call over to the speakers for today, Mr. Martin Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you very much, and thank you everybody, for joining Loren and myself. And those that wish to follow the presentation, it is on our website, if you are so inclined. Today, I'll review the business results for the second quarter. Loren will go into greater detail around the financials. And as our practice, both Loren and I will answer any questions that anybody might have.","So, let me start by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter, you'll find this on Slide 3 of the presentation. Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter. 75% and 79% of actively-managed assets were ahead over a three- and five-year basis respectively. Strong investment performance, combined with a comprehensive range of strategies and solutions we offer to help clients achieve their desired investment objectives contributed to long-term net inflows of $5.9 billion for the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up 4.2% compared to the first quarter. The quarterly dividend is $0.27 per share, which is up 8% over the prior year. We also returned $198 million to shareholders during the quarter through the combination of dividends and stock buybacks.","Turning to the summary of the results for the quarter, assets under management were $803 billion at the end of the second quarter, up from $798 billion in the prior quarter. Operating income was $390 million in the quarter versus $374 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.63 per share, the same as the prior quarter.","Before Loren goes into details on the financials, let me take a moment to review investment performance during the quarter inflows. Turning to Slide 6, investment performance remained are strong across the enterprise, in spite of the volatility later in this past quarter. Looking at the firm as a whole, 75% of the assets were in the top half on a three-year basis. 79% were in the top half on a five-year basis.","I am now on Page 7. I think we all recognize that every client has a unique set of investment objectives with a desired set of outcomes that can be achieved in a variety of ways. We believe the greatest opportunity for clients to achieve those investment objectives is by using a well-constructed portfolio that is needs-based, spans asset classes and considers both active and passive strategies.","One of the greatest strengths of Invesco is the broad range of active and passive capabilities we offer our clients. It's a key differentiator for us in the marketplace. Our focus on meeting client needs with a broad range of active and passive capabilities drove solid flows into our business during the second quarter. Active and passive flows we saw across the globe, reflecting continued efforts to deliver strong investment performance and provide excellent outcomes for clients. Although retail flows were impacted by the macro event, we saw strong flows in our institutional channel during the quarter.","The figures on Slide 8 reflect a broad diversity of flows we saw across our global business during the quarter, which included strength in fixed income, namely investment grade, stable value, global total return, real estate, and other asset allocation products.","Despite significant funding during the quarter, the institutional pipeline of won but not funded mandates remains strong and diversified across asset classes. We feel good about the results for the quarter. In spite of the late volatility we saw in the second quarter, we continue to see strength in Asia Pacific and EMEA particularly, and across the broad range of asset classes.","These flows were the result of the continuing strong investment performance, and our ability to meet client needs with a range of strategies and solutions, which positions us well for long-term success. And from my perspective, this quarter really represents the value of being broadly diversified by channel, asset class, investment capabilities, and the value of the investments we have made over a number of years.","Smart data in ETFs, European cross border investments, the institutional business globally, alternatives, fixed income. We have a history of advancing our business during uncertain times, whether it comes through markets or more recently the impact of such developments coming from the regulatory changes. We believe we are positioned very well. We believe we are making the investments to continue to strengthen our business, while at the same time, we recognize we are in an uncertain time, and we will be thoughtful during this period.","Loren?","Loren Starr","Thanks, Marty. So now we'll go through the asset roll-forward and operating income. So quarter after quarter, you'll see that our total assets under management increased $5.3 billion, or 0.7%. This was driven by FX translation of $8.5 billion, and long-term net inflows of $5.9 billion. These gains were partially offset by negative market returns of $6.2 billion and outflows from money market and the QQQs of $2.6 billion and $0.3 billion respectively.","Our average AUM for the second quarter was $810.9 billion. That was up 1.9% versus the first quarter. However, as Marty mentioned, due to the market declines in June, our end of period AUM came in at $803.6 billion, which is in fact 0.9% lower than our Q2 average AUM. Our net revenue yield was 46.2 basis points, which represented an increase of 0.1 basis points versus Q1.","The drop in performance fees quarter over quarter accounted for a decline of 1.9 basis points, which was more than offset by a variety of factors, including an improved mix, which added 0.7 basis points, one extra day during the quarter, which added 0.6 basis points, favorable FX and higher other revenue, each of which added 0.3 basis points.","Let's turn to the operating results now. Net revenues increased $19.1 million or 2.1% quarter over quarter to $936.6 million, which included a positive FX rate impact of $5.1 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees increased by $59.7 million or 5.8% to $1.08 billion. This was a result of higher average AUM, one extra day during the quarter, and the impact of the growth in higher yielding product. FX increased investment management fees by $7.2 million.","Service and distribution revenues increased by $6.2 million or 2.9%, also in line with higher average AUM, and the increased day count. FX increased service and distribution revenues by $0.2 million. Performance fees came in the quarter at $13.1 million, and they were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, which included bank loans, real estate, Asian equity and quantitative equity. Foreign exchange had no impact on our performance fees. Other revenues in the second quarter were $37.9 million, which was an increase of $6.7 million, and that line item benefited from a higher level of real estate transaction fees. Foreign exchange decreased other revenues by $0.1 million.","Third-party distribution service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $14.9 million or 3.7%, and this increase was in line with our higher average AUM and higher day count. FX increased these expenses by $2.2 million.","Moving further down on the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $546.4 million grew by $3.3 million or 0.6%, relative to the first quarter. Foreign exchange increased operating expenses by $2.3 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $351.4 million, a decrease of $11.3 million or 3.1%. The decrease was consistent with the decline in seasonal payroll taxes and a reduction in variable compensation linked to performance fees earned in the first quarter. These declines were partially offset by a full quarter of higher base salaries that went into affect on March 1. And foreign exchange increase compensation by $1.7 million.","Marketing expense increased by $3.3 million or 12% to $30.7 million. FX increased marketing expenses by $0.2 million in the quarter. Property, office, and technology expense were $82.2 million in the second quarter. That was up $4.4 million. This increase was the result of higher property-related expenses, and foreign exchange increased these expenses by $0.3 million. G&A expense came in a little bit higher this quarter at $82.1 million. That represented a $6.9 million increase or 9.2%. The increase in G&A was the result of $3.6 million of additional fund and regulatory costs, as well as higher professional service expenses associated with technology initiatives, which amounted to $2 million. Foreign exchange increased G&A by 0.1 million.","Moving on down the page, you'll see the non-operating income decrease $6.7 million compared to the first quarter, and that was largely driven by lower equity and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. The firm's tax rate on a pretax adjusted net income basis in Q2 was 28.7%, which was consistent with the guidance that we provided in the first-quarter call. Looking forward, our tax rate will return to the lower level of 25.5% to 26.5%. Which you brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.63 and our adjusted net operating margin of 41.7%.","Let me just take a few minutes to discuss Invesco's financial outlook, before turning things back over to Marty. At the end of Q2, clearly negative market sentiments and risk-off behavior on the part of many clients occurred, and that was driven the situations in Greece and China. As a result, as I mentioned, we find ourselves starting the last half of the year at a level of AUM that is, in fact, lower than what we average in Q2, and roughly flat to the average AUM we had across the first half of the year.","We continue to believe that Invesco is very well positioned for success, and we face many significant growth opportunities, many of which do require further investment on our part, in order to realize. At the same time, we are aware of our needs to manage our expenses in a disciplined way, especially when markets are particularly volatile and uncertain.","So as of today, our expense guidance is still roughly in line with what we discussed with you in the first half of the year. Nothing has changed. However, we will be looking closely at other areas of spend and investment with an eye to prioritize and look at certain non-critical projects and initiatives to see if we can delay certain events, particularly until the market has stabilized.","However, on a positive note, in the last half of July, we have seen some improvements in the markets, and a significant positive turn around in the retail sentiment in Europe and our ETF business. In fact, just in the last two weeks of July, we generated more than $1 billion of net inflows. In addition, we continue to see very strong institutional demand across a variety of our investment capabilities, and we would say that should this improvement continue, we do believe that our organic growth rate is on track to meet our plan of 3% to 5% for the year, and our incremental margin target of 50% to 65% is achievable.","With that, I will now turn things back over to Marty.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you, Loren. Operator, any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We have a first question coming from Michael Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, guys. Maybe the first question, and maybe for both of you. Loren, maybe just given what you said in terms of the shifting tone and sentiment in July. You mentioned the last two weeks. I don't know if you have a full-month picture, but even more important than that, you gave some color on the institutional pipeline.","Just on the retail. When you think about maybe up through April, all the momentum and the progress that you have been seeing versus some of the pull-back that we have seen in the past couple of months, we just want to get a sense on which products continue to work, where you are seeing that demand. In the cross-border, we have seen huge swings early in the quarter versus what we are seeing now. I just wanted to get an update there, since that is a big driver for you.","Loren Starr","Michael, I'll answer maybe the first one and Marty you can add whatever. In terms of July, I would say we are roughly flat in July on net flows. So obviously those first two weeks were tough, and they have been completely offset by the last two weeks in July. The daily flows continue to be strongly positive from where we are today. That is the good news.","In terms of the products that are absolutely on track and continue to be in high demand, we're seeing alternatives generally as an asset class flow very well. GTR in particular, bank loans, CLOs, alternative fixed income continue to be a very strong provider real estate. Those are going to be continued trends. We're pretty certain that those didn't even really slow down that much. Balanced also continues to be a strong area of growth for us. IBRA, we have got balanced product in EMEA and CE as well.","What we really saw was equity. That took the hit from that April - May time frame, and that was around -- very much a target of domestic equity, got hurt pretty bad. UK equities also got hit. China got hit. That was the real element that took the flows away.","The things that are still flowing, and we think very positively, that are going to continue to flow, also I did mentioned fixed income, which is another area where we have spent a lot of time and effort and investment to build out our capabilities, and to allow our clients to understand those capabilities. And we're seeing a lot of demand at both retail and institutional for those products.","So I'd say, the themes are going to continue. Hopefully the equity element, which was really the part that hurt us is stabilizing, and now we're going to see more continued interest in those products. The ETFs as well, clearly stalled for us for a while, and that was because most of the flows going into ETFs was really centered on either the hedged, foreign exchange hedged product or the international products, which we don't have a presence in nearly to the extent to a sense that some of our competitors do. We have, as I mentioned in my commentary, seen that turn around. Our products are now selling across many of our capabilities in our ATF range.","Michael Carrier","That's helpful. And Loren, just on the expenses, it sounds like keening an eye on things, just given the volatility in the market. I think in the past you have given some guidance on the line items, and just particularly the G&A. You called out a couple of items that you have seen maybe were more elevated. But I just want to get some sense going forward where these things should be running, and I hear your comments on keeping an eye on the markets, but just anything that was maybe more noisy this quarter?","Loren Starr","I'd say G&A did pop up. There were a lot of things that you would definitely circle as being one-time in nature. Probably somewhere you could easily circle $3 million to $4 million of stuff in G&A that was non-recurring. I think the issue is that -- other things may fall off, but other things may come on. So there is a recurring, non-recurring situation in the G&A.","We are managing that line item, looking very closely at it, trying to manage through it, and I would say it's probably at a very elevated level in the second quarter generally, and we would hope to see that number decline from where it is. In terms of giving explicit guidance as to where it lands, harder for us to say exactly where that would be"," If I took a swag, I would say somewhere in the $75 million to $80 million range is probably the right level, but it is harder to really manage and forecast that line item, just because there are certain things that are going to be related to product launches or certain needs around regulatory situations, where we're just going to need to spend money to deal with those situations.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Glenn Schorr","Thank you. Maybe we could get a little more color on the Asian franchise. I think, I heard your comments on equities in China, but in general, that is $60 billion now. $1.3 billion in positive flows, and I think there was like $7 million in performance fees from the region. If you could just get a high level, what is working, what do you still need to build across Asia, because I think it held up a lot better than people might have thought.","Martin Flanagan","Two points. So we look at it as one of the fundamental strengths of the organization. Lots of commentary about China right now, but if you look three to five years, it is a very important place to be. We look at our greater China capabilities, unique. We look at our presence in mainland China as unique, both retail and institutional. And it may go through a challenged period here, but we think we are uniquely positioned there.","What I would say is we talked about the institutional business. The leadership in Asia Pacific. The institutional leadership is new this year, very, very strong. We think that, and we are seeing greater results already, which is frankly hard to believe, and we're seeing it in Australia along, also Japan is a very strong institutional market for us, and historically, that's not been the case. We are seeing additional success frankly before I would have thought that was the case institutionally in the region. And again, we're looking for continued positive contributions from that region for us.","Loren Starr","I'd say the things that are really working for us, we have seen a lot of demand for fixed income product in Japan. We're seeing a lot of institutional business generally. Australia as well is taking on our GTR product. Real estate continues to be a theme. A lot of things working for us in many different regions within that Asia category.","Glenn Schorr","Thank you. Last quarter, you mentioned on the institutional pipeline, the won but not-yet funded was at an all-time high. Any color? I hear you, that the pipeline's good. I'm just curious on how good.","Martin Flanagan","It's really at the same level it was last quarter, which is very, very good. I think the question for all of us, and we would -- the uncertainty, I think we'd all have to -- What will institutions do? When will they fund? I think if we're in a stable market, we're going to see the funding of those, which we would anticipate, we don't have any indication otherwise, but we have seen over the years when markets get unsettled, sometimes the institution are low slower to fund it. Won but not funded continues to be at record highs for us.","Glenn Schorr","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we have another question coming from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Hopefully I got this right. It looks like you won a larger series of large active US institutional fixed income mandates in the quarter. Generally not an asset class I think of first when I think of Invesco, and I mean no offense there. But can you flush out what is happening, where the mandates are being won, and any color you can provide?","Loren Starr","We are seeing it across a broad fixed income, stable value, and we are seeing it both in terms of corporate activity, our Taft-Hartley business. It is spread across a variety of asset classes. The one that we are probably most pleased with is the growth in the corporate side, which has never been necessarily the strongest area we have played in. We continue to add resources to be more meaningful to the corporate clients that we are working with. It's really in broad fixed income and stable value, where the largest wins took place.","Martin Flanagan","Ken, just adding to that, if you look add our fixed income performance, it's really very strong. And the client results are frankly sooner than I would have thought, and I think you'll see, we talked in prior years, we thought we were going to miss this whole fixed income cycle, and it was just really making sure we had the capabilities for the next one. That said I would say we're making progress before I thought what would have happened. So it's all very good from my perspective.","Ken Worthington","Great. And then maybe my follow-up. Invesco made a large push in product development in marketing into alternative products in the US and Europe over the last 18 months. So the track records are still young and developing, but Q2 would seem to put these products to the test. So the question is how are the products performing? Are they meeting your expectations? And given maybe the change in sentiment, how are conversations evolving with the intermediaries to really sell the products, both in the US and in Europe? Thanks.","Martin Flanagan","Very good question, Ken. Our view is that, if you are taking feedback from the clients, the feedback has been quite clear, whether it be retail or institutional, but retail in particular is relatively new, that allocations are going to go from 5% to 15% to 20%. Whether they get that high, who knows, but let's just say they go to 10%. That is just quite an opportunity.","We have had the investment capabilities internally, largely for institutions. We, as you know, put probably the broadest range of alternatives into the retail market, beginning at the end of last year. Our view always was, think of no shorter than three years before you're going to get results, because of, as you say, developing the track record and the like. And every once in a while, you get some success before its time.","The first one that came on was IBRA. You all know how successful that has been. It continues to be successful. The one that is an early success right now is GTR, and it's in the UK, on the continent, in the United States. Asia, the derivatives component slows that down in that region on a retail basis. So we think it's going very, very well, and it's nice to have another early surprise if you want to call it that, from a client response in GTR.","With regard to your question, the volatility of the markets. Did we see disproportionate flow into the alternative bucket on the retail side? We did not. I think that's too early. I think if we continue to have a couple more quarters of this, the intention is going to be there. One limiting component continues to be the distribution channel's ability to get alternatives on their platform.","There is high desire, but the mechanics of getting them on the platform are still slow. It's not a criticism, they're just being very, very cautious. Just recently, GTR has been added to a couple of very important platforms here in the United States. That should be a good development in the future.","Loren Starr","And just on GTR. The good news is GTR is now at $6.5 billion in terms of AUM, and if you add in the won but not yet funded component, it would be at $9 billion. It really just continues to grow, and again, a very attractive fee rate on that product. Roughly 100 basis points. Good to know.","Ken Worthington","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous.","Patrick Davitt","In these past quarters where there was a pretty significant decline in the stock price, you have ramped up your me purchase quite a bit. Didn't really seem like that happened this quarter. Could you walk through the thought process around that, given the weakness in the stock last quarter?","Loren Starr","Patrick, I think we have debated internally for some time about how to react to certain market dislocations, and it's always unclear when to go in big, because you have to have a real strong view on the market, and tactically, you can get in and you can do some. We did buy more this quarter than we did last quarter. At the same time, we are still feeding some large products as the large feed capital needs that we need to balance across the buy-back opportunities. And we are still looking to maintain $1 billion in excess of what we have from the regulatory capital perspective.","And so there's a balancing act that continues to exist our prioritization of how to use capital. The first call on our capital is always going to be the internal one, in terms of organic needs, which would be the seeding. And so I think given the size of the seeding, this is probably the largest element, in terms of being a little bit more circumspect, doing more on the buyback. We will continue to be very systemic in our buyback. And again, the stock may go up.","We're going to continue to buy. Stock may go down, we're going to continue to buy. And so, we have seen our ability to forecast markets as a challenge. And it's probably better on our part to be more systematic as opposed to trying to time the markets in a big way.","Patrick Davitt","More broadly it seems every day now there is either a regulator or a press article talking about bond liquidity. And you always enter that conversation, given your size in the bank loan markets. Curious if all of that kind of noise is bleeding into your conversations with clients, and to what extent you feel like that conversation is going positively for you?","Martin Flanagan","It's a good question. Look, I think when you read the public commentary generally in the papers, it's too shallow of a commentary, quite frankly, the thing to say. Money managers, including ourselves have been constructing portfolios for decades. It's the fundamental strength of what we do as an industry. In portfolio construction, you are always looking at liquidity needs and the like, and there's an assumption in the paper that if you are in bank loans, you have 100% in illiquid, hard to trade bank loans, and it is just false.","So if you look at the combination of our bank loan products or others, there is a high liquidity component to it. There are back-up lines of credit. The clients absolutely understand that, it's just the public commentary doesn't. But I will say the industry is working things like shortening settlement periods and the like in bank loan markets and doing the things that we should, just to continue to make the markets more efficient, more effective for the benefit of our clients. That is our perspective on it.","Patrick Davitt","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Bill Katz of Citi.","Bill Katz","So just trying to run the math a little bit, if you're feeling pretty good about the 3% to 5% organic growth rate and July is basically a push, and we know the first half of the year. It would suggest the theme here is the institutional business is doing pretty well, but the thrust of the question is, I think you have to have some pretty big numbers coming through in the second half of the year. Are you at a point now where you are starting to really take advantage of scaling some of the products? Obviously, you gave the disclosure on GTR terms. But just more broadly, one of the pushbacks has always been, oh you have a lot of small funds, but nothing that is really sizable. Do you think you're at a nice inflection point now where you are starting to scale some really scalable assets globally?","Martin Flanagan","It's a good question, Bill. You get scale by doing good things for clients, and I think you start by if you look at our performance, it's really very strong. That said, you have to do something about it. We, as a firm, for the last couple of years in particular, have refocused again on taking those capabilities that can become offered globally to clients and taken to clients globally, and that is what we have done and that's what you're starting to see, whether it was risk parity, GTR, bank loans, real estate. So that is an absolute focus of the firm, where it makes sense to do that, and we have been making progress, and we are focused on accelerating that progress. And I think you're seeing that.","Loren Starr","The opportunity around the products that have global demand, whether it's IBRA or GTR or some of the bond products, that is absolutely what we're focused on, and I'd say we're making progress. It's not something where for fixed income we said it is happening faster than we thought, actually, but we're probably not at a level where you would say we're at the same scale of some of our larger competitors. But again, we value the diversification, too. I make that point, that we don't want to be probably as large as our competitors in certain products. We like to have a series of diversified capabilities, all that work on a global basis.","Bill Katz","That's helpful. And I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the regulatory pressures are building in terms of the costs. Is that idiosyncratic to Invesco, or is that more of an industry dynamic? Where are you seeing it? And then if you still feel pretty good about the incremental margin range and we know the GA, does that suggest there's a little more operating leverage on comp from here?","Martin Flanagan","Let me take the first part. The regulatory thing, it is hitting everybody. Not like the banks, but we think it's quite overwhelming, the amount of regulations that have come this way. Where it's hitting the most, so again, it will depend on if the firm is global or not. If you are a global firm, the UK was probably the most dramatic in its change and its regulatory environment and the demands on a firm, the investments we have made around that are material. You also have impacts of things like RDR and what does that do. We have talked about that over the years. We thought we would be a winner. We are a winner in it, but by the way, you have to make changes along the way.","The continent is another area where again, much more complex regulation impacting the business and the like. Yes, we're spending money. But what I would say too, it also increases the barriers to entry, which I think, that is fine for us. It's probably too bad for the market. But longer term, the bigger stronger firms that can make investments will, and will frankly probably do better than the mid-sized smaller firms.","You come to the United States, we have had again, an awful lot of regulation come out. It wouldn't be to the same magnitude there. I think some have paid close attention to, which you have all have is, what happens with the fiduciary rule. That could have some incredibly negative consequences ultimately to all of our clients. Well-intended, but currently proposed, not very thoughtful.","That said, we think we are going to be one of those firms that is quite well positioned if some version of this rule comes out. I think others are going to be at quite a disadvantage. It really is an influence on businesses like I have not seen in my career, and we do feel that we can take advantage of opportunities that emerge as business models get changed through the regulatory dynamics.","Loren Starr","To answer the last part of your question, Bill, the answer is yes. It's leverage on all the line items. We are seeing with the now renewed strong growth in cross-border flows in EMEA, for example, that the trend on the fee rate should be more positive. FX has improved slightly as well, which is again very important in terms of getting that operating leverage in some of our most scaled products. I think those elements will help, and as you know, our compensation line item is probably most strongly driven by investment performance. It's probably reasonably stable, so there isn't sort of a sense of large needs to change compensation. For those reasons, we think that 50% to 65% opportunity on incremental margin is there, as long as the trend comes back, or it continues, where we are seeing the flows come back in the most important places.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thank you for taking both of my questions.","Operator","Our next question coming from Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets.","Eric Berg","Marty and Loren, why do you think there is such a bifurcation, such a difference between the behavior of institutions and individuals during the quarter? And by that, I mean if one pieces together the different pieces of information that you are giving us, and the different tables that show the flow of assets, it looks like it was a fixed income-led, institutional-led, US-lead advance. And active advance. And there wasn't nearly as much retail activity, and I should say fixed income and alternatives. But so heavily institutional. What is your sense, obviously, you can't get into the heads up of individual investors everywhere. That's impossible, but from talking to your colleagues and distributors, what is your best sense of why there is such a difference of behavior by retail investors and institutions?","Martin Flanagan","That is a really good question. I think this is something we have all studied over our careers here, and for all the education that we all try to put into the market with clients, et cetera, not just us, but distributors, consultants and the like, you continue to have different behaviors. Institutions, frankly, do a better job of being consistent in investing for the long term.","And I think what you have seen on the retail side, the bigger element probably, I don't have this number exactly in front of me was not so much redemptions as much as retail investors stopping. Instead of making the decision I'm going to put more money into -- I'm committed to this monthly investment plan into my US equity capability, they are until they're not. I think they get really scared with what was going on in Greece and what was going on in China and even with advisors, and I think advisors are really, really important for our retail clients, the idea of just holding off is very, very common. And it is as simple as that, but it was pronounced.","Eric Berg","If I could ask another high level question to you, Marty. During the course of this call, we have talked about all of the many businesses in which Invesco competes, other than active equity investing. We've talked about risk parity, global total return, bank loans, other alternatives, real estate, and so forth. My sense is that there is a view in this business by many people who follow it that somehow active equity vesting is the holy grail, it's a good business, and that everything else, especially fixed income, is not as good. What are the merits of that, whether people believe that? What is the truth about your business? By that, I mean that as Invesco transitions to these other businesses in many quarters, other than active equities, is that a good thing? Should I feel good about it, should I feel bad about it, or indifferent?","Martin Flanagan","Good question. So here's our answer. So it gets to the comment that I made earlier. Every single client, whether retail or individual, has a unique set of investment objectives, and you can get there through a variety of ways to meet their outcomes. What we are committed to, and how we have built the firm is having a broad range of investment capability to meet those needs. High conviction capabilities, whether they are active or passive.","So when we talk about passive, we believe in smart data. It is a better data, and you get better information for your clients. The combination thereof is how we think we can generate the results for our clients over time. I can't pass on my individual judgment on how somebody should build their portfolio.","That said, I'll put on my personal advice. Over time, always, active management will give you the greatest returns for the level of risk of investment. That is a fact. That is not common wisdom right now, because the period we have come out from 2009 on, and the bounce off the bottom, three rounds of QE, et cetera, et cetera. It is an absolute mistake to be giving up on active equity investing. And I will say you go cap weighted passive investing, the best you can do is an average, minus fees. I don't think that is how you serve your clients best.","Loren Starr","And Eric, just on the purely Invesco-specific financial point, the margins on those capabilities, fixed income or alternatives, are certainly as good as what we have seen in active equity. So there isn't a financial give-up in terms of us moving from one active class to another, particularly as long as we have scale and those capabilities.","Martin Flanagan","I come back, Eric, just to make the point. Our view is if you are looking to invest in Invesco, our absolute focus is on our clients first, and we think if you do a good job for clients and you run a disciplined business, Invesco is going to do really, really well. I think that is really an important thing to understand, too.","Eric Berg","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Fannon","My question is again on the institutional side. Just curious with the strength you are seeing there, are you having success cross-selling to existing institutional clients, or are these new relationships mostly? Just trying to get a sense of kind of the breadth?","Martin Flanagan","Quite frankly, many of them are new. And frankly, an area that we are focused on to improve is having a greater number of relationships with each of our institutional clients. Not just what's in, but a number of them are multinationals and just doing a better job of serving them around the world. And again, we think we are one of very few organizations that can do that, so we look at that as an opportunity for us.","Daniel Fannon","Great. And then just also, just thinking about the backdrop, volatility, and what that presents potentially opportunistically for you. Has your views around M&A changed at all? Do you think about potentially being more aggressive in a market like this, where maybe some peers or others aren't in as good a position as you are?","Martin Flanagan","Our views haven't changed. The criteria is still focused on what are the skill gaps, or product gaps that we are missing, and that is the first criteria. We try to build them first internally, but again, I wouldn't say we're there. In challenged markets, it's amazing what presents itself, and again, we're not there, but we're not -- we'll just have to see what happens.","Daniel Fannon","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Luke Montgomery of Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery","So coming to the ETF business, you have got a foothold there. It's a number four position. Still a small fraction of the overall market, and fairly concentrated for you by AUM flows in a few products. But you have talked a lot about growing the platform with smart data. Seems like more and more of your competitors are talking about it, too. I thought perhaps you could speak to whether you feel, if you have a comfortable lead in the race here. What your competitive advantages are, and whether you think there's a first advantage in some of these product ideas. Any thoughts on that competitive landscape?","Martin Flanagan","I think others coming into it, just verifies that it's a good idea, and that there is -- that it's a good thing for clients. So the others coming in, we think that's a good thing. There is absolutely, in the ETF market, in particular, first mover advantage. Very differently than institutional mandates or another retail mutual fund. So product development becomes very important and it's really, what, two or three of the same products, and that really takes up the shelf space. And so being first or second really matters in that.","And we also think our competitive advantage in smart data is that if you look at our product range, it's the broadest smart data product range out there. It's also the oldest. When you start to look at track records, you're not doing models and looking backwards, it is the product range that has the longest experience in the marketplace, and that is valuable over time. So coming new into the market, you are disadvantaged by those facts.","Luke Montgomery","Thanks, and then coming back to the fiduciary rule, I think most of the focus has been on how this impacts intermediaries. There's been a little bit of talk about how this could be more challenging for bundled defined contribution providers, but at least in my view, it seems rarely supported by anything specific in the legislation, that would accelerate any of the pressures that already existed or introduce any new pressures. As you think about the opportunity in DCIO, any thoughts on how the rule changes the competitive landscape for the legacy providers?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, it's a good question, and I think everybody is searching exactly for what the right answer is. I think if it does go through in its current form, which I doubt, because it is absolutely unworkable and it does any number of things, but if it did, I think it would be quite unsettling to the whole marketplace. It would put a value on size, which could be, quite frankly one of those catalysts for combinations that you would not have imagined previously.","It also, in some of the support commentary, it is very specific in sending people towards types of investment strategies, types of investment products, types of vehicles, that will clearly have unintended consequences for investors. We have the unique position from being in the United Kingdom, and with RDR and there's corollaries there. So trying to create purity is a wonderful goal, but what you have seen in the United Kingdom is individual investors.","There are more people not taking advice right now because of RDR, and their total cost has gone up. I believe you're going to have that same type of thing here. The people that most need advice won't get advice, and they'll be disadvantaged by the whole process. So it's hard to answer the question until we know what comes out at the other end. But as currently, I think it would be quite disruptive.","Luke Montgomery","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Brennan Hawken of UBS.","Brennan Hawken","First off, congrats on the quarter, particularly in what has proven to be a really difficult and challenging environment for a bunch of your peers. So I just had one question left at this point. You highlighted that towards the tail end of July, volatility in Europe is subsiding. Now that you are seeing flows and trends come back, what is different in recent experience versus earlier in the year, or is it just a return to the products that were popular, and working before? And is there any difference between retail and institutional. Just some color from there would be helpful.","Loren Starr","It feels largely like a return to the previous part of the year as opposed to some new trend emerging that is different from what we saw before. Maybe there's a little less interest in corporate bond product than we saw before still, but that is being offset by some other products, that fixed income, long-dated corporate fixed income, maybe less so. That is about the only thing that I can point to that feels a little bit different.","Brennan Hawken","And then one small one. There was a little noise around New York tax in the quarter. Is that going to have any impact on the tax rate going forward?","Loren Starr","No. It was just a one-time situation that is no longer going to affect our P&L.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill.","Michael Kim","A little bit more about the opportunities you see to leverage the breadth of product across the franchise, to build customized offerings across both active and passive strategies, as well as maybe other alternative quantitative or allocation services, and I know it's still relatively early days, but any early read into relative economics of what I would assume would be chunkier mandates, if you will?","Martin Flanagan","And you got cut off at the beginning, but I think I got the gist of it. It's really -- the question around solutions and how do you put together the various capabilities. It is an area that we are very, very focused on. I would say we're early days of success.","It depends on where in the world, probably -- opportunities are probably greatest at the moment for us in Asia, probably in China in particular. We're also seeing it on the continent. We also believe there should also be an opportunity here in the United States. It has just been relatively slower in those two regions.","Loren Starr","And early read on relative economics of chunkier mandates. We have seen no change in terms of the attractiveness of the mandates that will stay around stable value. The broad fixed income was one where we don't have as much scale, and so it's improving significantly as we generate more AUM in that category. So that's the two big movers.","In terms of GTR, the economics are excellent, similar to what we see across the cross-border range, so rates tend to be at the high end. So other than that, I think we have sort of discussed the other elements. They are all at margins that are very attractive to -- should be attractive and accretive to our margin overall.","Michael Kim","Got it. That's helpful. And then, just in terms of some of the newer vehicles we are seeing on the actively-managed ETF front, just given your market presence with power shares and as you communicate with your client, how important is non-transparent actively managed ETFs? Is that something that investors are really looking for, or is transparency in terms of portfolio holdings not really that high on the list for your clients?","Martin Flanagan","The conversation has been going on for some period of time. And if you remember, we have introduced two or three active ETFs five or six years ago. We were one of the firms ahead of the exemption. And I think I have said in the past, we still have them. They might have $3 million in them across the board, and it's probably our CTFO.","Loren Starr","And those are transparent.","Martin Flanagan","Those are transparent. So again, I'm just a big believer that at the end of the day, people don't invest in vehicles, per se. They invest in investment strategies first to meet their desired outcomes. The mutual fund vehicle is a spectacular vehicle for a long-term investors, and we all know the disclosure period on and the like, we have just not seen a lot of demand for non-transparent ETFs from our client base.","And some of the things that we look at, the things we are pointed to of the advantages, we think that you can solve any of those through share classes within mutual funds, too. That said, we are indifferent because we could do active ETFs ourselves, we have our existing ETFs and mutual funds. So we're just really -- we study it, and we're capable, but we're just not seeing demand, which is very counter to the commentary that you might be reading in the papers.","Michael Kim","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Next question coming from Robert Lee of KBW.","Robert Lee","Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked, but I did have one. This hasn't come up on your calls in a while, but relating to a potential M&A. You have done most of your product building in house for the last several years post the -- I can't remember the name of the acquisition. The Morgan Stanley acquisition. Haven't really done much, and you have talked about it being a low priority.","But I am just curious as you went through the product build-out cycle, have a lot of oars in the water, so to speak. Is there anything that as you've gone through that, you've said, gee we would have liked to have built this, and we just, for whatever reason, maybe it wasn't a capability we thought we could do, and does that at all kind of shape your thoughts about maybe going back and looking at some M&A here and there? Obviously maybe nothing large, but just your updated thoughts on that.","Martin Flanagan","Good question. They have not changed too much. I think you're right, and as Loren has said and we have said, we first look to advance the business looking internally, organic development, and that is what we have done. If you look at the range of capabilities right now, we don't see a lot of gaps, and during that process, we thought the gaps we had, we did solve internally so we don't see gaps right now. That said, that's continuing why it puts M&A on the back burner, because we look to M&A when we can solve the problem with the capabilities that we have.","Where we have done it though, Rob, it's more in India, that was a market that look over at a very long term, a good thing to do when we saw a way to get into India, and a relatively small investment, and we think it's a good investment over the long term. So it was more country than capabilities. But as I said earlier on the call, nothing looks obvious at all right now. That said, if the market does get very challenging, it's amazing what pops up in those periods, but it's not apparent at this time.","Robert Lee","All right. That was all I had. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. And we have another question coming from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","A couple of quick questions. One is on the alt and distribution. You mentioned earlier in the conversation that there is a high bar on the distributor side to accept alts. At least, that is my read of what you said. I am just wondering what is there for it, and is it simply a matter of time and performance over time to prove out, to get on platforms, or is there other things going on?","Martin Flanagan","So I think it's a good question. The reality, is although the desire is there, it's complicated; right? So really the distributors are working through a mechanism of what do they want on the platform? How do they get it on the platform? Education into the sales force is critical.","There's a lot of focus on making sure -- suitability and so these are -- to me, those will all really good developments. We don't want to be on a platform, and none of us want a bad outcome for our clients, so it has really been educating sales force. What are they trying to accomplish? What are the distributors saying? What capabilities do we have confidence in from the money manager, and so that's really what slowed it down. There are just a handful of alternative capabilities on the various platforms. We probably have as many as anybody in the market.","Betsy Graseck","Right.","Martin Flanagan","I think it will change though. I think it will pick up the pace as people get more confident.","Betsy Graseck","So it's dedicated sales team into distributors, as well as just helping them understand the various products?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. To be clear, I am also saying the distributors themselves, like a Morgan Stanley are spending a huge amount of time on education for the sales force there.","Betsy Graseck","Right.","Martin Flanagan","They want them very focused on suitability. It's jointly solving that problem. That is really the element where it's taking an awful lot of time.","Betsy Graseck","I got it.","Martin Flanagan","I think it's appropriate, by the way.","Betsy Graseck","Right, okay. And then separately. There has been -- a know your customer requirement, regulatory requirement in the asset management community as well. I think it's called FATCA. I'm wondering if that had any implications for flows, not only in this quarter but into the next couple of quarters, because I thought it went live July 1, and I was wondering if that was something that you could benefit from?","Loren Starr","As far as I know, we have been working on FATCA for two years now. It has not been anything that has surfaced in any of our conversations with any of our distributors or regions about clients being somehow disturbed or displaced or acting differently than they otherwise would. So at least from where I sit today and what I have heard, it's sort of been a non-event. It's probably been a lot of work, but it's not created a different demand behavior.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Chris Shutler of William Blair.","Chris Shutler","The long term net inflows continued to average somewhere in the mid to upper single digit billions per quarter, so quite encouraging. Just looking out over the next couple of years, recognizing it's tough to predict, but what do you think are the biggest opportunities and risks to that range from an asset class product perspective? I certainly recognize that part of your value proposition is having that diversification to be where the demand is, but I just wanted to get your take there.","Martin Flanagan","I think the biggest opportunity for us is people coming back to equities. It has been a long time, and I think they will. You can go back to the same percentages because of demographics, and et cetera, et cetera. That said, if you look at us as a firm, it's the historic strength of the firm, it is the broadest range of capabilities. When you get any active movement back into active equities, it is going to be quite a difference for us. What is the risk? You get into a very difficult bear market right now, and that could extend that outcome for quite a period of time. That said, everything we have been talking about today is the other side of -- it's a broad range of capabilities that puts us into an easy position.","Chris Shutler","And Loren, you mentioned that, it sounded like maybe you are pulling back on a little bit of spending here. What are you maybe delaying in terms of project spending, and what magnitude of dollars are we talking about? Thanks.","Loren Starr","It's an active discussion right now, so we are not at a point where I would say we would provide any different guidance than what we have in the past. As I said, our current guidance is pretty much in line with what we said before. It's going to be more of a discussion as we continue look, are we in a really turnaround, where flows are coming back. I'd just say it's one that we are looking at day-to-day.","In terms things that you could be delayed, there's certainly things that are prioritized and delayed, relative to other things you absolutely have to do because of client need or a regulatory need. That is the kind of thing that we are looking at, is could you delay three months or six months and not really affect clients in a regulatory situation.","Chris Shutler","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a last question coming from Gregory Warren of Morningstar.","Gregory Warren","Yes, thanks for taking my questions, although a lot of them have already been asked here. I may have missed it, but we talked about the fixed income flows being heavily influenced by some institutional mandates. Was that the same case for the balance, because that looked to spike up during the quarter?","Loren Starr","Well, the balance -- we saw a lot of interest in balance. That was really a continuation of interest in Europe. We have a very well-performing balance product that is managed out of our industrial perpetual team combines the capabilities of our equity teams and our fixed income teams. We also saw a lot of interest in balanced product in China. And in the balance category, we also have IBRA, which we have talked about institutionally has been of great interest and we're winning some good interest there.","Gregory Warren","You had mentioned the fact that the organic growth target on long-term assets is between that 3% and 5% range for the year. Do you just have a bit more clarity? Is there more institutional stuff in the pipeline? I think right now we are sitting in the 2% to 2.5% range.","Loren Starr","I think we absolutely see interest in the big institutional pipeline, as Marty said, all-time high plus, with retail coming back. Obviously, July was a bit of a lost month, and we are making good headway, but if we stay -- even if we stay at this $2 billion a quarter, sorry, $2 billion a month type of rate, we're going to be at that -- probably at 4%, just doing the math myself. So I think we're -- and I also think we can do better than that.","Gregory Warren","That's good to hear. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank do you. As of right now, we don't have any more questions on queue.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you very much, and thank you, everybody for joining Loren and myself, and have a good rest of the day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."],"12667":["Invesco Ltd.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] ","Now I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director, Investments. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Marty Flanagan","Thank you very much, and thank you, everybody, for joining us. The Q3 presentation is available on the website for your reference. But to allow more time for Q&A, we're going to shorten our prepared remarks and really get the questions quite quickly. So I'll just give a brief overview of the results and Loren make a couple of comments, and again, we'll get the questions, so we\u2019ll have more time to have a discussion.","So now only four months post the close of the acquisition of Oppenheimer made tremendous progress, bringing the two organizations together, and you can see by this quarter it's generating meaningful results already. As we've discussed on previous calls, we do look at this as a multiyear growth story that people's relationships in the U.S. provides this capabilities to take around the world, while also creative skills for organization. That said, the first full quarter of the combined organization has delivered powerful results. ","If you look at very strong earnings quarter-over-quarter generating $502 million operating income at 38% improvements as compared to last quarter. Operating margin expansion exceeding 500 basis points, taking our margin up to 40.9%. The combined firm added $200 million net revenues during the quarter, while adding only less than $60 million in expenses. And we're particularly pleased to announce that we're bringing on our expense synergies well ahead of schedule and exceeding our initial target of $475 million. We are now estimating savings of $501 million. ","Importantly, we achieved these results and what was a very challenging macroenvironmental flows and also been the early days this combination between our two organizations. During the quarter, clients reacted to the market news by keep risking, which resulted in outflows in our Americas and UK retail businesses. Flows in our legacy or byproducts low during the quarter, which we had expected, but they are stabilizing. We will speak about that in a couple of minutes. ","These outflows were offset by positive flows in China, EMEA, ex-U.K. business and ETFs. So the positive flows during the quarter really demonstrate the tremendous strength and potential to combination. Furthermore, the operating and financial strength of the combined firm enable us to return $440 million to common shareholders during the quarter through dividends and stock buybacks.","So finally, it is still very early days, but from our perspective, the initial results are very strong. Loren? ","Loren Starr","Great. Thanks, Marty. So before we get to Q&A, I wanted to spend a few moments highlighting some key items for you on the topics of flows and expense synergies, resulting from the Oppenheimer transaction. ","So if you look to Page 5 or Slide 5, we had $10.5 billion of net outflows in the Americas, majority of this is attributable to the retail business. On the next page, we drilled down on this a little more. ","So on Slide 6, we show that 2019 history of monthly gross sales and net flows for the Invesco and Oppenheimer U.S. active, retail products combined, which includes periods of both pre and post-close. It has had another way, this illustrates the trend for the two firms together over the entire period, including the pre-acquisition period. I think there are few important takeaways from this chart.","First, gross sales post-close are increasing, we see a positive trend line. However, while gross sales are improving, they\u2019re not yet to the pre-deal level. So there is obviously more room for improvement.","Second, the chart clearly highlights that the deal has had an impact on our gross sales levels. Integration of two sales team are well underway, and in fact, going quite well, but they\u2019re not yet complete. And as the integration is completed, we would expect the gross sales levels to come back to at least the pre-acquisition levels.","And, third point, net outflows have been more elevated post-close. But this is largely a function of the abnormally low gross sales level I just mentioned. And we\u2019d expect net flows to improve as we complete all phases of the sales integration work through this year and into 2020. While staying on the topic of flows but moving away from U.S. retail, I\u2019d like to point out that we continue to see a strong institutional pipeline.","The institutional won but not funded AUM continues to build quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And in particular notes, we were notified this quarter of $10 billion mandate, won by our solutions team, which is expected to fund in the first half of 2020. Also, we received notification of a recent $100 million when into the newly launched OFI emerging markets local debt fund on our cross-border fund range in EMEA.","It\u2019s still very early days, but we\u2019re beginning to see revenue synergies from the deal. There is strong retail and institutional interest in the OFI products and the pipeline is warming.","The next \u2013 let me move to the topic of expense synergies. If you\u2019ll recall, we have been projecting to achieve run rate net expense synergies of $475 million by the end of the first quarter of 2021. At the end of the third quarter, we achieved 105% of our synergy target or $501 million of run rate expense reductions for the combined organizations.","This represents an elimination of 15% to the expense base of the pre-combined organizations. We already saw that the opportunity to stay more than $475 million by the time of the transaction closing, we only had a clear line of sight, regarding the $475 million in savings. After we closed the deal, we were able to look deeper into the business and we started making significant progress on the integration. And we now see that we can run the business with this slower expense base.","There is still further integration work to be completed, but we\u2019re confident that we can deliver the higher level of expense synergy that we\u2019re presenting to you today. And as a reminder, the synergy level is net of investments made in areas that further strengthen our distribution and investment capabilities and processes and which allow us to drive future growth and avoid future cost.","We presented on Slide 9 of our deck summarizing these expense synergies, this illustrates the combined firms\u2019 representative run rate, annual operating expense base. But please do keep in mind that this assumes FX and market conditions are in line roughly with the end of Q3 levels.","So in summary, before we go to Q&A, let met just say that we see the potential for the long-term net flows to trend in the right direction, although that clearly not where we want them to be right now. One of the key areas of outflows we\u2019re experiencing is centered in U.S. retail space and that is largely due to the shortfall and gross sales that we expect will ultimately be corrected. And as the U.S. retail sales teams complete their integration.","We continue to work hard managing the things within our control, improving gross sales, funding greater expense savings and adding to our deal-related expense and revenue synergies, and continuing to invest in areas that we believe will allow us to grow more quickly in the future.","And with that, operator, I\u2019d ask you to please open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We do have our first question from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning.","Marty Flanagan","Good morning.","Ken Worthington","Can you first talk about the journey back to positive long-term net sales? So a positive net long-term sales, something you foresee for Invesco in 2020? And if not, 2020, when? And then, can you maybe describe the path to positive sales, which new or existing products or asset classes do you see driving the incrementally better sales or incrementally lower outflows that we\u2019re seeing today, the more specifically, you could be the better? And then why?","Marty Flanagan","Good question, Ken. Let me hit a couple of those and I\u2019ll ask Loren and Greg to pitch in, too. So let's say on the what Loren was pointed out about the deal because I think it's actually quite critical. The \u2013 to put sales force point in clarity as we've said in the past, literally the sales force now represents half of old Invesco, old OFI. They're literally going through training right now. ","We actually as you always do have disruption when you do transfer agency conversions in the like, they'll probably be up and running, I'd say fully into December, so I think early next year. And the quality of the team is the best we've ever had. So we've viewed that the historical gross sales. We will exceed those that will be, so when does that happen into next year, that will surely happen, ideally on the first half of next year from our perspective. Again, I'd put it in the context of Loren date of the \u2013 it all depends on the market, but with this market continues, that's what we foresee.","Loren Starr","Yes. I think in terms of the path to positive, so we're clearly saying we're going to become look like that's where really we're saying because of the sales improving. I think the path to positive is going to be a function of some other things that are \u2013 some within our control and some without of our control. So one thing that is still very much weighing on our flow picture for the firm globally is sort of just the macro environment and some of the political uncertainty that exists, where we see risk off, it's affecting everybody. ","And so in Europe for example, that risk off behaviors drove driven flows into cash and in a way from active products. And that's something that we can control, but we're definitely looking to see hopefully some of these events becoming more clear, Brexit being the most obvious one. The other element that I think is moving in a positive direction and is an important precursor to flows is performance. ","And we've had some headwinds around performance that we're beginning to see sort of a turnaround and particularly in sort of recent months where you can see just how strong the comeback or the pullback in performances when we see some release on some of these macro topics for example, what we're seeing in terms of what's going on in Europe and the UK has a big impact on our UK business. I think Greg, I mean, you can speak to that a little bit if you want.","Greg McGreevey","Yes. Maybe can just to get a little granular to the essence of your question. So it's that intersection between demand and performance. Maybe point to kind of four or five areas to get to the specific question that you asked on. One would be fixed income, where as you know, we have very strong performance. We're seeing quite strong demand in almost all markets. Part of the transaction that we talked about before with Oppenheimer was to really leverage their global equity capability, which is incredibly strong. ","There's quite strong demand for global equities and its various flavors in a lot of markets outside of the U.S. And so we're seeing that, I think ETFs and the traction that Loren kind of mentioned with this when we're going to hopefully see in the first quarter and when it farms in solutions. We're seeing that traction really take shape in almost kind of all markets, if you will. And then global liquidity, that was kind of mentioned as one of those areas, not only in China that we talked about on prior calls, but we're just kind of seeing that in other markets. ","So that's really for I think the gross sales side and where that demand and performance, where we have that strong performance kind of intersects. Clearly, we're seeing some \u2013 on the redemption side, some important performance improvements in a number of those funds that have had the most significant amount of outflows. I'm happy to drill into those numbers, but I think on a year-to-date basis, which is still short-term for most of our funds, both here with the legacy Oppenheimer, we're seeing some notable improvement that has to continue. But if we see that in concert with those things that I talked about, that's really how I think we get to the positive flow picture.","Ken Worthington","Okay, thank you. And then on the synergies, can you talk about the outlook from here both synergies and dis-synergies? So maybe starting with dis-synergies, I believe there's still a 529 plan outflow. I think that's a fourth quarter event. Correct me if I'm wrong. Any other deal related dis-synergies that we should expect in the near-term. ","And then on the cost side, you took out $501 million. Is that the end number we should expect? In other words, if you get more, do you are reinvested? Are you going to reinvest some of the $501 million? And if not, any idea on how much more we'll be able \u2013 shareholders will be able to keep that wouldn't be reinvested.","Loren Starr","So Ken, on the first point that the synergies, you're correct, there's the $2 billion New Mexico outflow that is to be expected in the fourth quarter. That has been dis-synergy. The only other dis-synergies are the ones we just talked about in terms of the gross sales being abnormally low, some of the kind of a general disruption related to GA conversions. I mean those have been dis-synergies to the flow picture that should end. We're seeing begin to improve overtime, but there isn't anything else that we know of in terms of dis-synergy, and if anything, again, we're seeing more positive revenue synergies that take on potential for the products in the C Caps in Europe for example is a good real live flow coming in. ","In terms of the $501 million, that number is net of investments. So that is the number that we are saying you're going to get. There is no intention for us to invest through that number. So that's the bottom line. There are more opportunities for us to sort of generate more synergies. We believe some of that may get invested, some may drop to the bottom line. We're at this point comfortable with the $501 million. And we will continue to keep you updated in terms of the potential upside on that number.","Ken Worthington","Thank you very much. ","Marty Flanagan","You're welcome. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open. ","Mike Carrier","Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. First one just on the sales and the flows, I think Marty, you mentioned over the past, probably one to two years, there's been some negative impacts the business, whether it was Brexit and some of the European headwinds and then on the value side versus growth, that being the headwind. It seems like some of those things are at least starting to potentially like shift gear. But just wondering if you're seeing any early signs some like improvement on that front.","Marty Flanagan","Yes. So look what we think are fundamental strengths of our organization. So I think EMEA, I think Asia-Pac, Brexit and trade wars, they have just tremendous headwinds for us and against, so posting results in light of that, it's not an excuse, it's just a reality. We are sensing with Brexit in particular, certainly end game coming here \u2013 like to starting to see just recently the performance is starting to pick up very strongly, which is a very good sign. ","And so again they say hope is not a strategy, but you definitely are sensing some relief here. And look, we have Sterling being at, what is it 120, 129 is a whole lot different than 119. So again some of these \u2013 be able to continue to manage through it, but any relief is just really powerful. They get on a few anything in the performance.","Greg McGreevey","Yes. My quick, I think the rotation is starting to happen from a growth to value. The market's starting to recognize, but not all companies are the same. Some make better capital allocation and are able to produce different returns on investment. So we're starting to see probably the most impactful thing is a lower correlation of stocks to the index. And that really gives our active managers, the ability to use their strong stock picking skills. And so I think that's part of the reason when we kind of look at our year-to-date performance improvement, it's really the result of some of those factors that has kind of allowed our performance to improve the $64,000 question is always, is that going to continue? ","The one thing we know is, it's not going to continue forever in terms of what we've seen over the course of the last 10 years. So it gives us some comfort that when this does change, given the strong teams that we have, we'll be able to generate the performance that you've come to expect. ","Mike Carrier","Okay, thanks. And then Loren, maybe just on the fee rate, so you got to bump this quarter with Oppenheimer, the trend over the past couple of years has been a little bit more on the negative side. You've just given the expansion on the ETF front and then the industry is seeing some pricing pressures. There's some news on FMAs that that's coming under pressure as well on some platforms. But just when you look at some of the investments that you guys are making and now with Oppenheimer, on the platform, I know it's tough to predict, but do you see some areas that yes, like higher fee, like momentum or trends versus some of the areas that are going to pressure that fee rate overtime. Is any update on how you're thinking about that and then managing expenses with that mind?","Loren Starr","So it's a very dynamic, there are a lot of puts and takes in the fee rate. There are some definitely some positive things in our fee rate. In terms of we've talked about in the past with our institutional pipeline, where the assets that are funding are in a higher fee rates in the assets declining. We continue to build out I think a strong set of capabilities around alternatives, which tend to have a higher fee rates and aren't going to be sort of pressured by indexing. ","We are also very supportive and like our ETF business and we want to continue to grow it. And so those are coming in at lower fee rates and that is a good thing for us. They are great margin products as long as you can grow them quickly and sort of great scale and those products, we embrace that phenomenon and want to grow that part of the book.","I think it is very hard to provide guidance on this measure just in general. And really there's just so much that's outside of our control in terms of the mix of products not to mention currency in markets. So we're probably not in a great position or we're probably more likely to refrain on providing guidance on fee rate going forward just because it is so dynamic. But I would say it's a real even fight in terms of the things that are sort of helping us on the fee rate on the positive side versus things that may be putting it to the flip side.","Mike Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot. ","Loren Starr","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe if I'm wondering if you could just go into just the integration process and you realize obviously you've hit the $500 million of cost, but like you said there's definitely so more work to do. It's still pretty early. Maybe just can you outline what types of things are being done over the next couple quarters? For example, the any kind of back office arrangement on custody fund accounting in mid-office if that's in process for the combined organization, in any thoughts on how much product rationalization has contributed to the $500 million and in any future rationalization that might be planned from that?","Marty Flanagan","Let me hit a couple of things and then Loren and Greg can pitch in. So yes, so all the systems have converted over to our systems from Oppenheimer. So that's a good development. We still have with the transfer agency, one more software upgrade that will happen at the end of November, all the middle and back office will end up converting through next year again. So still I think first quarter 2021, as we said. So that's in progress too. And those are the areas where we'll know more when we get in \u2013 further into it, but that's all underway right now.","Loren Starr","Yes. I think listen, it's the fund mergers and those types of product rationalizations have not happened yet. So that's not part of inherently the $501 million. There may be some sort of incremental savings associated that there's probably some incremental investments as well, that we're hoping to do. So I'd say really it is \u2013 the $501 million is a number that we feel extremely confident that we'll be able to deliver through a variety, they are right now. We are going to continue to look at some of the other integration opportunities really around tech, run operations as well. Some \u2013 there's all sorts of efficiencies that we can still continue to create in our sales efforts, as well as our investment efforts. So I can't get too specific at this point, but ultimately, we're still looking at the wide range of opportunities around this integration as we get closer to the business. ","Marty Flanagan","I do want to come back to the product rationalization, think of, it's a small thing, not a big thing. And I think I've spent some overreaction to it in the past. So it's a small thing, not a big thing, just remember that. ","Greg McGreevey","Yes. Maybe just to put a finer point on that, Marty, I mean, I think when you look at the impacted assets, we think it's around 2% of our total assets, roughly 14 legacy, Invesco maybe 15 OppenheimerFunds. So we're not in the grand scheme of our whole product mix. It's really a both small percentage of funds, and if even smaller percentage of assets.","Brian Bedell","That color is really helpful. Is it clear to think that operating margin obviously is going up from the 40% that we're already seeing, because there's sounds like there'll be incremental savings of course, revenue dependent. But maybe just also talk about the growth sale initiatives and the potential to improve that from even levels before the deal, to what extent can you do that through the institutional offering of the Oppenheimer products in the potential sale of Oppenheimer retail in Europe. And I guess any color for $10 billion mandate on the solutions team in terms of what disciplines that's coming in?","Marty Flanagan","Yes, so look, I could be repeating myself, but there's nothing we are full steam ahead on driving gross sales right now. And I said previously, if you look at the most acute area where there was disruption, it was a U.S. wealth management platform. We think January 1st, we'll be on our front feet and full steam ahead and we anticipate seeing higher gross sales on the back of that. Greg mentioned, we do now have alarming here. We do now have six OppenheimerFunds on the C Cap range to set road shows in Europe for two weeks ago, so early days. But as Loren said, I think we saw already $100 million, it's not going to change our world, but that's very, very fast and it's going to continue.","So what we're seeing institutionally is, I talked about lot going on a fixed income, lot going on a real estate. So that really the also part of the business continues to be in high demand institutionally and to looking for some opportunities in the retail channel. So we're very excited about what's in front of us. ","Loren Starr","Yes. And I think we also haven't yet fully sort of explored the full opportunity with MassMutual and there the revenue synergies working with their advisors. Again as we've talked in the past they have 8,500 advisors. They're the seventh largest distribution for us in wealth management space. And so we are now actively working with MassMutual with our products and our solutions that we trying to understand what is a good fit within their network. That has yet to sort of get plugged in. So that we'll provide some further lift that was not there pre-deal for any of the combined firms just as an example. ","Marty Flanagan","And again, we've not talked about as we really like our position in China and we just see that rapidly growing in the quarters and years ahead. ","Greg McGreevey","Yes. And I think this relates to Oppenheimer, maybe you can just put a finer point on, one of the biggest opportunities we see is to promote the legacy OppenheimerFunds into both retail and institutional channels. We've been spending a lot of time post the merger between investments marketing and distribution. Those would be things like our global equity suite, things on the global fixed income side, muni bonds to mention kind of three very specific areas. And so we're optimistic, it's still kind of early days, but we really come together across those three areas to see again and that intersection between demand and where we have investment capabilities, so where we're going to be able to get out to prospects and clients. ","Loren Starr","And Brian just on the color on the $10 billion solutions when it's not a appropriate for us to talk about, it\u2019s just the client has not sort of released their own notification of that. So when it comes public, we'll be able to talk a little bit more about that deal. ","Brian Bedell","Okay, fair enough. Thanks for all the details. That\u2019s very helpful. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Ryan Bailey","Good morning. This is actually Ryan Bailey on behalf of Alex. I was wondering going back to Slide 9, if we're looking at that $2.9 billion number. Is that the right run rate, I guess as we should be thinking about the expense base entering 2020? And then are there any puts and takes in that number? And then maybe coming back to the $501 million, that's a net synergy number. Can you give us a little bit of color around like maybe how much investments would be included in the gross number, and then where those investments are going?","Greg McGreevey","Yes. So on the $2.905 billion that is the right run rate for you to be assuming going into through 2020. We feel confident, again, assuming kind of markets flat to September and effects that that number is definitely achievable, if not \u2013 if one that we can do better on. In terms of their $501 million that is a net number, there is about $30 million of investment that is already been done relative to the Oppenheimer transaction. ","So you can think about our gross number being closer to $531 million. And so the $501 million, and those have been areas that where we invested around technology, sort of their sales team effectiveness, really again trying to create a better platform for WMI business to be successful. We do think there's opportunity for us to invest more and we do plan to invest more to continue to grow and make our team more effective. That will be some \u2013 will be entirely funded by further sort of integration or savings. But with that said, there is opportunity for us to deliver more net synergies to the bottom line beyond the $501 million. We believe, but we're not at the point where we're able to commit to that.","Ryan Bailey","Got it, okay. And then maybe if we turn to capital for a second, so you've done two forwards over the last two quarters. It's about $500 million, it sounds like you're \u2013 you have to pay out between sort of 1Q and 2Q 2021. Do you expect to do any more of these over the next call or year or so? And then is there any shift in capital priorities overall?","Greg McGreevey","Good question. The answer is no. We don't intend to do any more forwards at this stage. We think that we will still be doing buybacks, but there's only $260 million left on the remainders stub of what our commitment is. And that's one that a commitment that we think we can complete over through open market purchases easily and effectively without using foreign purchases. So that is going to be done, probably through the course of 2020. The \u2013 in terms of changes to capital priority, there are no changes to the capitol priority. We continue to focus on first returning capital to organic needs, through seed is not seeing significant needs around seed above and beyond expectations.","So we think that is largely sort of status quo. We want to continue to be able to grow our dividends every year under our markets. And so that's still part of our priority. And then the remainder of capital will be returned to shareholders through buybacks. So that priority is still exists. I will say that we still is very important to us to maintain our investment credit rating and we also want to continue to build cash. So we have $1 billion of cash in excess of what is required from a regulatory perspective. All that is consistent with our past priorities and all are still intact in terms of our thinking.","Ryan Bailey","Got it. Thank you very much.","Greg McGreevey","You're welcome. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on that last one on the expense comment on the $2.905 billion. Loren, I just wanted to kind of clarify, because previously you guys had walked through the synergy, the expense synergy quarter by quarter, and you've upsized the ultimate target. So $475 million goes to $501 million that's really clear. It clear that your end run rate for expenses would be the $2.905 billion. But I thought in your response to the prior question, you said that that the $2.905 billion would be the run rate entering in 2020, but I'd thought previously you had said the expense synergies you get there by the time you exit 1Q 2021. Is that \u2013 is the previous timeline still intact or you accelerating the timeline too?","Marty Flanagan","We are accelerating the timeline. So we're delivering the full synergies, 105% of the synergies effective this quarter, so pretty much all that kind of wait for it to come has gone. We can declare victory effectively in terms of bringing you that run rate effective this quarter. I think the point that we're trying to make, or I've been making that there's still integration work happening in the background, but we are getting the synergies and those savings effective this quarter into Q4 into \u2013 first quarter 2020 so far. So that that is hopefully it helps answer your question.","Brennan Hawken","It does. It's very clear. Thank you. Sorry if that's a \u2013 if it was redundant and previously indicated, I just wanted to clarify. ","Marty Flanagan","No need to worry.","Brennan Hawken","Yes, agreed. Good and helpful. So there was previously referenced the announcement we got recently from Wirehouse expected to launch a program optional for participating asset managers on SMA products. Is this a sort of product that you think would be compelling? I know that a lot of times on the shelf having a \u2013 you got to have a good product, it's got to be the performance has to be strong, the value add has to be clear, but it also has to be at a compelling value, a compelling fee rate, especially versus the peers. ","So is this the sort of program while not \u2013 maybe not commenting specific to any program, because I know you wouldn't want to do that until then front run. But is this a sort of program that you think would be compelling? Is this a sort of program that you think you would participate in? And do you think it would help accelerate your sales in that important broker sold channel for you? Thanks.","Loren Starr","Yes. So Brennan I think just to put some context in terms of the SMA business generally, we're currently ranked 36 in the industry. So it's not a big part of our business. We have sort of under $10 billion in overall SMA business. I think related to that particular platform that you're talking about our exposures probably less than $0.5 billion. So it\u2019s not a big deal for us, just in general. We did see it. It is little too early for us to say just how interesting and attractive, it might be for us. There is definitely some potential upside but also some things that we have to get an understanding before we said it would be interesting for us to participate. And\u2026","Marty Flanagan","Yes. And I just add, just listening to our conversation today, we just have so many opportunities in different channels to work in, within the United States retail institutional globally and our focus continues to be there. And that\u2019s where we see the excitement and really what\u2019s going to be the force behind, you can see the growth of the organization. So, again, we have plenty to work with what\u2019s on our plate right now.","Brennan Hawken","All right, fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.","Marty Flanagan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Patrick Davitt","Hey, good morning guys. Thank you. Another one on the $2.9 billion run rate, understanding that\u2019s kind of a baseline for 2020. Should we\u2019d still assume \u2013 to the extent, we assume asset inflation in our models, some upside to that with kind of normal increase in expenses related to asset build. Or is that really kind of what you think it will be and can go lower from there?","Loren Starr","Yes. So I think we made a caveat, which is that\u2019s based on sort of assets based on September AUM, as we saw a huge market up tick, there\u2019s definitely some amount of variability in our incentive plans that would scale up, which is what we \u2013 you\u2019d expect. Similarly, as we saw a down market, we would also sort of see that flex down. So there\u2019s normal kind of variability that would happen around incentive plans. But, ultimately, there is no \u2013 you should not expect to any sort of hidden inflation numbers into 2020 on this number at all. This number, we\u2019re feeling is comfortable based on the current AUM levels.","Patrick Davitt","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then when you announced the deal, you kind of announced an expectation of, I think 2 basis points of revenue yield deterioration from breakage. Is that related to the rationalization process? So we should still expect that when you do rationalize or is that something separate?","Loren Starr","That is something that would include the potential for breakage with those rationalizations. And again, that was $45 million. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anywhere near that amount, as I think it was already discussed. It\u2019s a small number of amounts of products or assets in general. So I think as I\u2019 mentioned in the past, that $45 million could be an upside to the overall modeling and the fee rate deterioration that we\u2019ve provided in terms of deal economics.","Operator","Does that conclude your question, Patrick?","Patrick Davitt","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Your line is open.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Fortunate, I do want to spend on more time on this $2.9 billion, because I\u2019m still actually a little confused by it, so I apologize, but my denseness. So is there enough synergies go forward from here that could offset the inflation to the extent that flows worth to build against the path that you think that could play through. And just assuming a \u201cnormalized\u201d market with so called $0.07 for equities? I\u2019m just trying to sort of see, how that $2.9 my trend as the business gets a little bit better.","Loren Starr","We haven\u2019t done the sensitivity. I mean, I think if you look at how the firm has \u2013 it\u2019s a bonus pools, it\u2019s really the largest component of it. And it\u2019s a percentage of PCBOI. It\u2019s in the proxy. It\u2019s kind of, that\u2019s how we operate. It\u2019s the same concept that\u2019s going to come into a sec going forward. So if we see flows really driving, higher levels of AUM, which we\u2019d love to see or if the market improves from here, you\u2019re going to see sort of just a normal type of flex around those types of bonus pools. So again, I would point you to kind of our past experience, the same kind of set of ratios that you\u2019ve seen in the past in terms of how complexes with revenues and assets.","Marty Flanagan","Bill, I think the point out, profitability will improve if that\u2019s really the underlying question and you would get a margin expansion in that scenario that you\u2019re talking about it. That\u2019s the fundamental question.","Loren Starr","Yes. The incremental margin is still at the high level of 50% to 65%, as assets and revenues grow.","Bill Katz","Okay, that is very helpful. Just two more questions and just [indiscernible] On the institutional channel, I certainly appreciate the notion that your pipeline is getting better and the fee rate underneath that is better than what\u2019s going out the door. But when I look at just over the slide that continues to sort of point to flattish flow Page 5 \u2013 flattish flows overall. At what point does some of that very strong pipeline feed into maybe a more positive growth? Or maybe another way to think about is where you losing traction, where you\u2019re gaining traction?","Loren Starr","I think, in terms of pipeline as we send, we\u2019re gaining traction in some of the places that were quite successful in China, Greater China. So geographically that\u2019s been really a strong area for growth across all sorts of asset classes in Chinese equities fixed income. I think it has a lot of upside for us as we continue to see success and further penetration in that market. We do think that Europe is got a lot of opportunity, particularly as we build out the solutions capabilities and we are meeting the needs around fixed income and general use of factors and other capabilities that have been part of our growth engine story for some time. So those are upsides. Real estate continues to be a major driver of opportunity for the firm overall.","I think in terms downside, there isn\u2019t a ton of downsides. We don\u2019t see sort of big likely to terminates or sort of big ugly story on the downside for institutional. The reason that as it kind of turned negative here, it\u2019s been largely because of the volatile market that we\u2019ve been in and some of the fundings have slowed just because of the uncertainty, work that we\u2019re doing in Europe and UK have definitely slowed to some extent just because of the \u2013 sort of the risk off a behavior that we\u2019re seeing is people want to understand what direction \u2013 things are going in. And so we do believe that, I mean, those numbers are going to fund. It\u2019s just a matter of timing.","Bill Katz","Thank you. Just one last clarification I probably did, I think you covered before on that $10 billion mandate that you expect to find in the first half of the year. Is there a way to think about the fee rate associated with that? I apologize, if you already covered that.","Loren Starr","Yes. Again, just because it hasn\u2019t been disclosed publicly, we\u2019re not going to talk about it, because it really will be transparent to the client and if and when they disclose it. So we just think it\u2019s appropriate for us to be talking about fee rates for clients.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. My question is around the UK, obviously, Brexit has been an overhang, but also there\u2019s been the scrutiny of Woodford and the asset management industry as a whole. Could you talk about, kind of perpetual, because they\u2019re being brought into same in the same discussions around the platforms and how these funds are being sold and you obviously your performance there has been hit? And so I guess just in general, can you talk about the outlook for perpetual, what any ramifications you may or may not expect from some of the platforms and how funds were sold and how your business practice might differ from the way it\u2019s been written about in the price for other funds?","Marty Flanagan","Look, it\u2019s a good question. And you obviously it\u2019s very topical in the UK, yes, I can\u2019t speak for win, but what I will say, one of the most fundamental things that we did, strategically was purchasing Intelliflo. And that\u2019s early days, but that is really a very powerful platform that we think is going to make quite a difference for us in that marketplace. And you should realize, if 35% market share, we\u2019ve just please the model portfolios, it\u2019s early. Clients are starting to go on the platform. It\u2019s going to start picking up next year. And I think that was a very important strategic decision that we made.","And with regard to investment performance, again, these markets more recently have been very, very positive for us and in those teams. And the combination thereof I think puts us in a good place. And this is how, speaking at a retail level, I think as what you\u2019re addressing. Institutionally, we continue to be very, very strong in the market and growing. Greg, I don\u2019t know, if you want add anything.","Greg McGreevey","Look, I think just highlight the year-to-date improvement that we\u2019ve seen in our Henley business overall, especially on the equity side with a number of our assets, especially those that have had the most significant size in the top half of peers improving pretty dramatically from 2018 and 2017. So don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of the fact that it\u2019s relatively short term performance. But September was an especially strong month for performance within the Henley equity side and so we're travelling definitely in the right direction if you will. And we've seen significant improvement also within the Henley fixed income side.","So the one thing I think on that business because is kind of gets to outflows and what we may see there, I think that group historically, like a lot of our other equity teams has an incredibly strong culture, skill and capabilities. And I think that team historically has produced incredibly strong performance. It's really been the recent market environment in the short run has kind of impacted our performance notwithstanding with the positive things that have happened on year-to-date basis.","So, I'm highly confident that we'll be able to given those skills to return back to what we would expect that group and what they historically have produced in terms of performance. And Marty?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. The Brexit coming into the market environment has been a tremendous headwind for us, but that's a high degree of confidence in our investment teams. And at some point it will not be a risk off world and we anticipate, we are participating very strongly in it.","Dan Fannon","I guess to clarify on the performance, I'm looking at Slide 14 and I look at the UK on the one, three and five year numbers. And so what improvement are you citing I guess or is it somewhere else that I could see that?","Loren Starr","Yes, so this is at the end of \u2013 so this is \u2013 looking at it on a one year basis, I was giving you a year-to-date numbers. So the four quarter of last year as I think you know is an especially troubling year for kind of all equity performance. And so that really impacted when you looked at the one year performance at the end of September of 2019 those numbers, if you look at it on a year-to-date basis you would definitely see improvement.","And then I was referencing specifically the September number where we had roughly about 90% of all of our assets within the Henley group in the top half of our peer groups. So again, it's relatively short-term, but we're starting to see that trend in the right direction for the same reasons that we talked about earlier. Well, hopefully did that clarify?","Dan Fannon","Yes, yes it does. And then just a follow-up on Asia, outside of money markets, I guess what products are selling in that region? And I just kind of what \u2013 I guess or what are you or where you see potential other kind of avenues of growth in that region?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. So through Invesco Great Wall its very broad, equity products are very, very strong, highly performing they are recognized as one of the top tier local money managers there. Institutionally, in China it's very broad, heavy real estate fixed income [indiscernible] market to add, so very broad and very deep in that area.","Dan Fannon","Okay. Thank you.","Marty Flanagan","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Michael Cyprys","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just hoping to dig in a little bit more on the institutional channel, it's good to hear that the pipeline is up and improving here. Just hoping you could talk a little bit about some of the investments that you've been making in the institutional business, particularly around data, technology and also the ability to customize. And I guess the question is how is your approach different today versus say two years ago and what might be most different as you look out over the next two to three years?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. Look it's a great question and let me hit on a couple of points and I'll have Greg pitch into. I think we and all our competitors would tell you it's a great opportunity. The other reality is the demands on clients have never been \u2013 from clients has never been stronger. And so this depth and breadth of investment capabilities has mattered, but right behind it exactly what you're talking about investments in technology around analytics, insights, has been very material. And if we look at this beyond its a necessity as you're going to compete and win with institutions, thought leadership is an another area that becomes very, very important in these conversations because what we're seeing with appliances, they're wanting to work with us very deeply and very broadly and so its effectively opening up the organization to whatever set of capabilities that we have and so it's been material and it's been real.","Greg, what would you think?","Greg McGreevey","Yes I think, the big three areas that we've invested in are capabilities on the solutions front, the client experience, which would be both technology and systems as well as thought leadership where we've added with very strong content from our investment teams, the ability both in marketing and within that group to be able to provide that content into the marketplace.","On the solutions front, it's been one of the largest investments I think we've made as an organization. And the ability to partner with clients to help them create outcomes that they really desire is where the market is moving to. And it gives us, I think, an ability because of the individual resources and expertise that we've added to really have the conversations that we need to, and provide those outcomes that I think are so \u2013 the clients are looking for.","Part of the reason that we were able to talk about that client on the institutional side and a lot of the other pipeline is really the result of that investment that we made a number of years ago in solutions. We wouldn't have been able to obtain that client, when we talked about that was $10 billion without the investment that we made. And we're seeing a lot of momentum with other clients as a result of those three areas that I kind of talked about and Marty talked about within the institutional side. And we think that's only going to be a trend that will continue. So we're excited about that.","Michael Cyprys","Great. And just a quick follow-up, is there any way to sort of quantify, I guess, how much investment spend is currently in the expense run rate and how we should think about that, if anything kind of peeling back over the next couple of years or if that get recycled into other investments? How should we be thinking about it?","Marty Flanagan","So, we have an enormous amount of investments in our run rate. I think we've \u2013 it\u2019s well in excess of sort of $100 million of investments just generally around the firm across a variety of growth engine areas that we've talked about in the past around China, around solutions, around factor-based investing. So that is \u2013 in our run rate, we expect to continue to build that number over time, but offset that with further savings as we talked about through synergies and just general, sort of prudent expense management and discipline.","Loren Starr","And I think the key thing for where we're at within solutions, which is kind of a broad area, we feel quite confident that the majority of the investments that we've made within solutions has already been made. Although the other things that we might need to do on the distribution side and in another areas to kind of support that, but, we really feel like we've made the significant amount of headway into the individuals that we've need to hire there.","Greg McGreevey","And really \u2013 again, just to put some, how do we see it and what have we done? Our solutions team uses our capabilities, right? I think that's quite different than what a number of our competitors do. So literally, sort of sits on top of \u2013 looking through all the investment capabilities that we have and it's really hand in hand with the clients. And what we're seeing clients do where if you go back two and three and four years, it was more of what product does a client want and what do we have doesn't match off much more. It's becoming a much more holistic engagement with our clients. Now it might be a capability or second capability, but it's really that insights and analytics that is really just changing the dynamic with the client for any institutional money manager to be successful in our view.","Michael Cyprys","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.","Glenn Schorr","Thank you. I want to drill down a little bit more on the MassMutual potential. You mentioned the 8,500 advisors, you also in the past talked about the general account. The advisors are not the same type of businesses as the retail broker dealers, the wire houses. So can you talk about what you expect to be selling into that channel? What do they typically consume and how quickly that can be? And then anything you could add on the general account, that'd be great?","Greg McGreevey","So look with MassMutual, again, I'd say early days, it's a very strong robust relationship and we're working through those multiple areas that we've talked about. What we'll do better on is telling you once we've accomplished something as opposed to what's coming that's not been received. So what not these calls, that said with the 8,500, we\u2019re looking at building models for that sales force. And you can think of traditional investment capabilities that would be available, some of the other wire houses. So it's not as different as \u2013 it is different. But again, the commonality is there that, [indiscernible] frankly, we are in multiple conversations around the general accounts, right now with MassMutual. And again, once we accomplish something, we'll let you know.","Glenn Schorr","And the models are that a product of Jemstep being\u2026","Greg McGreevey","It's really the solutions team that's doing them sort of building a combination of our active and factor capabilities and in consultation with the CIO and what they are looking for their client base.","Glenn Schorr","Cool. And then maybe just you could just update us on GTR. I wish that on the past and choppy markets like we saw this quarter, that was decent backdrop for GTR, just \u2013 if you could just talk about what you're seeing on the ground in terms of potential demand?","Loren Starr","I mean, I think what we've seen is, there's been a fair amount of outflow in the retail side, particularly in EMEA as that product has underperformed some loss. And I think there's sort of generally been, again, as I mentioned, sort of risk loss and people have sort of moved into cash. It still actually appeals to a lot of people in principle in terms of what it's trying to achieve as an outcome in a lower risk than the equity markets with good return over cash. It's currently, I think, it\u2019s somewhat underperforming that level maybe by 200, 300 basis points. It's been improving in the current market. And so the performance has instead of come \u2013 is moving in the right direction. So again, we're hopeful that we can see that product at least stabilize at a minimum as opposed to sort of currently where it's in that flow.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Thanks, Loren.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kenneth Lee","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just to follow-up on the UK flows, I'm looking at it from a broader perspective. Just wanted to get some of your thoughts, whether any of the recent regulatory activity or Brexit have been changing client preferences over the past year? And maybe just how would you characterize the sentiment of clients within the UK?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. Look, it is a \u2013 yes, it's really wearing on clients, right. It's been about Brexit transition has been a long and difficult, but from our perspective, where it's really come to light where you can feel it. It's really 2018 into this year. I mean, you can see it in our business, you can see it in the actions of clients and what they're doing. So it's more of a movement to risk off cash type things. So we're seeing less of a movement towards passive as you see here in the United States. So again, it has been a headwind. Again, so what have we done about it? We take it\u2019s been very important to change our ways to support our clients and Intelliflo was an important part of that. And again, it was [indiscernible]","Greg talked about the active performance was picking up what we are, as you see now and our portfolios are \u2013 we are bringing factors and passive into the market. And that is also something that we'll need to be on the Intelliflo from also that trend will pick up there in our mind. And again, I think you can see it just more broadly from our ETF flows throughout EMEA that is incredible strong. And right now, we're the number two flowing ETF provider in that part of the world.","So again, source transaction was very important for us and we see that pace just picking up as we look to the future. And if you remember when you go back when we announced it, you can look at the ETF business in EMEA literally looks like its 10 years behind where the United States was. And that was a couple of years ago. And you are absolutely seen that demand pickup as we anticipated, and we are a beneficiary of that. And we looked at that as another area of very important growth for us.","Kenneth Lee","Great. That's helpful. And just one more looking further out when you take into account, potential synergies with MassMutual fully integrated sales force being able to leverage a broader product set. Any updated thoughts on what could be like a long term potential organic growth expectations for the combined Invesco and OppenheimerFunds complex?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. I wish I had that crystal ball, but what I will tell you is, our organic growth rate will exceed that of our competition. And we've strongly believe with what we're building and what we have built, puts us in a very strong position for where the industry is going and how we're position against it. And so we are starting to see that in very \u2013 the areas that we've talked about on this call. Are they all at full potential? Absolutely not. But they are absolutely contributing, right now we're seeing it and you're seeing it and we're very excited about it.","Kenneth Lee","Great. Thanks.","Marty Flanagan","Yes.","Operator","At this time, we have no further question.","Marty Flanagan","Great. Again, on behalf of Loren, Greg and myself, thank you for your time and appreciate the questions and the dialogues. And have a great day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to the speakers for today, Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin L. Flanagan","Thank you very much, and thanks, everybody, for joining us. I'll speak to the presentation on the website, if you're so inclined to follow. And I'll go through business results, and Loren will get into the greater detail on the financials. And as always, Loren and I will address any questions people have afterwards.","So if you happen to be following, I'm starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. To get started, long-term investment performance remained very strong for Invesco across the board in the first quarter. And again, we continue to see some areas of exceptional investment performance. And on the back of the strong investment performance, we contributed to a continued trend of positive long-term net inflows for the firm in spite of the continuing volatility in the marketplace. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of net positive long-term flows for the firm, which we think is quite strong in consideration of the marketplace that we evolve and operating in. ","And importantly, during the quarter, we're raising our quarterly dividend 41% to $0.1725 per share, reflecting continued confidence in the fundamentals of our business. And during the quarter, we've repurchased 3.1 million shares for $75 million.","Taking a look at the summary results for the quarter. Assets under management ended the quarter at $672 billion versus $625 billion at the end of 2011. Invesco continued to generate a strong long-term investment performance for our clients during the quarter, which contributed to the net long-term inflows of $7 billion. This further extended the positive trend that we've demonstrated over the last several quarters.","Operating income rose to $269 million versus $256 million in the fourth quarter last year. The operating margin was 36.6% during the first quarter, again, expanding over the fourth quarter operating margin of 35.8%.","Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.44 per share, up approximately 5% quarter-over-quarter. And again, Loren will go into a much greater detail with the financial results.","Let's take a moment and look at investment performance, and again, it's our continued commitment to investment excellence and the hard work to build and maintain the culture. The strong investment culture has generated this strong long-term investment performance across the enterprise. And if you take a look over at the firm as a whole, 65% of the assets were ahead of peers on a one-year basis and 77% of assets were ahead of peers on a 5-year basis. ","And as we mentioned the last quarter, the softness in the 3-year number reflects the rolling off of some very strong numbers in the fourth quarter 2008 and a brief period where we trailed the market during that snapback data rally in the early part of 2009. Based on the strength of the recovery later in that year in 2009, we would expect that 3-year numbers to solidify in mid-2012.","Moving on to flows, again strong investment performance contributed to positive inflows in spite of the volatile markets. And as I've mentioned earlier, net long-term inflows totaled $7 billion for the quarter. During the first quarter, we saw a strong client interest in the balanced risk allocation product, real estate capabilities, ETFs and also in areas such as international equity, bank loans, munis, stable value. So it was really some broadness in the interest across the organization. ","Globally, the ABRA suite of product is generating tremendous interest from clients who are attracted to what is a very effective investment capability in this very volatile market. And also the top decile performance has been generated by the investment team. And as a result of the strong performance, ABRA flows were $3.4 billion during the first quarter. And this represents a 40% organic growth rate versus just last quarter. So it's an accelerating level of interest into this investment capability.","The ABRA suite of products that's closing in our 3-year track record. That is during June that will happen. And as a result, we are seeing more clients add these capabilities to their platforms. We also saw a solid uptick in ETFs during the quarter as more investors put equity and higher yielding Fixed income capabilities back into their portfolios. And Invesco Perpetual corporate bonds continue to attract meaningful flows from the U.K. and continental Europe. And over the past 3 years, assets have grown in the strategy from $4.2 billion to just over $12 billion, a threefold increase during that period. ","In China, we saw increased interest in our Chinese equities capabilities, real estate, balance, asset allocation. In Japan, the Japanese advantage strategy has generated top decile performance over 1-, 3-, 5-year, and has generated strong net sales last year. And again, it looks like a strong pipeline there. So the point is, we are seeing in a really volatile challenging market some real interest in the investment capabilities.","Taking a look at flows by channel. You can see gross sales across Retail and Private Wealth Management contributed to the positive net flows for Invesco as a whole. During the quarter, the institutional business saw a strong client interest in ABRA product, the commodities [indiscernable] product, real estate, bank loans and stable value. So again, a strong and growing pipeline. And we saw a substantial increase in the international growth product during this period too.","Wins in these areas were offset by the $1.4 billion liquidation of the PPIP program, the treasury program and $1 billion in lower fee fixed income mandate that the client decided to internalize the capability. The decline in gross sales quarter-over-quarter was largely a timing issue, and our institutional pipeline continues to grow and be very strong and growing.","And I just would like to come back to the PPIP program. It was, from our point of view, a great program. We were pleased to be in it. The team generated excellent results, so very good news, strategy. The Treasury was very happy to get the capital paid back at the pace that we did. And again, we came out of it as one of the top managers. And again, what you'll see in the active -- the $1.4 billion out of our active asset categories, but for that redemption, the results would have looked that much stronger.","So in general, we feel very positive about the flow picture. And in spite of this trendless direction of the market, things are feeling quite strong for us at the moment.","Moving on to Slide 9, I'd like to spend a minute talking about the U.S. Retail business. The depth and breadth of our investment capabilities are strong investment performance and focused client engagement efforts that resulted in strong momentum in this U.S. Retail channel during the first quarter. And in spite of the volatility, we saw the combination of strong performance and a number of high-demand capabilities to drive good momentum into the business. Early, I mentioned ABRA and the ETFs. We're also seeing demand for international growth products, emerging markets, munis, high yields. So again, we're starting to see a broad interest along different capabilities in the Retail channel.","And as a result of the strong demand for these capabilities, we continue to see our market share gross sales increasing relative to the market and trending positive over the long term. The U.S. gross sales were 32% quarter-over-quarter and redemptions were significantly lower than the industry average. Ours coming in at 24% versus the industry at 32%. We still believe we're in the early process of achieving the full potential for our U.S. Retail business. The combination of solid performance and the number of high-demand capabilities are driving good momentum, and we're pleased with the progress we're seeing.","And before Loren moves on to the financials, I'd like to take a moment to update everybody on our capital management priorities. And a number of you have been long-term holders of Invesco and know the direction of the company quite well. But it's really -- we have focused very much on the multi-year strategy to grow and strengthen our business. Our commitment to investment excellence enables us to deliver strong long-term investment performance to our clients. We worked to enhance the depth and breadth of our investment capabilities and have made successful strategic acquisitions that further expanded our capabilities. We also worked to further enhance the effectiveness of our global operating platform. And as a result of all of this progress, the depth, breadth and strength of our business has put us in a position to evolve our capital management priorities, which you'll see on Slide 11. And has been in the past, and has not changed, our first priority is to reinvest in our business in ways that enhance our ability to deliver strong long-term investment performance to our clients.","Now in addition, the dividends are now featured more prominently among our priorities, which should provide a more committed level of return to our shareholders. This emphasis is reflected in our decision to increase our dividend 41% during this quarter.","We came to this conclusion after a number of discussions with some of our very senior investors here, a number of our shareholders, good conversation with the board. And we feel very, very good about this direction. We think it's very positive and reflecting the strength in the organization. We will also continue the program of repurchasing shares. And as we've said in the past, our goal is to achieve a cash buffer of approximately $1 billion in excess of regulatory requirements. A key difference is that we have dropped acquisitions from the revised capital management priorities. All the acquisitions we have made to date have been strategic and focused on enhancing our ability to meet client needs. By revising our priorities, I want to make 2 points very clear. First, we don't need acquisitions to be successful. And secondly, we are not, and have not been, the consolidator of asset managers. These revised priorities reflect our confidence in our ability to meet our client needs. And based on meeting our clients needs, wwe're sure that we will continue to grow and further strengthen our capital position over time.","I'll stop there and turn it over to Loren.","Loren M. Starr","Thank you, Marty. So moving onto slide on assets. You'll see that during the quarter, we generated total net flows of $8.1 billion, $7 billion in long term and the remainder in money market products. Similar to prior quarters, the aggregate flows reflected continued strong client demand for ETFs, UITs and other passive products. In the category of actively managed assets, so we did see demand accelerate, as Marty mentioned, for balanced-risk but also for other income-oriented products in the quarter. These inflows, however, were offset by active equity outflows and also the previously announced $1.4 billion return of funds related to the liquidation of the treasury component of our PPIP fund.","We also saw markets and FX continue to work in our favor in this quarter, and they added $39.4 billion in AUM. And resulting increase in AUM quarter-over-quarter was $47.5 billion or 7.6%, giving us $672.8 billion in AUM at the end of Q1. The average AUM for Q1 was up 5.9% to $658.2 billion.","Moving onto net revenue yield. I just want to spend a little time with that since it's been a focus. Our net revenue yield in Q1 was 44.7 basis points. That reflected a decrease of 1.4 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The decline was due to the combination of 3 large factors. The first was due to, and the biggest, lower transaction fees and other revenues, accounting for 0.9 basis points of the decline. We saw lower performance fees in the quarter, and that accounted for 0.3 basis points decline. And then we saw a reduction in our gross management fee yields. Now this had a few things going on there. First, we saw our Invesco PowerShares QQQs increase from 4% to almost 5% of our average AUM. And that accounted for 0.2 basis points of the decline. And then we had 2 offsetting elements. We saw a fee expansion through asset mix, as equities expanded as a percentage of our AUM. However, that was offset by day count in Q1. And those 2 effects were roughly about 0.3 basis points offsetting.","So next let's turn to operating results. Our net revenue grew by $19.5 million. That was up 2.7% quarter-over-quarter, and that included favorable FX rate of impact of $2 million. Looking further onto the line item, you'll see that investment management fees increased $41.3 million or 5.4% to $812.1 million. And this increase was roughly in line with the growth in average AUM we experienced from Q4 to Q1. FX accounted for $2.9 million of that increase.","Service and distribution revenues were up $7.9 million or 4.4%, also in line with higher average AUM. And investment management fees and FX accounted for $0.4 million of the increase. Performance fees for the quarter were good. We came in at $21.2 million, but that was a decrease of $2.8 million versus Q4. The performance fees were generated primarily from certain of our investment trusts in the U.K., but also from our real estate portfolios.","Other revenues in the quarter came in at $33.1 million, that was down $11.8 million, and this decrease was the result of lower transaction fees really due to our private equity business, which had strong transaction fees in the fourth quarter.","Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues increased by $15.1 million or 5%. Again, this is largely in line with the increased investment management and service and distribution fees, and FX increased these expenses by $1.2 million.","Moving on further down the slide, moving to operating expenses. They came in at $467.1 million. That was an increase of $6.6 million or 1.4% relative to the fourth quarter. FX increased operating expenses by $1.4 million quarter-over-quarter.","Again getting into the line items, you'll see that employee compensation at $313 million increased $0.7 million or 0.2%. We saw seasonally higher payroll taxes offset by reduced variable compensation cost relative to the fourth quarter. FX increased compensation expense by $0.8 million. Again just to remind people, as is always the case every year at the end of February, the firm provides for salary increases and new deferred compensation awards to employees. The second quarter will therefore reflect a full 3 months worth of this impact related to these expenses versus only 1 month of impact in Q1. However, this increase should be offset by a reduction in payroll taxes in Q2.","Moving on down, marketing expenses increased by $4.9 million or 22.2% to $27 million. And this increase was a result of higher advertising expenses in the U.S. and the U.K. And FX had a marginal impact of $0.1 million on this line item. Property, office and technology expense came in at $66.3 million. That was an increase of $4.4 million, and that reflected higher property lease expenses, as well as increased investment in portfolio management and client engagement technology initiatives in the quarter. And FX increased these expenses by $0.3 million.","And then we got to G&A. G&A came in at $60.8 million, down $3.4 million or 5.3%. FX had an impact on G&A of $0.2 million, but you'll remember in last quarter we indicated a roughly $3.5 million of G&A would not recur and that in fact happened.","So continuing on the page, you'll see that nonoperating income increased $8.3 million compared to the fourth quarter. And this increase was due to the mark-to-market of certain of our partnership investments, but we also realized some gains on the sale of C capital the during the quarter.","And then we had the firm's effective tax rate coming in at 25.1%. That was in line with our prior guidance. And again going forward through 2012, we'd expect that tax rate to be between 24.5% to 25.5%, which brings us to our adjusted EPS, which we grew by 4.8% to $0.44. And then, as Marty mentioned, our net operating margin expanded about 80 basis points to 36.6% quarter-over-quarter.","With that, I'm complete, and I'll turn it back over to you, Marty.","Martin L. Flanagan","Great. So we'd like to open up to any questions anybody might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Our first question does come from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the direct real estate business, how much money have you raised, but maybe not invested yet? And how quickly are you putting dollars to work here?","Loren M. Starr","Ken, we have several billion dollars won, but not yet funded real estate assets, and that's a pipeline that continues to expand. It does take a while for it to be invested, so it could take anywhere between 0.5 year, perhaps even longer, depending on the opportunities. They are patient in terms of looking for the right investments. But it is something that has been sort of being put to work and continues to be put to work quite at a good clip.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then on the institutional business, I know this is lumpy. But can you talk a little bit about what happened in this quarter? It looks like redemptions were normal, but the gross sales dropped off a lot. And I think maybe, is PPIP on the redemption side that give back to the government? And I don't think you make fees there, but was that recorded in the Institutional gross redemption line?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, all right. So in terms of the first question, there are a couple of factors. One, just generally, sales and redemptions, quite honestly, are lumpy in Institutional, and so it is hard to sort of be a straight line progression all the time. But if you remember, there was, I think we've talked about it in the fourth quarter, about $3 billion of real estate sales that took place. It was in the Passive side of the business, on the Institutional side, and this has sort of separate real estate properties that we manage that showed up on the sales side in the fourth quarter. And that wasn't something that recurs. So that was about $3 billion. You take that out, it sort of becomes more flattish quarter-over-quarter at least comparing to the fourth quarter. But in reference your second question, yes, absolutely, the PPIP was and is reflected in the institutional outflows. And again, we think it's a good story. It was sort of a planned redemption in terms of what we're looking for. About $1.1 billion of that is in Active, $0.3 billion of that is in the Passive category, so again just to give you some color. Overall, I'd say, in terms of the institutional pipeline, just to give you some more color on that, I do think it's one that we feel is strengthening and is in fact probably higher than we've seen in recent history and it's broad based, so it's across many of our different categories of capabilities, whether it's balanced-risk, Real estate, bank loans, global equities. It's a very, very positive story for us at this stage. And so we feel pretty good even though the first the first quarter didn't necessarily reflect it in terms of the absolute numbers. We feel that it's looking pretty solid for us.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then just lastly, the Japanese REIT business, obviously beginning of last year was a big, big tailwind for you. In the quarter, how did it do? Is it a headwind now? Is it really not doing anything? Where does your Japanese REIT business stand?","Loren M. Starr","It's actually doing pretty well. I would say in the quarter, there was $470 million of redemptions related to that particular capability. That was the net outflow number in the quarter. The first month, April, I think it was about $50 million, so it's actually at a better pace into the second quarter, so we feel pretty good. Again, we don't think that there's this big sort of pent-up desire for redemption on this product. And in fact, we have been very successful in terms of providing this product through a variety of distributors to -- with stickier sort of time horizons than others in that space. So we think that we have a pretty good situation there. And quite honestly, we're also working with the distributors in Japan to look at other products that ultimately, if it makes sense, could serve as a way to replace those assets if they wanted to redeem.","Operator","Our next question does come from Bill Katz of Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions. First one, on the marketing spend, how much of that is tactical given the performance and some of the momentum of the gross sales versus more structural given the broadening of the platform?","Martin L. Flanagan","A couple of comments. The vast majority has been a broad recognition-type marketing spend. And that is in place, it's going to continue. And as we've said in the past, we just know we have work to do to catch up there. There has been some specific, if you want to call it, tactical marketing, but largely around in the United States, around the good performing Equity products, the equity income products, the International product, and we'll continue to do that. But the vast majority is really broad.","Loren M. Starr","Bill, there may have been about $1 million or something related to the U.K. launches of the global Balanced-Risk product. So a little bit of tactical, and there probably will continue to be a little bit of tactical as we continue to roll out those products.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And so my follow-up question is just in terms of capital management. So it seems you seems very clear that you're not looking to do anything of size that's not to your liking. But conversely, as you look at your footprint now and you see what's growing and what's not, are there other areas that might be pruned that could be reinvested into faster growth parts of the business?","Martin L. Flanagan","Bill, we continue -- I mean, you've followed us for a long, long time. I mean that has been our history for the last number of years and we'll discontinue to do that, and where we feel really good about the depth and breadth of the capabilities around the world. There are just areas that we would like to get stronger in and we're just always looking at that, and that's always what we try to do. So we'll stay on that path.","Operator","Our next question does come from Robert Lee of KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Maybe actually a follow-up to Bill's question and will be a little bit more direct. I mean, obviously, there's been reports about Atlantic Capital, and I've also seen some reports here or there about speculation about you're maybe even looking at the CLO business as a business you maybe no longer want to be in. So I guess more directly, given that you don't have a slide here showing that it had inflows, should we be thinking that Atlantic Capital remains as kind of a strategic important business for you? And more broadly, is it possible that we could see more businesses kind of be pruned like CLOs and things like that?","Martin L. Flanagan","Let me respond to a couple. Again, first, we don't ever speculate on any of these sites' activity. It is amazing to see the attention here. But around Atlantic Trust, I mean you have seen they have another great quarter of net inflows. They've done a spectacular job for their clients. It is a very unique well-run business. And you can see why people are interested in it. But again, we're going to continue to stay on the path that we've been on with them, and they've done a great job. So we can't say anything more than that. And again, we continue to be very, very committed to the bank loans CLO business. It's done great things. It's a great team and we see continued opportunity there. Where CLOs in particular, they literally dried up over the last number of years, but it is something that -- it of looks like it'd be an opportunity again over the next -- in the coming years.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow-up. Would it be a positive on the kind of ETF business a little bit more, the Passive ETF side of the business, a little more granularity? And sense of how much of the flows there were kind of straight ETF products versus, say, some UIT products and maybe even the QQQs?","Loren M. Starr","No problem. So of the -- we saw net flows on ETFs broadly of $6.5 billion in the quarter. $2.1 billion of that was our traditional ETF products at the higher fee. $4.2 billion of that was the Qs and $0.2 billion were the Invesco PowerShares DD product. So that's the breakout.","Operator","Our next question does come from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess focusing on flows here. If you could talk about, first off, it looks like Asia you had a change there in terms of going into outflows in the quarter. And then also within Alternative's, you also saw a moderate change and talk about what's the products that are redeeming in both those areas, please?","Loren M. Starr","So Dan, in Asia, it was again largely the -- what we saw the U.S. REIT product go out. So there was some pressure there. There was a little bit of institutional outflow we saw in Australia, was a factor. On the Alternative side, it was really PPIP. It was the $1.4 billion that you're seeing there. And maybe there was, what, CLO that redeemed.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then it seems like a fair amount of moving parts that you walked through with regards to the revenue yield. And so just want to think about it going forward, all else being equal given the number of days going into the second quarter plus just kind of the movement of average assets. As I said all else equal, we should see the revenue yield kind of move higher here into 2Q?","Loren M. Starr","Yes. I mean I think it won't have the day count impact affecting it, again barring any further movement in Qs and so forth, which can obviously have some impact. There would be an uplift of some fee rate into Q2. And then obviously, we talked about the fee waivers falling off, which is our expectation still in the second half of the year among some other things that we think will be helpful for the fee rate.","Operator","Our next question does come from Michael Carrier of Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question. Just on the expenses, so it seems like maybe on the marketing and then on the occupancy, you guys mentioned some of the drivers there. But I guess, just looking at where we're at currently going forward. Any items, one that will be coming out of there? And then probably more importantly, any new initiatives that you're looking at to be picking up? Or are these fairly good run rates going forward?","Loren M. Starr","Mike, I would say that they are fairly good run rates going forward. The marketing at current levels, I think is probably the right way to think about it going forward. Property, office and technology could see a little bit of noise here and there. But I do think it's just one of these numbers that we'll be fine. There's a big moving piece to this, so I'll just remind people. That we'll explain, but it's offsetting, which has to do with our European infrastructure transformation where we're going to see some properties being exited. We're going to see an outsourcing of our transfer agencies so -- and then, a reduction in salaries. So you'll see that line item, property, office and technology increasing through the last half part of the year, but it will be offset through some employee compensation, as we really moved to the outsourcing arrangements, which gets completed at the end of the years, but we will explain that. But again, just so you understand, there will be some sort of offsets there. G&A, we feel pretty good about, so I don't think there's any real need to point anything out there. Again, we continue to try to manage closely and it will depend on what sort of market environment we're in to some extent, but based on where we are today, they're pretty good.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Then when I look at your flows and going across channels, adjusting for the PPIP, it looks like you will had flows probably across all of them, on products kind of the same thing. You get inflows across each of the categories and then regions x the Asia, you had some outflows in Canada, but there's still inflows across. And the only area that -- it's been challenging for the industry and you guys are no different with being on the active side, just fixed income maybe not as strong in equities a bit, but in line with industry trends. But when you look at where you guys are and the products where you're seeing inflows versus where you're seeing outflows, do you still categorize it as still just industry trends? Or are there certain products where you're seeing some momentum or you're seeing some improvement in performance where either you could start to see that kind of an inflection point? Obviously, it's going to depend on the market and sentiment around outflows. But just more specific to among your product lineup, anything that's turning or changing either that you're seeing?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, you're asking exactly the right question, and we have a conversation all the time not just amongst ourselves but also with clients, and I know you all do too. And as we look at it right now, we just start by looking at the depth and breadth of the capabilities. It's broad. It's deep. We like what we have, strong performance. And what you're seeing is still the market unclear investors of what they want to do, right? And it's -- we agree with the theme that fixed -- core fixed income is not the place to be in the next 12, 18 months. And the way that we look at this as the flows, the asset allocation capabilities getting an awful lot of attention, the risk parity in particular. And that's very consistent in our minds that people starting to move away, try to get some greater returns than what we've had, while also trying to maintain risks. And if you see where some of the other folks get the municipal bonds and sort of -- you can see why people are starting to do that for yield, but also thinking where tax rates might be going. Emerging markets, we're starting to see some of that also. And bank loans again, very interesting, real estate very interesting, but that's very consistent with people moving -- trying to move towards generating greater returns. We personally think the idea that world's passive from now until 30 years from now is just not accurate. I think this is a very natural evolution. It's slower than what you've seen in the past, which is not surprising, continued to the magnitude of the challenge that we came out of. And if you'll look at our flows, you're right. They're broad. They're-- we are in net flows across many categories. But we are still in a position. If you look at the -- where the net outflows have been, it's largely been in U.S. equity products, and that is a real strength of ours. And when you look at our assets under management, we have disproportionate U.S. equity, more so than the industry. So when people start to move into U.S. equities, we should benefit very, very strongly from that because of the depth and breadth of the capabilities. So again, we think the right answer is very hard to pick markets, but having a broad set of capabilities are performing well. You should do well. And I think that's what you're seeing right now from Invesco.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And this might be -- maybe it's a little too early, but just on the -- your restructuring, any update there, timing, just any color there? And like I said, it might be too early?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I think it's really going to be a second half discussion. So again, I think it is a little too early to have that other than it's on track. We're doing well. Everything has been signed in, so progressing. So we do think it is going to help transform our business. It is just sort of an operational part of the overall transformation. We have talked about what we want to do in Europe generally, and I think we're seeing good traction with the flows. But I mean, quite honestly, we pulled back a little bit on some of the initiatives we were focused on because of the market that we were in, and it didn't seem to make a lot of sense to significantly increase advertising for example, in Europe when people were certainly, as an industry, not necessarily buying product. So there is more to come, I think, on the European story overall that, that we'll be happy to tell at the right time.","Operator","Our next question does come from Matt Kelley of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your efforts on the Retail side, working with different platforms and specifically, what products, financial advisers are most excited about offering at this point in your discussions with some of the different Wirehouses would be helpful?","Martin L. Flanagan","So let me go through it. It's a little bit repetitive, Matt, so I apologize for that. But what we are seeing, as I discussed earlier, I mean you can just see quarter-over-quarter, gross flows are quite dramatically and it was 32% quarter-over-quarter. What that is reflective of is the conversation we've been having over the last 12, 18 months that lead indicators are getting more products on platforms that's been broadening very, very much. And one indicator might be if you take a look at our, what you call it, our top 10 distributors, retail distributors, a year ago, 3 of the 10 were in positive flows, us on their platform. At the end of this quarter, 9 of the 10 of our distributors were in net flows with us. So that's a really positive trend. We are seeing again, where we're seeing the flows. ABRA is this risk balanced allocation because of the marketplace and because of the performance is very, very popular, but we are seeing international growth. Small cap adds some good flows during the quarter and municipal bonds, high-yield bonds. So it really is broad. But disproportionately, it's around real estate, but it's been around the asset allocation risk balance. But we don't -- it's just getting broader than anything that we ourselves have experienced. So again, as confidence come back into the market, we think we are going to be positioned quite well.","Loren M. Starr","And I just mentioned that we're seeing strength in terms of crossing the independent channel, up 23% quarter-over-quarter in terms of mutual fund sales, the Wirehouse Channel, I think we're up almost 40% quarter-over-quarter in terms of mutual fund sales. And the broker deal channel, 34%. So -- and then when we look at our sort of rankings within distributors, it's pretty much across-the-board that we're increasing our market share in every single name that we sort of have a relationship with. So again, it's just very encouraging. And then on the platform side, the one thing that we're really looking forward to is when ABRA gets the three-year track record and actually get onto -- into models, which is going to be an important point to help even further accelerate the interest in that product.","Martin L. Flanagan","And I think if you step back strategically, add some of the things we've been talking about with all of you in our investors is that what we were responding to was a marketplace where advisors were becoming much more sophisticated in dealing with their clients. And so, yes, we have a depth and breadth investment management capabilities, but they also are using different vehicles to meet those needs. Yes, mutual funds, but also the UITs play an important role in some of the advisors that we work with. As do the ETFs, and it's really that broad range of investment capabilities with vehicles to meet the advisors' needs. And that, again, is sort of the positioning that you're putting ourselves and we want the -- we want to help the advisors be successful with their clients, and that seems to be -- it's gaining some traction.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. The other thing I'd ask you about is on the ETF business, I think they're one of the things that I had wanted a discussions about is the revenue margin versus operating margin dynamic. And I was just hoping you guys, obviously there are a lot of moving pieces in your operating margin right now, given expenses and flows into different products. So could you give us a little bit of how you think about the business in terms of the underlying margin associated with the active versus passive side of the business directionally? And how -- what any sort of inflection points might be?","Loren M. Starr","Yes. So I would say that we feel very good about the margin prospects for our ETF business in general. And firstly, the ETF business is sort of hard because there's all sorts of different pieces to our ETF business that we've talked about in the past. I mean, the one that is sort of misleading is I'd say, or the Invesco Powershares QQQs, right? So they have no management fee, but they have a marketing rebate. And the way I view that is, is it's almost a margin accelerant to our traditional PowerShares. And because it is something that we benefit from that in terms of the broad brand recognition that we get through the QQQs. And so you put marketing sort of being helped with that product. In terms of the infrastructure, it's all there. It's built and we're just getting bigger. And so, we've seen margin expansion as we see the operating leverage work for our ETF business. And I think also importantly, we're more focused now than we have in the past in terms of -- an all weather type of ETFs. The ETFs that will be less sort of specifically thematic and probably will serve across a long time. And that will help in terms of getting critical mass in those ETFs, which is important for our profitability and margin expansion. So again, all those things I would say gives me a great sense that, that business is -- it's certainly on par with the rest of our mutual funds business in terms of margins, and should not -- we haven't seen price degradation or fee sort of squeezing unlike some of our competitors who are on very commoditized types of products. So we haven't seen that activity on our products. So we feel very good about that. Some of the other products that are passive, which would be our UIT business have very fine financial characteristics. They are launched. They don't have a management fee, but through the launching process, there's a very, I'd say, good fee associated with that. And so, you think about the margins on that. They're among the higher-margin elements of our business. So again, we feel very good about that. Some of the other parts of the business that I'd say are passive would really be related to maybe leverage associated with some of our structured products. And again, those can generate performance fees. And so it's not a big part of the passive story. It's a small part it's not one that tends to grow that much. So really, the QQQs and traditional products and the UITs and we feel good about those products in particular.","Operator","Our next question does come from Cynthia Mayer of Bank of America.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So on the expenses, and I apologize if you covered this, but how sustainable is the cut in the variable comp? And what drove that?","Loren M. Starr","We tend to see variable comp decline a little bit in the first quarter really as an offset to the payroll taxes. It is not a -- something that we would say is a large number. If you're thinking about compensation going forward, I think it's going to be sort of roughly in line with this quarter based on current levels. It can move around a bit. We talked about the offsets of our payroll taxes going down but the a quarter worth of salary increases and deferred compensation. The other thing that can move it around, of course, would be performance fees and those are sort of when they were done in the quarter, it's reflected in the compensation in terms of bonuses. And so that number will move around based on levels of performance fee. And we hope they go up because we hope performances go up. But again, hopefully that's helpful for you.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, that is helpful. And on the Retail flows, it looks like the gross sales were up in the quarter, but they were also up a year ago in 1Q. So I'm wondering if you can tease out how much of that increase you think was seasonal versus greater traction?","Loren M. Starr","Yes. I mean, there's no question. There's some degree of seasonality in the first quarter, so you're right that that's a good comparison. But just to remind people, in the first quarter, a lot of the sales that we saw were through stable value types of sales, and so that was a much lower fee type of product, typically 11 basis points, maybe less. The sales that we're seeing this quarter are not in that category. They're more along the lines of 90 basis points, so it's a very different revenue profile than we saw last year.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And maybe on the stable value, what were the flows to that?","Loren M. Starr","I couldn't put my fingers on that offhand right now. But I mean, they were significant in the first quarter last year, billions if I remember. But let me -- maybe one that we have to address offline with you, Cynthia. I mean, maybe it's $3 billion, is that -- I don't know. We'll address it offline, sorry about that.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, just in terms of the fee rates, can you tell us maybe what impact fee waivers have this quarter and what the outlook is there?","Loren M. Starr","Well, the fee waiver impact we had said related to the fund mergers is roughly $30 million on an annual basis. And so we're obviously seeing that in this quarter. We'll see it in the next quarter. It's really going to be in the second half of this year that those we expect would fall away. Obviously, that's still a discussion that needs to be completed with the fund board. And so I don't want to get ahead of the fund board. Still, things may happen there, but that is our current expectation. So again in the first quarter, it would be obviously a part of that $30 million as being reflected there.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And money market fee waivers, are those improving at this point?","Loren M. Starr","Those are not improving or getting worse. Quite honestly it's a small part of what we see because we have institutional product, which tends to be at a lower fee rate, 11 basis points. And so, our waivers are not material. Certainly, I think across the year or maybe they're $5 million to $10 million in that range, at most.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could just ask one last question, just a very general one. You have a lot of investors in the Balance Risk Allocation fund. I'm just curious what you think their return expectations are? And what you think, to the extent they're substituting it for something they already own. Are they substituting it for an equity fund, a bond fund or an alternative fund? And what do you think the best benchmark for that is?","Martin L. Flanagan","Cynthia, I don't have that level of granularity. I think the answer you're getting some element off the all of that. And it's really, I think how I'd really respond is that the financial advisers are looking at this balanced risk allocation product as just another important tool in the toolbox that they're meeting the investors' needs. And one of the elements that's important is that there's less volatility associated with it. And I think one things that's come out of the crisis is that people are less inclined to have the volatility that they've had in the past. Now I'm sure as years go on and things stabilize, that will probably be less of a focal point. But you're just getting people that are seeking greater returns than what they're getting in the cash accounts and trying to get some greater equity-type like returns.","Loren M. Starr","I mean, and I think I'll only say, there's a hypothesis which is maybe people who are in balanced products, fixed balance products equity versus fixed income, maybe going into this type of product, which is more dynamically allocated across some more wider range of investment opportunities. So -- but again, that's it's a hypothesis. It's hard to really sort of say who's redeeming out of what for us.","Operator","Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First question, you guys have been pretty good about identifying allocation trends and sort of getting out in front of them, so that you have the right strategies in place when demand ultimately picks up. So just wondering what sort of products or strategies are you currently working on or having the pipeline that you think could ultimately be meaningful growth drivers down the road?","Martin L. Flanagan","It's going to be the iPad 4. No, in all seriousness, we're not in a position to have those conversations and we're always looking at -- really, we respond to client needs, and we really think really what we have out there right now is pretty broad. And I think we're on the mark, but I appreciate the confidence and the thought, but no real magic.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then maybe if you could more on just talk a little bit about other revenues. I know you mentioned the lower PE transaction fees in the first quarter. But what is the outlook for the kind of deal flow there and how should we be thinking about that line going forward?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I think it's one that -- we knew there was PE stuff, it's sort of one-off, but the biggest piece in that line item or pieces are related to the real estate transaction fees, which again, we feel good about the growth there. The UIT business, the revenues associated with that business go in that line. And the UITs had a very strong quarter. In fact, for the industry as a whole, I think UITs had the strongest quarter they had in a very, very long time. And we saw that as well. So I think that, that's going to help continue to contribute to that line item. And so overall, I think we think somewhere between $30 million to $35 million is kind of the right run rate level in that space. It will move around. I'm not that good that I can actually tell you when the real estate Transaction fees happen and what quarter they happened in, but we do think that sort of the overall level will be in that range.","Operator","Our next question does come from Jeff Hopson of Stifel, Nicholas.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So I'm curious, in terms of the U.S. Retail market, what are your wholesalers out there talking about? So obviously, they want to capture sales and see where the interest is. But are they talking about equities trying to position for when there potentially is some interest?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, that's a good question. I'm really glad you sort of asked that. I mean, I'd say ourselves, and I suspect the vast majority of the firms that are doing well are -- the ideas of product pushing is long gone. I mean, I think that's -- and it's much more going into a consultative advice, engagement with the clients and is very broad, very deep. And we have not just recently, but even somebody asked earlier about if you just look at some of the marketing materials, even last year, we were getting people focused on where we thought -- that the great opportunities in equities. And international equities, large-cap, dividend-yield, equity income-type products. And so we've been on it for quite a long time. And with the idea of just trying to understand investors' need and where we think the opportunities are and wanting them to be thoughtful moving ahead and not reactive to the market. And we do it in multiple different ways, whether it be through things even PowerShares Universities. We have -- we came over with Van Kampen of Van Kampen Consulting team that actually is educational sources for different advisors in the marketplace. We're doing it quite broadly with white papers, investment buck pieces. Having our investment teams in the markets talking to, so maybe that's too much information, but the real point is we really want to work in partner with the advice channel, and having them solve the longer-term needs for their clients.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could follow up. Your U.S. Retail business, if I assume, that maybe it's not an ideal scale, can you get there if equities continue to lag? Obviously, the allocation products are helping. But any thoughts on that?","Martin L. Flanagan","Our -- again, our focus is on quality, not quantity. And if you look at all of our conversations and all of our focus has really been on generating consistent good long-term performance around a broad breadth of capabilities. And that's really what, and I think, we have accomplished. And if you do that, there's no question in my mind in time, you will meet client needs and you will end up serving more clients more broadly. And that's what you're seeing. And a little bit to the conversation we're having earlier, investor preferences will move over time. And having the depth and breadth of the capabilities, it really matters. And that's what we think we've accomplished and ready for multiple different market cycles. And we think we're doing very fine right now in a very difficult market. And if there is a greater sense of confidence by investors, we'll just do that much better.","Operator","Our next question does come from Craig Siegenthaler of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just had a follow-up question on the economics of the Passive business. So you did answer some of this earlier, but I just want to kind of ask it very simplistically. So if you have $1 of additional revenues going to Passive and $1 going into Active. On average, I know there's a lot of different pieces there, but what is the differential between the incremental margin between the 2?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I think it's largely the same, Craig. That's a way to think about it.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And as you move across the passive, and you did comment on this a little bit earlier, but as you look at UITs, Retail ETFs and Institutional passive, what is the difference between incremental margin between those stories, one higher than the other?","Loren M. Starr","So Passive within Institutional?","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes.","Loren M. Starr","Again, Passive within Institutional, I think will be generally at a lower fee rate and perhaps a lower margin. We don't have that much of it, so it's not something that we are positioned for. We have some, but again, it's really sort of leveraged. That's associated with a real estate fund. We could have some leverage. We break out the assets associated with that fund into the passive and active pieces. So it's a little unfair because you can't really have the fund without the two pieces together. And we've broken it out just because we think it's important for you to see, as those assets grow, what the impacts are. But you can't -- I mean, it's not really something that we just have leverage, right? It's always with the funds. So passive for Institutional isn't all that relevant, I think in terms of the conversation. It's really the retail side that we've just been talking about, which I think is a very fine business with excellent financial characteristics.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a kind of financial question. The fee waiver step down on the merged funds I thought was June 15. So roughly in 2Q, you're going to have 15 extra days of higher fees and then the bigger step up is in 3Q. Do I have that right? Because I thought when you were explaining that to Cynthia's question, you actually referenced the first quarter?","Loren M. Starr","Okay. So maybe -- I was saying in the second half is when you're going to see the fee waivers fall away and basically you get the pickup. I was using rough, sort of rough -- yes, it's spread in, so there's a couple of dates. I think you've probably got those dates generally correct, but I think in terms of the bulk of it, it's sort of end of June.","Operator","Our next question does come from Marc Irizarry of Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Marty, can you talk just about ABRA a little more in terms of how it could evolve as a franchise for you if preferences remain the same, in particular as you get past out of the 3-year anniversary here and you get your 3-year numbers. Do you think that that's going to become more of an Institutional product potentially for you? Are you going to grow maybe in the DC channel with that product? Or maybe you can just talk about how you see that evolving if preferences stay the same for retail investors?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, ABRA is a subset of really our multi-asset strategy and we can maybe talk about it more holistically next quarter, if that's helpful. But yes, in that context, I think it's important to note, I mean, this is a very attractive product in this market, right? Sideways to up market, it is obviously been very, very attractive. And as I mentioned earlier, if you look at the punch ratio quarter-over-quarter, it's 40%. I mean, we had net flows of $1.5 billion last quarter, and $3.4 billion this quarter. So I mean it's really quite dramatic. And to your point, from a franchise point of view, if you look at it by channel, it was really introducing the Institutional channel at the end of '09, and so recognizing much smaller assets, but it was 60% in the Institutional channel, 40% Retail. If you look at it today, it's 90% Retail, 10% Institutional, but it's really just been more of the pace of the uptake, and it is through those different areas that you're talking about, it makes a lot of sense in the DC plan. It makes a lot of sense for an individual asset allocation plan. And that's what you're seeing. I think also what I would note just from a franchise point of view, when we introduced to, we're introduced in the United States. So 100% of the assets is from the United States. Yet today, 30% of the assets are outside of the United States, and that is a development. It's and introduced in trailing the U.S. And I think Loren mentioned earlier, it's just been, I don't know, a month or 6 weeks ago that it's been introduced in the U.K. Maybe I'm going to lose track of the time, but some of them are months ago into Canada and into what we call our C Cap product that gets it into kind of all Europe and actually in some parts of Asia. So it's a capability. It is a global capability, and that's what we've been doing with it and there's national extensions off of it as we've talked about whether it'd be a commodities leave, which has been gaining some real attraction. And also the same idea had been introducing an income version of it, and that was introduced in the Retail market, December of this past year. So very early, but that's exactly -- again, this is a subset of the total mall passes strategy capability that we've been on for a period of time. And it is making an awful lot of sense. And I think, I think it's importantly to note that we do feel we have the depth and breadth of the capabilities are very, very strong. This is a sweet spot at the moment, and some of the -- what could you expect? If you have a bull market start to kick in, this is going to slow down. But the good news is where the -- where's money going to go? It's going to go into our various strong equity-type products. So again, it's back to the conversation we're having earlier, just broadly being in position to meet investor needs around the world and within channels, and that's what this is really representing.","Loren M. Starr","Just know -- I mean, it's too late for the U.S. allocation as an asset class, which this falls into is $820 billion in size. The world allocation piece of that, which is what this is classified in at the subset is $252 billion, so it's a big pool of assets. We're obviously, I think just touching the surface now. I think if you aggregate all our asset allocation across what we've got, it's roughly $12 billion, something like that and growing rapidly. So we're still at a very small market share of the pretty big pool that is pretty exciting for us.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just, Marty, your comment on acquisitions sort of falling off or falling significantly lower on the capital priorities, what does that say about maybe it's the fact that you do have all the capabilities you need? Or is it something regarding sort of the environment out there with the deals that are out there relative to what you're trying to accomplish? I'm just curious in terms of your sort of commentary around acquisitions sort of falling off the priority list for you?","Martin L. Flanagan","It's probably both of those, right? I mean, if you look at the company today as compared to 6 years ago, the depth and breadth of the investment capabilities are just vastly stronger. And much of it was done organically. But by the way the combination of WL Ross or ETS [indiscernable] addition or Morgan Stanley\/Van Kampen thing, they're really driven by meeting strategically investor investment capability gap. So there's just fewer gaps, right? And yes, that's a big message but I think also, to your point, for some reason, it seems that there's a perception that's the bulk that were consolidated. We've never ever, ever done a consolidating transaction. It's always been strategic, and we just don't want anybody confused. And always our first priority has been to reinvest back in the business and organically improve ourselves. And -- but again, we just want that very, very clear in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Freeman from Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just maybe a couple of follow-ups on other questions that have been asked, and then maybe following on the capital allocation. So as you reconsider the mix of dividends versus buybacks, obviously, your conclusion is dividends are more important. But relative to one another, not having the -- your cash flow statement in front of me last year, the last few years as you think about what you spend to reinvest in the business? And then, that excess capital -- that excess cash flow remaining, how -- a, how much of that do you see distributing out? And b, the mix?","Loren M. Starr","So Roger, I think in all honesty, how much of our cash flow we use and return will vary depending on the sort of market we're in. Obviously, whereby upping our dividend, we're committing -- to a more committed amount of sort of a payback outdoor cash flow. In terms of what we've done in the past, I think it's ranged from 50% up to 100%, and it will vary. But in terms of how we think about it, I mean, it's obviously within that range as the way you should be thinking about it. It could be at the midpoint of that range or a little bit lower for us going forward. But again, in terms of just how much we do in a particular year, we'll have a lot to do with ultimately how the year sort of plays out. But I would look through our past history to understand what you should expect from us. And really, it's more business as usual. All we're really doing here, and the way you should be thinking about is just transferring a little bit of what we did in buyback into the dividend bucket. I think it's all the magnitude. It's pretty much the same.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. Okay. Yes, that's what I was getting at. So that's easier. So okay. And then secondly, on the progress around the Van Kampen integration and new product sales, did you have any new product additions on platforms? Or how many did you have during the quarter? And importantly, was there anything of significance on the model portfolio front that you've added?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I think the ABRA [ph] -- all of the platforms have been marginally placed. We're still waiting for the big impact on models. And I think we're really thinking it was going to be one that is going to get into these models once we hit the 3-year number. That's the one that should have the biggest impact in terms of moving the dial. But we continue to make progress, obviously, in terms of the market share. We've been very pleased. And it's happening tomorrow. It's just happening through our sales force effectively, working with the advisors at sort of their office levels. So again, we're pleased with the impact in terms of the transaction, the integrations done. We are now really just seeing the benefits of that coming to fruition as advisors and home office really understand our products and us better.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, you made some upgrades to the Institutional sales force a couple years ago. And it sounds like the pipeline is strong as it's been in a while. Is that reflective of, I assume, the incremental penetration you're getting with the gatekeepers? Is that progressing as you thought it would?","Loren M. Starr","Yes. We feel really good about the Institutional leadership, and Eric Johnson and the team he's brought on. And it's just getting stronger and stronger. And it's a combination of investment capabilities that are meeting investor needs along with a really talented group of Institutional sales leaders. And I think many of the people on the phone know that. I mean, it just makes a huge difference and they're making a huge difference for us.","Operator","Our next question does come from Cynthia Mayer of Bank of America.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify. I think you said earlier in your prepared remarks something about April flows, $3.4 billion, but I wanted to clarify that.","Loren M. Starr","No.","Martin L. Flanagan","No. Was that from you, Cynthia? That -- I mentioned that was the ABRA flows for the quarter.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","ABRA flows, okay. That makes more sense. I was going to say, that would be unusual for you to discuss April flows.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. I don't want to break with history.","Operator","At this time, we show no further questions.","Martin L. Flanagan","Again, on behalf of Loren and myself, thanks very much for taking the time and we look forward to talking to everybody in the next quarter. Take care.","Operator","Thank you.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer.","Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Thank you very much, and on behalf of Loren and myself, thank you for spending time with us today. If you're so inclined, you can follow the presentation which is on our website and I'll spend a few minutes reviewing the business results for the quarter, and Loren will go to more depth into the financials. And then today, we're going to talk about our competitive positioning in the context of industry trends and our key focus areas before we open it up for questions.","So I'm on slide 5, if you happen to be following and here is going to be the highlights of our discussion today. During the second quarter, gross sales were up 32% from the same quarter a year ago, redemptions were up as well, however, which led to the outflows during the quarter. And I'll get into the details about the outflows in just a few minutes here. We completed two acquisitions during the quarter Guggenheim Investments' ETF business and Intelliflo, the number one technology platform for financial advisors in the UK which further strengthens our digital advice capability.","We also continue to invest in growth drivers which are meaningfully strengthening our business and contributing to growth now and in the future. And Invesco is a highly differentiated investment management organization with numerous competitive advantages. And again in a few minutes, I will speak to that.","On slide 5, you'll find a summary results for the second quarter. We continue to demonstrate strong long-term investment performance with 70% and 71% of actively managed assets in the top half of peers over three and five years. We achieved gross sales of $54 billion during the quarter, up 32% versus the second quarter of 2017 and gross redemptions were $62 billion driven by market dynamics which led to total long-term outflows of $8 billion during the quarter.","Adjusted net operating income was $376 million for the quarter, up from $357 million in the prior quarter. The operating margin improved during the quarter, increasing to 38.7%, up from 37.3%. We returned $124 million to shareholders during the quarter through dividends.","Our overall performance for the latest three and five year periods remained strong with areas of exceptional strength. When we look at our investment teams and the investment processes, the approach is to focus on generating outperformance over full market cycle. Where we are in this market cycle, it is impacting the relative performance of value-based equity investment approaches which is the expected.","As you can see on slide 6, the outperformance of growth versus value stocks has expanded rapidly over the past 12 months, which is very typical at this stage of our market. This market dynamic places near-term pressure on fundamental active value based equities and in turn client demand for these capabilities and flows, which we are seeing in our value-based equity capabilities.","Importantly, however, the current conditions have hampered the value based equity strategies in the short-term, but long-term investment performance as measured across the full market cycle remains solid. The depth, breadth and tenure for investment teams combined with the consistency of their investment philosophy and approaches give us a high degree of confidence that these capabilities will see significant and rapid improvements in performance when markets normalize.","As mentioned earlier, gross flows were up 32% versus the second quarter of 2017. This is a near record for the organization. We saw continued strength in gross flows across retail and institutional as well as active and passive, all of which were meaningfully higher than the same period a year ago. During the quarter, demand for ETF capabilities was robust. More specifically we saw particular strength in our commodity ETFs, with nearly $400 million in flows for the quarter and year-to-date flows of $1.5 billion.","We saw robust institutional activity with gross sales of 55% versus a year ago with broad based demand across a range of equity, alternative and fixed income capabilities. The higher level of redemptions relative to the prior year were largely driven by the growth versus value, market dynamic and our value equity products as well as a large sovereign wealth and sub-advised redemption that we highlighted in the prior quarter. We are highly confident the flow trend will improve assuming a more favorable market dynamics.","I'm going to hand the call over to Loren, so he'll highlight the financial performance then I'll come back to highlighting the key differentiators that are creating a competitive advantage for Invesco.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Great. Thank you, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter our total AUM increased $29.1 billion or 3.1%, which is driven by the acquisition of the Guggenheim ETF business which added $38.1 billion. We saw market gains of $10.3 billion, inflows from non-management fee earning AUM of $0.9 billion, inflows from institutional money market products of also $0.9 billion and then we also had reinvested distributions of $0.7 billion. These factors were somewhat offset by negative foreign exchange translation of $13.8 billion and then as Marty mentioned long-term net outflows of $8 billion. Our average AUM for the second quarter was $973.9 billion that was up 2.4% versus Q1.","Looking at the net revenue yields for the quarter that came in at 40 basis points and our net revenue yield excluding performance fees was at 39.5 basis points. That was a decrease of 0.4 basis points versus Q1. The acquisition of Guggenheim ETF business and the impact of foreign exchange on our AUM mix reduced the yield by 0.9 basis points and 0.3 basis points respectively. These factors were somewhat offset by one extra day in the quarter and a pickup in real estate transaction fees within other revenues and that increased the yield by 0.4 basis points and 0.3 basis points respectively.","Going to slide 12, you'll see our U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter and my comments today will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which can be found on slide 13. You'll see that our net revenues increased by $16 million or 1.7% quarter-over-quarter to $974 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $11.2 million. Excluding this impact, our net revenues increased by $27.2 million. This increase primarily reflects our higher average AUM from the Guggenheim acquisition, one additional day during the second quarter and as mentioned higher real estate transaction fees.","Adjusted operating expenses at $597.4 million, decreased by $3.3 million or 0.5% relative to the first quarter. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted operating expenses by $5.4 million during the quarter and excluding this impact, our adjusted operating expenses increased by $2.1 million. That increase was driven by seasonal growth in our marketing activities and higher G&A expenses largely from irrecoverable taxes. This increase was then partially offset by seasonal decline and comp expenses on lower payroll taxes and employee benefit costs those traditionally happens in the second quarter.","Our adjusted non-operating income decreased $20.3 million, compared to the first quarter reflecting the foreign exchange mark-to-market on our seed investments during the quarter and as well as higher interest expense associated with the credit facility borrowing to fund the Guggenheim transaction. The tax rate for the quarter held steady at 20.6%, which brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.66 and our adjusted net operating margin of 38.7% for the quarter. I also just wanted to point out that our head count increased by 181 employees to 7,315 employees, primarily reflecting the individuals on-boarded resulting from the Intelliflo and the Guggenheim acquisitions that closed during the quarter.","Before turning things back to Marty, I just wanted to quickly provide a couple of updates and the first is on current month flows. Overall, the July flow picture remains rather choppy with strong sales and pipeline opportunities offset by elevated redemptions, many of which feel one-off in nature. Through the month of July, we've experienced net outflows of approximately $3 billion. This result is largely explained by two separate account terminations and a sell-off in commodity ETFs in U.S. and Europe.","On a somewhat longer term basis, we are confident that our flow picture will stabilize and turn positive, driven by many of the focus areas of growth for Invesco. Additionally, we continue to see a healthy institutional pipeline of won but not funded business that will help accelerate our flows back to positive territory.","So the next area of update I'd like to turn to is China, which is in fact a great example of a focus area growth for Invesco. We're seeing strong demand for our Invesco Great Wall joint venture or IGW as we call it. In June, IGW's Jingyi Money Market Fund was selected as one of seven money market funds to be included in YuE'Bao, which is the money market program administered by Ant Financial, which is an affiliate of Alibaba.","The program, which serves as the money market platform connected to mobile payment services Alipay manages nearly $250 billion in AUM and represents a very exciting opportunity for IGW and Invesco.","So since going live in June 14 of 2018, IGW has seen very strong flows and substantial growth in a number of client accounts on its platform. From the end of the first quarter of 2018, the AUM of IGW's Money Market Fund increased from about $80 million to almost $3.5 billion. We believe that IGW's new relationship with Ant Financial and its strong long-term investment performance across its many capabilities will provide Invesco with significant growth opportunities immediately and in the future. In fact, we expect that total flows including those into money market will be about $6 billion for IGW in Q3.","Final part of my China update addresses our current approach of consolidating only 49% of IGW in our AUM flows and non-GAAP P&L. Given Invesco's leadership in the joint venture, the recent change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership and our active dialogue with our JV partners around gaining an additional ownership interest we'll begin reporting 100% of IGW beginning in the third quarter. And with that, I'd like to turn things back to Marty who will provide additional detail on some of these key differentiators that are creating competitive advantage for the firm.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Great. Thank you, Loren. So I'm now on slide 15. And as I've said a few minutes ago, I want to highlight the macro trends that are transforming the industry, but in fact, these have been in place for some time and I think they're all quite well known throughout the industry. The point though that's important is that the pace of change or pace of the adoption of these macro trends is accelerating at a very rapid pace and it's literally creating winners and losers in the industry today. And it's really important to understand these trends in the context of our strategic positioning and our future direction. We've been developing and expanding our capabilities ahead of these trends for more than a decade and we continue to aggressively develop them for the future.","I'm highly confident in our strategy, our ability to execute and the results they will generate in the near-term and long-term. And now let me just take a few minutes to put these into context of the macro strategy.","Our key strengths and differentiators put us in a strong position to be a winner within the industry for many years to come. Our investment platform's comprised of broad diversity of high quality, well tenured teams with high conviction in their philosophy and processes. We've a comprehensive range of investment capabilities in vehicles with market leading presence and the fastest growing segments including alternatives\/multi-asset, ETFs and smart beta. We have a long established global presence with deep client connectivity in key markets including fast growing markets for us such as China and EMEA. Our at-scale global platform drives efficiency and effectiveness while enabling us to commercialize key technologies for the benefit of our clients. And lastly, our market leading solutions capability draws on our comprehensive range of capabilities to deliver outcomes aligned with the needs of our retail and institutional clients around the world.","Our core business is very healthy and strong which provides a strong foundation for future growth. We're investing in growth drivers that complement our core business, a combination that sets us up for strong and diversified organic growth, running a disciplined business enables us to reallocate investment in the areas where we see tremendous opportunity, which you'll find in slide 17.","We began building the ETF franchise in 2006 with the acquisition of PowerShares and more recently have expanded our ETF capabilities with Source and Guggenheim. We are now the fourth largest ETF provider globally and number two in smart beta globally. We have 40 years of experience and expertise in factor investing, well ahead of competitors in this space. We currently manage more than $160 billion in factor strategies for range of clients around the world. We continue to leverage our factor expertise, most recently with the launch of eight fixed income factor ETFs this week.","We've a market leading solutions capability that works with our distribution and advice teams to create customized portfolios for clients, drawing on a comprehensive range of products. Invesco was an early mover in digital advice market with our acquisition of Jemstep and we are aggressively expanding our capability with the addition of Intelliflo.","As we mentioned in our first quarter call, Jemstep has gone live with a number of clients in the United States and in UK, Intelliflo is already the number one technology platform for financial advisers and we are seeing strong post-acquisition momentum. We're working to expand our digital advice capability globally. We continue to build our institutional capability investing in talent and resourcing and strengthening our client experience. We're seeing continued momentum in the institutional area with gross flows up 55% year-over-year.","Our early entry into China provides a strong foundation for growth and one of the world's fastest growing markets. China is projected to account for half of the global AUM growth over the next decade. We're currently ranked four out of all foreign asset managers in China and we continue to build the business with the recent launch of the very popular Belt and Road Fund and as Loren talked \u2013 just mentioned, we are very excited about the relationship with Ant Financial and had very impressive platform. What truly makes Invesco unique is not any one of these capabilities or growth driver, but our ability to bring these capabilities and growth drivers together to meet the needs of our clients","This unique combination is what defines our competitive differentiation. We're proactively investing in the business, building on our first mover and competitive advantages that drive sustainable broad-based growth in line with our clients in the industry direction. Our acquisition of PowerShares more than a decade ago, our decade long experience and factors, our first mover advantage in digital advice and our early entry into China demonstrate our experience, our commitment to clients and our focus on investing for growth.","We're confident of our organic growth prospects and remain focused on executing for clients, leveraging our competitive advantage and investing for growth which we believe ultimately drives shareholder value.","So with that operator, if you'll open up the call for questions, Loren and I will be happy to answer all the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly speakers. Speakers, our first question comes from Dan Fannon from Jeffries. Your line is now open.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, first, I mean, Marty, you mentioned highly confident about flows improving and we look at kind of slide 22 and some of the performance challenges and what you talked about with regards to where we are in the cycle. I guess can you give us a little bit about whether it's product region? We heard what's going on in July. I guess what gives you the confidence around flows improving in this kind of more immediate time period?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So, Dan, it's a great question. And if you told me we would be in this part of the cycle with such \u2013 this concentration and having such a huge impact on the value versus growth in December, I wouldn't have imagined it quite frankly. The impact that you're seeing is because of the great success of these capabilities over the last number of years, clients have very high demand for these capabilities.","Now, the exact opposite happens when you get to the structured periods and the point that we're really trying to make is that high quality teams, there's not demand for the capability right now, that's driving the current flow \u2013 large part of the current flows. But I think our point is the depth and breadth of interest of capabilities around the world and so many different channels and regions is very, very strong. And that tends to offset these things. But really what has changed, the magnitude of that changed. We've not seen in 10 years more than 10 years such a concentrated market impact. And again good part of our equity capabilities have been in volume, so again it's the broadness of the organization I think that's really pointing out and that the narrowness of where these redemptions are largely coming from?","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And I guess just to follow up on that institutionally is you guys mentioned a backlog and we've heard this before I guess if we think about the products and where that demand is coming, is there any differentiation from previous periods or is there an acceleration in certain products or regions that you could highlight.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, good point. So it's never been broader, right. So you're seeing it in equity and what equities would you imagine that's largely factored capabilities institutionally outside of the United States. Real estate continues to be a very high area, alternatives beyond that, bank loans and things such as GTR continues to be an area. The institutions are continuing to look at risk parity as an area. So again it continues to be very broader than it's ever been that we're seeing.","And the point to look at is the gross flows, what did happen in this quarter and frankly what we are seeing. The one large redemption in this quarter, it was really driven \u2013 it was an equity capability with good performance. But you are seeing clients start to \u2013 some of them are worried with some of the equity exposure with some of the topics of trade around the world and the like \u2013 we're not seeing a ton of it, but that's an example of one or two of those and they can make a big difference in the quarter. And I think that's really the point. Looking from quarter-to-quarter is very difficult always has gone, but if you look at the history of growth for us institutionally over the last couple of years, it continues to just improve.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","And the other thing, Dan, I would just mention is the pipeline of opportunities is at an all-time high in terms of fee rate, it's about 65 basis points across the entire pipeline which is well in excess of our overall fee rate. And the terminating pipeline, so to speak is at 24 basis points. So again when you look at it on a revenue adjusted basis even though the headlines are kind of large, really from a revenue perspective, we should feel and we do feel very optimistic about what the pipeline is bringing to us. And again the predominance that you said is broad based which it is, but there's a significant growth in alternatives which tend to be have a higher fee rate as well.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Thanks Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Hey, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Just given the detail around Jemstep on the last call with six financial institutions going live this year and I think it was five banks and one insurer. When should we expect Jemstep to start contributing to net flows? And how large is the underlying advisory AUA in the platforms that will go live this year or have already gone live?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","So again we continue to look to 2019 for the beginning of a level of contribution that would start to be interesting. So we've not moved off that our confidence, it just continues to strengthen along that. Quite frankly, I don't have the number of AUA of the institutions, but it would be \u2013 frankly, I just don't have it right now. So but it's a large number and an impressive number and that's what gives us confidence that you will see the success in 2019, right.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And just as a follow-up, did any financial institution sign up since the April call?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","We are in process of adding some financial institutions and again we're in the contracting period, so there's nothing we can say, but when we're through it, you'll hear about it.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi, thank you. Good morning. The IGW consolidation, is that $6 billion you mentioned the total AUM that's been consolidated or new flow? And how should we think about the fee rate impact from consolidating that AUM?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","So the $6 billion is \u2013 think of it as a new flow at 100%. We would be consolidating 100% of the AUM inflows going forward, which is, right now, the joint venture is about $22 billion in size. So there'd be another $11 billion showing up in our assets under management. Obviously, the money market is more at the institutional rate, but there is opportunity to do more than just money market on the Ant Financial platform which is at significantly higher rates obviously for active products, you're sort of closer to 75 to 100 basis points in that range.","So it is something that it's a little hard to model right now because it's very much in flux. The immediate kind of opportunity is probably at the lower money market fee.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","So it's fair to say the vast majority of its money funds right now?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","At this point, yes.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. First on outflows, obviously, elevated this quarter and you mentioned market conditions is a factor. The way I see it is, I see more of a boom and bust cycle for Invesco occurring as you promote and rapidly grow certain products only to see performance falter at some point and sort of driving the bust part of the cycle. So we saw this with IBRA this maybe playing out in GTR diversified dividend. Do you see it the same way and are you structuring growth that might be more consistent and repeatable and ultimately have less risk of this sort of boom and bust cycle?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","It's a fascinating point of view. So I put in the context if we've had net inflows for nine years. And I'd say very few firms have done that. And I think what it does show is that the fact is clients do have different demands during different parts of the cycle. And as they see risk on, risk off, they build their portfolios accordingly and it is no different now. And what you're seeing with this value versus growth, you see where all the flows are going throughout the industry at a retail level because you can get clear line of sight. It is a dominant flow picture there, in particular within ETFs. And so I wouldn't call it a boom and bust cycle. I think it's driven by client demands. This current period might be most extreme because of where the market is though. I mean last time you saw something like this not at the exact level but would be the 1999-2000 period.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Okay.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, Invesco I think recently lowered fees in Canada. Can you describe kind of the actions you took and why, and given Canada and Europe both are sort of higher fee regions, how should we think about the fee outlook for the Continental European market?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","So Ken that was a fairly small asset base that got adjusted, so it was not material to any real \u2013 revenue impact. The reason that was done is because there was a discrepancy between similar products in the U.S. and Canada. And so they needed to bring that more in alignment because there was \u2013 we were creating sort of an unhealthy arbitrage opportunity that just need to be closed. So that was all it was pure and simple.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","So there is no sort of planned and other than kind of just making sure our product line up that makes sense.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, guys. Just wondered if you could dig in a little bit more on the retail side of flows, it looks like that was a big driver here in the quarter...","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...it looks more U.S. and UK dominated. I know you highlighted the growth value dynamic. But maybe just additional color on where it's coming from, is it model portfolio, is it broker sold, what's kind of the view from the ground there?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. Now you just \u2013 you hit it right, I mean it's we are in the advice channel. So it's literally driven by investor \u2013 the large \u2013 where it starts really is fall offs in demand and that's what in terms of to drive up the net outflows because of that. And so there's \u2013 it's really a demand topic right now.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","And so just I mean I think in terms of overall magnitude, I mean again I think it needs to put in context, the biggest outflow in the quarter was the sovereign wealth outflow that we preannounced by far and away. U.S. value we've talked about it, it's as a category within the industry in outflow. It's certainly been a very difficult challenging market for that category. And so we're seeing about $2 billion just generally of outflow across value which is again is somewhat consistent with overall industry trend.","Our UK equities which is again sort of a value oriented category is about $1.3 billion related to that category. International growth is about $1 billion and then there is an element which we've talked about in the past related to our REIT product in Japan which is a retail product, Yuexiu Reit and that was about $1 billion. So when you put that all together, I mean you really explain largely what is going on the outflow in the quarter.","Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Great. And then on the capital side, I know you guys are focused on delevering after the Guggenheim deal here, but I guess with just the weakness in the stock in the sector at large. I mean, does that all maybe change your thinking a little bit to do maybe a moderated pace of delevering combined with a little bit of a buyback given here the valuation at the current levels?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","I think we see the stock has been extremely attractive. We are clearly focused on reinstating our buyback program, which I think we've discussed would be in the fourth quarter. We are also trying to preserve our current credit rating and it is something where we have \u2013 we will view that if we were to sort of accelerate the buyback sooner than, before we get the leverage back in line that we would be attempting a downgrade which takes a long time to actually come back from. So we do understand the topic, but the time value here, we're talking about a couple of quarters at most before we can sort of crank up the buyback machine again.","Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you guys say which strategies the two July terminations came in, were they active equity or?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","The two, one was direct real estate and the other was similar sovereign wealth outflow that we've talked about before, so similar topics.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. The Asian equity.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Asian equity?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is now open.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Loren, I don't think you touched on this, but at the last quarter, you had updated an outlook for revenue yield before performance fees of being 40 basis points for the rest of the year. This quarter came in a bit below that. Is the 40 basis point outlook still something that we should use or should we revise that?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So revenues, there's day count noise within that, and so it kind of goes up and it goes down depending on day count. I think the probably somewhere between 40 basis points and 39.5 basis points is very safe in that range over the last half of the year. I do think as we get into 2019 where we continue to see some of the lower price product and our success in our ETF business expands, you're probably looking at sort of down to 39 basis points. Again, but importantly, and again it's an easy point to overlook, this is not because of fee cuts, this is because of the mix of our products and as we gain scale in these lower fee products, we're actually seeing incredibly attractive incremental margins. And so, we don't see anything wrong with the fee rates dropping as long as we're building scale in these products. And our margin on those products are at a higher rate than the firms overall, which is the case. So anyway, that would be our sort of updated guidance around fee rate, net revenue yield, excluding performance.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you, Loren. And just following up and I know there have been a couple of questions on it, so sorry about coming back to it, it's just a little confusing. The growth versus value performance gap you all highlighted, it's not really all that new. I think that's part of the reason why there's some confusion. Also you guys \u2013 Invesco really has a quite a diversified offering, so it's not like we think about you all as really levered to one style versus the other. Is the idea here that, and Marty I think you spoke to it earlier, is the idea here that just the remixing away from value right now within Invesco products is what's so overwhelming? And therefore that's why it's noteworthy. If you could just flesh that out a bit, that'd be great.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, glad you're asking if it's not understood. So I'll try again. So, it's really the magnitude of the change in the concentration, right. So if you look year-to-date, the amount of money going into momentum based growth products is enormous. If you want to use ETF as a proxy, whether it'd be cap weighted or even in smart beta, the vast majority of the money is going into a very few number of funds that are momentum based. So this extreme period, from that perspective, I'm not making any judgments about the merits of it, but that's what you're seeing and what we've had over the last number of years is great success on the value based capabilities.","That's been the driver of flows for us in the U.S. retail channel, in particular when the demand for those comes off and you see such a magnitude of change of relative performance. That's when \u2013 and so literally it happened this year. I mean that's when you saw the change in flows, that's how quickly the sentiment changed from an investor point of view. And I think that's really the point that I'm trying to highlight, not that in fact we saw this. We all have been in the industry a long time, you know this is a natural thing that happens, but it's actually the magnitude of it right now in particular this year and how changed investor \u2013 retail investor sentiment in particular.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, okay. Thanks for that additional color, Marty. Last sort of clean up for me, through July outpost to-date I believe, Loren, you'd said there's a sovereign wealth in the direct real estate. As far as given that there's sovereign wealth, it's a big part of it, is that outflow a lower fee item or is that more in line with the firm average, should we think about that when we start to model here the current quarter?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Because it's active-equity and it's well-performing. I mean it's probably more in line with the firm's overall fee rate, which is unfortunate in terms of the impact. And the real estate \u2013 direct real estate is probably also at a similar fee rate.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. Thanks, guys. Loren, maybe first one just on expenses, it seems like comp and I think property office tech, you came in a bit better. I know some of that's probably FX impacted. But maybe just any update for the second half of the year, given some of the guidance that you gave for the first half.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So I think our guidance sort of largely stays intact. We've been maintaining good vigilance on our expenses and comp as part of that. Some of that is, I think just flexing down, the normal flexing down of incentives, sort of incentives in relationships to operating income, but we would say guidance that we gave earlier stays intact.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got it. And then Marty, just one more on the flow outlook, so the growth versus value, look I understand that. When I think about some of the initiatives that you guys have been working on, so whether it's the broader sort of ETF platform and then when you combine that with some of the digital investments as you head into 2019, I'm just trying to understand how you guys think about maybe, the next 12 months, 24 months in an environment where some of those investments start to kind of contribute and produce more significantly. But maybe we still have this growth versus value issue going on...","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","...versus obviously if that starts to shift and that would be more of a tailwind, but...","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I mean like can you see some maybe normalizing in these outflows just given some of those investments maybe scaling?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","That's the point I have been trying to make, so thank you I'll try to clarify. There is a high degree of confidence that the investments that we've been making and the strengthening of the business whether it'd be institutional and you can start to see the institutional capabilities that China is meaningful for us, the pace of change and our strengthening there is very, very strong. But then the same thing with these \u2013 the ETF platforms, we are now just getting through building up the range of capabilities that we want. Post acquisitions always it takes time to get capabilities on platforms that's where we're going through with Guggenheim right now. It takes months and quarters, not the day you've closed, doesn't mean you're on the platform. Those conversations are all going really very, very well. Literally in any range of model conversations with various platforms, so that's why our confidence is so high and you're going to start to see again whether it'd be Jemstep or Intelliflo start to have the impact to the organization next year.","So I think the question that you're asking, let's assume that the market stays \u2013 the market dynamic stays where it is. Do we anticipate the likelihood of us generating flows beyond these redemptions we do. It's more likely in 2019 than it is this year because hard to call the market and we're not going to call the market, so we're going to anticipate that it plays out for another two, three quarters before you get some change there.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Couple of sort of tactful modeling questions and I might miss this like going on this morning. Do you guys call out the strength in the other revenue line this quarter, I sort of felt like that was a much bigger variant than maybe what the prior guidance was or I may be misremembering that and I do have follow up question.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So that was related to our J-REIT launch in Asia which had significant amount of transaction fees associated with it. So it was related to a fund launch.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So would you expect that to get back into the mid-teens type of level on a go forward basis?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, most likely. I think I view that as more of a one-off.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. Where are you, you mentioned in the press release by but I didn't hear it in the commentary this morning in terms of the global efficiency initiative when you sort of get to that sort of run rate of annualized savings, is that still a year end 2018 number at this point in time?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Absolutely. And we're making progress. We're in mid implementation on some of the outsourcing and we're getting some of the benefits which again is allowing us to maintain expenses and guidance sort of roughly where we had them even despite some of these acquisitions that we've done. So we're feeling good about our optimization efforts and certainly would expect to see them continue on through into 2019.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And just one last one, and Marty, maybe if you, just stepping back a lot of folks of course and you've laid out previously, a long-term guidance of, or at least an aspirational goal of 3% to 5%. Can you sort of help us with the building blocks and how you get from sort of what's a little bit of a choppy view right now, sort of putting the way the style box issue for a moment? How you get from where you are today and really the industry at large to that sort of that low to mid-single digit organic growth rate?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So Bill, it's not going to be any one thing, but it's literally going to be a combination of areas that we've been talking about, right. So we're continuing to see growth in strength and alternatives. We're continuing to see growth in factor capabilities and I put ETFs in that bucket, but it goes beyond that. You're seeing institutional clients outside of the United States look at that as a growth area. And then frankly when these digital platforms start to kick into, they're differentiated in the marketplace and it's really the breadth of those capabilities that will get there. And again I think you would have \u2013 markets are what they are. And again as I said before, if you ask me in December, if you would have seen the magnitude of growth versus value trade going on, I would not have seen it and if it hadn't \u2013 if it just stayed status quo our \u2013 we would be through that organic growth targets that we talked about.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","The other way to think about it, Bill, if you look at our current assets under management, I mean you could highlight that there's at least a third of our assets that are sort of growing at a high-single-digit double-digit rate in terms of ETFs, factors solutions digital. We talked about which are yet to come. If you really just do the math around taking that part relative to the rest of our core business which maybe growing at a more flattish, lower single-digit rate. You really get to that 3% to 5% quite quickly just in the handful of years as long as you can sustain the build out and the growth on these high growth areas which is clearly what we're talking about, what we're focused on.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Your line is open.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Hi, thanks. Just want to follow-up on the conversation around the pace of change speeding up and next-gen passes specifically. So I'm just curious what's going on, you've brought in the new platforms, you've built out products set, you've adjusted pricing where you need to. Can you talk about the conversations with the distributors or are you seeing in sales already, what's going on behind the scenes to give you confidence that that's going to start contributing, because if it does it could make a big difference offsetting some of the style box stuff?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. And so it's not limited to retail. Every conversation that I'm in institutional clients around the world, they're doing the same thing, they're narrowing the relationships. They want more from their money managers and not just the range of capabilities which is, I call it table stakes, a range of strong performing capabilities of our market cycles. But these elements have to be able to get into a solutions conversation with them, help them do analytical work, help them through any number of things, how do you think through factors, how to use factors, about leadership, the ESG, whatever it might be.","There aren't a lot of firms that have that depth and breadth of capability in a range to do that. When you go to the retail channel, it's clear that everybody here understands the U.S. market very well. You are seeing that narrowing of those platforms and again that same dynamic is happening and it's beyond thinking of just a single product on a platform. Yes, that is the majority of what it is today, but more and more can you help more holistically with these platforms from a standpoint of helping build models, participate in building models, helping the successive factors in the retail channel is intellectually accepted, the magnitude of it is nowhere most of us think it's going to go.","So the demand has to be created, the demand is going to be created through education. So do you have capabilities to help educate hand-in-hand with some of these platforms, again very few firms can do that. So those are the types of things that are creating real competitive advantages for the firms that have that, the breadth of those capabilities and the resources to compete in that way and that's very different than what it was five years ago.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","I think marketing spend was up a bunch year-on-year this quarter. Some of that is branding, some of that is selling what's working now. Is any of that targeted towards this, does it fall in under this education process...","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, absolutely.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","And sales force and distribution arm and educators if you will, has that all been built out and your confidence is higher now because we're closer to the payoff?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","No question about it, right. And again what we are doing \u2013 and again you'll hear other firms talk about it, but what we are doing with digital capability is around marketing and education at a level that we've never done before. And that is the future and is pivoting from surpassed practices and past capabilities to the future. And it is being accepted in a very strong manner.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks very much, Marty.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Looks like there was an increase in fund launch cost in the quarter, wonder if you could tell us what's in the pipeline in terms of new products and whether there's any opportunity for Invesco to participate in investor demand for private credit products?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","So, just on the fund launch products, you read the U.S. GAAP release, good for you, that's related to the products that we consolidate. So that actually \u2013 that comment is only relevant for U.S. GAAP, it's a CLO related expense that gets consolidated out in our non-GAAP. So, but with that said, there are quite a bit of new products that are being looked at and probably the one that is most recent is we have eight new bullet share ETFs that were just launched around factor based or self-indexed and managed. So I think that's the one that we feel is going to have some very strong demand and uptake with clients who really haven't had access to these types of products in a real way and Marty, I don't know if you want to talk more broadly about new product introductions that we're looking at?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. It has again very, very focused on where we think in the retail institutional world, it is literally completing the build out of what we think is meaningful and desired by end clients both retail and institutional with factors and that's what you saw with this factor launch, you'll see probably a couple more of them probably ending in the first quarter of next year, that would be the end of probably what we think is the build out, it is on the back of Guggenheim and source and we think having the totality is important.","And again, don't think if this just as ETFs by themselves, they are important part of our solutions capability and the models that we build for clients or helping institutions as they look to embed factors more broadly and some of their thinking in their portfolios.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","And then the other question about private credit?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So within our alternative business \u2013 it is an area that we have some capability, it is not nearly as broad or deep as some of the big PE type firms. But again, I think the range of our alternative capabilities is strong and you've seen the success over the years.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you. Thanks. And just one more bit in terms of housekeeping, it looks like there was a bunch of factors that drove the tax rate a little bit higher. Wondering if there is a more updated guidance for the tax rate going forward? Thanks.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So again we're speaking to the non-GAAP financials which are probably more relevant. 20.6% was the effective tax rate which was steady to the first quarter and is consistent with our guidance going forward. So I'd use that as the non-GAAP tax rate, in terms of the U.S. GAAP tax rate that can move around quite a bit depending on the different products that we have to consolidate, so I find that number a little bit more difficult to provide guidance on that.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Bluestein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Question I guess around capital priorities from here, so you are responding to industry challenges clearly by making several acquisitions over the last couple of years. Do you feel that at this point the build out is generally done from an acquisition perspective and we should think about you guys returning to close to 100% pay out of net income starting 2019 or do you see opportunities for more deals?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. From my perspective, the acquisitions that we made over the last couple of years are from our perspective meaningful and important for the success of the organization going forward and meeting client demands. It is hard to predict the future. I don't see \u2013 generally you don't see the opportunities until they present themselves, right. So there's nothing obvious at the moment, but again we will continue to do what we've done in the past and stay to our capital priorities as we have said. But if there's something that comes along that we think will materially improve the competitive position in the firm we would clearly pay attention to it.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And that would be again in the areas of digital distribution and ETFs or something else?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Hard to predict quite frankly, because if you looked at the breadth of the firm right now, we think we have very competitive set, right now, you just don't know what the opportunities emerge. So I really wouldn't want to lock ourselves into a box, that has been the priority over the last couple of years and we think it's been very helpful.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","I would say, Alex, I mean put our plan, our current thinking is, yes, we'd be back into payout in terms of probably not at a 100%, but typically we've been sort of in that 70% to 80% range, because we do feed a fair amount of our new product launches and so there continues to be a pipeline of sort of organic needs around some of that capital, but we're certainly in terms of the thinking. We'd be back into buyback mode by the end of this quarter or end of fourth quarter.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, got it. And then my second question I guess is just around the UK equity business, performance obviously remains pretty challenged, some of that is style driven, some of that had some specifics. I guess can you remind us what the AUM base there in UK equities, and what the revenue pool on those assets is today. And then I guess as we get kind of closer to Brexit, again maybe just a reminder, what percentage of your UK based product comes from the Eurozone customer base and if there is any sort of risk to that as we get closer to the end of the year?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Why don't I pick up on Brexit, and then Loren can follow up on the other. So look where it stands right now, the vast majority of the money managers are benefiting from sort of this validation model that is the case for us, and it would not materially change our business model, we'd end up with some more people on the continent, but not to a dramatic amount. And that seems to be the state of play as we move forward. So it's not nearly as challenging as it is for some of the investment banks with the pass-porting topics.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","And Alex, out of a total Invesco UK asset base of $136 billion, $27 billion is UK equities.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey guys, can you talk about the Intelliflo acquisition and how you see it fitting into the digital strategy. It looks to me like more of an end-to-end complete platform where as Jemstep is I think more of a frontend, so is that fair? And could you help us just distinguish between those two assets and how you intend to leverage them in their respective markets?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, very good question. So the UK market has changed so dramatically post some of the regulations and what you saw happening was the IFAs were starting to move to platforms to help with some of their investment decisions on funds that they were using and due diligence and the like. And so the center of gravity became these platforms. Intelliflo became obviously a very important one with 35% of the market share.","It is an open platform, it will remain an open platform. That said, it is an opportunity for us to work with Intelliflo and create models through solutions and the like that would benefit the existing IFAs on the market and where a number of things right now. So it is very different, but it's a different market place, where we see the benefit coming together in time with Jemstep and Intelliflo is not just in some of the technologies but it'd be a combination of some of the platform benefits along with the frontend that we think will enhance our offerings in both our markets over time and we'll also look to some other markets around the world as we look forward here.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Was there a purchase price for Intelliflo or any financial details or how much revenue profit et cetera?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So it wasn't a material acquisition relative to let's say Guggenheim. So we've not disclosed the nature of the magnitude of the transaction and that's really pretty consistent with our past practices. It's not going to be material to revenues and expenses being all impacted this year at least.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much. Good morning, folks. Maybe just coming back to the net revenue, your comment, Loren, on the sort of migration towards that more 39 basis point area next year in terms of your assumptions on that. You mentioned that the pipeline of new potential wins more in the 65 basis point area. So I just wanted to see if your assumption of hitting that pipeline is within that 39 basis point, because I realize the ETF franchise and the money market business is going to dilute that. So if you actually do hit a lot of that pipeline, would there be upward \u2013 upside to that 39 bps or is that already in your assumptions?","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. Great question. So I mean the pipeline really goes out six months, nine months, since it's not all the way into 2019 typically they get funded. And so the 2019 commentary is a little bit uninformed in terms of what the pipeline is going to look like at the end of the year, so the guidance that I'm giving you taken with a grain of salt. It's not based on a ton of information other than sort of general trends of mix of where we see the growth and largely around ETFs in particular, and then to some extent money market as well.","So I would say we could do better than that, it's quite possible. But we kind of think that all absent any other information, that's probably the right place to guide people.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe big picture question on the sort of the large chunky institutional outflows and this is obviously an industry issue we're seeing across the asset manager space and lot of it's not in your control because of the allocation decisions by sovereign wealth funds and pension plans. But you guys do have a very good menu of products and solutions capabilities to potentially be on the winning side of some of those things. So maybe, Marty, if you can talk about sort of how you see that outlook ,whether there's a chance you'll get some more wins like the Rhode Island 529 plan and then maybe sort of how you see it sort of from a risk perspective of pension plans doing more allocations away from your core products?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. It's a really good question. So what I can say generally is \u2013 and this'd be around the world, globally what we are seeing the finals that we are in and through quite a broad range of capabilities. The size of the mandates are dramatically larger than they have been over the past number of years. That's a very good sign that's going to continue. And within the pipeline, as Loren said and it continues to grow, it continues to broaden and continues to strengthen. We also try our best to determine what the redemptions are by doing all the things that you would hope, client engagements, the feedback they would have, how the performance is, all those things that you would think be normal factors and decision making. We don't do a good job in forecasting redemptions institutionally, more often than not or I think there's not \u2013 you'll get an immediate termination and it can be a corporate event, it can be an asset allocation decision, but just had at a pension meeting.","So it is really hard to do it and we continue to try to get better at it. But it makes it hard for these conversations from a credibility point of view when you look at the one-offs that happened and clients are entitled to make those decisions and they do and they frankly should. So again, we try to do a better job, we'll continue to try to do a better job of it. It's very hard to get real insight into it. But what we do have a much better sense is the growing magnitude of the size of the institutional accounts and the breadth of them.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. I guess that would sort of say to the extent that you can and I guess when you move the sales force towards maybe in more proactive solutions sale, that would maybe get you into that conversation earlier, is that \u2013 or do you think that's kind of a moot point.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","There are actually two different things. So let me follow up, I see where it's going. So look, the whole firm, the sales force is changing how we're facing off with clients. It is not selling a product, it is a deep product relationship with the client trying to understand what they're trying to accomplish and meet their needs in a broad way, that is really what's going on. And compensation has changed to follow that approach as opposed to being sort of product specific to the total relationship of a client. So that's probably not unique to us, but anybody that has a broad range of capabilities or solutions capabilities is likely doing that. It still doesn't mean that you're going to get the insights into individual decisions that can happen.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I wanted to come back to investment performance because it is obviously so important. When I look at Invesco, I mean you guys have clearly significant scale, significant financial resources. You' think those would be really pretty material competitive advantages particularly relative to smaller asset managers. But it just seems like that's not necessarily translating into superior investment performance, at least on the equity side of the firm. And just wondering if you guys could maybe talk a little bit about why you think that might be and if there's anything you can do to perhaps address that?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Hard to address, because I disagree with it. So again it's back to the conversation that we've been having. So we do have in our equity capabilities a large value bias, and they have grown in size over the last number of years because of the very good performance. It's relatively underperforming where we are in the marketplace, and that has \u2013 when you look at the macro numbers, it paints the overall macro numbers. There's still very, very strong performance throughout the organization. So that's the best that I can do with that if you want to play back the tape 12 to 18 months ago, the numbers are very, very different and you wouldn't be even have asked the question.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, okay. Let me just get a clarifying question here then. These performance numbers we're looking at, the AUM in top half versus peer group, doesn't that control for that? So like the growth numbers or versus growth managers and the value numbers or versus value managers or is that not necessarily the case?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","It depends on the peer group too. So if you look at within our \u2013 if you look at our growth capabilities, international growth capabilities, there's a value bias to it. So it will look like it's relatively underperforming those firms that are momentum growth investors. So if you want to say that that's a same style you can draw that conclusion. That is a shortfall of trying to simplify something by style boxes as an industry that's what we do. But when you look at the individual mandates, that's not how clients are investing or individual investors are investing through IFAs or financial advisors. That's really where the problem is.","And if you compare our diversified dividend capability which is a value capability against comp stock which is a very deep value capability, people are making very different decisions about that. Those are in broad strokes value capabilities, that's where the flaws come in.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. Chris, I'd say the one thing that's probably self-evident though. We don't offer today currently as much growth, pure growth and momentum oriented products as others do. And I'd say that is right now showing up as a business challenge, because that's what selling as Marty said. And so you could certainly falter if you wanted to that we don't add as much of a balance in our mix of product to cover the kind of extreme environment that we're in today, because we do have a probably a higher concentration in value oriented products particularly in the U.S. than maybe others do.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Marty, just wanted to circle back on your commentary before about some of the industry challenges, curious how you see the industry evolving in response to those challenges that you outline, what changes to firm structures and operations could we see? And do you think we could see more consolidation broadly, what sense a situation could it make sense for Invesco to partake in that?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. So \u2013 new license, everybody does a lot of thinking about these things. Look the way that we've been building a firm the way that we've built the firm and how we continue to evolve, we think is addressing that very, very directly. And we think broad breadth of the investment capabilities, is in a stable phase. They need to be able to perform over market cycles, that's not enough. You literally have to have a solutions capability to interface with these clients as all whether it'd be a retail platform or institutional platform is narrowing.","What you also need under those things in our view is and you can see by we believe technology is an enabler not just operationally but very much for meeting client needs, that's why we're building those platforms. And we also believe that you do need scale to generate \u2013 to be competitive in this marketplace. If you ask me up at the level of scale you needed five years ago, I would not have thought that that was such a hugely important factor for success going forward. It is because of the demands on money managers going forward to do more than just manage money for clients and not just invest in investment capabilities but also in operational capabilities largely around technology. So scale becomes really an important factor as you look to success going forward, so if you make these investments going and we've all been talking about.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then just following up quickly on the solutions side, just wanted to dig in there a little bit more. Just curious how much in assets would you say Invesco is managing today and solutions mandates and can you talk about how you're expanding your capabilities on the institutional side of the solutions. It's a competitive market place, how are you approaching the solutions market on the institutional side, and what's differentiated with investments approach?","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah, so we probably \u2013 so there's been a build-up over the last two plus years. We have north of by 45 professionals in the solutions group differently than a number of our competitors. What they use is our range of capabilities, all right. So it is using our capabilities to meet client needs. Solutions probably gets over used because it's expressed in different ways. So we actually use it in the retail channel. It's started in the U.S. retail channel for us, working with if you want to call it corner offices and working with financial advisors, analyzing their portfolios, helping them determine how best to change their asset allocations to meet the needs that they want. So solutions by the name itself suggest that we take all the assets and manage them all, it's a misnomer. So that's what's happening at a retail level.","Institutionally, it's somewhat of the same engagement where very sophisticated clients are working with firms like us and our solutions team to do analytics and looking at their portfolios to see how they might make changes to meet different outcomes they want to. These are sophisticated institutions. They have resources and capabilities. They're wanting to get different perspectives in making their decisions. That's what's different. So many of these interactions are not leading to taking over the totality of the assets, but broadening our relationship with them and expanding the number of mandates we might have with them from a pure solutions assets under management.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. I mean if you aggregate kind of that multi-asset and all those things I mean we're talking about $60 billion within that range. But again I think the biggest opportunity may be right now in terms of being an enabler ...","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah.","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","... for our retail institutional business as opposed to if your standalone business that is creating solutions or doing LDI or something of that nature.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And is that $60 billion on the institutional side or is that both? How do you...","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","That's both retail and institutional.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And on the institutional side, is there a number that you're able to share...","Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.","...half and half, somewhat maybe a little bit more retail than institutional.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Yeah. Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Speakers, we show no further questions in queue at this time.","Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.","Great. Thank you very much for joining Loren and I and we'll be in contact next quarter and before that in various conversations. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to turn the call over to the speakers for today, Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin L. Flanagan","Thank you very much, and thank you everybody for joining us today. As was just -- I'm here with Loren, and we'll go through the presentation. It's on the website if you're so inclined to follow. I'll review the business results for the second quarter, and Loren will go into greater detail of the financial results. And then we'll go to Q&A and address any questions anybody might have.","And before we get into numbers, I want to drive a sense of the macro environmental factors that impacted our business through the second quarter. And as we've seen in the past, it was really a tale of two markets. Some of the gains in April and May were offset by the weakness of June. Global markets stumbled in June as investors reacted to the comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and other Fed officials signaling an early retreat from the asset purchases. And further signs of slowing in the Chinese economy added to additional downward pressure. And as a result, the global markets, particularly emerging markets, generated mostly negative performance in the month of June. And we saw many investors heading for the exit in that period. One of the few bright spots with the U.S. economy working, consumer confidence remain strong and the housing market continue to remain strong and getting stronger. Fortunately, markets have improved considerably in July, and we've seen investors return and add to their portfolios. A key question going forward is, what is the impact of rising interest rates in the United States going to have on the economies and markets in the U.S., in particular, and also around the globe?","So with that as a backdrop, let me highlight the firm's operating results for the third quarter. I'm on Slide 3. Long-term investment performance remains very strong across all time periods during the second quarter. Delivering strong investment performance, our clients contributed to net inflows of $1.4 billion during the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up 26.9% as compared to the second quarter last year. And a continued focus on taking a disciplined approach to our business drove improvement on our operating margins to 39.3% from 35.7% the second quarter in the prior year.","Assets under management were $705 billion during the second quarter, down slightly from $707 billion in the prior quarter. I do want to highlight that assets in the financial results during this quarter reflect our decision to treat Atlantic Trust as a discontinued operation, giving the business and the acquisition by CIBC later this year. Operating income was $310 million versus $306 million in the prior quarter. And earnings per share were $0.50, in line with the prior quarter. We also saw continued improvement in the firm's operating margin to 39.3% from 38.9% in the prior quarter. And reflecting the confidence and the strength of the business, we continued our share repurchase program, buying $75 million in common stock during the quarter and, previously announced, paid the quarterly dividend of $0.225. So a total of $100 million was returned to shareholders during the quarter.","And before Loren goes through the details on the company's financial result, let me take a moment to review the investment performance during the quarter. I'm on Slide 6 now. Investment performance during the quarter was again amongst the strongest we've seen across our global enterprise. 82% of assets were ahead of peers on a 5-year basis, and 81% of assets were ahead of peers on a 3-year basis. And as you might expect, with numbers like these, long-term performance of our investment teams across the enterprise are quite strong, with number -- with a number of capabilities achieving top decile performance. In particular, our Henley investment team was named best performing fund manager of the last decade by FE Trustnet, which is the main supplier of data in the U.K. financial sector. 91% of the Henley team's funds were in the top quartile over a 5-year period and ended -- that ended this past second quarter. And of course, it's a remarkable result and it's a very strong team and very dedicated to generating consistent, good, long-term performance. Also, the performance of our cross-border range -- fund range remain very strong during the quarter, 86% of assets in the top half of peers for both the 3- and 5-year periods.","Turning to flows. Gross sales remained strong across the global business during the second quarter. And to put this in perspective, gross sales were up 51% versus same quarter a year ago. However, strong gross sales were offset by redemptions as markets and investor confidence tumbled in June.","I'm now on Slide 8. Following on the record net inflows for our retail channel in the first quarter, we saw strong gross sales and solid inflows in the retail channel during the second quarter. These were offset by -- to some extent by redemptions in June. Within the institutional channel, our pattern over the past few years is that we typically see a number of mandates funded [ph] in the first quarter, which leads to softness in the second quarter. In the most recent quarter, solid gross sales were overshadowed by the previous disclosed FX overlay and a low-key passive real estate outflow totaling $2.5 billion in addition to challenges related to the markets in June. The good news is -- for the third quarter is that long-term flows during the month of July are already ahead of total flows that we saw in the second quarter. And again, this can change during the rest of the quarter but off to a very good start. And additionally, the institutional pipeline of one but not funded mandate also looks very, very strong.","Turning to Page 9. Gross sales for our U.S. retail business remained strong at $21.8 billion for the quarter, a 49% increase over the same quarter a year ago. Strong sales were offset somewhat by redemptions. However, Invesco's retail market share of net flows was considerably higher than its market share of assets under management. Additionally, PowerShares' traditional ETFs achieved year-to-date inflow, market share that was significantly higher than the asset under management share, 8.4% of flows against the 2% market share in assets. The annualized redemption rate remains favorable relative to the industry, although we saw some narrowing of the margin between the 2. Flows into the complex were led by continued strength in traditional ETFs, balanced risk strategy, U.S. value in international growth. Importantly, we continue to see a broadening of flows across the capabilities, with 19 Invesco funds generating inflows of $50 million or more year-to-date versus 9 funds generating inflows at that level in the same period a year ago.","The strong investment performance of our multi-asset suite of products continue to generate tremendous interest from clients who are attracted to a capability that aims to provide a high level of protection in volatile markets. Although not at the pace of the prior quarter, we continue to see strong growth during the second quarter across the entire suite of products, with net flows of $2 billion. Flows into the strategy were impacted by the challenging market in June. The market declines in the quarter were unusually correlated, limiting the asset classes' diversification benefit. Highly correlated environments such as these are rare but not unprecedented and are typically short-lived. Relative to risk parity strategies of competing firms, Invesco outperformed in June and for the trailing 12 months.","We thought it'd be helpful to provide some context for the firm's performance in an environment of rising interest rate. And from our perspective, this is largely a U.S. topic. As everyone knows, flows into fixed income have been very strong across the industry over the last number of years. In past rising rate environments, the types of capabilities that have been most negatively impacted in this rising rate environment are government products, and to a lesser degree, municipal bond products, intermediate investment grade categories, which include core and core-plus, have experienced outflows. In addition, given the low absolute yields and the possibility of negative returns in core and core plus, we could experience elevated outflows to what we've seen in other rising rate environments. The bulk of our fixed income assets are short-term products, cash products, stable value, as well as credit-oriented products, such as bank loans, which are less susceptible to outflows in a rising rate environment. Lastly, given the strong performance and broad diversity of our capabilities, including equities, risk parity, alternatives, we're well positioned to capture money that shifts as a result of rising rates. With this as a backdrop, chart on Slide 11 makes the point that Invesco's U.S. retail assets are less vulnerable than the top -- than our Top 20 competitors. In this case, the chart represents roughly 70% of the industry to outflows from taxable fixed income. In addition, given the large cash and stable value assets, the institutional assets are less vulnerable as well.","We feel good about the momentum in the business. We remain confident in our ability to deliver a high level of value to our clients. And we believe the firm is very well positioned regardless of where the markets take us next. As always, we continue to focus for opportunities that further strengthen our competitive position and our financial position over the long term.","I'll stop there and turn it over to Loren.","Loren M. Starr","Thanks, Marty. So quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM fell $2.1 billion or 0.3%. Positive long-term flows of $1.4 billion were more than offset by the negative impact from markets and FX of $3.5 billion. Despite the market decline featured in June, our average AUM for Q2 was still up 4.1% to $719.8 billion. Our net revenue yield came in at 43.9 basis points, of which are the decrease of 1.7 basis points quarter-over-quarter. And that was driven by lower performance fees.","And now let's turn to the operating results. Net revenues increased $2.3 million or 0.3% quarter-over-quarter, which included a negative FX rate impact of $4.1 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees grew by $42.4 million or 4.9% to $905.2 million. This increase was in line with a higher average AUM and also a small improvement in the effective fee rate during the quarter. Foreign exchange reduced investment management fees by $4.9 million. Service and distribution revenues are up by $9.4 million or 4.6%, also roughly in line with the increase in average AUM. FX decreased service and distribution revenues by $0.4 million. Onto performance fees, we saw $9 million in the quarter, but that represented a decrease of $29.6 million from Q1. Performance fees in the second quarter were driven by actually a variety of products, including bank loans, current [ph] equity and as well, institutional mandates in the U.K. Foreign exchange reduced our performance fees slightly by $0.1 million. Performance fees, as we've discussed in the past, are rather difficult to forecast. So I'm providing some guidance on this line item, however -- which is just this about $5 million per quarter other than in Q1, when we tend to see higher levels in the U.K. depending on performance in the U.K. Other revenues in the second quarter came in at $28.9 million, and that was an increase of $3.1 million versus the prior quarter. The increase in other revenue was largely driven by higher real estate transaction fees. Foreign exchange reduced other revenue by $0.2 million. Again, this line item can move around a bit. And so I would guide you all to use a run rate of about $26 million per quarter. Onto third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, which we net against gross revenue, that increased by $23 million or 6.7%.","And before I move to the next slide, I'd just like to explain a little bit the disconnect between the growth in the distribution expense, as well as the management fee growth. The distribution expenses actually were in line with our retail management fees in the quarter. The reason management fees were up only 4.9% while distribution expenses were up 6.7% is largely due to the institutional management fees being down quarter-over-quarter as they were in line with institutional AUM, which declined 2% at the end of the quarter versus the beginning.","So then moving on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $479.7 million decreased by $2.1 million or 0.4% relative to the first quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $3 million. Employee comp at $322.7 million declined by $12.1 million or 2.6%. And this drop in compensation was driven by lower seasonal payroll tax cost as well as a reduction in staff cost as we completed the outsourcing of our European transfer agency in June. This was slightly offset by a full quarter's worth of salary and share-based expenses. Our foreign exchange impact was $2.1 million in the quarter for comp. Looking forward, assuming no change in quarter-end asset levels, we would expect compensation to be down approximately $3 million to $5 million through the remainder of the year, again, assuming flat AUM. Marketing expenses increased by $1.2 million or 5.2% to $24.3 million. FX decreased these expenses by $0.1 million. And we expect marketing to return, however, back to the $27 million level per quarter going forward. Property, office and technology expenses came in at $68.4 million in the second quarter. That was up $2.1 million. The increase was driven by the completion of the outsourcing of our European transfer agency again and by continued investment in portfolio management technology systems. Foreign exchange reduced these expenses by $0.4 million. In terms of guidance, we would expect property, office and technology expense to level off around $72 million to $74 million going forward. G&A expenses came in at $64.3 million, up 6.7% or 11.6%. Please recall that the first quarter included a $2.5 million legal settlement credit. The additional $5.7 million of expense was the result of new product development, as well as increased compliance and risk management cost in Europe. Foreign exchange increased G&A by $1.5 million. Going forward, we'd expect G&A to decline to roughly $63 million per quarter.","Continuing on down, you'll see that nonoperating income declined by $1.3 million, and the firm's effective tax rate on a pretax adjusted net income in Q2 was 27.1%. The quarter's tax rate was roughly 100 basis points higher than the guidance that we gave before, and that was the result of changes in the mix of profits, reflecting a higher proportion in the U.S. and Continental Europe. Going forward, we'd expect to see -- expect the expected tax rate to be around 26.5% to 27.5%, which brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.50 and adjusted net operating margin of 39.3% despite assets under management. Ending the second quarter lower than the beginning of AUM in the quarter, we'd expect operating margins to exceed 40.5% by year end. Please note that we now exclude Atlantic Trust from our continuing operations and as a result, we have added the additional 0.5 percentage point to our prior guidance on the operating margin.","And with that, I'd be happy to turn it back over to Marty.","Martin L. Flanagan","So we're ready for any questions anybody might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Carrier with Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe first question, just on the flow outlook. Marty, you gave some color both on the institutional side and on the retail sides in July. I guess just 2 things. Just on the institutional side, x the $2.5 million that you guys noted earlier, just what trends were you seeing during the quarter that led to the outflows? And then you mentioned the pipelines looking pretty good. So where is the interest kind of going forward for the institutional in the channel?","Martin L. Flanagan","Let me just -- maybe I'll talk about the pipeline and then Loren can follow up. So I think the seasonality is a real thing for us, and I suspect it might be for others. So I think importantly, if you look at where the pipeline -- or if you look at gross sales a year ago, institutionally, and to the gross this quarter, still up year-over-year, that's a good sign. If we look at the pipeline, won but not funded, so it's not hopeful, right? These are won but not funded. It's hitting some of the highest levels that we've seen. So we think that's a very, very good sign. And it's simply a matter of timing, as we've talked in the past.","Loren M. Starr","Yes. In terms of the -- what happened in the quarter, I think there were some outflows, as we saw also in retail just in terms of the equities, largely focused in Asian equities and international equities. So that was sort of another element within the quarter, but I wouldn't say that's a trend that we'd expect to be ongoing.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, just on the expenses and the margins. So there's a lot of moving pieces with Atlantic Trust being backed out and then you gave guidance on a lot of the expense items. So I just wanted to be clear, for year end, assuming the current environment, in terms of the flow picture, the market picture, you're still targeting that 40% plus margin. I guess, what would make that change, meaning, would it be the -- assuming flat-out markets, but from a flow standpoint, anything that could potentially be more weak, meaning if you saw weakness on the balanced products, could that change that? Or is that fairly certainly based on what you can see at this point?","Martin L. Flanagan","I don't see us not hitting that. So I mean, you'd have to have a quite appropriate -- quite a pullback in the market. So...","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I would answer that. I think, I mean, in terms of sort of some outflows we may have seen, I think that modest relative to this asset base that's been built up and the product that -- the allocation product and we're seeing other higher fee products in the pipeline. So I honestly think the mix topic isn't one that is going to change our forecast. And as we've said in the past, I think, obviously, the guidance is now 40.5% by year end. And so we do feel pretty good about that. And clearly, if markets improve from the end of the quarter, which they have, that's obviously a very positive element, and you'll see operating leverage provide for their upward lift on margins.","Martin L. Flanagan","And I just -- adding to that point where -- as we talked numerous times, the risk parity, the multi-asset strategies is a real strength of the firm; it continues to be a strength. We continue to see interest around the world. But we've also said, importantly, if you look at the depth and breadth of the capabilities in a rising equity market, what would you anticipate? We would anticipate a slowdown. And what would you then imagine happen is that you would see flows going to the equity markets. And frankly, that's bit into the equity capabilities. And we're seeing that. We're seeing broadening -- they ought use -- more public. If you look at the U.S. retail market, you're seeing not just international equities now, but you're seeing a broadening of the U.S. value capabilities. And those are things that we anticipated. And again, it's strong, performing capabilities. Our -- they are many and broad. So -- and again, you couple that with a rising interest rate environment, if you believe that in the making, which I think most of us do, we think we're very well positioned for that also.","Loren M. Starr","And the other thing I would just mention, Mike, is Continental Europe, which has been a strong provider of a good sort of flow mix. In terms of fee rates, it's still very, very strong for us and continues on through July. So again, I think the indicators are still quite positive and green about -- so the mix continuing to improve. So I don't want to take that away from the conversation at all.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Kim, Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just first, to follow up on the IBRA strategies, obviously, they've been an important flow contributor for the firm. And while the 3-year track records remain strong, some of the shorter-term numbers have lagged a bit. So any recent shifts in terms of redemptions and performance, meaning have you started to see signs that maybe the stickiness of those assets have weakened just given some of the more recent underperformance?","Martin L. Flanagan","No. So -- let me follow up on the performance element because, again, I think importantly, the public category is very broad and it's made up of many different things. If you look at the risk parity strategies within it, our relative performance is very strong compared to other risk parity strategies. And that's even in that down month of June, which is not how people make investment decisions. But that's an important test for that capability. But if you look at the trailing 12 months, it's very strongly performing and outperforming its peers. So I think that's a very important point to take. And we would have anticipated, as I've said, as equity markets rebound, there will be greater interest and more broadly away from that. That said, we continue to see interest in the risk parity capabilities through different channels in different locations -- different regions in the world.","Loren M. Starr","I'd also just add that we know that the institutional side of the business is actually -- the demand is actually improving and growing for this particular product. So it's definitely a feature in our pipeline doing nicely, Michael. And so even though the retail side may have paused a little bit, maybe the redemption rate is going back to more of a normalized level, I think it was sort of abnormally low because it was sort of low base and not a lot of time frame in terms of people, I mean, held the product. We're seeing that sort of go to a more normal level. Sales may be off a bit, but we absolutely think institutional and retail will provide sort of continued flow opportunities for this product unless -- if equity markets take off in a very solid way, as we've always said, we'd expect that product probably not be quite as much as in demand as some of the equity products.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just more broadly, as a firm, you've always been forward-looking in terms of trying to optimize the business, either from a strategic standpoint or an operational perspective. So as you look across the franchise today, any color on areas that you might be targeting for further optimization or development?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. I would make the point when we talked about it some in the past. We are strong believers of extending our core investment management capabilities. And where has that moved into? And it's into, more broadly, multi-asset strategies. We're a big believer in that. People are focused on risk parity. But quite frankly, it's quite a bit broader than that. Looking at multi-credit capabilities coming, there will be the U.K. launch of another multi-asset strategy that we'll start there in October, that will end up in different parts of the world, so just much more broadly extending our investment capabilities into what we think is people are calling and different liquid alternatives and the like because we've had teams that have managed them, various capabilities for 10, 12 years in the institutional market. And we continue to pay attention to that. So we continue to look to strengthen what is a very strong part of the organization already.","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you could maybe go another layer or 2 in the July snapback of flows and maybe answer it by either geography, where you're seeing the recovery and\/or by maybe type of product, active versus passive.","Loren M. Starr","Sure, Bill. I think in terms of interest for the snapback in July, we're definitely seeing interest in equities, long-term active equities that's featuring nicely, positive flows showing up. We're also seeing continued interest in our traditional PowerShares product. So that's been a theme that continues to ride. Good strength in Asia Pac and Continental Europe, in particular, are really doing very well for us, not that U.S. is not. But I think the U.S. featured even more strongly in the first quarter, whereas now I think the other regions are actually sort of showing equal strengths. So the interest in the products -- and we have fixed income as well, alternative fixed income, continue to be a very interesting product, real estate. So it's a lot of the things we've talked about. The only thing that sort of different, I'd say, is that instead of asset allocation being the #1 kind of driver of flows in July, that has really been sort of more equity-oriented products and some of the alternative fixed income that has shown up as the greatest demand.","Martin L. Flanagan","And again, you don't want to extrapolate early days into a quarter. But as Loren started to highlight, basically, every region of the company is in that flows right now. And for the number of years that I've been here, I don't remember that happening to that degree now. But that can change very quickly. But it just showed the relative strength. And as I pointed out, just look at gross flows being up 50% quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, I mean. And the broadening of the interest throughout a number of capabilities, I think, is the main point of underlying strength.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And the second question is just going back to Martin for a second. I appreciate your guidance for the next couple of quarters. When you think more thematically as you look out to 2014 and beyond, how do you think about incremental margin? And I guess the underlying question is, are there any pent-up investments that need to be made as you position for further growth into next year?","Loren M. Starr","So I mean when we think about our plan, we plan multiyear. So we have a reasonable sort of look forward into what we plan to do not just this year and kind of year-to-year kind of discussion. We kind of think out multiple years. So we do think we know the big imperatives. We know where the investment is sort of taking place. And my expectation is that there's going to be sort of a continued level of good investment around the business as you'd hope us to be doing, but nothing that's going to sort of step up as sort of being a big surprise or in an area where we've under-invested and suddenly the need is going to have a real impact on margin. So we would expect and hope to see incremental margins, again, not that we manage the business this way but sort of in that 60%, 65% range into 2014 and beyond. And again, we believe that that sort of operating leverage should allow our margin, assuming markets grow and we're able to grow organically, to continue to expand beyond the current guidance that we have given for this year.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Worthington, JPMC.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, I'd like to ask about the halo effect around IBRA. And maybe to what extent has success at IBRA -- or has success at IBRA opened up new distribution or expanded existing distribution relationships? And has it actually allowed you to sell other products that you might not have sold otherwise?","Martin L. Flanagan","It's a good question. And I think as we've talked in the past, maybe the U.S. retail channel, in particular, because if you go back to handful of years now, as we've said, the Invesco brand was relatively new into the retail channel. And so having something successful creates absolute awareness more broadly across the capabilities. And that coupled with having the capabilities sort of performing well, I think you could clearly make the argument that that has been a very powerful thing in particular. That might be less so in other regions of the world where we've been Invesco and has had a good number of years of success. But it is something I would not discount. I think you're right.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. And then, I guess, how much more do you think you can leverage that? And in particular, I'm thinking about the Van Kampen products. The returns and the performance has been very good there. They're in that kind of the rate asset class for the right time. We're seeing sales at something like a comp stock turnaround. But some of the other big flagship funds that are performing great are still in redemption. So I guess it's kind of a combination of, one, can you leverage evermore to get these products into more channels and actually get them sold given the backdrop seems so good for them? Or has the -- have you kind of maxed out the success in IBRA in terms of leveraging it for other products?","Martin L. Flanagan","So I wouldn't make it so info-centric [ph] I think very, very importantly, what we are seeing is where the focus of net inflows and the values it was really around, right? It is now broadening, right, against the value suite. So that's a really good sign, and really, for 2 years we have been talking to our distribution partners and clients about the obvious, get into the equity market. So it has been more of a lack of interest on clients to be investing on equities. But, do know it is an absolute focus of the firm to continue to broaden the awareness and participation in some really, really strong investment capabilities across the firm. And I think that's happening. And, look, the data point I would -- as I said, a year ago there were 9 funds in the U.S. retail channel worth $50 million or more in a quarter of sales. There's 19 today. So it is -- I'd say we've not seen the success that we would anticipate.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And, lastly, active alt's doing very well. I assume that's real estate, but can you give us some more color there and maybe talk about performance and pipeline for Wilbur, quant and the other active alt areas.","Loren M. Starr","So in active alt, our 2 sort of primary drivers have been the real estate group, as you can imagine, but also bank loans, which has done really, really well. We have seen more and more consultant advocacy for the bank loan products. I think now it's really sort of tick a lot of the boxes with all of the consultants on this product. And we have, in our pipeline, strong showings for both of those areas in particular. In terms of our private equity capability, we still have great opportunities there. But, as you know, it's more centered around a particular fund launch and right now they're working through investing their current products. But we see an opportunity to do other things until the new recovery fund comes up and so there is, certainly, activity and assets that are in the pipeline as a result of some of those elements. But I'd say they're smaller, on the spectrum of what real estate and bank loan is doing.","Martin L. Flanagan","I would add just, Ken, to the question, and it gets to the broader question you and Bill and others were asking earlier. So the quant team has really been -- again, this is one of the ones that -- team has been together 20 years, great performance and they are natural extensions and they have been very successful the last number of quarters now with multi-assets capabilities. They've been of interest in Germany in particular, and again, those are the type of things that we think there's opportunities in other parts of the world.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","One more question on IBRA. If you could maybe talk about the gross sales versus redemption trends, maybe in June and kind of what we're seeing in July, if the growth sales have slowed and you're seeing elevated redemption or kind of what the dynamic is there.","Loren M. Starr","I can do that. So we saw in June certainly a tick down on sales. It wasn't dramatic but maybe 15% to 20% kind of decline in sales. But redemptions really picked up, right? So I think we saw there an unusual spike in redemption in June, filling out one that is carried over into July. So we're seeing in July sales still at a more modest level than we've seen in the past, and we've seen redemption rate, though, sort of subside. So it's not spiking as much. So, still, we're looking at July data, it's sort of just the data points. So we ought to see probably another couple of months before we really decide what is really the trend and where its going to stabilize. But it's moving in the right direction, where the redemption rate is going back to what I would say is more of an industry norm redemption rate, if that's around 20% kind of redemption rate, and then we would see sales, depending on what the market is, at maybe, hopefully more than half the level of where it was before and hopefully somewhere around 3\/4 of the level we've seen in the past.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then I guess a question on the distribution margin, you gave explanations to what happened this quarter. And if I think about what you're saying for your institutional pipeline, with that coming back, should we see that more normalized going forward or any outlook in terms of that expense revenue dynamic?","Loren M. Starr","Yes. No, absolutely. I mean, really, what happens is institutional assets are priced at quarter end, typically, because the quarter we saw a big drop in rates -- sorry, in markets. We just, obviously, kind of didn't have good luck in terms of when the revenues are going to be calculated off of that asset level. We've seen asset levels come back so that's a good sign. And then the other thing, obviously, in terms of the pipeline, our institutional pipeline is probably more than 10% above its 12-month average run rate, and certainly even higher than it was -- much even higher than that than it was relative to the first quarter. So we do think that with the institutional pipeline is, even though didn't present a lot of great results in the second quarter, the fundings are going to happen in the third quarter and fourth quarter, right? So there was really just this pause of fundings that took place in the second quarter because so much of it happened in Q1.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Kelley of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Loren, just to kind of follow-up on that last question. When you've given the 40.5% operating margin guidance by year end now, I assume, first of all, that's x Atlantic Trust. And then second of all, is your distribution margin kind of more normalizing, indeed reflected in that 40.5%?","Loren M. Starr","So the answer is yes. Atlantic Trust is excluded, so that's the extra 0.5 percentage point on top of the original guidance of 40%, so that's correct. We do think that the distribution costs, in terms of the margin that you're looking at, which -- again, I just warn you a little bit on looking at those things because they're not exactly comparable -- should be more normalized and our forecast still reflects our expectations for, I think, that normalization to take place, which is based on, I think, fact. So we have not seen anything. Just to clarify, we've not seen that sort of should cause anybody alarm. Our distribution costs have suddenly spiked up, where we have changed our payouts to our distributors. That did not happened in the second quarter.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just another question, I know you've been asked a lot of different ways. But, on IBRA, just wanted to ask sort of a different question. Do you think that some of the channels that you've been selling that through really understand the decision makers, the gatekeepers, if you will, really understand the different dynamics of your fund versus something of your peer funds and how they're supposed to behave in certain environments or are they just kind of -- I know they is a broad statement, but that a lot of gatekeepers sell them all as allocation funds and don't really differentiate a lot between them?","Martin L. Flanagan","So I can only speak to our capability, and I feel quite strongly that it is absolutely understood by, just call them the gatekeepers, into the channel and we spent an awful lot of time on education. And so I think, speaking for the capability that we have, I'd say there's an awful a lot of attention on that educational point and I think it's broadly understood.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Hopson of Stifel.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two questions. Can you talk about the timing of the sale proceeds and then the effect on share repurchase? And then, Marty, what would you say -- obviously, IBRA and a couple of other products have been the go-to products in the field. But in terms all of wholesaling messages out there, what -- has anything changed in terms of what your guys are focusing on? Any change in messaging, et cetera? And what is Invesco trying to do in terms of making the brand, et cetera, the message unique versus others?","Martin L. Flanagan","So again, I might be a little repetitive. But, again, the absolute focus is trying to understand client needs and listening very intently to them. And putting forward investment capabilities that meet those needs. So as you would be aware, most all the distribution partners right now have their strategists and they put forward their ideas of what they think is proper asset allocation. We work very hard with them to make sure that we follow along with that and make our capabilities available. And that sort of, point being, is very broad, the range of capabilities of that focus. We, in particular, as I said previously, for the last couple of years have been very, very focused on the merits of a well diversified portfolio and the importance of equity exposure within that. Not just U.S. but all the way to international global capabilities, and we think that is really then under -- people have been underexposed. I mean, it's no question about it and it was clearly, I think, a reflection of people just feeling -- not having a level of confidence coming through the crisis. So it has been a very broad message. We spent an awful lot of time if you just follow -- you can look at the websites and get some sense of the intellectual capabilities that we put forward in education. So those have been the focuses of the firm.","Loren M. Starr","And just in terms of your first question, our expectation is that the deal will close before the end of the year. The reason I can't give you an exact date is because there are some regulatory steps we have to go through in terms of getting approval. But beyond that, there's no reason, at this point in time, to think that that won't happen. The proceeds, when we get them, which will be at the close, we will then execute our buyback around that time. So, hopefully that's consistent with what you have expected.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, if I could follow up, the U.K. in particular. I know you've done well, I think, with IBRA being introduced there. But the traditional products, as you point out, are performing extremely well, flows have been okay. But any thought on -- in this environment, could you see some improvement in sales end or flows from the traditional perpetual products?","Martin L. Flanagan","Sure. Where we're starting to see interest is broadening, right? The international capabilities are performing well. Flows are moving very much into their -- the fixed income capabilities continue to be very, very strong and continue to see flows into those capabilities, so it broadening. And, also, we anticipate that in the fourth quarter will be the introduction of the multi-asset capability, that team has joined us earlier this year. So, that, we think is also a very, very important thing. With introduction of RDR, and the focus will be multi-asset strategists around the broad range of Invesco Perpetual capabilities in the first instance, and then we'll broaden as it moves around world. And so we think we're positioned very well.","Loren M. Starr","And I would just add, in July, we're seeing very nice strong flows coming from Invesco Perpetual across fixed income international equities and U.K. equities, so all products are doing well there.","Operator","The next question comes from Luke Montgomery of Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","It sounds like you answered a little bit of this already. But, coming back to the institutional business, one of your competitors is talking about changing behavior of large international institutional clients including sovereign wealth funds, which have been reducing allocations to long only-U.S. strategies for a variety of reasons. Some of those are investment related and some of them aren't. But when I look at your flows, institutional net outflows, equity net outflows, that seems to confirm the trend. But then, by region, the outflows are concentrated in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, all of the inflows came from Continental Europe. So you highlighted some lumpiness in the quarter, I'm not sure how sure how much you can make from all that, but perhaps you could drill down a little more specifically about institutional demand or behavioral trends by client domicile or client type.","Martin L. Flanagan","It's a great question. So what you are seeing -- let me try to pick it up sort of regionally in that concept -- the lumpiness in Europe is -- again, this relation, the success we're having with multi-asset strategy that's managed out of Frankfurt. That is a capability that there is interest in other parts of the world. Less so in the United States, but in Asia there is, also, and into United Kingdom. The interest that we see from sovereign wealth funds and the like, it does tend to be more of the multi-strat capabilities. Things like bank loans, things like real estate, so alternative type capabilities, and that has been focus for where we have been seeing a lot of interest. We have also seen less interest in more traditional long-only capabilities and that's where you've seen, even after having many years of relationships with some of these large sovereign wealth funds where they are having less exposure to some long-only capabilities. Is that a permanent trend? Hard to know. But I would confirm what you're hearing. It's been our experience.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the ETF business, loan participation ETF, that's been a fairly large driver of your inflows over the last year, as has the emerging margin market debt ETF. Wondering if you can just weigh in on the debate about whether ETFs help or hurt liquidity during times of stress, especially in classes like fixed income where the underlying liquidity is thinner. And what are the risks in ETF market structure that really concern you and what can go wrong here?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, I know it's quite a debate. I think it, personally, gets overplayed. The idea that ETFs drives up oil prices, et cetera, et cetera. I just don't know that I am a big believer in those types of things and so I don't have empirical evidence to support my opinion at the moment, but I just don't really see that to the same degree.","Loren M. Starr","I would just say that -- I mean, because, particularly our product is more retail focus, it's not as rapid motion in terms of people's behavior, in terms of buying and selling. So, again, in terms of us sort of moving markets and having big distortive swings, I don't think PowerShares is certainly providing that.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Lee of KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","First question -- and I think I'm a little slow this morning -- but just to make sure, clarify it for me and all -- July. So, July flows generally positive across the board, at least in terms of geography. So I want to make sure I have that.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes.","Loren M. Starr","That's correct.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Second question I have is just on kind of capital management. Clearly bought back few more shares this quarter than last quarter. But in general, it does look like kind of return to between that share repurchase and dividend, a little less than cash generation. And just how should we be thinking about it? Is one of the near-term priorities kind of continuing to chip away at short-term debt? I mean, it looks like that may have come down about $100 million or so in the quarter. Is that kind of the pace that we should generally think about?","Martin L. Flanagan","Rob, I mean, I think our strategy hasn't changed really. So we've increased -- so, I mean, just to back on, we've increased our amount of maturing capital in the form of dividends. We've reduced the amount that we were doing in buybacks, but that we've not turned away from buybacks and you're seeing sort of good run rate on dividends and buybacks, given our operating cash flow generation this year. Excluding, obviously, Atlantic Trust, which would be sort of on top of whatever we would doing, run rate. We did pay down a little bit of the debt. So net debt decreased, I think, about $150 million in the quarter. That's not unusual because it's usually at a high level in the first quarter and sort of comes on down. So we're going to continue to sort of chip away at the debt and sort of increase our cash levels over time to get to that $1 billion in excess of our regulatory requirement. But as we've said in the past, and we'll continue to say, I mean it's sort of a self-regulated pace that we're going on and we're not sort of following that as the first number one priority and sort of reducing the other opportunistic chances to buy any shares if we think that's the right way to. So, over time, it is our hope that we would be able to return even more of our operating cash flow to shareholders as we achieve those objectives. And so where we are today could actually expand. So I would generally guide people to think that our ability to return cash will increase over time and that we will achieve our goals in terms of debt paydown at the same time, and cash. A wall to build, so that we can do all that without anybody feeling slighted.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one last question, just on Canada. Since you touched on all the other regions, I guess. I mean, can you just kind of touch on what you're seeing there? I know it's obviously not as big a business as it used to be but it tends to be a high-fee type of business and I think relatively high margins. So are you seeing, really, kind of the same improvements there in their traditional products or you're really seeing the momentum more from new products you've introduced there over the last year or 2?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, so, I think it's a combination of all those things. Actually, our traditional products, which historically has the highest fee, we're sort of less in the focus in terms of the distribution that we had in Canada, and they were focused somewhat more on some of the assets allocation products that were introduced there. What we are seeing now is that a lot of those traditional invested Trimark branded products are doing extremely well from an investment performance perspective. And so the level of interest and activity around the core products is much more than they were in the past. And so we're seeing sort of a shift of balance, I think, in terms of focus. Maybe a little bit away from the asset allocation products and back to the core. So that's -- sort of we're in the middle of that right now. We think it going to continue and we would not be surprised to see more focus on the core and maybe a little bit less on the asset allocation, just going forward, given the fact that the core had been largely sort of ignored for a long period of time.","Operator","The next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So, just generally speaking, given the dynamics you guys laid out in the quarter, with weakness in June and average AUM being higher than beginning and ending AUM, the fact that you have some passive drive in the flows. My assumption is just we should see some downward pressure on the management fee rate here going forward, all else being equal. I mean, is that right or should I be thinking about it in a different way?","Loren M. Starr","Yes. I think you're probably off a little bit on that one. So one of the things we're seeing is that the passive products -- I mean, their fee rate has been growing, right? Because as we've seen, like the bank loan product which has done so well, I mean, that's at 65 or 70 basis points fee. So that has really been helpful in terms of driving up the fee rate. In terms of the mix of flows coming in from Continental Europe, some from Asia now that we've got more balance -- I mean, we're actually -- the products outside of the U.S. tend to have higher fees than ones in the U.S., and so if we're seeing sort of Asia and Continental Europe and U.K. sort of coming back more strongly, that's going to be helpful too. And then, finally -- I mean, as people, and we're hoping this is the case, sort of have more of an appetite for risk and risk-oriented products -- I mean, all those risk-oriented products are going to have a higher fee than sort of the stable value of money market type of products that can grow but definitely don't do much for the fee rate. So we would expect, and it is in our thinking, that we'll continue to see the effective fee rate grow. It did grow some from the second quarter to the first quarter by about 1\/2 of a basis point in terms of the core management fee. And, again, we would expect to see continued slow improvement over time. We don't want to give you the wrong idea that it's going to pop up 1\/2 a basis point every single quarter, but I mean it could slowly grow over the course of 2013.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And sort of following up on a point that you made there, in the context of that response, and then you have seem to referred to it a few times. You all seem to be saying that you're basically positioned well for a great rotation. But we've heard other asset managers saying that they're not really seeing signs of that great rotation, and certainly not a rotation out of fixed income into equities. I just want to clarify sort of just ask you guys bluntly. Are you seeing something different in your conversations with clients or is it more that you believe that in the course of the coming 12 or so months that you expect that to happen and that will lead you guys to benefit?","Martin L. Flanagan","So, it's a good question. I would agree with the idea that we are not seeing a great rotation at the moment. But what we are seeing, if you look over the last 12 months, people are great putting more money into risk-type assets. Loren was talking about traditional ETFs. You're seeing just great growth there. And not just bank loans, but into equity capabilities in emerging markets within that. That would be something. I had mentioned earlier, we're actually seeing net flows not those just into international equity capabilities, but actually into U.S. value capabilities. That's relatively new. So I would say that you're starting to see people gain a little more confidence and their broadening, where they are allocating our portfolio to more risk-type capabilities. That said, we're never going to try to guess a market. We know we'll be wrong, so the main point that we were trying to get across today, in many different ways, is that investment performance across the organization just couldn't be stronger. And that's from fixed income through equity capabilities. And if you look at the exposure, and our focus is the United States because we think that's where the rates are going to start going first, the breadth of the product, the performance of the product and our relative client's allocations right now put us in a very good position, if there is money that is strongly moving out of that fixed income market. And we are very well-positioned to serve clients well in the many different asset classes they might choose to go into.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then last, just a housekeeping item. Just to clarify, does your guidance on comp and property impact get us to ballpark the right run rate we should be thinking about, post all the changes for the European version?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, it does. So everything is off of the second quarter, sort of that's the run rate for the third and fourth quarters.","Operator","The next question comes from Greggory Warren of MorningStar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just going back to the previous question, and this is just a big, big, big, picture question. As we're looking at fixed income here -- I mean, we've got kind of a sense of what happens when bond investors kind of freak out about rising rates last month. But when we try to categorize who's really invested in fixed income at this point, we've got some institutional clients that really piled into it after the financial crisis, looking for more stability, security, and we also have the starting of the baby boomer retirement class. As we move forward -- again, because my sense has always been that what comes out of fixed income won't be as dramatic as what went it over the last 5 years. Because some of these clients are these baby boomers who are going to have to stay invested to fixed income just for the income needs. And I'm wondering how you guys think about that and how you adjust your business to accommodate that, but also understanding that bringing in equity business really helps your fee rates.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, so we start by a couple of fundamental principles and focus on generating good outcome for clients. And we then have the point of view that clients want a broad, deep set of investment capabilities to meet their needs. That's also what we've done as a firm. Within that, though, a couple of points. Yes, personally, you can see the fixed-income exposures are, frankly, at all-time highs. So you can have a point of view that they will come down, they won't come down to more historic levels because of the baby boomers, and that common sense would tell you that. I do think they're going to come down quite a bit more from where they are right now, because I agree with your long-term view. But, when you get into a rising rate environment, people are starting to lose capital, you're going to see them move. That's just what happens. But I think what we are doing, and other firms are doing are very focused on generating income for clients. And I think that's also why you're seeing things like our premium income product, the dividend-oriented equity capabilities. And, also, this gets into why we believe so strongly in multi-asset strategies, because it's a combination of asset classes that not only can generate income for clients and they can't get the exposure to them. But, also, there is less volatility in it, so to your point of an aging population and the need for income and broadly diversified, that's what we see evolving and that's why we're so focused on it. But, again, I also -- my personal opinion, I think, pension plans and individuals have been underexposed to equities over the last number of years, and that's not a good thing for longer-term needs. But that's my personal opinion.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","No, no, it sounds good. On the flows during the quarter. I mean, they tended to be stronger. I was looking at you guys to be sort of in a small net outflow mode. So it was encouraging to see flows being positive. You said that flows through July are on par with what we saw in the second quarter, was I correct in hearing that?","Martin L. Flanagan","No, they have, through the month of July -- month-to-date, they are exceeding the flows of...","Loren M. Starr","Okay, the entire quarter, yes.","Martin L. Flanagan","The whole quarter.","Loren M. Starr","The whole quarter.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And it's broad based and its equity and fixed income?","Loren M. Starr","Correct.","Operator","The next question comes from Roger Freeman of Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just coming back to the growing share in your U.S. retail complex, particularly around the 19 versus 9 funds 1 year ago, with sales over $50 million. Is part of that coming from getting added to model portfolios on any of the distribution platforms? I know that was a focus of yours, I'm just wondering what kind of success you've had there.","Martin L. Flanagan","It would be. And I'd say, again, when we -- I just want to call it, the initial growth post combination with Van Kampen. I mean, it was 100% focused, because they had to be, because you have to go through those. And we've had great success of getting on platforms throughout -- I wouldn't say we're done. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but we're at a very strong position right now.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then one other question. Just coming back to the redemption rate from an earlier question. I mean, I hear your comments about sort of Q3 versus Q2. Just looking at that chart on Slide 9, I mean it just looks like over the last year, the redemption rate relative to the industry has gone up. And I'm just wondering, kind of looking at that slightly longer time frame, what would you say accounts for that?","Loren M. Starr","I think it's a good question. I think some of it has to do, I think, with just the post transaction of the Morgan Stanley transaction, where we had all these investment capabilities that were sort of embedded in certain channels and we were able to cross-fertilize the sale into different channels, right? Where value was really in the Morgan Stanley channel and sort of the Edward Jones channel, and we had our traditional products growth and others factored in our channels. And so, as those things sort of got crossed over, they've built up and so there was an abnormally low redemption rate for a period of time as they sort of built into their equilibrium holdings, and now we're sort of getting to more of a sort of normal run rate. That is sort of a guess as opposed to factually -- I can tell you exactly what is going on, but we knew that something like that would happen, right? That we're sort of at an unusually low rate post that transaction.","Operator","The last question comes from Marc Irizarry of Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Marty, just one question on IBRA and the fixed-income exposure. Now, it sounds like it's maybe against the category that performed relatively well versus maybe other risk parity strategies, but maybe relative to the asset allocation category. It's positioned differently. Can you give us some perspective on -- have there been any changes to the positioning in the fund and just maybe what the fixed-income exposure of IBRA is?","Martin L. Flanagan","So, let me take that in different pieces. So they've not change their approach. It continues to be exactly what they put in the market and they continue to manage that way. I don't have the fixed-income exposure here right now within the portfolio. But thirdly and finally, very importantly, if you look at that world allocation category, it is so diverse that it's not very helpful. And I think the relevant point is look at the risk parity capabilities next to one another, and we performed very, very strongly with those.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just, Loren, just a quick one for you on spending relative to regulatory requirements, if you will, on expenses. Where are you in the build-out? Where are you in the sort of build-out of compliance infrastructure or sort of regulatory required spending on systems, et cetera, how far along are you in that process?","Loren M. Starr","I think we are pretty far along. There's probably, again, based on what the regulators continue to require from us, so it could continue to shift. I mean, it's been a sort of changing landscape in terms of the regulators. I mean, the good news, if there is any, I mean, seems like some of the rate of change and the speed of sort of new regulations coming through is slowed a bit. And so that is helpful and, again, I'd like to say we're sort of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel somewhere, but you never know it if it's another train coming at you. But I think, generally, we're -- I mean, the guidance we gave is sort of down a little bit, we think we sort of hit a high point in the second quarter and we're going to be able to step down just a bit off of that, while we're not assuming a big step down at this point.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, just confirming, Lawrence. It is not just for us. I think it's for any financial services firm. But even money managers, the compliance requirements, it's been a material increase. And, as I've said in the past, it tends to focus on those markets that were hit hardest during the financial crisis. The U.S., the U.K., and Continental Europe, and it has been a material level of investments. Our point of view, that's exactly what we'll do and just making sure that we're in front of all those things, it's just critical to us in the industry. So I think you just have to anticipate it. It's going to be here for a good number of years.","Loren M. Starr","Many good examples. I just heard recently that, I think, the U.K. is planning to do their own form of FATCA.","Martin L. Flanagan","Now, there you go.","Loren M. Starr","So, I mean, that's just news to me, yesterday, that I heard about that. So, again, we can be surprised. So it's just a little hard for us to say exactly, Mark.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.","Martin L. Flanagan","Well, thank you everybody. On behalf of Loren and myself, I appreciate the participation and the interest, and we will talk to you very soon. Have a good rest of the day.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to the speaker for today, Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin L. Flanagan","Thanks very much, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me is Loren Starr, Invesco's CFO, and we'll be speaking the presentation that's available on our website, if you're so inclined to follow. Today, we'll provide a review of our business results for the third quarter. Loren will go into greater detail of the financial results, and then the 2 of us will open up to Q&A.","So let's begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the third quarter, which you'll find on Slide 3 of the presentation. Long-term investment performance remained strong across all time periods during the quarter. 81% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3- to 5-year basis. Strong investment performance, combined with a comprehensive range of strategies and solutions we offer to help clients achieve their desired investment outcomes, contributed to net long-term inflows of $6 billion during the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up 16.4% for [ph] the same quarter last year. And a continued focus on taking a disciplined approach to our business improved our operating margins to 41.8% from 40.2% in the same quarter a year ago, an increase of 1.6 percentage points.","Assets under management were $789.6 billion, down from $802.4 billion at the end of June, reflecting the late quarter volatility in the markets. At the same time, operating income rose to $382 million from $377 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.64 versus $0.65 in the prior quarter. The quarterly dividend remained at $0.25 per share, up 11% from 2013. And we've repurchased $50 million in common stocks during the quarter.","Before Loren goes through the details of the financials, let me take a moment to review the investment performance and highlights of the business around the world.","I'm now on Slide 6. Investment performance during the quarter was strong for all time periods. 81% of assets were ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year basis and 76% of assets were ahead of peers over 1 year. It's also important to note that 52% of the assets were in the top third of peers on a 3-year basis, and 65% of assets were in the top third over 5 years.","On Page 7, to put this in historical context. I mentioned that investment performance is very strong today. Currently, the percentage of assets under management rated 4 and 5 stars by Morningstar runs 70% for our U.S. retail franchise, 96% for our retail funds in the U.K. and 82% for our cross-border range. And importantly, in the U.S., 97% of all the assets are rated 3 stars or better; in the U.K., 100% of the assets are rated 3 stars or better; and the cross-border range, 94% of the assets are 3 stars or better. Our tremendous focus on achieving investment excellence across the globe has produced consistently good long-term performance. And if you look back a decade, you've seen some dramatic improvements in some of the regions around the world.","Turning to flows on Page 8. You'll see gross flows remained strong during the quarter and overall redemptions declined, leading to net long-term inflows of $6 billion. I want to point out this is also the strongest active organic growth rate we've seen since the first quarter of 2013. And these numbers reflect broad diversity of flows across our global business during the quarter, particularly among our active strategies.","Gross flows on retail and institutional channels were strong during the third quarter as we continue to deliver strong investment performance to our clients. The redemption picture improved significantly in the retail channel and, combined with strong gross flows, drove net long-term flows substantially higher. The institutional channel continued -- saw continued demand for real estate, bank loans, equities and asset allocation capabilities across the globe, which drove positive flows during the quarter. Institutional redemptions were driven partly by the successful disposition or the realizations within private equity or real estate. And the institutional pipeline of won but not funded mandate continues to looks strong and, as importantly, is concentrated in real estate asset allocation, international equities and alternative fixed income capabilities. So very broad there, also.","Let me take a moment to highlight our global businesses, which you'll find beginning on Slide 10. In the Americas, U.S. net flows were $1.3 billion during the quarter, were driven by international growth, U.S. value equities, high-yield munis, diversified dividend and UITs. The redemption rate of 20.6% in August was favorable to the industry average of 28.6%. U.S. gross flows were up 9% from the prior quarter. And we are working very diligently, as you would imagine, to build the awareness in self -- shelf space for our liquid alternative capabilities, which are gaining traction amongst advisers and platforms.","As we've mentioned on previous calls, institutional flows into IBRA have remained positive, driven by top quartile performance. And on the retail side, strong client engagement effort and the current market volatility are driving improved gross flows and a reduction in redemptions. With the strong institutional flows and improvement in the retail picture, we believe we'll see a positive -- we'll return to positive total net flows in the U.S. in the next 2 quarters.","In Asia Pacific, we saw continued strong growth in net flows during the quarter. Key drivers of the strong results include the Shinko U.S. REIT and the Australian bond fund in Japan, cross-border funds in Greater China and institutional flows into real estate, Asian equity and Invesco quantitative strategies across the region.","Investment performance across EMEA remained strong during the quarter and, in some cases, exceptional performance as we discussed earlier. Mark Barnett and his team continued to turn in strong numbers for the high income and income funds, which ranked amongst the top 10 in their peer group of 262 funds year-to-date. As a result, outflows from the U.K. income are steadily returning to normal redemption rates, with $1.9 billion of net withdrawals during the quarter.","Our GTR fund also continued to see strong flows on the back of strong investment performance, crossing the $1 billion mark early in the quarter and reaching $1.2 billion by the end of the quarter. Strong investment performance and continued focus on meeting client needs contributed to the strong EMEA long-term net flows, which were $3.3 billion for the quarter.","Assets under management by our EMEA business totaled $170 billion at end of the third quarter. And as you can see on 12 -- Slide 12, during the quarter, net flows into EMEA, excluding U.K. equity income, were $5.3 billion. Driven by strong investment performance, our wider U.K. retail business has continued to demonstrate strength with an increase in gross flows year-over-year. The business has strong momentum and continues to become more diversified with increased flows into global equities, European equities and multi-assets, to highlight a few. Our retail clients and advisers in the region remain optimistic regarding the recent market volatility. Activity of gross flows and redemptions declined for a couple of weeks, but we've seen no particular impact on the net flows.","In general, what we've seen over the past few weeks of market volatility confirms our long-term business strategy. Invesco is one of the few investment management firms in the world that offers institutions and individual investors a comprehensive range of strategies and solutions that help them achieve their desired outcomes. We provide capabilities for all markets: bull markets, bear markets and markets that go sideways. And we're well positioned to deliver for our clients competitively, regardless of which markets we see in the fourth quarter and beyond. It's also a time where a number of our investment teams look for periods of market volatility, which creates valuation anomalies and opportunities, which they exploit for the benefit of our clients. Historically, it's these periods of increased market volatility that clients seek the established capabilities of our experienced investment teams.","So with that, I'll stop here and turn it over to Loren.","Loren M. Starr","Thanks very much, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $12.8 million ( sic ) [$12.8 billion] or 1.6%, and that was driven by negative FX in market of $14.8 billion, outflows from money market and the QQQs of $4 billion. These items were partially offset by positive long-term net flows of $6 billion. Our average AUM for the quarter was $801.7 billion. That's up 1.5% versus the second quarter average.","Our net revenue yield came in at 45.6 basis points, flat versus Q2. The benefit of an extra day in Q3 and higher performance fees was unfortunately equally offset by the decline in other revenues and the weakening of sterling versus the U.S. dollar.","Now I'm going to turn to the operating results. You'll see that our net revenues increased $12.7 million or 1.4% quarter-over-quarter to $913.7 million. That included a negative FX rate impact of $9.1 million.","Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees grew by $16.5 million or 1.6% to $1.07 billion. This increase was due to higher average AUM and the additional day in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. FX decreased investment management fees by $11.5 million.","Service and distribution revenues were up by $7.4 million or 3.4%, also in line with higher average AUM and the extra day as well as the continued strength in our cross-border products sold in Europe. FX decreased service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million.","Performance fees came in at $10.3 million, an increase of $3 million from Q2. This is about $5 million more than we had expected based on the guidance we provided in Q2. Performance fees were earned from a variety of areas, including the U.K., bank loans and quant equity. Foreign exchange decreased performance fees by $0.2 million. And as I said in the past, performance fees continue to be one of the more difficult line items for us to predict with great accuracy.","Other revenues in the third quarter came in at $34.5 million, a decrease of $4.4 million, resulting from the lower level of real estate transactions fees. As you'll remember, we generated $6 million in nonrecurring transaction fees in Q2 as a result of our Japanese REIT launch.","Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $9.8 million or 2.4%. This was in line with higher revenues derived from our related retail AUM and one extra day in the quarter. FX decreased these expenses by $0.2 million.","Moving on down the slide. You'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $531.8 million grew by $7.8 million or 1.5% relative to the second quarter. FX decreased operating expenses by $4.8 million during the quarter. Employee compensation at $349.5 million increased by $4.9 million or 1.4%, and this was a result of increased headcount and variable compensation quarter-over-quarter. FX decreased compensation by $3.2 million.","Marketing expense decreased by $3.5 million or 11.3% to $27.4 million. Advertising costs came in a little lower than we expected in the quarter. FX decreased these expenses by $0.3 million.","Property, office and technology expense came in at $77.3 million in the quarter, which was up $1.2 million. This was about $3 million lighter than we had previously guided. The increase reflects the higher outsourced administration costs in EMEA. And FX decreased these expenses by $0.6 million.","G&A expenses came in at $77.6 million. That's up $5.2 million or 7.2%. This increase was due to professional service fees, driven by ongoing technology platform investments as well as an increase in indirect taxes. About $2 million of the increase should not recur in Q4. And FX decreased G&A by $0.7 million.","Going on further down the slide. You'll see that nonoperating income decreased $10.5 million compared to the second quarter. The decrease is primarily driven by low or -- excuse me, lower realized gains on seed capital investments in Q3 and the liquidation of a CLO that occurred in Q2.","The firm's effective tax rate on a pretax adjusted net income basis in Q3 was 26.6%. Looking forward, we'd expect the effective tax rate to remain between 26% to 27%, which then brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.64 and our adjusted net operating margin of 41.8%.","Now before turning things over back to Marty, I'd like to just touch on the impact of the market and FX volatility on our earnings outlook. In periods of uncertainty such as this, which we have seen before, we will try to manage our level of spend as best as we can without sacrificing strategically important investments. However, we simply can't adjust expenses down as quickly as revenues in a declining market. We expect to remain focused on prioritizing our most important initiatives, and we will diligently manage our discretionary expense in this quarter. Given that the markets have made our AUM a bit of a moving target, we don't believe it's very productive to provide explicit line item guidance in Q4, understanding, however, that we are committed to doing what we can without compromising our most important strategic opportunities.","And so with that, I'll turn things back to Marty.","Martin L. Flanagan","Thanks, Loren. So happy to open up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Loren, maybe first question. Just on the expense that you were -- you were just going over. When we think about the areas that you do have some flexibility, so whether it's on the marketing side or the G&A, just maybe just remind us -- or when you think about how much variability you do have if the environment does get -- and not talking about the fourth quarter but just meaning over the next year or so, if you get into a tougher environment, how much can you pull back versus what you would view as like longer-term view investments?","Loren M. Starr","Certainly, Michael. I mean, we have -- some of our expenses are somewhat fixed in nature, whether it's amortized, deferred compensation or related to rent. We clearly can move on some of those items over time. I think in terms of near-term ability, it's going to be around the discretionary expenses. Marketing is also a lever that we can and will look at depending on the environment that we're in, where strong levels of advertising may not make as much sense in markets that are somewhat negative. So certainly, that level of $35 million, which I think we had originally guided in Q4, may be somewhat lower if we're successful in Q4. But ultimately, we have more opportunity to affect 2015 than we do the fourth quarter because a lot of the spend is effectively committed within the quarter. So it is really to that point that we -- we'll certainly do what we can within the quarter to manage, but some of it is going to be locked in.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then Marty, just on the flow picture, I mean, when we look at kind of the industry trends right now, things are pretty muted. You guys have put up results and -- whether it's on the European side, which is across asset class things have continued to do relatively well. So where are you seeing some of that demand? And particularly, maybe into September, October because obviously, things got a little bit more rocky in the environment. But it seems like the strength continued, particularly relative to the industry. So just any insight, and that could be on the retail side or in the institutional.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. It's a good question. And what I would say, it's, really, too early to tell if it's -- definitely what's going to -- what are going to be the reactions. I think we're probably in a transitional period right now where whether it's institutional or retail investors are assessing, and I think their first move, which we all saw in the early -- let's say, their public numbers coming out, retail was -- you saw outflows. And the first move is to do nothing, right? And I think that's really what you saw a number of people do in the United States in particular. But people assess -- get some sense of looking forward and have some judgment. What -- from our point of view, what we think is ultimately is a good thing for our clients and an opportunity for the firm is that volatility is a part of markets. And having things like alternatives in your portfolio, liquid alternatives in particular, is something that is going to, I think, is going to be here for a long, long time. And we're seeing it just with IBRA right here. IBRA has been -- institutions have continued to commit to IBRA but you're seeing, really, with these volatile markets, opportunities for IBRA that GTR funds for us. So we think it's really the broadening of the asset classes that will be the opportunity as we look forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Kim, Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, maybe a bit of a more bigger-picture question. I know it's not a -- necessarily a big piece of your overall asset base, but just wondering how your bond funds here in the U.S. in particular might be positioned assuming we see some sort of dislocation in the credit markets. Just curious to get your take on liquidity concerns across the industry and how you think about your funds assuming a potential downturn.","Martin L. Flanagan","So let me start at the highest level. So if you look at the performance across our Fixed Income platform is very, very strong, and -- which is a good place to start. I -- with regard to what people do, and I think what you're suggesting is that people started to move from -- redeem from Fixed Income capabilities, what's the liquidity impact. And it is a topic everybody is focused on. From our point of view, we feel like we're positioned very, very well. I mean, it's something that we look at. I mean, obviously, our portfolio managers deal with it every day and have done that for a very long period of time. And in those products where we think that liquidity could be more challenged, there is a greater cash capability -- greater cash levels in those funds. There's also liquidity elements that they have layered on top of it. So we think we're positioned very, very well for it. So we're aware of the topic but we think we're managing very well and don't have a very large concern about it.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe if you could talk a bit more about product development these days, particularly as it relates to more solutions-oriented strategies and other products that might match up with some of the prevailing demand trends that you just mentioned earlier.","Martin L. Flanagan","So look, I think we could be better positioned right now. So if you look at the range of capabilities that we have, from the one at smart beta, we think smart beta is continuing to be an important part of portfolios that are put together, and then as you look at the active range of capabilities we have from the traditional loan only to maybe more traditional alternatives, let's say, private equity and real estate, it's really the suite of liquid alternatives that we introduced very broadly last year that put us in a very unique position. So we think the combination of our active strategies all the way through alternatives and smart beta, there's very little that we can't address in meeting clients' needs. And also, with our solutions group that -- with the larger institutions, you can have that broader range of conversations to understand what are they trying to achieve and what are the different combinations of investment capabilities that you could put together to meet those needs. So we really think we're positioned very well. In one level though, to be clear, I do think we're, frankly, ahead of the market at the retail market with the range of alternative capabilities that we've had. People are very focused on it. But quite frankly, the uptake on the distribution platforms is probably slower than we would have thought. And it's just them getting their hands around their internal -- things that they need to work through. But we think it's a very important opportunity for us and for our clients.","Operator","The next question is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, Loren, understanding that the market volatility and that you're -- it's difficult to forecast next quarter out. But just wanted to talk about the fee rate and kind of the products that are selling and where you're seeing the flows if we can still see that fee rate grind higher x currency, x market based on just kind of the gross sales, gross redemption trends you're seeing, and then that corresponding impact obviously flowing through to -- through margins.","Loren M. Starr","Yes. Thanks for asking the question, Dan. Absolutely. We've been -- sort of had a headwind with FX working against us. I think it -- if it stabilizes and we sort of enter a period where we don't have that particular impact, we should continue to see our fee rate climb from where it is today as the flows that you've seen continue to be quite strong through the cross-border product line, which, as you know, tend to have a higher fee rate. Certainly, some of these alternative products, as they take and get more traction, have a higher fee rate. So we do feel that the trend is still very much in our favor, to see fee rates climb going forward, absent any further continued strengthening of the dollar versus other currencies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. And then Marty, when you talk about asset allocation and the demand there, can you specifically talk about, is that including IBRA? Or is that just -- are those -- is that just separate products? And then can you talk about kind of where that demand is coming from, from the end clients?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, good question. So these definitional problems. So we would include IBRA in that. We'd include things like global total return capabilities. There's -- our versions of IBRA there. So it is really that suite that we have brought to market. So where we are seeing demand -- so if you start with GTR, that was probably the next introduction after IBRA, and it's really only been in the market from a year ago, September. In the U.K., it's over $1.2 billion. That's pretty good for a very short uptake. The interest that we're seeing institutionally and also, frankly, in the retail market in the U.S., GTR is really very, very strong. And the same thing on the continent. It's trailing the U.K. just because that was our initial launch. So we think that's probably going to be another natural one. But again, it's really, what you're seeing now with the advisers on the retail side is they are looking to build broader portfolios. And they're interested in having lower-volatility type elements within there. And Bill ( sic ) was asking a question earlier that it is also looked at as an alternative to some of the fixed income, from a stability point of view, within the portfolios. Institutionally, again, it just continues to be areas that some number of the institutions are looking to expand. So it's early days for us, but again, the depth of our capability and the performance out of the box has been very strong. Now it's a long-term game, but it's always nice to start with your performance.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Worthington, JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On real estate. Real estate continues to be on fire for Invesco. It is cyclical based on the way you talked about your sales and when you get transaction and performance fees. We seem to be in the strong sales portion of the investor real estate cycle. So are we getting late in that part of the cycle? And is the next step elevated performance fees, given you're a mix of kind of U.S. core and international?","Loren M. Starr","Ken, I'll try to answer that question. I think we saw, and we have seen, a lot of good transaction fees coming through the funds being able to sell their holdings at a good price. So that's been helpful even though that's been somewhat of an outflow when every time something gets old. We're seeing the pipeline, as Marty mentioned, the institutional pipeline is now really beginning to climb again. And so I think we are entering a sales cycle where that pipeline is going to begin to fill up with more won but not yet funded type of activity, which, again, don't translate into assets until those things start funding. So I think we're very much into a building-up AUM as we sort of start into a buying phase as opposed to a selling phase. So that is going to continue to progress. I think with the realizations that I mentioned, yes, absolutely. The idea that we're going to begin to be able to realize performance fees in the real estate area is something that, I think, we've talked about in the past. And then we certainly have expectations that we're going to see some of that roll through, specifically around the timing, as I mentioned. It's a little problematic for us to figure out exactly what quarter they -- are they going to occur, but we know that they are -- have done a great job in terms of performance. And so there is a lot of built up performance fees in the real estate pools.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, can you talk a little bit about the investing environment in Europe and the U.K. given kind of changes in the economic outlook for both? You had a really strong third quarter. The outlook in those regions seems to have weakened economically. What does this mean for Invesco in terms of sales and investor appetite? And are you in the right distribution channels with the right products to kind of weather any change, a persistent change in environment if the current choppy market conditions continue?","Martin L. Flanagan","So Ken, let me pick it up and start maybe on the continent. So we -- kind of Europe's been a topic. We started the conversation maybe 3 to 4 years ago of the opportunity there, and it's starting to become realized over the last 1.5 years. We still believe we're relatively early stages of success on the continent. So with all the progress we've made, there is more progress to be made. And it's really -- we're not on all the platforms that we want to be on. We are getting on more and more of them. We have good reason to believe that we'll continue to expand the breadth of platforms. As I pointed out, the performance in that cross-border range is very, very strong and it's very broad. So it's very attractive to distribution platforms. And just our ability to help our distribution partners be successful is also in place, too. So I look at it as a continuing growing opportunity for us. With regard to what might happen with investor appetite, I think, if you ask me some -- a couple of years ago when we thought that EU was -- discussions of it breaking up, I would never have thought we would have seen the client demand for investment products as we saw. So it's really been a surprise and continues to be -- they look to funds as the way to invest and save. And they feel that's a really solid and thoughtful way to look after themselves, which, frankly, we think it is, too. So -- and again, I come back to the range of capabilities, too, as demand moves, we do think we have the capabilities to give clients the alternatives. If they want to get out of European equities, they can look at things like GTR, they can look at things like IBRA. The fixed income capability is very, very strong. In fact, it's -- flows there. So we think we're really well placed. And just in the U.K., again, it's -- we're an absolute top firm there, and the performance just continues to be just very, very strong. And so we're -- we're everywhere we need to be in the U.K. and we're well positioned there. So we look at it as continued strength in the U.K. and growing opportunities on the continent.","Loren M. Starr","And maybe, Ken, I'll just pile on a little bit. I mean, that -- we saw in EMEA generally, still good, strong flows in the quarter as you can see through our roll-forwards, a lot of products contributing. The full range, actually: balanced product; equity product; Pan European equity was also strong, even though maybe others in the industry didn't see quite as much strength, we continued to see strength there; real estate; fixed income, corporate bond; euro corporate bond, all doing well. And through -- even the October, that cross-border in EMEA is in strong, good positive flows. So we think that, that is a continued opportunity for us that may slow down a little bit relative to what we've seen in the past just as people are trying to figure out what to do given the market environment. But we have such a great range of products at such high performance levels that we think we're going to be able to continue to sell through all types of -- whatever the market throws at us. So I think we're going to probably still do pretty well there.","Operator","The next question is from Bill Katz from Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First big-picture question. You seem to have a lot of momentum across products and geographies and distribution channels. It may be too pointed of a question. But I'm sort of curious, is there something structurally going on that you're starting to see the unit growth coming in terms of net flows? Is it market share gains? You mentioned, Marty, that there may be some more distribution channels. But why -- I know it's been a 5-year in the making, but specifically, what seems to be the linchpin now that's really inflecting the flows?","Martin L. Flanagan","Where in particular, Bill?","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, I think Europe and Asia in particular seem to be quite strong, looking at your data.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. No, it's -- I think you're really hitting it on the real point. There's no one thing. It really has been, yes, a number of years in the making. And it is a combination of, again, the range of capabilities are attractive, the performance is consistently strong along with the business support that we can help our institutional clients be more successful or our distribution partners on the retail side. So I wish I could tell you what the one thing is, but it's just many things. And -- but to be more specific, what does it mean? If you look at all of our institutional ratings, they are -- there are many and they're strong. If you look at the number of platforms we're on around the world, they're -- they continue to grow. Now the U.K. has always been strong, right? So the -- it's really the continent and other parts of Asia joining, really, the U.S., which we've been talking about for a number of years. And so it's really the U.S., Continental Europe and Asia just continuing to strengthen.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. The same question, just a little more technical. So still curious. In the U.K. and now Europe, there's 2 dynamics underway. Some are underway, some are still to come between sort of the shift of RDR as well as on the MiFID II, some consternation about how to sort of treat equity research. How do you think that might impact your business? Because some of your peers, the stock price have come in a fair amount. I think investors have been worried about that. And given you're a pretty big player in the U.K., just trying to sort of see what the economic impact might be to you on a go-forward basis.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So with regard to RDR, I mean, it's still early days. But I think what we had said is we were matching what RDR would be in practice. We would say, we're -- we thought we'd be well placed and we are. And it's really again, it's the recognition of the organization and just the depth of capabilities. And so we're doing just fine within the RDR world. Now is it meeting the expectations of the policymakers? That's probably a different topic. I don't believe that the costs have gone down for the end of investors. And actually good point, too, it's probably going up. So I don't think that was part of the plan. So with regard to the topic -- with regard to research, I know everybody's very focused on it. And I think, the conversations that I'm aware of and that -- the undertakings is that, there is now quite a thought of do no harm to the capital markets, right? The unintended consequences of trying to take pieces and modify them, I think, have become front of mind of the regulators. And I think where you'll probably end up is much more in greater disclosure and -- for the end investors. And again, we'll see. It's going to take some time. But I think that's probably where we'll probably end up.","Operator","The next question is from Brennan Hawken, UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On -- you gave a lot of color on EMEA and the flows, and thanks for that. That's really helpful. I was just kind of curious, if we think about the U.K. and then potential retail flows with Perpetual, is there any kind of seasonality we should think about for retail flows that might be a consideration going forward?","Loren M. Starr","I think there may be some degree of seasonality that tacks onto it. But I think that is largely a very modest impact. And probably the biggest thing that we can see, and we're seeing it every month, is this normalization that is happening around our redemption rate, and how, as things are getting back to normal and really, in the U.K., the client reaction to that transition is almost old news now. And so we're -- I think that's probably the bigger impact, is that we're turning into more of a business-as-usual situation in the U.K., which will be quite helpful for us in terms of continuing to turning those outflows into inflows.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Terrific. And then, apologies if you hit on this before, but given some of the volatilities in yields in October, have you seen any change in the IBRA flows quarter-to-date?","Loren M. Starr","We're seeing a much stronger interest in IBRA. So the redemption rate is certainly dramatically down. I think the level of interest around IBRA, both institutionally and retail, is sort of seeing new levels. So it is somewhat at an inflection point where you'd say, if you just follow this through into next couple of quarters, that it would be going quite positive. But again, just drawing a line here. But it has been very month -- every month, you're seeing significant improvement in the IBRA position, and that's not a surprise to us. As people are looking for greater stability and predictability around -- and less risk in their portfolios, it's a natural place for people to go.","Operator","The next question we have is from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So we've spent some time talking about EMEA. Wanted to talk a little bit about the U.S. part of your business. It sounds like the outlook is getting a little bit better there. I'm just kind of curious if you guys could characterize for us why that region maybe isn't flowing a little bit better than it is. I know you guys rank pretty favorably to a lot of peers, but just wondering if you could expand on what's going on in the U.S., why we're not seeing a little bit better growth.","Loren M. Starr","So I think that we're seeing strong pockets of growth. Obviously, the U.S. is a big -- it's a big thing when you look at it, particularly the way that we disclose it to you. And so it does hide the real stories within stories that exist. What we've seen in terms of the greater strength in the U.S. in North America, real estate, direct real estate. We've certainly seen continued strength in the Invesco PowerShares offerings as -- and we have quite a wide range there. We have great capabilities around alternative Fixed Income, particularly around bank loans and CLOs. And then fundamental equity, international growth in values is quite strong. I mean, so these have been somewhat offset recently in terms of numbers where we've seen some outflows in certain products that I'm sure you're familiar with around, let's say, bank loans, where people have sort of knee-jerked out of those types of products, which again, sort of masked some of the underlying strength. Other areas where we had -- and have seen some outflow would be more based on when the equity markets were moving quite strongly. Some of our core, more sort of safety-oriented equity offerings were not performing in line. But they're going to become more interesting in this type of market. So I mean, that's a little bit of context. We have such a wide range and diverse set of products that for us to be at a sort of consistent high flow in the U.S. is hard for us to achieve because they're very diverse in what they offer.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, okay. That makes sense. And wondering if you guys can give us an update, not just for the U.S. but for the entire franchise, what flows look like so far on October.","Loren M. Starr","So I say, to -- today, there, is modestly negative for us. Not anything that we'd get alarmed about, and progressively getting better. Each day that's sort of come by through recently has been a benefit to the flows. I already told you that we're seeing some of the most important, in terms of fee rate, parts still driving forward like EMEA. We have this very strong institutional pipeline that is -- I think it's up close to 70% higher than it was in the prior quarter. And on -- and some of that is going to begin to fund whether it's into the fourth quarter or into 2015. So again, we feel reasonably good about where we are in the flow picture. And I mean, we don't have the industry data yet, but I gather that we're probably doing as well, if not better.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I have a question on the liquid alt side. Maybe there's a few things in here. The -- I mean, as you roll that out, I mean, you've certainly seen in the industry pretty strong demand for retail and liquid alts products. But I think it's probably easy -- my perception is it's probably fairly easy for investors and advisers to be confused about what's the difference between these products, and some peers will probably put IBRA in their liquid alts stock -- and you have it in your balance. So what can you do or what are you doing to -- with may be in the retail world and with advisers to make sure that they understand what they are buying and how to compare. Because one of the things I think you always fear is that people buy something that they don't understand it, they ultimately get disappointed and that has negative consequences down the road.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, you're on a very important topic. And so that was really what I was trying to highlight. It's actually -- it is going slower than the -- than what you might be reading in the papers, right? So what I would say is there's an absolute clear recognition that, for the retail investor, the ability to have access to alternative capabilities, as I look at it is more broadening the asset classes that they can invest in. And also, introducing some lower-volatility type offerings to them is viewed as important and necessary. We have spent an enormous effort on education just -- before they even came to the market. Internally, then with our distribution partners sort of tied hand in glove on how they're positioned, what they're meant to do, what you should expect in different markets, how it modifies your portfolio and that you're achieving what you want to achieve. So we even have sort of an internal consulting group that spends time with the distribution channel to help the -- all the advisers be successful with it. So we think education is a really, really important part. And that's why what I've been saying, it is an important opportunity but it's not a 2-, 3-quarter opportunity. It's going to be looking back for 3 years and see where it is in total. And also, and I say rightfully, the advisers or distribution partners, they are slow in putting capabilities on platforms because they want to get it right, too. And I think that's really important. That's good for everybody. You've got to get it right for the clients first. So I'd say it's progressing in a thoughtful manner.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Great. And maybe to follow up, you've clearly had -- have good flow momentum in a variety of places across your -- across the firm. And I'm going to guess you probably don't look at things in this manner, but I guess I'll ask it anyway. If you look at the breadth of your franchise and geographically, product-wise and size and -- how -- what do you think is kind of a natural or organic growth rate for your firm? Do you think it's in the 3%, 5%? Do you think at peak it could be better than that? How -- do you have any thoughts on that?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, it's a good question. You're asking the unknowable. But yes. what I think is, if you look at the firm right now, if you look at -- again, depth of capabilities and performance, what we think we should be able to accomplish, there's really no reason that we shouldn't be over -- whatever a reasonable time frame, 3% to 5% organic growth rate. Are there periods that you can be on top of that? I believe that is the case. We have yet to see that sort of all-in, risk-on investor mindset, and that is exactly -- that is where we are best positioned. So we have had these results without having it go straight to our strong suit. So that's a period that you would expect even greater organic growth. On the other side is, if we're all talking now, how are clients reacting? How are they thinking? If people slow down and just stop for a couple of quarters, you're going to have -- you're going to be below that. And so it's -- again, so there's a market sentiment topic [ph] to it, where the market is. But over a good period of time, I think there's no reason why we shouldn't be in that 3% to 5% organic growth bucket.","Operator","The next question is from Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just a follow-up here on the U.K. equity income business. Do you believe Retail Distribution Review could have temporarily aided the U.K. equity income retail business over the last 12 months? But as more accounts convert to the new fee structure, because many brokers actually have been avoiding the transition, that U.K. retail equity income redemptions could actually pick up or remain elevated into next year?","Martin L. Flanagan","Interesting question, here. We have no evidence of that, and so I -- it would just be total speculation. I mean, I think -- what I really think is -- the fact is that the reputation of Invesco Perpetual's very, very strong. Mark Barnett and his team have had a tremendous track record on their own for a good period of time. And factually, they have performed very, very well. And so that, in combination with our advisers, to be able to have a broader range of capabilities within the franchise, I think those are the vastly dominant factors of why we've got to where we've gotten to. But interesting question. I just can't -- really, it will be speculation on my part.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Marty, and then just a quick follow-up. So we're heading to the fourth quarter here, we've had a few quarters of sort of lumpy redemptions from the equity income business in the U.K. Given kind of your visibility, are there any sort of larger losses, platform losses that maybe could occur in the fourth quarter? Or should the fourth quarter really be the first clean quarter without any significant redemptions from that business?","Loren M. Starr","Okay, Craig, I'll answer that one. I think what we're seeing from the data factually is that it's getting less and less of a topic. And we have not certainly heard of any large -- not been notified. We had no expectations of anything to happen, which is great news. For us -- that doesn't mean that it can't or it won't. And there is always a year-end to kind of -- who knows, right? People may reevaluate their portfolios. So I don't want to sort of say we have 100% certainty on any of these redemptions. Because as soon as you think you do, you'll get surprised. But I'd say, in terms of our level of confidence and feeling that we're moving into a normalized period, I say, absolutely. And we certainly have no knowledge of any large or even small platform redemptions in our future.","Operator","The next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous.","M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP","On the news this morning that you're ending the agreement with Deutsche Bank around the commodities PowerShares product. Will that meaningfully change your economics on that product?","Martin L. Flanagan","Let me pick up the first part, and then Loren can pick up the second. So no, we're not ending our arrangement with Deutsche Bank. We're modifying it. I mean, it's been a very, very good partnership. And what we're really doing is just changing some of the responsibilities that's around. Now we'll be -- take complete responsibility for the product range including portfolio management, distribution operations. They will continue to be a very important partner in the underlying indexes and the like. And we'll continue to work together for a good number of years.","Loren M. Starr","And then in terms of the financial impact, it really is not a material topic. We've not disclosed the nature of the relationship, but it is an ongoing relationship where we will continue to partner with Deutsche Bank as we sort of develop and continue to grow our product lines. But we have internalized, as Marty said, the management the -- of the product as opposed to being largely a distribution relationship that we had before.","M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay. That's helpful. And then we talked a lot about RDR and the ebbs and flows of that in Europe and U.K. Could you talk a little bit about PowerShares specifically and assets specifically, and to what extent the process of that adoption is occurring because of the regulatory changes in Europe?","Loren M. Starr","So Patrick, I'd say, the RDRs, as I think we've talked about in the past, it does somewhat open the opportunity for greater use and take-on by advisers of these type of products where, to the extent that they're going to be paid for advice directly by the end client, the use of such products become easier for them to use. And so we have said that for the U.K. and EMEA generally, it is a major focus of ours, one that we are very organized around trying to develop. And it's one that you probably -- realistically, you're not going to see true results or impacts for somewhere between 12, 18 months because it takes that long to really sort of make an impact. But we're very focused on it. We think it's a great opportunity for people who have ETF capabilities, which obviously, we do. And again, to be clear, our focus in this space is continued promotion of sort of the smart beta-alternative type of ETFs as opposed to the normal cap-weighted type of products that are very much in focus by Vanguard, BlackRock and others.","Operator","The next question comes from Greggory Warren from Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Craig Siegenthaler touched on some of the questions I had about Neil Woodford and what was going on with equity income in the U.K. But I'm just kind of curious, as we look out and we look at the -- what they've done with the pension reforms in the U.K., the removal of the requirements for the annuities, how much do you feel that there's growth there to sort of replace what you lost with Woodford's departure?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. I -- look, as we've been trying to point out, it's a very, very, very strong set of investment teams with superior investment performance. And whether it's across fixed income, broadly, GTR, European equities, Asian equities, European equities, it is probably, I'd say, some of the strongest capabilities in the United Kingdom, period. And so it's a very important part of our business, it will continue to be. And by the way, those capabilities are now being used more broadly throughout the world. European equities, Fixed Income, et cetera, they are a very important part of what's happening on the continent and also different parts of the world for some of the global capabilities and the like. So it's been a tremendous success and it's going to continue to be a tremendous success. And you're actually pointing out something important. This -- with this door opening up that -- investments beyond annuitization, that's a very good thing for us. Now again, that's not next quarter or the quarter after that, but if you look years ahead, it's really quite a good opportunity for us.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Good, good. And then something we don't really talk about all that often, Canada. Can you guys give us a feel for what the market looks like now with kind of the challenges you're facing? I've noticed that ETF growth has been pretty explosive the last couple of years. The banks have gotten a lot more aggressive about going after mutual fund assets. So just kind of curious how you guys view your position within the Canadian market right now.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So I'd start again with performance. If you look at the performance of the teams there, really very, very strong. The success in the retail channel has improved quite dramatically, and it was a combination of things. One, again, getting performance to a very strong level, which it is and has been for a good period of time. You are pointing out, yes, the banks are very dominant. It's probably the one place in the world that they're so dominant with asset management within them. We have done vastly better than where we were a few years ago. So we -- and again, as you point out, it's the addition of ETFs for us and the like make us much more competitive and put us in, frankly, a -- we think we have competitive advantages in the marketplace. And the other opportunity for us that we're early days is the institutional market in Canada is very big, very important. And the capabilities that Canadians are looking for in the plans suit us very, very well when you start to look at the range of alternatives that we have. So it has been an important part of our business and we look at it to be a growing part of our business once again.","Operator","The next question is from Marc Irizarry from Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Marty, I'm curious on just the IBRA. And maybe just largely fixed income and just concerns about market structure changes on liquidity and maybe how your funds are responding to that, either in terms of disclosure or maybe just some views on what -- how you're thinking about more stress scenarios, maybe where liquidity conditions could change and given investors' responses to rates and what that might mean for a fixed income manager for you guys.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So again, I might be repeating myself a little bit. But if you look at the capabilities and what we do on a daily basis, we're always looking at liquidity. Liquidity management has always been an important part of what we do. The portfolios are stress tested on a very regular basis to get some sense of what is the range of possibilities under different scenarios. The portfolios are then positioned accordingly, if that is a concerns -- some portfolios literally have liquidity -- access to liquidity outside the portfolio. So again, it's something that we think we're absolutely on top of that we're doing very, very well. And by the way, I think the industry does it very, very well. And I think that's something for everybody to really understand. It's worth probing and pushing. But I really think that the industry's really focused on it, and they're really trying to do a very good job with it.","Operator","Your next question is from Eric Berg from RBC.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Marty, my question is going to be purposefully a general one. You've talked a lot in this call at various points about how the conversation between investors and their advisers here, meaning in the United States, has changed, given the extremely low level of interest rates, given the volatility in interest rates and given the major swings intraday in the stock market. It would be helpful to me if you were to sort of focus on the most important ways in which the conversations both here -- well, here have changed. I'd love to know what you would think are the most important ways the conversations have changed, and if you would provide the same answers for Europe. Contrasting how the conversations have changed there to here, I would -- it would be very helpful.","Martin L. Flanagan","I think it's a good news development. I think for some of us that were around the TMT period where, if you remember, advice was dead, everything was going online, and there's no room for advisers. Needless to say, that didn't happen, and it's exactly gone the exact opposite way. There's something like 85% almost 90% of all individuals have some form of advice given to them. And I think it's also gotten much more sophisticated over the years and very focused on understanding clients' time horizons, risk tolerance, et cetera, et cetera. Things that we all collectively know quite well. And that they're building robust portfolios around that and using a range of capabilities if it was historically 60-40 equity, fixed income, loan only. The addition of being able to have greater access to a broader range of asset classes and also capabilities that are lower-volatility type capabilities and -- is really, I think, a very, very, very good development. I think it's gotten to, what you're pointing out, I think post-crisis, it's a little bit back to the future. Different names are being used. But people are looking for income. They are looking for capital preservation, et cetera. And I think that, again, is a very good thing, at end of the day, for shareholders. Europe, I would say, is behind that, but it is evolving quite a bit to that. To a degree I'd say, the advice channel in the States is probably as well-developed as anywhere in the world.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Shutler from William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So on the topic of bank loans, just quickly, I wanted to ask a couple of questions. So first, I was just hoping you could give us the kind of the total assets that you have in bank loans, the rough split of retail versus institutional, and then how the flows have trended recently. And then in addition, the -- just interested in the credit rating. From a credit ratings perspective, just -- if you take the portfolio as a whole, how aggressive has your team been in kind of investing down -- further down the credit rating spectrum?","Loren M. Starr","Chris, so we have about $30 billion, I think, in aggregate around the bank loan capability, both institutionally and retail. The retail bit is the smaller part of that, so I think we're probably somewhere around $7 billion in AUM on that and the rest is institutional. And the current flow picture is -- it's an interesting one. We're seeing continued interest in bank loans on the institutional side, very much so. The retail side, we saw modest outflows. I think it was about $0.5 billion in the quarter related to -- maybe a little bit more, $600 million, related in the retail side. So that's kind of the trends that we've seen, nothing alarming, nothing that is necessarily unexpected. And in terms of how the portfolios are being managed, I know they're being managed with a fair amount of conservatism because of the topics that Marty and everyone has obviously raised around liquidity and managing through stress periods. And so the idea that we are selecting securities that were -- that are most liquid, that are easy alternatives to straight bank loans or using affiliated types of products in those portfolios is very much top of mind. So again, I'd say, our level of sort of management around the conservative side is at a heightened level, as you would expect.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then a similar question just on real estate. Could you just give us a quick update where you are there in terms of AUM and how flows have trended over the last couple of quarters?","Loren M. Starr","So AUM is roughly $62 billion. We've been trending higher consistently in every quarter, both again split between retail and institutional. We're seeing a lot of interest and demand on the retail side, particularly around the geographies that are most interested in income-oriented types of products, and that would be in Asia and Japan as well. Direct real estate is a global phenomenon that we're seeing in terms of interest and take-on. That really, as I said, sort of continues to pick up, as our capability is one of the few truly global capabilities among asset managers and also one that has done a very good job for its clients historically.","Operator","And sir, I'm showing no further questions.","Martin L. Flanagan","That's great. Thank you very much. And Loren -- on behalf of Loren and myself, thank you very much for participating and the questions, and look forward to talking to you next quarter.

And as the case many of them had to work remotely because they couldn't get into the office, and they did work very diligently during the storm for the benefit of our clients, we appreciate that very much. And I'm sure that this appreciation is the same for all of you within your organizations, and I know it's been a difficult time.","So on the call today with me is Loren, as was just mentioned, our CFO. And as is our practice, first of all, the presentation's on the website, if you're so inclined to follow it. I will review the business results for the quarter, Loren will go into greater detail of the financials. And as always the case, Loren and I will answer any questions that people might have.","So I thought it might be helpful before getting into the numbers is to really provide a sense [ph] of the macro environment that we're operating in and that we were operating in within the quarter. And although the markets during the quarter were generally positive, lately, we've seen signs that investor confidence is under pressure again. And it's a variety of factors that are contributing to this. It's the deterioration in the economic environment in Europe, some continued softening in China, although it continues to be a very rapidly growing part of the world. But here, in the United States, uncertainty over the fiscal cliff, negative news that's coming in from abroad is really keeping investors on the sidelines. And again, this week, the weather in the Northeast did not help any of that investor confidence.","In this uncertain market environment, what we've seen is advisors and consultants are focusing on managing risk as a major topic. We recently completed a survey with advisors in the United States, and 65 of them responded saying that managing risk and wealth preservation were the predominant philosophies for managing client assets. So again, people are in a very cautious position still. And as you would expect, the emphasis on risk management for preservation of wealth is driving them into yield-oriented capabilities and multi-asset capabilities, many of which are continuing to see positive flows across the industry. Invesco is well-positioned ahead of this trend, and it's really the broad suite of income capabilities and multi-asset capabilities that we have for our clients that is responding well to these needs.","So moving on, let's take a look at the third quarter and some overview comments. Long-term investment performance was strong again across all time periods for the third quarter. And delivering strong investment performance to our clients contributed very solid operating results. And as we mentioned during the last quarter, we saw early signs of a turnaround in flows in July. And building on that early momentum, net flows grew to $11.7 billion for the quarter. And this was amongst the strongest net flows in the history of the company and most robust net flows since -- we've experienced since the second quarter of 2010. Invesco's quarterly dividend is now $17.25 per share, representing a 41% increase over last year's dividend and reflecting continued confidence in the fundamentals of our business. Return on capital to shareholders during the quarter totaled $118 million.","And during the third quarter, we did take advantage of a number of opportunities in the marketplace to further invest for the future of our business. And let me hit on a couple of those. And as many of you know, we currently have a presence in India through the enterprise support location in Hyderabad and also with WL Ross & Co. having a location there also. We plan to build on that presence, and it was really by acquiring a 49% stake in Religare Asset Management and creating a partnership in India for us. This move will enhance our presence in an important and growing market and will expand again our comprehensive range of investment capabilities with these investment capabilities that Religare Asset Management bring to us.","During the third quarter, we continue to build out our market-leading multi-asset capabilities with the addition of a multi-asset team in the United Kingdom. In the next year, we look to introduce capabilities into the marketplace that again will very much extend and complement the multi-asset capabilities that we have across the organization globally. We continue to invest in the brand in the United States. And where our awareness and brand equity score is now among financial intermediaries has risen to 10. And just 2 years ago, we didn't even show up in the results. And as we said, we do think it is very important for us to generate a level of awareness and brand equity in that marketplace. So good progress is being made there.","If we move on and take a look at the summary results, let me start there. And it's really driven by very strong net flows of $11.7 billion during the quarter. Assets under management rose to $683 billion during the quarter, up significantly from $646 billion at the end of the prior quarter. Operating income was $250 million versus $249 million in the second quarter and the operating margin was 34.1%. Earnings per share were $0.42 per share versus $0.41 in the prior quarter.","So a very key metric -- key metrics around investment performance and distribution were among the strongest they've ever been for the organization. And as a result, employee compensation rose in the third quarter, driven by strong, sustained investment performance and near-record flows. And as we said for some time, a major focus for the firm is to reinvest in the business and build on our strengths and to further enhance our competitive position, which we think we've done during this quarter. We also took advantage during this quarter of opportunities in the market, continue to invest in our investment capabilities, our brand, global platform and in our people in ways that we think again strengthen our business for the long term.","Before I turn it over to Loren, let's take a look at investment performance. And as you know, we have an absolute commitment to investment excellence. And our efforts to build and maintain a strong investment culture has helped achieve solid investment performance in spite of a very volatile markets once again.","And as you can see on Slide 7, 63% of the assets were ahead of peers on a 1-year basis, 67% of assets were ahead of peers on a 3-year basis and 78% of assets were ahead of peers on a 5-year basis, again, very, very strong. And again, we'd like to call out during this past quarter, 79% of our U.S. retail assets under management are currently rated 4 and 5 star by Morningstar. And that is an all-time high for the firm. So again, a good investment results.","Taking a look at flows during the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, net long term flows totaled a near-record $9.4 billion during the quarter. We experienced solid growth in our active assets under management, with strong, broad flows across ABRA, high-yield munis, alternative fixed income and others. If you take a look at the passive flows during the quarter, they again were very, very strong for Invesco PowerShares, excluding the Q2 Qs. Flows were strong and product across low-volatility bank loans and other income-oriented ETFs, again very consistent with what we're seeing from a macro point of view in the marketplace also.","But as an example of that, of these flows in traditional Invesco PowerShares, ETFs were $2.1 billion. And that represents an annual growth rate of 39%. So again, very, very strong results for Invesco PowerShares.","Taking a look on Page 9 at flows again. And as you recall, during the prior quarter, we mentioned the very robust institutional pipeline. During the third quarter, we saw good momentum in institutional flows, which totaled $2.9 billion. And as a result, a good portion of the pipeline rolled off during the quarter, as some sizable commitments funded. But in spite of these roll-offs, we continue to see solid momentum in our institutional business recently that is rebuilding the pipeline to near-record levels.","And if you take a look at how we've done on Page 10, taking a look at flows, we're very strong again during the third quarter for the U.S. retail business. Net flows, excluding the PowerShares' Q2 Qs, were nearly $6 billion, up significantly from the prior quarter. Gross sales were up 17%. Flows into the complex were strong across ABRA, munis, International Growth and again, a number of other capabilities, so very broad and deep improvements there. Redemption rates continue to be very, very favorable relative to the industry. We have a redemption rate of 20% versus 28% for the industry as a whole. So again, very good news.","Taking a look on Page 11. Globally, the multi-asset suite of capabilities is generating tremendous interest from clients. We're attracted to the capability with the strong long-term performance it aims to provide, a high level of protection in these very volatile markets. The Balanced-Risk Allocation mutual fund in the United States did hit its 3-year track record and a 5-star Morningstar rating on a total return low-wave basis earlier this year. And we are seeing a growing number of clients add to this capability and putting it on their platform.  As a result of this very strong performance of this capability, the multi-asset product suite flows have moved up quite nicely. Assets under management increased to $20 billion and flows in the third quarter were more than $4 billion, up substantially from the second quarter.","So in spite of the mixed signals we saw in the market and the global economy during October, we do remain cautiously optimistic about the quarter ahead. We have a very robust culture that enables investment talent and delivers strong, long-term investment performance to our clients. Our market-leading asset allocation capability is enormously popular and provides a powerful catalyst for future growth. And we offer comprehensive depth and breadth of investment capabilities that enables us to provide solutions to meet the clients' needs in a variety of market environments, as we are proving.","And as you might imagine, in this environment, we're seeing strong demand for income products. And Invesco is very well-positioned to meet these needs for clients seeking income with strong performance in these capabilities. As a result, sales of income products -- of our income products in the U.S. are up 76% year-to-date. So again, I think it positions us very well for the market that we are in.","So with that, let me turn it over to Loren. And afterwards, we'll come back to Q&A.","Loren M. Starr","Thanks very much, Marty. Moving to the slide on the asset roll-forward. You'll see that AUM increased $36.4 billion quarter-over-quarter. That was 5.6% growth. It's a combination of the following elements: market and foreign exchange, that contributed $26.4 billion of the increase; the long-term net inflows of $9.4 billion; we have net inflows -- the Money Market products of $2.3 billion. And these increases in AUM were slightly offset by dispositions of $1.7 billion, as we sold off some of our European CLO management contracts in the quarter.","Average AUM for Q3 was up 2.6% to 66 -- $667 billion. And our net revenue yield in Q3 came in at 44 basis points. This was an increase of 0.3 basis points quarter-over-quarter. And the increase was due to a combination of the following factors. The first is product mix and an extra day, as well as the expiration of fund mergers related to fee waivers. And that added 1.1 basis points in aggregate. We also saw this offset, however, by lower performance fees in the quarter. That reduced our net revenue yield by 0.7 basis points. And also, we saw lower other revenues, which had a negative impact of 0.1 basis points. I think the good news, however, is that our net revenue yield before performance fees was up substantially quarter-over-quarter, and that obviously sets us up nicely for Q4.","Moving to the next page. You'll see that net revenues increased $22.6 million or 3.2% quarter-over-quarter. That included a positive FX rate impact of $3.2 million. Looking at this a little bit more closely, you'll see that investment management fees increased $37.8 million or 4.7% to $839.9 million. This increase was in line with our higher average AUM but also in line with an expansion of revenue yield.","FX increased our investment management fees by $4.3 million. Service and distribution revenues were up by $9 million or 4.8%, also in line with the increase in investor management fees. And FX increased service and distribution revenues by $0.4 million. Performance fees came in the quarter at $3.4 million, represented a decrease of $12.1 million versus Q2. And other revenues in the third quarter came in at $24.4 million, that's down $1.6 million off of Q2. The decrease was the result of continued level of lower transaction fees from our real estate business. And again, obviously, this was a little bit slower rate of transaction fee realization than we had previously hoped or anticipated.","Our third-party distribution service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues increased by $10.5 million or 3.3%. And FX increased these expenses by $1.7 million.","So continuing down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $484.3 million increased by $21.2 million. That's 4.6% up relative to the second quarter. And foreign exchange had an impact of an increase of $1.8 million on that line.","Moving into the detail. You'll see that employee compensation probably was the biggest mover. That was at $327.7 million, also increased by $21.2 million, and that was up 6.9%. The growth in compensation, as I mentioned, required a little [ph] explaining that just given its magnitude. The increase in the third quarter reflected an $8 million catch-up accrual for the first half of 2012, driven as Marty said, by the sustained long-term -- strong long-term investment performance that our teams are delivering. As you know, there's also a certain amount of variability and performance in AUM in the first half. But given where we are in the year today, we're able to forecast our full year results with more confidence. And hence, that's why we took the adjustment now.","The impact of the first half catch-up was roughly $0.015 per share and approximately 100 basis points of operating margin. There was also a step-up in the run rate of variable compensation in Q3 that reflected about $4 million of the increase. In addition, given the significant increase in sales and net flows in the quarter, our commissions were up substantially, approximately $4 million versus Q2. We also saw some other expenses, including medical insurance and relocation costs in the quarter that accounted about $3 million of the increase versus Q2. And then finally, foreign exchange increased compensation expenses by $1.5 million.","Moving off of compensation down to marketing. You'll see that, that expense increased slightly $0.3 million or up 1.1% to $26.5 million. FX increased these expenses by $0.1 million. Property, office and technology expense came in at $69.3 million in the third quarter. That was an increase of $1.5 million. The third quarter increase included effects of technology expenses associated with continued investment in portfolio trading and risk management systems across the firm. FX also increased these expenses by $0.2 million. G&A expenses came in down $60.8 million. That was down $1.2 million or almost 2%.","So continuing on down the page. You'll see that our nonoperating income increased $8.2 million compared to the second quarter, and that increase was due to the realized gains of certain of our CLO products in the quarter. The firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q3 came in at 25.8%. The rate was slightly higher than the previous guidance, and that was a result of one-off adjustments to our tax reserves. Going forward, we expect the effective tax rate to be back down between 24.5% to 25.5%, which brings us to the adjusted EPS of $0.42 and our operating margin of 34.1%.","So I'm going to turn it back to Marty now.","Martin L. Flanagan","So why don't we open up to any questions people might have?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question does come from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to start with the sales question. You had particularly strong sales into Fixed Income. Maybe you can talk about why Fixed Income is flowing so well? And if you could mention Perpetual, those products seemed to be performing particularly well. How are Perpetual sales, in particular, for the quarter -- Perpetual, Fixed Income sales for the quarter?","Loren M. Starr","So Ken, I think the fact that our Fixed Income is doing well is probably consistent with what you're seeing in the industry. It's nothing, I'd say, that's so unique to Invesco. I think we are very well-positioned, particularly around some of the alternative fixed income offerings that we have, whether it's mortgage products or our bank loan capability. Stable value continues to do very well. The high-yield products and high-yield muni products, doing very well. So we are benefiting from the interest in those types of products. And we have very good performance in those type of products as well. And that's a trend that we see continuing into Q4. And then in terms of Invesco Perpetual product, we are seeing really good strength in sales in some of the Fixed Income products, particularly as they're selling not just within the U.K. but also across Continental Europe. And then the traditional Equity Income products, again a sort of mainstay in terms of what people are looking for in the U.K., are doing very well. And the performance is extremely strong, as you mentioned. So I think from a competitive position, we are feeling good about where we are in the U.K. in particular. We're also looking at, as Marty mentioned, some of the multi-asset capabilities. And so we think there's an opportunity to continue to expand offerings within the Invesco Perpetual sort of footprint. And so that's work in progress, still too early to say how that's going to go, but that's pretty exciting.","Martin L. Flanagan","And I think I'd add to it. If you look at some of these macro factors as people are -- as I said, it's a cautious environment still. But if they move more towards credit-type products, we do very, very well and same thing with Equity Income-oriented capabilities. Again, we do very, very well with that. And if you just use the U.S. as a barometer and look at where a lot of the Fixed Income flows go in the United States, it was in intermediate bond category. We're still -- that's not playing to our strength, right? And so these results, I'd say, are really, really strong when you consider that the world is just starting to move to really where our strengths are.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then management fees rose a bunch this quarter, both on the active side and the passive side. I know there's like a million things that influence it. But as we look forward, based on what you know, what is the outlook on both the active and passive side? And obviously, you don't know what the markets are going to do or how the mix is going to affect it, but there's a lot of other things that you do have insight into. So what's the kind of near- to intermediate-term outlook, if you can share that?","Martin L. Flanagan","So again, I think if you agree with the macro observation that people, if they do start to move more towards this broad category of income capabilities, and to me, that's Equity Income capabilities but also you have more credit-type capabilities, we'll do very well in that. And our effective fee rates are higher in those products. You move into -- if there's a continued appetite for multi-asset strategies, which we think is not a short-term trend but a long-term movement in the market, we do very, very well in that area. And again, the effective fee rate is higher there. And even within PowerShares, where you've seen the movements, where people were first starting to get exposure to the equity markets, really using the QQQ capability, which is a very good capability. As you know, it is -- for us, it's really an expense reimbursement-type situation, where we had tremendous growth. And our traditional PowerShares capabilities, I said up 39% with again much greater effective fee rate. So if we agree with the macro theme, we should do reasonably well in the quarters ahead.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then just a little one, Loren, on the tax rate. Usually 3Q is the best quarter of the year for the tax rate being low. It actually perked up a little bit. I think if my calculation is correct, it was the highest we've seen this year. What influenced the tax rate this quarter? And again, what is the outlook going forward?","Loren M. Starr","So the historic sort of benefit we've seen in the third quarter were really sort of statute of limitations on certain sort of tax reserves. And those got released, and so that kind of wound down, and there wasn't anything else left. So it wasn't sort of something seasonally happening, it was really specific to kind of certain tax positions that we've had. This, in particular, went the other way. So this was a sort of an increase in a reserve that we took related to Canada. There's nothing specifically to point out, but it was a one-off reserve adjustment. So we'd say it's easy to -- I mean, it's always hard to predict where the tax rate ultimately comes out. But right now, we believe the guidance we just gave at 24.5% to 25.5% is good for Q4 and going forward.","Martin L. Flanagan","And Ken, as I think about your question some more, I think it's also very important for everybody to understand. So this is a more short-term, intermediate movement towards income. We think that's going to be here for a long, long time. But also importantly, if you believe the world is getting stronger, we are -- again, our asset strength are equity capabilities. And if you look at the performance of our international capabilities and emerging markets capabilities and our domestic equity capabilities, they're very, very strong. And that again should bode very, very well for the organization.","Operator","Our next question does come from Michael Kim of Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, Marty, just to follow up on some of your comments on risk management. I guess, one of the reasons behind the strong demand for the ABRA products has been sort of that phase increasingly looking to outsource asset allocation services. So just wondering if the markets remain constructive and maybe retail risk appetite start to rebuild a bit, could you see somewhat of a reversal in that trend, as advisors maybe get more comfortable sort of picking their own strategies again?","Martin L. Flanagan","I find that not likely. But I think what is more likely, I do believe these multi-asset strategies are here for the long haul. And I'd say we're still very early on what ultimately where they will go. That said, you could see the flows being less dramatic than what you've seen and movement much more into, again as I was just mentioning, international capabilities, domestic equity capabilities. And again, I think that's fine. I think that's -- if it's good for the clients, that's good news. And by the way, we happen to match up very, very well against that.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then you mentioned earlier, kind of the institutional pipeline rebuilding. Can you just give us some color in terms of where you're seeing the demand? Is it still kind of mostly centered in bank loan and stable value and maybe real estate? Or have you seen any signs that U.S. or non-U.S. investors are maybe getting a bit more willing to take on some more risk?","Martin L. Flanagan","So what we're seeing sort of globally, it's still largely alternatives, some multi-asset strategies, fixed income, it's broad categories, and as you say, some of the natural [indiscernible]. There are real estate bank loans, and it's more preservation of capital income type. That said, we are starting to see, and it depends on where in the world, global equities within EMEA is actually getting quite a bit of attention, I think, which is a good thing. But there is still an income appetite of really around the world.","Loren M. Starr","Yes. I would just say, I mean, we won $1 billion mandate in Germany. It's a Quant mandate. It's really very interesting to see that happen since Quant had been largely ruled out as a category for a long time. And so clearly, that's an equity exposure. Japanese equity is still of interest. We're seeing wins there. And then maybe not institutional, but Canada, by the way, just won a $330 million mandate, which is across equity products, which would include Canadian equities, small Canadian stocks, global endeavors as a broader equity mandate, and then International Growth. So I don't think equity is sort of a dead category. It's still not where it should be and where it can be. But it's certainly still making headway. And again, generally around the institutional pipeline, it's been strengthening -- strengthened relative to the second quarter, I think about more than 20%. And then versus a year ago, I think it's up substantially, I think closer to -- just to get the number. I think it's 30% off of last year. So good growth in the pipeline.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it. And then just one final one to follow up with Loren. How does the step-up in the bonus accruals this quarter potentially impact maybe performance fees looking into the fourth quarter and into next year? And then also, just any guidance in terms of how we should be thinking about the other revenue line going forward as well?","Loren M. Starr","Okay. Well, I mean, the bonus accrual was really reflective of where we are today in terms of this performance for the full year and where we think we're going to end up. But it doesn't include any magic assumptions of the performance fees coming in, I mean, so it's just a pretty conservative view. When we forecast forward, it's really reflective more of where we are from an average asset perspective. Generally, in terms of performance fees though, we do see in the fourth quarter and we have seen in the past, good performance fees related to our high net worth business, where I think people are all familiar with, that they have an MLP product, which as a category, is doing very well. And our MLP product is doing even better than the category. So that could be of a similar magnitude that you've seen in prior years. And then I think the transaction and other revenues, that's one harder to predict. We thought it would step up this quarter. It's obviously did not. We do see a higher level of transactions in the pipeline for Q4, which should mean maybe there's some pickup off of that line item. But again, I think it's real hard because of the timing of these things are very difficult to predict. And so again, I think the run rate of transaction fees and other revenues is probably safe -- it would be safer to sort of take where we are today and assume maybe there's a small pickup, a couple of million off of that benefit into Q4. But that's about as much as I sort of offer up.","Operator","Our next question does come from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, Loren, just to clarify on the comp. Is the $8 million accrual step-up, is that the starting point we should think about 4Q? Or is it -- should that be backed out to kind of as a run rate?","Loren M. Starr","So take our current comp. Obviously, there's $4 million of sales commissions as well, so hopefully we continue to perform so that might continue, that would be good. I think the $8 million, you should back out. That was definitely a catch-up for the first half and should not be seen as a recurring cost going into Q4. So take the number and subtract out the $8 million, and then you can sort of figure how that might increment up or down based on performance fees coming in or average assets up off of where we were off of Q3. And again -- but the normal sort of operating margin, operating leverage would be existing at that point. So you'd begin to see margin increasing into Q4 if we stay where we are today in terms of asset size.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, just a clarification as to why we didn't see that in 2Q, just in terms of the timing issue, the way you think about comp.","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I think it's just because of the volatility of performance. I mean, as you know, we have risk-on, risk-off. And that actually has an impact on some of our teams in terms of other position from a performance perspective. And obviously, assets were rather volatile through the second quarter. So again, it's hard to really figure out when to make the move. And then we saw such a large pickup in assets into Q3. We felt it was obviously pretty evident to make it in Q3. So again, it's part of the difficulty of forecasting to know when to ease that in.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And I guess, just thinking about the environment we're in and your guys' focus on margins, in an environment where your sales are strong, is it hard to think about margin expansion, given the kind of the payouts and the way that just works with regards to the compensation?","Loren M. Starr","I don't think sales -- obviously, the big factor was the catch-up in the quarter. If you back that out, you'd be back at 35.1% margin. So you'd be back in the 35%, and then you'd see step-off into Q4 with higher margins. So again, I think the sales was an element, but it's not one that should depress margins normally. It's just that was one element within the picture but not the biggest one.","Operator","Our next question does come from Bill Katz of Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just sort of come back to that margin discussion for a second. If I did my math right and I haven't adjusted for anything other than the $8 million catch-up, it looked like you had a 60% incremental margin. It seems pretty robust in the construct of spending on brand equity, as well as the variable [ph] computation rate of sales. Is that the right way to be thinking about the incremental margin on a go-forward basis? Or are there any other operating efficiencies probably to be kind of anticipated?","Loren M. Starr","So yes, I mean, we talked about incremental margins, which again we don't manage quarter-to-quarter. It's more of a sort of a result as opposed to something we manage to. And again -- but generally, the concept is you'll see a lower incremental margin. If the market is not helping us, you'll see a higher incremental margin. If the market is helping us, because it's increasing assets without having to do a lot of marketing and sales activity and new product development. So it really will depend on what sort of market we're going into going forward. I think the range of 50% to 60% is still probably a decent one for people to think about. And we are still investing in the business and we have intentions to continue to invest in the business. But again, we're hoping to be able to offset some of those expenses by those efficiencies that you suggested we're doing. And it's a continuing theme for us to look for those across the firm and position our operations in the best location that gives us the best unit cost, so to speak, of production. And that's an ongoing dialogue. We have been talking about outsourcing our transfer agency in Europe and U.K. and that's going along. That project is actually probably going to spill into Q1 of next year, as opposed to ending this year just because of the magnitude of it. But that has some nice run rate savings that we'd expect, $10 million to $15 million in that range coming off of that. So all those things are factoring into our thinking to try to develop and deliver margins that will expand even if the markets are flat.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then Marty, a quick question. If you're still curious, perhaps a couple things, sort of why you're gaining some share in the United States. But just the conversation on the multi-asset being here for a bit of time, can you tell me where that's coming from in terms of what's shifting within the retail distribution? Is it just a shift from product sales? Is it a specific asset class? Is it share gains? I mean, what's your sense of what's driving that unit growth?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. It's really very broad, Bill. I mean, we're seeing it from retail to institutional and really around the world. And I think really what it's doing is -- and again, it's going to be different in different parts of the world why they're doing it. But much of it is bringing that capability across different asset classes, which is not necessarily inherent, I'd say. I would say it's also the repositioning of really the advisors in the channel, where they are much more taking on a broader role and a very constructive role of broader advice and asset allocation, and these really work within it. And as we've been doing some of the capability extensions and to income elements around it, and there's elements of commodities capabilities within it, so you're really getting some asset class exposure and some constructions that meet the investment needs of the different clients. So it seems it's going to be here for quite a while.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just last one, I'm just curious, any update on how [ph] Money Market performed [ph]? I guess, there's been some movement to more of a select redemption gate at the board level, just sort of curious. And any thoughts of what you're hearing in the regulatory discussions?","Martin L. Flanagan","Really not so much at this time. I mean, I think, yes, there are -- there continues to be ongoing conversations within the industry, as it had been for the last 4 years. And again, I think it's a very constructive set of dialogues. And we'll just have to see what the ultimate outcomes are. But again, I feel that the money fund vehicle is a very good one and is going to remain one. But it will continue to play out, I think, over the next months, quarters and well into next year.","Operator","Our next question does come from Matt Kelly of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I just wanted to come back to the margins, sorry for beating a dead horse here. But just looking at your operating margin versus the overall industry, arguably, you're at as strong of a point you have been in the recent past for flows and performance. Do you think your margin relative to peers could substantially grind higher? Like, if we're thinking about 35% now, is 40% out of the realm of possibility? How do you kind of think about yourself versus the industry-wide margin?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, so Matt, we definitely would not view 35% as sort of the margin that we aspire to or where we're forced to be at. We would absolutely expect to see operating margin -- our operating margins increase over time as our assets grow and as our net revenue yield hopefully begins to continue to increase and trend forward. So it's been -- if you go back and you try to figure out what happened to Invesco, why margins are where they are, I mean, we did have seen our net revenue yield decline substantially over the last several years. And despite that, we've kept the assets growing, and so margins have probably stayed roughly flattish. And so that has been the real situation. For us to be able to see our net revenue yield increase over time will require, obviously, the continuation of some of these new products with higher fees that are in very significant demand. And we are seeing that now, which is a very positive trend for us. And we also believe that if you do continue to see equity markets sort of stabilize and maybe improve from here, we'll begin to see the net revenue yield increase. I mean, 1 basis point obviously is a huge topic, right. I mean, it's $65 million in a year. If we can sort of continue to see that trend on top of good organic growth, margins will expand and we'll see them into the 40% and above.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, I agree with that. And I would also add to it, if you do look during this period that Loren talked about, So I am going back to '05, and look at operating expenses as a percentage of average assets under management, and I don't have the numbers in front of me, you'd think I have them indelibly in my brain, they have dropped quite dramatically during that period, I mean, substantially. And as Bill was asking earlier and others, we continue to be very focused on always be more efficient, more effective all the time, and we do that. But we are not going to have that magnitude level of efficiency gains that we created over the past 5, 6 years. But again, if the same time you just do the math and do -- watch the effective fee rate during that period, it dropped dramatically. And if we had not been as strong as operators as we were, it really been a really bad outcome. But to Loren's point, we think there's no reason that we shouldn't start to see the effective fee rate increase based on the capabilities we have and where we think investors are starting to move, make their asset allocation decisions and where we think they're going to go going forward. And you get any wind at your back, and it could be quite a good story for the margin.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then I wanted to ask you guys about the team you hired from Standard Life GARS in the U.K., I've seen the press releases about how much they were managing over there. What are your plans for folding them into your multi-asset platform? Is it going to be more of a new fund? Or are they going to kind of dovetail off the balance risk platform? Or how do you think about that?","Martin L. Flanagan","I don't know if I got the question in total, Matt, but I think it's what are the plans ultimately. So they obviously have a tremendous reputation, and it's going to be some time before we're in the market with the capability in United Kingdom. It will be into next year just for all sorts of various reasons. Initially, the focus is going to be a suite of -- around the existing Invesco Perpetual capabilities, which again are very highly regarded as -- just your background in the United Kingdom. And we think that's a very, very strong complement to the existing multi-asset capabilities that we have. And that's how we're looking at this really around the world, what can be global and how do we meet some of the local needs. And we think this is going to be a very powerful one in the United Kingdom. And from there, we'll just see where it goes. Again, they have a great reputation. We think it's extremely complementary and a part of -- to what we have. And again, it's part of the overall plan that we're trying to accomplish.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick last one for me. Just on the PowerShares platform, be curious to get your thoughts for future expansion there. Do you think you're pretty well set up with your current product lineup? Or any products you think you would be interested in adding or potentially subtracting from your existing platform? And how much associated operating leverage do you think you can get from that platform as well?","Martin L. Flanagan","Well, if you look at the lineup over the last couple of years, I think the team's done a very good job in sharpening it and both from strategically introducing capabilities and quite frankly, winding down some that we didn't think were -- made sense anymore. So that's from a U.S. perspective. And they'll continue to be natural product development over time, but it probably will not be as robust as the activity you saw over the past few years in the United States. What you've seen is an extension into different markets, into Canada, that's been very successful. We have some recently good plans into Greater China area, in particular. We think we're positioned very, very well there. And Europe continues to be an area that we're looking at. It's an area that's gone through -- we've been there for some period of time. We've not made the inroads that we would have hoped. But again, it's a very, very tremendously changing environment as you would know in that part of the world. But we think we're still early days on where we're going to go with our ETF capabilities globally.","Operator","Roger Freeman of Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, first on the ABRA [ph] products. I think they were -- you said they were 43% of long-term flow this quarter, 25% last quarter. I think you just hit the 3-year performance benchmarks right before your earnings call in July. Just wondering if this is a run rate reflective of that or still in the ramp process. Probably still is, right?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, it's always fun to see exponential growth extrapolated. We definitely view there -- I mean, there's definitely continued demand for the product. And we -- it's hard to sort of say whether it sort of stays at the same pace. I mean, sometimes we saw it sort of takes a breather and then it comes back. And so there's probably some degree of seasonality in terms of even how the platforms take on these products in terms of their selection. And I think October and May maybe times when they start thinking about these things. So it is certainly something that we think is going to continue to grow. And even globally, we think it's got huge opportunity, not just within the U.S. So I'm not going to put too much cold water on the trend, other than just -- I can't say fourth quarter is going to be exactly as strong as the third quarter because that was certainly a very exceptionally strong quarter.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, Marty, I think you had mentioned earlier that you have gotten up to sort of #10 on brand recognition. I think you said that's where you were back on the 4Q call in January. And I'm just wondering, and you also said the hardest part is going up from 10 and really working the way up the ladder. I'm just wondering where you are in sort of pursuing that. Maybe you haven't done an updated market survey if you have moved up since then [ph], but just thoughts around that?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So again, we've made great progress from, frankly, no recognition. And our view is that we don't aspire to be #1. We think that would just be -- we don't think we need to be, and we don't want to spend the money to be. We don't think you get that benefit. 10 is an important place mark. Quite frankly, if we were, we'd probably think if we're sort of somewhere 4 to 7. That's a pretty fine place to be. And so we're going to continue to work very hard to build our reputation. But again, we think the reputation largely gets built by generating very good investment performance. And it's really recognized leadership through investment performance, and we're going to do it. But don't worry, we are not hell-bent on -- we're an investment management organization driving investment results, and it's not -- we're not hell-bent on becoming Coca-Cola. So...","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And I guess then, just certainly maybe tied to that lastly, in retail, you pointed out the redemption rates came down a lot. It did for the industry as well, over a number of quarters. Over the past year, you've kind of widened the gap. In other words, your redemption rate has been lower by a greater degree sequentially. They were again this quarter. I'm just wondering if the moves are more sort of industry-related with a number of firms are kind of pointing this out. Or if you're seeing any sort of incremental benefit to that Van Kampen combination in terms of some of the older funds that were underperforming, seeing those redemption rates comes off as people move into stronger products. Just anything along those lines?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, so I sure hope it's an industry trend for decreasing redemption rates. I mean, I just think it's the exact right thing for clients, first thing. So that's the first place I start. We have been very fortunate to have our redemption rate be quite low. It is a combination of, again, starts with a very strong investment performance across the complex. There's no question the Van Kampen combination has been a very important one for us, bringing in investment talent into the organization and other talent generally. So that has been a positive also. And at the same time, when you're growing and you have capabilities that are of interest to clients and investing in them, those are all 3 add up to a relatively lower redemption rate than that of the industry. But I would come back to that I sure hope there is an industry trend down because I think that's really good for investors ultimately.","Operator","Glenn Schorr of Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Loren, are the Van Kampen fee waiver roll-offs fully in the run rate now? I just don't remember where we're at in that process.","Loren M. Starr","Yes, Glenn, they are. So that's $7.5 million per quarter is in there. So that's part of the 24 basis points, I think, is what that translates to on an annualized basis. So that's some of the benefits going from -- on our never [ph] yield before performance fees increase.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Cool. I think you noted it before, but there seems to be a real divide between real strong performance in U.S. equity and then other outside the U.S. I'm curious, a, I expect that flows kind of treat the same. In other words, you just have a little bit better flows going on inside the U.S. versus out. And more importantly, is there a common thread on the investment theme across the non-U.S. geographies that is leading to the underperformance?","Loren M. Starr","So you're looking at some of the charts that show some underperformance in some of our regions? Is that right? Some of our [ph] regional equity?","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Correct. Slide 20, I think, is the best one.","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I mean, I don't think -- it's hard to say there's one basic theme that captures what's going on there. I think when you look -- I mean we have some spots of underperformance, but they're not connected or related. I mean, the Asian equity bit, maybe some of our Chinese equity. China has been depressed. And probably the impact has been worse there than people anticipated with our investment team as one example. But there isn't any theme, and Marty, jump in if you...","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, there's one area in particular that there's -- we have a very, very good Japanese investment team that in fact, they came over from Morgan Stanley during that combination. They have a very good long-term track record, very good investors. And a lot of their investment focus has been sort of an export-oriented theme. And it's relative performance has been hurt over the last 12, 18 months with some of the challenges in Japan in particular. But again, it's a very strong team, but they're the ones feeling the relative underperformance at the moment.","Loren M. Starr","Yes, and I also say in Canada, which is another example, it's a great turnaround story. You don't really see that in that chart, but they're probably performance is going to increase as we get towards the end of the year. Their whole performance profile has really dramatically improved. So the 1- and the 3-year numbers look fantastic, and the 5 years are going to follow. So again, these probably get everything equal performance to another [ph]. If you did it on the asset weighted basis, clearly it's not as equal.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes, it's a single-digit percentage to AUM. It's just -- that's why I asked the question on if it's a heavier percentage on the flows. Anyway, last question, a lot of people dance around the margin issue. I guess, if you decompose this, this really comes down to comp ratio, where you stand out towards the high end versus a bunch of peers. And I just don't know if it's something related to pay out either, a, on the Van Kampen deal; or, b, just more broadly on how comp is structured. When you comp yourself relative to the peers, are there a few things that would tend you to be on the high end on the comp ratio side? And as this continues to bruise the way you did this quarter, does that kind of abate over time as you, I guess, grow into your strong performance?","Loren M. Starr","So I mean, what I'd say is, I mean, we -- the vast majority of our competition is driven by investment teams. They're the heart of the company in terms of what they're ultimately delivering. And I think we have a common philosophy that maybe more unique to Invesco than some of our peers in that we pay more on investment performance than we do on sort of a revenue share concept. And so people who pay on revenue share will have a higher percentage of their comp directly tied to revenue, have a different philosophy around how they want to pay their investment teams. And we think ultimately, it's the right thing for our clients to provide incentives that are linked to what the clients want as opposed to sort of something dropping out due to where the markets are going today. And so that, I think, is maybe some elements of what's unique. And perhaps the other element which is, again, the strength of the firm and one that we feel really good about is that we have many different capabilities across the globe that ultimately give us a better, diversified offering to our clients than many of our peers. And so we should be able to grow more effectively. We should be able to provide solutions to our clients in a better way as a result of that. But that's a more expensive proposition than just having one thing which, again, I don't say our peers just have one thing, but we probably have more of capabilities than some of our peers.","Operator","Our next question does come from Cynthia Mayer of Bank of America.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess just briefly on RDR, I think we're in the final quarter before it goes into effect. And I'm wondering if you expect any impact to this quarter, maybe front-loading of sales. And then when it does go into effect, would you expect -- what kind of impact are you expecting at this point in terms of sales and redemptions? If the share class, for instance, is grandfathered, would you expect lower redemptions ahead?","Loren M. Starr","Yes. I mean, those are really good questions, Cynthia. We obviously have set up share classes that respond to the requirements to only have a management fee associated with the products that will be flowing. And so all of the new flows coming in off of Jan 1, 2013, will be in this new share class. But you're right, existing assets and products with clients are grandfathered. So I think the real question that we need to see what the advisers, the IFAs, do in that context. And in some cases, they may rather just transfer everyone into the new share class as opposed to having the 2 share classes. But we don't know yet really how that's going to work. It doesn't have an impact on our business from a profitability perspective one way or another. We're still netting the same management fee under both scenarios. It could sort of create some activity in terms of people switching and exchanging, but that should not do anything really in terms of ultimately the bottom line, we don't think. So we're watching it carefully. We're so -- hard to predict exactly what happens. But I don't think it's going to happen in a dramatic way. I think it's going to be people are going to take some time to sort of think about how it's going to go.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then maybe just in terms of the revenue yield, when you look at your near-record pipeline and you look at the mix of that, is the mix of that any different from your current revenue yield?","Loren M. Starr","It's better. It's improving. So we are very pleased by the net revenue yield coming in at a higher rate and certainly and also the, to be conservative [ph], redemptions, those are the lower rate. So we're seeing lower fee product coming out and higher fee product going in, and a lot of these alternative products and certainly the balance risk types of products are at a fee rate that's sort of at or higher than our current rate.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just maybe finally, I think you mentioned, and sorry if you mentioned this already, that G&A stepped down a little bit. Is that G&A sort of a sustainable level for 4Q?","Loren M. Starr","We think it is. I mean, we're seeing some of the benefit of the Minerva -- I'm sorry, that's the code name of it, forgive me. It's the outsourcing of our transfer [ph] business, forgive me for using code names. But that is -- we're beginning to see some of the benefit of that fall into our G&A line item. We'd expect to see more. We said it is something that's going to move into the first quarter. So the ultimate positive impact of run rate savings will sort of achieve as we get into 2013, but we're going to begin to see -- we're beginning to see some of it in this quarter and some into the fourth quarter as well. So I think the G&A numbers should stay. Now the only offset to that is we, and we talked about it last quarter, regulatory requirements and legal and all these things associated with sort of positioning ourselves in the geographies that we're in is becoming more and more expensive. And so that's sort of a counter theme to some of the savings that we're expecting to get from this outsourcing activity.","Operator","Jeff Hopson of Stifel.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The balance risk product, not sure if you gave us any sense of the geographic breakdown U.S. versus non-U.S., and any change in kind of the momentum of some of those products in Europe and the U.K.","Loren M. Starr","All right. Good question. So they're going to be mostly U.S.-based at this point. So as of the third quarter, 75% is U.S. domiciles. We got 12% in Canada and about 13% in the offshore in the U.K. So again, growing piece outside, but it is still the minority. And that's why we think this opportunity is pretty large that we could -- we obviously do what we did in the U.S. in these other regions. It will be truly amazing. And yes, just back in the fourth quarter of 2009, it was all U.S. So that just gives you a sense that it's beginning to grow.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so is it an issue of track records in those regions, or just how long the product's been really focused on? Or what are the issues as far as why it isn't bigger over there and why it could be bigger in the next quarter or years?","Loren M. Starr","So I mean, let's say for Canada, for example, obviously the market is only so large. So it's -- but I mean it's been -- the take-on has been huge. I think it's one of the fastest-growing sort of capabilities in that space that we're doing very well there in terms of caching a really good flow. I think outside of the U.S., it's doing well in Europe. So I think that's one that is sort of getting fully sized. The U.K. is a pretty new concept. And so there's still a fair amount of education, which was the same as it was in the U.S. And that takes probably a year at least, and it was only launched, I think, in the beginning, maybe February or some time. So there's definitely time that needs to sort of go by for ultimate results to sort of take hold. But we have good hope that it will and certainly, some of the new hires that we have there will also help sort of expand our presence in the U.K. in terms of all the offerings in the multi-asset sector.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you mentioned about the institutional pipeline. But any other sense of kind of what has happened here in October in terms of flows across the regions, what are investors doing any different, I guess, in October versus the previous few months?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I think it's a little hard to drill down in a particular month. Probably much better to sort of look at it within core [ph] because what happens in a particular month has a lot to do with just sort of noise on timing and things of that nature. So I'm just going to defer on that one, if that's okay, Roger, just to sort of -- Jeff, sorry, to avoid sort of making a statement on the trend that doesn't really exist.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. But have you seen any change in behavior, I guess, of investors generally, would you say?","Loren M. Starr","I don't know. I mean, obviously there's the macro theme of coming up to election and people sort of being a little bit skittish about where to put their money because they don't understand what's the fiscal cliff going to mean to the market and so. Yes, I mean, I think there's probably some sense of a little bit risk off relative to what we might have seen a little bit earlier. But again, I don't know what's going to happen after the election. Maybe it'll be something else.","Operator","Our next question does come from Eric Berg of RBC Capital.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You talked at length about, repeatedly and in detail about the growth of the asset allocation product and the rise of your international business. But it's also the case that the domestic business, at least for the industry, U.S. equities, has been an outflow for the industry for many, many months. Indeed, if you look back for 10 years, it appears that this outflow phenomenon from domestic equity funds is really not new. It even predated the financial crisis. So my question is, what's your latest thinking on what it's going to take to get to reinvigorate U.S. domestic funds? Or maybe this is a permanent trend away from them that we are seeing. I'd like to get your thoughts.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, good question. I wouldn't bet on the it's a permanent trend. And I think what you have -- and again, I think it's easy to come to that conclusion. I think what you would do though, if you look at flows into equities in total, and in total meaning active and passive, you get a different outcome. I think an awful lot of people are extrapolating that to say active equity -- U.S. equity investment [ph] in the United States is dead. And I think it's a misread. I think it is movement into passive is really a first step on to risk on. But I think the more relevant fact, if you look at what's happened in the marketplace post the crisis, and if you look at the correlation of returns to market events as opposed to stock-taking events, it's very, very high. And I'm going to forget that it's basically a 90% correlation of returns coming from macro events as opposed to stock-specific events. That's probably 25, 30 -- 25 percentage points higher than historical. That is the same phenomena that you saw at the end of the '80s, post the '87 crash into '90s. And so when you get these correlation periods, you don't get paid for -- active investors have a harder time generating alpha. And so I personally think that is the thing to pay attention to. And we would go to a -- I think as we look forward and if probably the United States is probably further ahead on healing itself economically. And if that's the case, I think active equity investors are going to generate alpha again. You will see more broadly they will. You will see money flow back into active U.S. equity capabilities. So yes, that's my perspective, and I think it is important and something to take a look at the correlations of returns.","Operator","Our next question does come from Robert Lee of KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions were asked, but one question. I mean, on the call a couple of weeks ago, BlackRock's talked about merging their [indiscernible] the U.S. retail sales force. Could you maybe update us on how -- remind us that you integrate the PowerShares products into your retail distribution, or if there's any need to change how it works out?","Martin L. Flanagan","We've been doing that for years, so that's not a new thing for us. When we bought the idea of ETFs, we had made the observation in 2005, '06 that we thought the advisers were moving much more to a holistic approach and advising their clients. And that it would be a common -- first and foremost, it's meeting the investment objectives, and then they would look at the different vehicles that did that. And naturally, asset allocations and meeting those needs for a combination of vehicles. So we've been doing that really almost from the beginning of the combination with PowerShares. So we say that's a good idea.","Operator","Next question does come from Chris Shutler of William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just one  quick one. It looks like the performance in U.S. core growth remains challenged on both the 1- and the 3-year basis. So I certainly recognize that it takes time to rebuild those capabilities, but those categories certainly aren't in favor today. But I just want to get your thoughts on performance there and how you're feeling about the teams and products you have in place.","Martin L. Flanagan","Let's see, 2 things, and it's back to almost a question before, 2 questions ago. If you want to see where the bulk of the outflow is coming in the U.S., it's large-cap U.S. growth as a category. For us specifically, the team running large-cap, mid-cap has been with the organization about 2 years, we think they're really very, very talented people and have good investment capability. And this gets back to a little bit of my answer earlier where a lot of their investment philosophy is driven by stock picking, and it's been challenged in this environment. So that said, we think the team's very, very good, and they have had a history prior to being with us that's having very, very good results. And we think they will generate them in time, but this has not been the environment for their investment philosophy. That said, if you look at the small-cap growth capabilities, it is very, very strong and continues to be.","Operator","Our next question does come from Marc Irizarry of Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Marty, can you just talk a little bit about the alternative business for you guys, how you think about building out strategies there, sort of what's weighing on the flows, where you're seeing some success? And how do you think about sort of building versus buying in that business?","Martin L. Flanagan","So again, I think you have to go asset class by asset class and some will be repetitive. But I feel very good with real estate. We feel very good about private equity, feel very good in bank loans, feel very good about some of the extensions that we have through our multi-asset suite, our asset allocation capabilities, whether it be commodities or some other areas there. So we just continue to look at it and look at where demand is. And if we're capable of meeting client need, we will respond. In fact, one of the turns that people have talked about, and I won't get too excited about it, but if you -- there are alternative capabilities that are appropriate and growing quite dramatically in the retail channel and we've seen that ourselves. And we are continuing to develop that. We've just introduced in the last couple of months another really alternative capability into the retail channel. It is directed towards high net worth individuals, qualified investors. So just being very appropriate. And so I think we'll continue to see those things. But we think we're positioned really quite well to do strongly throughout the alternatives capability as a firm, and we'll just continue to respond where necessary.","Operator","Our next question does come from Greggory Warren of Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'm glad you guys touched on the issue with the U.S. stock flows because I think it's an opportune or situation where people tend to focus on the headlines and just the active side. And if you really roll up the passive flows and strip out American funds, which has a heavy influence on that active side, the flows don't look as dire as the picture that gets painted with the headlines. So I'm glad you pointed that out. And I guess my question follows on kind of where we are with the flows. How do you guys, from a sort of a longer term perspective, think about allocating resources given what's going on now? I mean, it's easy to sort of throw money at your Fixed Income or a multi-asset class products or structure products in an environment where those things are selling. How do you think about allocating capital to equities? Because we've seen a few of your competitors year-after-year come out and do sort of marketing campaigns or other programs to sort of say, hey, equities are still here.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, so let me see if I can answer that in 2 ways. One, we just -- we start from a position of what are we trying to do for our clients. And our view is that we're committed to having a broad, very broad and deep capability across asset classes, equities through fixed income. We are very strong in equities, in particular. And to your point, even if you, as you were more articulate than I was describing sort of the U.S. equity picture, we have very good strong teams. We're committed to the strong teams, and we just know asset classes go in and out of cycle. And so we're just absolutely committed to them through the cycles, and we want them dedicated to delivering against the investment philosophy that they're known for and that they delivered. So to your final point, so what do we do about it. And if you look at, again, our -- how we -- and I'll answer more from a [indiscernible] more from a retail channel point, but it's not limited to that. If you look for the last 2 years, what have we been communicating with our investors, with our clients is that we have been showing them the benefit and making very clear the benefit of a combination of capabilities, whether it be a U.S. equity capability, dividend -- U.S. income capability and international capability. So we've been doing that for more than 2 years. And we think it's -- you just want to be very thoughtful and appropriate in making sure that you're giving investment guidance that makes sense for clients over the longer term and not be responsive to where flows go because that gets you in trouble.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay. And I guess sort of thinking about equities overall, when I was looking through the flow data third quarter, you saw outflows pretty much on par with what we saw last year in third quarter. And a huge difference in performance in the markets, and yet there's a fiscal cliff coming. There's the elections, but I don't think it was as dire a situation. So when I started looking at the performance numbers overall for active funds, it seemed to be that on a relative basis, pretty much every category was underperforming this year like it was last year. And I'm wondering, do you think it's a matter of, say, performance getting better? I mean, if you start having active management outperform the markets, that's sort of is the catalyst to get people back in?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So I think the relative performance active versus passive is back to the comment I made earlier. I just think it's really the market environment we are in is the 90% correlation to sort of macro events [indiscernible]. And to your point that you're appropriately pointing out earlier, and I've talked about the point of it's much better if we are giving -- the advice channel is encouraging people to be invested for the longer term, you take a 3- to 5-year time horizon, I really want to be invested in U.S. equities. I think it's going to be one of those things you're going to look back 3 years from now and say, \"Why didn't I have greater exposure to U.S. equities?\" That said, I would be going to the managers that, again, you all from what you do, are committed to very good teams, very good long track records, very thoughtful investment philosophies and processes. And you're going to do very, very well. And I think the reason why the money is not going into active equities is more, it feels like a bigger commitment on an investor's part and I think you cannot underestimate still how nervous investors are to invest for the long term in the environment that we're in.","Operator","Matt Kelly of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up from me on the capital management side. You have a pretty sizable amount of debt coming due in late February. I just wanted to touch on it because I don't think we've discussed it this quarter. What are your sort of thoughts there in terms of extend or retire or some of both? Or how are you thinking about it at this point?","Loren M. Starr","Matt, it's a good question. I think we are looking at it. Obviously, it's a unique opportunity in terms of you could issue debt and replace it at a very, very low cost. Or you could let it expire and just put it on the credit facility. They both can make a lot of sense. So I would just say it's something we're looking at. We haven't committed to one way or another as to, certainly, where we're going to go on this one. But we are -- definitely we've been looking at it quarter-by-quarter, and we will continue to pay a lot of attention to that opportunity. But overall, we are committed to sort of keeping the debt levels sort of flat or declining over time as we want to, continue to deleverage and show continued financial strength and certainly build up some more cash on the balance sheet. So that is still part of our objectives on the capital side, combined with, of course, continued dedicated return on capital through dividends and buybacks as we -- as you've seen us do and as you will continue to see us do.","Operator","At this time, I show no further questions.","Martin L.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now we would like to turn the call over to the speakers for today, Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin L. Flanagan","Thank you very much, and thank you, everybody, for joining us. And this is Marty Flanagan, along with Loren Starr, and we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on the website, if you're so inclined to follow. And we'll provide a review of the business results and also the specific discussion around the U.K. Loren will then go into greater detail on the financials. And as always, we'll have Q&A.","So let me start on Slide 3, and let me hit some of the highlights of the firm's operating results for the first quarter. Long-term investment performance remained very strong during the quarter. Strong investment performance and continued focus on clients contributed net inflows of $5.2 billion for the quarter across a diverse range of investment capabilities. Adjusted operating income was up 34.5% as compared to fourth quarter of the prior year. And a continued focus on a disciplined approach to our business drove improvement in our operating margin to 40.5%, almost a 500 basis point increase from a year ago.","Assets under management were $778 billion for the fourth quarter, up from $745.5 billion in the prior quarter. Operating income was $347 million versus $328 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.58, up from $0.55 in the prior quarter. And the quarterly dividend remains at 22.5% -- excuse me, $0.225 per share, and we returned $450 million to shareholders during the quarter.","Now let me take a moment and look back at the achievements over the past year, which will provide insights into our long-range plans. First and foremost, of course, we remain very focused on delivering strong long-term investment performance to our clients, which continues to drive the growth in the business. 83% of assets under management were ahead of peers on a 3-year basis at the end of 2013. And by delivering strong long-term investment performance to clients, long-term flows for the year were $34.4 billion.","We continue to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities, such as multi-asset, fixed income and liquid alternative capabilities in particular, and by hiring world-class talent, upgrading technology platform, launching new products and providing additional resources. The ability to leverage capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe, we believe, is a significant differentiator of our firm. We will continue to bring the best of Invesco to different parts of the business where it makes sense for our clients.","We also successfully completed our joint venture with Religare Asset Management in India, divested our private wealth management business and finalized the outsourcing of our European transfer agency process.","And before I go into more detail -- Loren goes in detail on the financials, but let me take a minute to review investment performance. And I'm on Page 7, if you are following the presentation. Our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain strong investment culture helped us maintained a solid long-term investment performance across the enterprise during the quarter. Looking at the firm as a whole, 72% of assets were ahead of peers on a 1-year basis, 83% of assets were ahead of peers on a 3-year basis and the softness in the 5-year number reflect the rolling off of some very strong numbers in the fourth quarter of 2008 and a brief period where we trailed the market during the low-quality rally in 2009. Based on the strength of our recovery later in 2009, we would expect our 5-year numbers to demonstrate steady improvement over the second and third quarters of 2014.","Now turning to flows on Page 8. You'll see gross sales remain strong during the quarter, and particularly strong numbers for active assets under management. These numbers also reflect the broad diversity of flows we saw across the global business during the quarter, which included continued strength in equities, alternatives and traditional ETF offering.","Net long-term flows were $1 billion for the quarter. Although gross sales remained strong for the fourth quarter, redemptions increased. I'll provide more detail in a moment. We also saw upward trend in institutional channel, net long-term flows and continued demand in real estate and bank loans.","Although clients in particular -- institutional clients continue to show interest in our asset allocation strategies, we saw further shift towards risk-based assets in the quarter, which resulted in the slowdown in the sales of IBRA.","As we've said in the past, in risk-on environments, client shift demand towards equities and away from risk-parity strategies. This is exactly what we experienced. We saw $6.6 billion of improvement in equity flows in 2013 versus 2012, which more than offset $6.2 billion decline in IBRA inflows in 2013 versus 2012.","It's important to note that our asset allocation strategies continue to perform well relative to risk parity peers, and we anticipate these types of flows during the type of equity rally we saw last year. That said, the choppiness we're seeing in the market currently is a likely favorable development for IBRA.","Gross long-term sales for our U.S. retail business remained strong at $18.4 billion for the quarter, a 14% increase over the same quarter a year ago. The annualized redemption rate for Invesco remained favorable relative to the industry, as you can see on Slide 11.","Flows into the complex were led by strength in U.S. equity, international global equity, traditional ETFs and alternatives.","Our business has become increasingly diversified as allocation in alternatives grew to 37% of sales in the quarter versus 28% during that same period 2 years ago. We saw 18 funds with net flows of greater than $100 million over the trailing 12-months ending 12\/31 versus 8 in the same period in 2011.","We also took the opportunity during the fourth quarter to launch a number of new capabilities globally that will help support the future growth of the firm. In fact, we launched more funds during the fourth quarter than we did in any full calendar year over the past 5 years. A number of these capabilities is built on the work we've done over the past few years to strengthen our alternative offerings to the market. These products leverage 25 years of experience managing alternative assets for pension plans, sovereign wealth funds and other institutions. These product launches are designed to further solidify our position as one of the largest managers of alternatives for U.S. institutional investors, with more than $83 billion of alternative strategies.","We continue -- we launched the global total return funds in the U.K., EMEA, the EMEA cross-border and the U.S. market as part of our efforts to further scale our multi-asset capability globally. Multi-asset absolute return funds provide exposure to a blend of investment ideas across asset class, geographies, sectors and currencies, something Invesco is extremely well positioned to implement.","We also took the opportunity to expand our suite of investment capabilities in the fast-growing China market.","We're pleased with the progress during 2013. We feel good about the momentum of our business. We believe Invesco's very well positioned regardless of where the markets take us. As always, we continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our competitive and financial position over the long term.","And before I turn the call over to Loren for more in depth discussion of the quarter's results, let me take a few minutes to provide an update on our business in EMEA. As I have mentioned, we are very well positioned for long-term success across the U.K. and Continental Europe. We continue to execute our transition plan, which is going very well. The market has been extremely receptive to Mark Barnett, who has an excellent track record. Mark is supported by strong Invesco perpetual investment team as he transitions into the leadership role for U.K. equities. U.K. experienced record gross sales during 2013 and has experienced excellent momentum heading into the new year. We have many attractive, highly competitive funds across the franchise, and we will -- which we will use to offset any outflows in the U.K. equity income funds.","Strong investment performance drove continued success in our cross-border retail business, which experienced $10 billion of net flows across 2013. We also made progress further diversifying our business during the quarter -- during the final quarter of the year, with strong net sales into global equities and European equities. We've also been pleased with investors' response to recently launched GTR fund, which has seen flows in excess of $250 million in a very short period of time.","We continue to make further progress in promoting experienced, capable, well-tenured fund management team in Henley.","Assets managed by our EMEA business totaled nearly $172 billion, as you'll see on Slide 15. During the fourth quarter, net flows into EMEA, excluding U.K. equity income, were $4.3 billion, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 15%. Given our efforts to thoughtfully manage the transition, we're pleased to report that client reaction to the departure news has been calm and professional, highly supportive of Invesco Perpetual's investment teams.","From October 15 through the end of the year, redemptions from U.K. equity income totaled $4.8 billion, approximately 10% of the total. This is good outcome. We continue to see strong evidence that many clients are choosing to remain invested in the funds as demonstrated by Tuesday's announcement from Edinburgh Investment Trust that is retaining Invesco Perpetual as the manager of the trust. We find the results encouraging. We continue to do everything we can to deliver good outcomes for clients, retain assets and grow our EMEA business.","Now I'll turn the call over to Loren to review the financials.","Loren M. Starr","Thank you very much, Marty. So quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $33.2 billion or 4.5%. This is driven by positive market returns and FX of $28 billion and total net inflows of $5.2 billion, of which $1 billion were long term. Our average AUM for the quarter was $761.7 billion. That's up 4.4% versus the third quarter average.","Our net revenue yield came in at 45 basis points, and that was an increase of 0.2 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The increase was a result of improved mix, leading to a higher investment management fee rate, as well as greater performance fees compared to the third quarter.","As a reminder, as we look forward into the next quarter, our fee rate, as it always is, will be negatively impacted by day count, as the first quarter has 2 fewer days than the fourth quarter.","Now let's turn to our operating results. Net revenue increased $40.9 million or 5% quarter-over-quarter, which included a positive FX impact of $10.4 million. Within that net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees grew by $44.8 million or 4.8% to $982 million -- I'm sorry, $982.8 million, and this increase was in line with our higher average AUM and an improvement in the effective fee rate during the quarter. FX increased investment management fees by $12.9 million.","Service and distribution revenues were up by $9.4 million or 4.3%, roughly in line with the increase in average AUM. FX increased service and distribution revenues by $1.2 million.","Performance fees in the quarter came in at $11.1 million, and that was an increase of $0.5 million versus prior quarter. Performance fees in the third quarter were driven by a variety of products and regions. FX increased performance fees by $0.8 million. As you know, performance fees are difficult to predict and could be volatile quarter-to-quarter. As we look towards Q1, we expect performance fees to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million, and this range includes the recent change to the Edinburgh Trust contract in the U.K.","Other revenues in the fourth quarter were $33.3 million. That was an increase of $0.2 million versus prior quarter. FX increased revenues by -- other revenues by $0.1 million. As we've said in the past, other revenues are difficult to forecast. But I will say that we expect the average to be approximately $30 million per quarter in 2014, although fluctuations quarter-over-quarter will likely exist.","Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $16.1 million or 4.2%, and that was roughly in line with the increase in retail investment management fees and service and distribution revenues. FX increased these expenses by $4.6 million.","Moving on down to the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $510.1 million increased by $21.8 million or 4.5% relative to Q3. FX had an impact of $5.9 million on those expenses.","Within expenses, employee compensation at $332.3 million, increased by $4 million or 1.2%, and was largely the result of FX, which increased compensation by $3.5 million. Looking forward, seasonal payroll taxes and a 1-month impact from base salary increases will lift our Q1 compensation by approximately $15 million to $20 million. And it will then decline by approximately $5 million into Q2, as the decrease in seasonal expenses are offset by full quarter's worth of base salary. This assumes flat assets from the end of the year, importantly.","Marketing expense increased by $7.6 million or 32.3% to $31.1 million. The fourth quarter included $2 million of new product launch marketing cost and $5 million in advertising and other marketing cost to support the ongoing business. And FX impacted these expenses by $0.4 million. We expect run rate quarterly marketing expenses to be roughly in the range of $28 million to $29 million per quarter in 2014. Again, fluctuation will likely occur quarter-to-quarter.","Property, office and technology expenses were $74.9 million in the fourth quarter, and that was up $2.2 million. FX increased these expenses by $1 million. Looking ahead, property, office and tech expenses should increase slightly to approximately $76 million to $77 million per quarter, reflecting continued investment in front-office technology platforms and increased outsourced administration costs due to the higher levels of business activity in EMEA.","G&A expenses came in at $71.8 million. That was up considerably, $8 million increase or 12.5%. The fourth quarter included $4.5 million of new product launch-related costs and also $2.5 million of, what I would call, other seasonal G&A costs. FX increased G&A by $1 million. And we would expect G&A to decline to approximately $67 million per quarter in 2014. Although once again, variation should be expected period to period.","So continuing on down the page, you'll see the nonoperating income decreased $7.9 million compared to Q3. The decrease was largely due to higher interest expense resulting from the refinancing of our long-term debt during the quarter, which happened mid-November. And then we also had lower unrealized gains on certain of our real estate and private equity partnership investments.","Interest expense will step up to approximately $18 million to $19 million per quarter, reflecting a full 3 months of interest expense impact.","Firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q4 came in a little bit lower than guidance at 25.4%. Looking forward, we would expect to see the effective tax rate, again, being around 26% to 27%.","And that brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.58 and again, as Marty said, our adjusted net operating margin of 40.5%.","And I will now then turn it back to Marty to open it up.","Martin L. Flanagan","So any questions please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ken Worthington, JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe, first on the buyback. So you closed the CIBC deal at the end of the year. To what extent were the big buybacks this quarter a front-end loading of the cash received from that deal? And really, given the deal closed on 12\/31 and there's more money coming in from, I'll call it an, earn-out in the next couple of months, is there still meaningful stock you'd expect to buy with the proceeds? And then for the record I do understand you bought back a lot more stocks from the total proceeds from the deal in the quarter, so I get the math.","Loren M. Starr","So the buyback really did reflect the front-end load of the value of the transaction, even though the money is spread over a couple of quarters. That is what the $350 million represented, Ken. And again, in terms of our interest in buyback, as we have in the past, we will be opportunistic and certainly be looking at a relative valuation and impacts on our stock due to market dislocations and other things. So again, we have a strong interest in being able to return our capital to shareholders, both through dividends and buybacks in 2014.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Marty, just on Neil Woodford. So Neil was sort of concentration risk that you inherited when you came to the firm. You put Mark Barnett in charge of the assets, and looks like it's helping retain the assets. You guys pointed out that he's being very well received. But you also maintained that concentration risk. So as you position for Neil's departure in the next couple of months, are there any steps that you either have taken or are taking to kind of minimize this concentration risk as we look forward into the future?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. Ken, good question. I think the reality is we'll take good money managers all day long. And Mark has been a part of that team for a long time. It's the depth of the team that is there. We couldn't be this successful without that real depth. And I think that often, it is something that gets overlooked throughout, not just our organizations, but a number of organizations. And you have to have a portfolio manager pulling the trigger, and that's what we do and a very talented one, supported by a very strong team. And we think that is the right way to do it.","Loren M. Starr","Ken, the only thing I would say is that we've been extremely successful, and we will continue to be working on continuing to grow other parts of the business in the U.K. So the diversification will happen largely through the success of our other teams. And we've had great success in the corporate bond area, in the global equity area. And obviously, the new GTR product, Global Total Return, has been off to a very strong start. So I think you'll see diversification created that way primarily.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you provide us an update on how the Henley based multi-asset team is doing? And I understand this is a pretty young team over at Invesco, but it would be helpful if you could provide some color on how sales activity has trended both, kind of in the U.K. I believe you have a U.S. mutual fund product within that fund now. And also, any C Cap cross-border activity in Continental Europe?","Martin L. Flanagan","So let me kick off. So we're very early days. If you remember, the U.K. fund got launched in September of last year. And the, just want to call it, the pace is not too different generally than the United States. It's usually served 3 years -- you have to have good track record for 3 years and keep going. That said, the reputation of the team is strongly in place. And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we've seen $250 million already head towards that team. So we look at that as a very, very good development out of the box. We have, as I said, just -- and that's one of the efforts in the fourth quarter. The capabilities now in the C Cap product, it is now in the United States. And it's hard to introduce in the retail markets in Asia, just because of regulation around derivatives. But it is a global effort, and we think it's a real strong complement to the risk parity capability that we have. And we think it's going to be a very strong capability for the firm in total.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just I want to touch on performance fees real quick. Given the 1Q guidance, and normally 1Q is a seasonally strong quarter. It seems that your performance fees will sort of trade -- trend maybe in the $30 million range next year plus or minus. Back 5 years ago, it used to be kind of $70 million, $80 million, $90 million. So -- and your alternative AUM is much higher. So maybe you could just help us think about what structurally has happened in terms of why the performance fee run rate is sort of lower than it used to be and not higher?","Loren M. Starr","Well, I guess, one thing: I mean, performance fees in aggregate have always been a small part of our overall revenues, so that's kind of one point. And we like it that way. We like the predictability. So we haven't been sort of driving to increase performance fees overall as a function of our overall revenues. In some cases, they're sort of part of -- parcel with the product, and they're expected by clients. And in which case, we'll certainly have them. So in the past, going way back, I mean, we had quite a bit coming from some of our quant capabilities. And again, some of our quant capabilities have done extremely well. But some of the new accounts that we have with institutions have been not performance fee based but more straight management fee based, which, again, I think it's probably more predictable and provides greater valuation credit to us [indiscernible]. Looking forward, I would say that we would expect to continue to see performance fees. Even in the first quarter guidance, I feel the 5% to 10% is probably the right level. For us, there is still some opportunity to see performance fees that could show up through real estate. And then over the longer term, we think the private equity fund V, fund IV, they're doing very well, those funds. They are above their high watermarks. And again, none of this is realized. None of it is stuff that we can be booking. But ultimately, it could be substantial in terms of performance fees, if and when they get into the point where we could recognize that from an accounting perspective. So I do think performance fees will continue to play a part in our revenue stream. It's really just the U.K. element is going to be more muted than you've seen in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Fannon, Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Can you give a little bit more color on the Edinburgh Trust announcement just in terms of the size? And then what other kind of institutional dynamic or clients you've talked to or what other assets remain within the Perpetual franchise and how those conversations are tracked?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So obviously, Edinburgh Investment Trust is a very high profile investment trust in the U.K. It's probably just under USD 2 billion. A very seasoned, experienced board. And so we look at that as quite a very public endorsement of Invesco Perpetual, Mark and -- I mean, and Mark Barnett and the team. And so we look at this as very positive. Others institutions, as you know, they're confidential. They're -- they don't want to be talked about publicly. And so again, I think looking at that as a strong supporter of Mark and the team, I think, is a very good way to look at this.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then, I guess, just thinking about the fee rate and what you guys are having success in selling products, particularly some of your C Cap versions versus kind of where you're seeing some outflows, whether that be IBRA or Perpetual, taking market aside, as you think out over the next -- into 2014, are you looking at your fee rate improving based on where you see the demand and where you're seeing redemptions?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So I think I'll step up one level and then come back down to it. It was maybe 3 years ago, we started to talk about we need some better jobs across EMEA and the efforts there. And you're now seeing very strong organic growth on the continent and, as I said, about 15% organic growth last year. We look for that type of growth to continue, and it's a reflection of not just, want to call it, the infrastructure work that we did, but really, if you look at the breadth of the capabilities on the C Cap product and its performance, it is really, really strong. And as Loren has pointed out, it is in broad -- bonds, European equities, global equities, the addition of GTR in it. So it is a very, very strong lineup, and we thought we are punching under our weight on the continent and we're starting to make some real improvement. So we look at it as a very, very strong dynamic for us. And also as Loren said specifically in the U.K., if you look at the depth of the team, the quality of the team and the performance across the global equity team, the European equity team, in addition to the bond team which has just been strong, it's broad, it's deep. And so that's also where we see money moving. So I think we're positioned quite well.","Loren M. Starr","Yes. I would answer just, in fact, right, yes, we do believe that the net revenue yield excluding performance fees, and I'll just make that point, will improve year-over-year because of the dynamics that Marty just talked about. The performance fee is a bit of a variable that could keep it more flattish depending on kind of how performance fees show up in the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Kim, Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, just coming back to U.K. equity income. On the last quarter's conference call, you kind of talked about redemptions above the historic reduction rate. We're about $1.5 billion in the back half of October. So not sure if that's apples-to-apples versus the $4.8 billion of outflows you reported for the quarter. But just wondering if you could give us a sense of how those outflows tracked through the quarter, and then early read into January trends would be helpful as well.","Loren M. Starr","So again, I think it is apples-to-apples, the $4.8 billion is consistent with the $1.5 billion that we talked about. It obviously has been sort of a -- there's been volatility in because of some institutional accounts who have decided to sort of terminate, and then those can be a little chunky. So it's hard to sort of read into it. And I'd say, generally, most of the movement has been around the institutional side. The retail side has been a much more sort of slow kind of -- and even less material impact on the overall number, so -- which I think is encouraging. Because the vast majority of the assets are retail based. So it has been sort of a general improving trend month-to-month, I would say, but I don't want to read any -- too much into that because, again, we all understand that this is something that's going to go through a couple of more events ultimately to really realize how much impact this is going to have. So we're very focused on it. We're not complacent on the topic. And again, we're focused on doing what's right for the clients and making sure that -- we have Mark Barnett in front of all the clients that need to see him and get comfortable with him. I'm not going to comment on January trends because we don't want to be out in advance of anything that our own U.K. team is doing. But I'd say, the bigger events generally will be at the time of actual -- Mr. Woodford's departure, right? And that would be the date that we think most of the noise and activity would happen. So that's the date I would look to as opposed to something else.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then maybe focusing on your fixed income business. Just curious to get your take on sort of the opportunity seemingly developing across institutional fixed-income managers, just assuming pension plans increasingly shifted to maybe more defensive asset allocations now that they've gotten closer to being fully funded, and how that might play out versus the potential for maybe some ongoing redemptions on the retail side of the business.","Martin L. Flanagan","So I'd probably broaden it. And I think if you look at what our pension plans, what would you expect them to do, it was rally of equities. And those that participated, if they close those gaps, you could really see more movement into asset allocation. And in fact, one of the things we're seeing, continued interest and things like give breadth in the institutional channel and on volume set, as we saw in retail. But that makes a lot of sense. The effort in fixed income around multi-credit is a core skill that we have in credit. And that capability, be it in the markets, along with things like bank loans, are traditional strength in real estate. So we think we positioned ourselves very well for what could be happening in the institutional market.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Katz, Citi.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just in terms of a lot of puts and takes in terms of what's coming and what's going out geographically, where you're seeing strength, et cetera, can you give us an updated -- I know you gave us a sort of tactical guidance for the first quarter on some of the line items for expense. But stepping back, can you give us a sort of a sense of where you think incremental margin opportunity might be? Is it still north of 65%? Or has anything primarily changed quarter-to-quarter?","Loren M. Starr","Bill, so I would say, again, the discussion on the incremental margins has a lot to do with what sort of market we're in. And I think again, so we will provide sort of a similar perspective, I don't think it's changed. Which is when the markets are generally moving up strongly, we can see the incremental margins be at the higher end of the range of somewhere between 50 to 65. And we certainly -- we think 65 is achievable, maybe even higher in the strong equity market. In flat markets, which is what we normally plan for and hopefully we'll be surprised with better market, it is more on the lower end of that scale. So you're into the 55 to 60s range. So depending on what's your view in the market, you can select what sort of incremental margin would probably occur.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up question. You've launched, I think you said the most products cumulatively in -- versus the last couple of years. So as you think through 2014, you put the Woodford assets to the side, which feels very tactile to me, and EMEA is doing very well, is it liquid -- where would you see -- where would you expect to see the greatest rate of traction of some of the new business trends?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So it's a good question. It sort of pairs very well with Loren's commentary and sort of what you see. So where we see the world will be, alternatives will continue. We think we're stronger and we'll continue to be. The efforts on fixed income, in particular on multi-credit, I think, in addition to bank loans and the like, is going to continue to be an opportunity for us. But again, I think you also have to go back to what have we done over the years and whether it be getting into the ETF business, moving into risk parity-type capabilities. The effort right now is around liquid alternatives, we think the depth and breadth of our -- we thought it very important to be holistic in getting a full range out there right now because the take-up time that we all know. So we think we're positioned very well in asset allocation, liquid alternatives. The Continental Europe in particular, I think is going to continue to be an opportunity for us. Our position in Mainland China, quite frankly, is ever-growing and will be something that will -- and to say nothing of the ETF business. Our market share was about 4% last year; as a percentage of gross sales, it was 7%. So we're growing the ETF business. We see that as a margin enhancer also. And we're continuing to get further strength in the U.S. retail business. So I do look at it as early days. And as Michael was mentioning earlier, if you look at our capabilities, it matches up very well where the institutional market could be going. So again, I think a lot of the things to pay attention to is we can't predict markets. But at one level, it really doesn't matter to us because we think we have the capabilities to participate. So I would look in the next 3 years as -- that we're positioned very, very well for where we think clients could be going.","Operator","Your next question comes from Luke Montgomery, Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So the operating margin is looking pretty healthy, above 40%. Notwithstanding that, we've talked a little bit about how maybe less scale in your product suite might be holding down the margin relative to some of your peers. Just wondering what levers you might pull to address the scale issue, whether that means rationalization of products or -- and redeployment of human capital, seed capital. Or is this really just more about getting the flows up? And if it's the latter, you touched on them just a second ago, but what are some more obvious opportunities by distribution channel or geography to increase that scale?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So you are on the topic. And I think, again, what I'd point to is just -- and we've talked about it. And here's an example of it right now. So we are taking the -- to the degree that we can take our investment capability to take them around the world more concurrently, that's going to make quite a difference. And I think you can just see from what we're talking about this quarter that is a real effort in that way. And we think by organic growth, with the quality of the teams, the long-term performance of the teams, that's where we see the real opportunity for us. And yes, we agree with your observation.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just in -- and is it -- could it be a little bit of both? I mean, is there some rationalization of products and redeployment of capital? Or...","Martin L. Flanagan","So we always do that. And I -- if you add up the number of things we've rationalized over the years, it's quite stunning, honestly. But we'll continue to do it. There's probably less rationalization, but we're always paying attention to that. And same thing, we deploy resources whether it be seed capital or talent to those things that we think have the highest probability of success, and that's what we think we're doing right now.","Loren M. Starr","I would also just mention, I mean, maybe the areas where we've seen less scale, I mean, there's definitely been a benefit just generally in terms of the flow activity. So all our regions are improving in terms of profitability. There isn't a particular area that I would say is a real problem or there's something going wrong someplace. So we're seeing really good traction just in terms of bring the flows in, and the top line is making it happen.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then on the comp. Even with the FX impact that you called out this quarter, looks like comp revenue is the lowest it's ever been. So first, do you expect any continuity in that FX impact? And I know you don't target a specific ratio, but what's the likelihood you can keep the comp ratio down at this level?","Loren M. Starr","I mean, I think, we -- I mean, given the guidance, I think -- and obviously, we get a sense of confidence. We wouldn't provide it. It is something where we don't manage to a comp ratio. Looking at compensation to revenues, we -- again, we provide a lot of detail on how we think about compensation should work in some compensation. But ultimately, we do feel that this is a sustainable good level with the variations around payroll taxes and then the obvious decline coming in for the second quarter as payroll taxes roll off.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One, maybe -- you might have hit on this, so just wanted to check, just on the buyback activity, you obviously got a pickup this quarter. Just in terms of the 2014, just in terms of what to expect. Should we just be going back to sort of that normal run rate that you guys have -- I think it's about 1\/3 of your cash flow. But I just wanted to get an update there.","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I mean, I think that's a good starting point to think about what to expect going forward. However, honestly, we're not driven formulaically in our thinking on buybacks, and we will have some variation quarter-to-quarter. We have said, and this will still be the case, where we do have some of the equity grants to get issued is on a deferred basis to employees in the first quarter. And certainly, we would do our very best to try to mitigate any dilutive impact by, certainly, focusing on buyback as a strategy.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, Marty, you gave pretty good updates in terms of what you guys have been doing on the EMEA side and then also on the balanced or the asset allocation products. And I think when I look at the U.S. business, you kind of gave the same updates. And over time, post the Van Kampen transaction, there was maybe a period of 1 to 2 years, where -- whether it was launching products, consolidating products, improving the performance, you're gaining traction on the distribution platforms. And then we gradually saw the flows improve. So I guess, in EMEA and in this -- the balanced risk or the allocation products, I guess, just kind of similar maybe color in terms of you got maybe one issue in each of those segments; but on the flip side, you're doing a lot to grow those businesses. I just wanted to get a sense of where you see Invesco in terms of like the inning the growth in both of those, whether you want to call it product areas or geographies that partially offsets some of these near-term issues?","Martin L. Flanagan","That's a good question actually. And so let me provide the perspectives. So if you go back with the talk -- a good inflection point was the Morgan Stanley and Van Kampen transaction, and we thought we just -- we weren't anywhere in the U.S. retail business at that time and we laid out our perspective of where we're going. I'd still say, in the U.S. retail business, it's going very, very well. But I'd say, we're fourth inning. Where if you want to use the headlines of where we're recognized by, as a brand, it's -- we're now ninth, tenth in the U.S. retail channel. We -- you couldn't even -- we did the first survey, they couldn't find our name. So it's -- that's a tremendous change in a short period of time. We still think we've got to move up a handful of notches, and that will make a big, big difference. EMEA actually, or Continental Europe in particular, it is somewhat of a replay. We are in the first inning of where we think we can go. Now the last couple of years, when we started to highlight this as an area where we're spending time and money, we have a lot of plumbing-type work to do. And the outsourcing and TA and things that you might think are sort of maybe not interesting. Well, the fundamental fact, if you don't have strong operating infrastructure, it gets in the way of success. And so a lot of the plumbing is now in place. There's a lot of rework on the product range. And again, I mentioned a few minutes ago, it's broad. It's deep. It's strongly performing. But we're still very early on penetration of -- with principal distributors on the comp. Now there's areas of real strength. In Italy, we're really, really, really strong. Germany, we should just be dramatically stronger than what we are. We've vetted Germany for decades. And so -- and also Switzerland, again, we're very much undershooting our weight. So we look at the continent as a real opportunity for us. And so the analogy's probably a very good one that you pulled out.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken, UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So you guys have described IBRA as more conservative than a bunch of peers. And clearly, January has started off as a much more risk-off-type market. I know you indicated that this was likely favorable. But could you give us maybe a little more specifics on whether or not what you've seen in January -- obviously, the performance is balanced nicely. But from a flow perspective, has that balance in performance helped sort of stem the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter?","Loren M. Starr","Yes. Brennan, I think there's probably a little bit of a lag in terms of how people respond. And so again, generally, we are still seeing strong interest in equities in January. So again, how long that persists is a good question. And I think we're seeing sort of a consistency in IBRA. The sort of flip side to that where that's been more on an outflow perspective. So I don't think we're seeing any change in behavior in January per se, at least in the flow data. But again, that's something where, within a week, you could begin to see something shift perhaps. So it's just a month, so it\u2019s hard to really say where it's going. I would just mention, it's probably worth just having this point out that in the month of January, we have more flows in the month of January, long-term flows than we saw all last quarter. So it's been relatively a good month for us.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's terrific. And then a follow-up to Ken's question, I know that with Woodford, you guys didn't have some of the protections like non-compete and such agreements. The assumption would be that you guys learned from that with Mark Barnell -- Barnett, excuse me. Is that a right -- is that correct?","Martin L. Flanagan","I don't think so, no. And again, it's -- everybody has terms of employment, in the U.K. in particular, and it has the traditional, what would you say, things that are in place generally. So -- and again, it is a free world. So we're very happy to be successful going forward with the depth and breadth of the team that we have. So we think we're very well placed.","Operator","Your next question comes from Roger Freeman, Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one more on Woodford. I think, Martin, you touched on this and pointed people to look at the sort of the departure date in thinking about when the -- maybe the bulk of the flows could come out, if they do. In another case, it seems like we've seen, I guess, a tail on that, even a couple of quarters beyond. And I'm wondering, because you kind of have a transition taking place over, call it, a 6-month period before, whether maybe that mitigates the potential tail effect.","Martin L. Flanagan","Good question. I mean, here's the reality: The reality is, and I said this previously, there's 2 types of outcomes, right, that you've seen traditionally when there's change. It's sort of unplanned, unpleasant departures, and that usually -- no one does well. The clients don't do the well, the organizations don't do well and, hopefully, the individuals don't either. This, we think, is very, very different. It has been a plan that's been in place for a very long period of time. We are executing that plan over what is many, many months. And what is happening is what we would hope happen, and that you are seeing -- Neil had a great 25-year track record but also overshadowed the depth and breadth of the team. And I understand that from growing up -- working for Sir John Templeton. They are big trees. And the truth is there's a lot of talent underneath there, and that's what's happening. And the point of having a long transition is to have the marketplace fully recognize the depth and breadth of the talent. And Mark and the team are being very -- recognized very, very nicely for well-deserved recognition in their depth and history. So the reality is we don't know, right? And I think importantly, we're doing all the right things to do good things for our clients. And if you do that, you get better outcomes than you might have otherwise. So again, we wish we could be specific. The truth is we just don't know.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, fully understood. And then, I guess, Marty, on the U.S. retail sort of brand recognition. You mentioned being sort of ninth or 10th. Correct me if I'm wrong, it seems like you've sort of been around that level maybe a year, 1.5 years now. And you've said that in the past, the hardest part is kind of moving up in that top 10. And I hear you say you'd like to move up couple of few rungs higher. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about in terms of maybe a timeframe. And does that come at a much higher sort of advertising expense?","Martin L. Flanagan","Good question. So we -- as I said, we went from -- you couldn't find us on the list, moving to 10 and sort of 9, sort of right on the cusp. It doesn't look -- we're going to stay on the path we're on, right? It is really driven by investment reputation and client engagement and we're doing all those types of things. And again, from my prior experience, it just takes longer than you would think, reality would suggest. And what I do know is if you go to the leadership of the distribution partners, we're very, very strongly placed and recognized as a very, very important partner because of what we're doing for their clients. Yes, it's harder when you get to tens of thousands of FAs throughout the country, and that's what takes it longer. So it's really just going to -- more of the same, keep working, keep doing a good job, keep generating good performance, keep generating -- taking care of clients and the range of product. And we'll push it up a few more notches. So -- but it should not be -- we're going to stay on the track that we're on spending-wise.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, got it. And, Loren, just quickly, I heard you mentioned sort of new product costs a couple of times, running through the numbers earlier. Just wondering, thinking about it on a sort of a full year basis, how do you think new product costs, say, 2014 versus 2013? I'm just trying to get a gauge for the significance of the new launches this year, given you're calling some of that stuff out.","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I mean, I think it was rather exceptional in terms of what we did this fourth quarter. And so normally, they get spread out. And -- but I think just the sheer number was also somewhat extraordinary. So in terms of the G&A impact, we sort of guided, I think, to a number that should be a little bit lower than sort of backing out the extraordinary amount in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Berg, RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to start with the situation in the U.K. and I wanted to sort of sharpen and make sure I have the right understanding about how you're characterizing the December quarter results. Are you saying that the $4.8 billion outflow net is encouraging, consistent with your expectations? Are you saying that it's discouraging, but that you're doing so well elsewhere that on balance you're pleased with the results out of EMEA? Just I want to make sure I understand your characterization of that $4.8 billion number, because 10% for a situation in which the manager hasn't left yet does seem like a lot.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So let me -- we are extraordinarily encouraged with the results in EMEA. We're extraordinarily encouraged by the results x U.K. equity income. We would think that a 10% redemption is not that extraordinary considering the history and the reputation of Neil and that it was not anticipated in the market. So that's how I would characterize it.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Switching gears to your global equity business. While you did have positive flows in your global equity business, it looks like company-wide, the flows were on a net basis $1.5 billion. It also looks like if one subtracts out the effect of the passive equity business, that sort of your active equity business was actually in outflow mode. Now maybe that's reflecting what's happening in the U.K., maybe not. But I would have thought that given the strength of your performance in your equity business and given the general renewed interest in common stock investing by bulk institutions and individuals that you would have enjoyed positive flows to your equity business.","Loren M. Starr","Right. So Eric, I would say, I think you've answered your own question in a sense. If you add back the $4.8 billion associated with the impact on equity income, that would give you a different result, one that would be more in line with what we're talking about.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right. And lastly, as you think about what's happening in fixed income and the assuming growing interest -- sorry, growing interest in equities, decreasing interest in fixed income because of what's -- or traditional fixed income because of what's happening in the interest rate environment, do you perceive a difference in the way that institutions versus individuals are behaving in response to this increase in interest rates?","Martin L. Flanagan","It's a very good question. I'd say, what are we seeing in all of us, right? So the declaration of great rotation really has not happened. There's been some movement to risk on assets. You would think over time if -- in a rising interest rate environment, it's really traditional fixed income that's going to be under the most pressure of that subsector. And what we ourselves compare -- retail investors, we saw much risk on appetite. And as we talked about earlier, there's a little bit from -- because we saw risk parity into equities in particular, we think that's frankly a good sign. Contrary to that, and again it's plan by plan sponsor, they are continuing to be in a risk-off mode. And so you could understand, if you have closed your underfunded gap why you would do that. To have an underfunded pension plan and to be in risk-off mode, I just don't understand, but that continues to be the case. So I would say institutionally, you're still seeing much more of a focus on low volatility, alternative-type capabilities, fixed income, multi-credit, those types of things. But again, there are many, many, many pension plans that are deeply underfunded, and not to be having equity exposure, quite frankly, is surprising to me. But that is what you're seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Shutler, William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","If we -- one question on the U.K. and then Asia. So on the U.K., you had about $4 billion of net outflows but growth sales are actually very consistent with the rest of the year. So I was hoping maybe you could talk about that dynamic. So is the consistency in the growth sales a function of equity income continuing to see consistent sales since October 15? Or have other products been picking up that slack?","Loren M. Starr","Well, I think there are some other products that are picking up the slack. The global equity product in the U.K. has been -- really seen a lot of this [ph]. So I would say equity income to sales, it has certainly declined somewhat on equity income but it's not been as big an impact as the redemption, obviously, that we were talking about.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then in Asia, obviously, nice flows there once again. So can you just talk about what products have been most successful there? I'm assuming it's helping mix of alternatives and maybe some others.","Loren M. Starr","Absolutely, exactly. We've seen bank loans. We've seen real estate and equities as well. So all those 3 are probably represent 90% of what we're seeing there.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","All right. And if you don't mind, if I could sneak one more in here on the Edinburgh Trust contract. Is there anything more you can say about the specifics of how that contract may differ now versus the old terms?","Loren M. Starr","I think that's public information. So it is essentially a -- there's a reduction of the management fee of 5 basis points. And going forward, there'll be no performance fees other than in Q1 where there's a reduction of about, I think, GBP 7.4 million off of what otherwise would have been paid. So that's the, I think, the bottom line on changes there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Lee, KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I appreciate your patience with the long lineup of questions. Just question on the ETF business, which, I guess, to Marty's point, people, I guess, maybe it seems forgotten a little bit lately, but it's been doing pretty well. But can you give us some update on how that's progressing outside the U.S.? I know that had been a priority for a while, and maybe it hadn't lived up to your hopes or expectations. I mean, so are you starting to see more traction with that business outside the U.S? Or is it still pretty much -- that's being driven by the success in the U.S.?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So U.S. is a driver, no question about it. Canada has also been really quite strong. What also gets hidden, though, is that it's frankly hard to track. Institutions from around the world buy the U.S.-listed ETFs, right? So we have investors from, frankly, almost 150 countries in the ETF business in the U.S. listings. And so the non-U.S. is broader than you would expect. But let me be specific to your question. So a number of years ago, we started an effort on the continent. The continent has become a very complicated place, as they have to serve the ETF. The environment is changing very, very much. We still look at that as an opportunity, and it just needs to settle down from its evolution. And so we are looking that as -- we've not given up. We just, as we're talking earlier, you want to focus on places where you can make a difference. We thought it was too unsettled to try to drive that forward in that change, but we think that will be an opportunity for us also. Asia is an opportunity. But again, not to the same degree as Continental Europe. But again, the lion's share of the activity is the U.S., as far as what we see.","Loren M. Starr","I think the other thing I would just say is -- and part of it is our focus on ETFs had been in the smart beta and specific access and some of the interest on these ETFs and some of -- outside of the U.S. have been more focused on traditional cap-weighted product. And so we didn't really have a product that maybe was understood or accepted. I'd say that is shifting rapidly and that we're seeing more and more interest in understanding some of the smart beta products. And so again, I think in terms of the demand in the market, it is opening up to us. But we were sort of a little bit early, I would say, when we first entered. So it was not a product that was in demand or understood.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Maybe as a follow-up question, I don't know how you would specifically track this. But do you have a sense of how much -- when you talk about U.S. retail, how much of the improved traction there or how much of the flows to your ETF products are being driven by your greater penetration of the U.S. retail market through your various platform relationships or wholesaling relationships that you wouldn't think of that like a wholesaler is not maybe going to write a ticket on the ETF or maybe he does? But how are you -- how is that translating into better ETF flows, your better U.S. retail distribution.","Martin L. Flanagan","That's a very good question and sort of fundamental to our business. So when we bought it, what we thought, it was interesting and somewhat unique. It was -- that was focused on U.S. retail business. And we saw an evolution in the financial advisor channel more to comprehensive plans for their clients, whether it be a combination of sort of -- think of core equity products or balanced risk product at the core and people using things like ETFs around it. And that has proven to be true. So our strength is in the retail market and in the United States, and that is not traditionally where the ETF business has come from. And it is no question self-reinforcing our traditional retail business with the ETFs and mutual funds ETFs and, frankly, UITs. So the combination thereof is really, really strong for us. And it gets to the prior question you're talking about, when you leave the United States, quite frankly, it's not a retail market; it's much more an institutional market. And so where we went to Europe with the idea that it would also evolve as a retail market. We were, quite frankly, too early in that development.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Great. And maybe one last kind of broad industry question, Marty. The OFR put out that piece a few months back and seems like there's been a lot of back and forth between the SEC and the FSOC. So I'm just kind of -- maybe your take from your conversations with whether it's powers that be in Washington and elsewhere, kind of what's your take and how you see this thing kind of evolving over time. And also I'm just curious, to the extent that you are domiciled in Bermuda, does that feel like -- if anything does come down to pipe that provide some level of insulation from some of these things that you've talked about?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So let me start with Bermuda. I think not. I mean, the regulators are interesting, where you might have thought after the crisis, at one level regulation is getting more local. But at another level, it is actually becoming more global at the same time, with the various risks oversight bodies working together. So it is a global topic. But what I would say, just with the first report that came out, I would say -- let me say it this way: The fundamental facts are very different than what the report might have talked about. And I think what you're going to see is the industry do a very, very good job of communicating in a very just clear way with the oversight regulators of what this business is and what it isn't and pointing out that it's not a big risk to the world. That said, we would also say as an industry, where there are areas where we can improve, we're going to improve. And we want to be constructive. And -- but again, I think it's going to be a long conversation, and I think the industry facts are very, very strong.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Irizarry, Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Marty, on IBRA, I'm curious if you have some perspective at the retail level. Are you seeing a portion of the outflows? Are they staying, you think, within the asset allocation category? You mentioned that obviously there's a rotation into risk and you're seeing a pickup in equities. And I'm curious, within the allocation category, it looks like the grosses have come down along with redemptions picking up. And I just sort of want to get perspective on how you view that category and product and building out product within balanced?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So let's see, I'll approach it 2 different ways. As we talked a handful of years ago, when we introduced this, we were very clear, we thought, one, there'd be rally in the equity markets on risk-on, we thought there'd be movement towards equity products, and we saw that and we saw it very much on our complex, as I talked about earlier. So not surprising. We also think, though, January -- just reminding people, there is volatility in the market. And that we look at asset allocation products, in particular low volatility-type products also just that broad range of asset allocation capabilities, it's here to stay and it will more and more be part of retail investors, one of their core holdings going forward. And again, that's back to why we were so focused on making sure that we had our -- start the clock ticking on the track records for the full range of capabilities. So again, I don't think we should extrapolate a quarter into -- or probably January into long-term trends. I personally think asset allocation is here to stay.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 quick ones. Is there any concern -- there's been a lot of retail money going into floating rate funds. Any concern around bank loan capacity in your products?","Martin L. Flanagan","No, we've not had that concern. But what I will say, just very explicitly, the team knows that it's clients first and ensuring that they stay dedicated to investment process. And if they ever feel that there's not enough inventory, they just put their hands up, and we'll stop. But that's not been the point of view as yet.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just real quick on the retail liquid alternative distribution in the U.S. I'm curious, expense-wise, if you're sort of building increment -- devoting incremental resources on the distribution side or if it's leveraging what you have already. And then also from an allocation perspective, where do you expect that those products fit into the portfolio, i.e. where do you think the share is going to come from?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So again, we're utilizing our existing resources, right, so as long as stocking -- that said, there's been over the past -- last couple of years or last year, in particular the new products, lots of effort on training not just internally but also into the retail channel. Probably a governor on absolute growth in alternatives will be really the educational process in the retail channel. So again, I look at this as growing over time, tremendous straight up, which is frankly a very good thing. Sorry, I just forgot the rest of your question. Oh yes, so where is it coming from? So we think very much that what you've seen happen with the asset allocation, some of the things that have been more short-term fixed income capabilities that people have in their portfolio has gone into alternatives. It's also come out of some of the more well, frankly, everywhere. Some of the core fixed income has moved into it because of several low volatility capability. And I think how many firms are positioning to the client is -- think of it as an anchor in your portfolio, and that's probably the predominant way that we're seeing it positioned. And so whatever people thought their anchors were before are being some of the sources for this.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Davitt, Autonomous.","M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP","I just have one question. I think you said last quarter that more than 50% of Perpetual's assets were platform related. We've seen a lot of unbundling announcements in the last few weeks from them. It does look like they're being pretty aggressive in terms of the fees that they want from the managers. How are the discussions going from your end? And do you think that's a meaningful headwind to your fee rate in that business?","Loren M. Starr","Patrick, I'd say, those discussions have been around for a long time and probably will continue in the future. We've been fortunate in terms of our business having really high quality product with super performance. And that relative to others is a very nice moat that prevents too much of that kind of conversation pushing through. I don't want to say it doesn't happen because it does. But we feel that, that is still very much in place. And so I don't think anything's really changed overall in terms of that dialogue. They always are aggressive, and I don't think that's going to stop.","M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP","So essentially, the RDR and unbundling hasn't really affected that pressure. It's not incrementally higher.","Loren M. Starr","Yes. I don't think it has. And again, we have certainly delivered a track record in the past of having excellent value for clients for the fees that we've charged. As long as we can continue to do that, I think we're going to be largely safe from [indiscernible] erosion.","Operator","Your last question comes from Bill Katz, Citi.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just 2 quick follow-ups. Marty, on the ETF side, there seems to be a little bit more interest in the marketplace around nontransparent ETFs. So wondering if you can comment on how vibrant of an opportunity that might be. And then separately, any updated thoughts on money-market reform. We've heard from one of your peers. I'm sort of curious what -- how -- what your bigger perspective might be.","Loren M. Starr","Nontransparent ETFs...","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So again, the nontransparent ETFs, I mean, it's been a conversation along for a while. There seems to be more developments there with New York Stock Exchange also joining the fray. And again, I think the developments may happen. I'd go back to a couple of things. We were early on in launching an active equity ETF, I'm losing track of the years now, but it might be 4 or 5 years ago, and there's -- the level of assets is very low in it.","Loren M. Starr","So it's still the same.","Martin L. Flanagan","Still the same. So it may evolve over time. And with a nontransparent thing, there could be another development. The way that I look at is that we don't have -- there's a place for ETF, there's a place for open-ended mutual funds. And for the vast majority of the active managers, the open-end mutual fund is a very good way to do it. And again, I understand the nontransparent would have -- replicate some of that. But again, that's not why a lot of people buy the ETFs. And I think that's really the core point for my perspective. Now you could see active ETFs evolving more on the fixed income market, that makes more sense to me. But again, I don't view it as the holy grail that some might be thinking right now. And if it evolves to be important, we'll be there. And as regard to money fund reform, I think we're all just sitting tight right now and we suspect an outcome that will be very manageable for the industry.","Again, on behalf of Loren and myself, thank you very, very much for your time, and your questions are very valuable to us. And we will talk to you next quarter. Take care.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for attending.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I'd like the call over to the speakers for today, Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin L. Flanagan","Thank you very much. And thank you, everybody, for joining us today. This is Marty Flanagan, and I am joined by Loren Starr. And we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on the website, if you're so inclined to follow. Today, as is our practice, we'll review the business results for the first quarter, including a discussion regarding the United Kingdom. And then, Loren will go into greater results in the operating results, and we will then open it up to Q&A.","So let me start by hitting the highlights of the firm results during the first quarter. You'll find them on Page 3 of the presentation. Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter, 81% of the active managed assets were ahead of peers over a 3-year period; strong investment performance; a broad first year flows and continued focus on clients contributed to long-term net inflows of $6.5 billion for the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up 18.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. These numbers supported a further improvement in our operating margins to 40.9% versus 40.5% in the prior quarter and 38.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Reflecting continued confidence in the strength and potential of our business, we're raising the quarterly dividend to $0.25, up 11% from 2013.","Assets under management were $787 billion during the first quarter, up from $778 billion in the prior quarter. Operating income was $363 million versus $347 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.60, up from $0.58 in the prior quarter. We also repurchased $120 million of common stock during the quarter, representing 3.6 million shares. And as I mentioned earlier, we are raising our dividend.","Now before I go -- before Loren goes into the details on the company's financial results, let me take a moment to review the investment performance. I'm now on Slide 6. Investment performance during the quarter was strong across the time period. 81% of assets were ahead of peers on a 3-year basis, and 73% of assets were ahead of peers on a 1-year -- over the past year. As we mentioned during the last quarter's call, the relative softness in the 5-year number reflects the rolling off of some very strong numbers in the fourth quarter of 2008 in a brief period where we trailed the market during the low-quality rally in 2009. We expect our 5-year number to demonstrate further improvement over the second and third quarters of this year. As you might expect with numbers like these, the long-term performance of investment teams across the enterprise was really quite strong, with a number of capabilities achieving top [ph] performance.","Turning to flows, on Page 7. You'll see gross sales remained strong during the quarter, nearly doubling gross sales from 2 years ago. In addition, redemptions tapered off, which led to an improvement in net long-term flows. Importantly, gross sales of active AUM for the quarter also nearly doubled results from 2 years ago. As I mentioned, total net long-term flows were $6.5 billion during the quarter. These numbers reflect the broad diversity of flows we saw across our global business during the quarter, which included strength in fixed income, equities, alternatives and ETFs. So obviously, very broad. Gross sales within retail and the institutional channels were quite strong also. Institutional gross sales doubled from 2 years ago and retail sales nearly doubled. The institutional channel saw continued demand in real estate and bank loans, in particular. During the quarter, we were -- there was roughly a $3.5 billion low fee redemption from a single client in one account, which accounts for the lower net flow number.","Gross sales for our retail business remained strong at $19.2 billion for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter. The annualized redemption rate for Invesco remained favorable to the industry. Redemptions also remained steady during the quarter, which resulted in net sales of nearly $3 billion. Flows into the complex were led by strength in our traditional ETFs, U.S. Value and International Growth Equity. We continue to see a diversified mix of sales and moderating outflow picture for ABRA. Our U.S. business has become increasingly diversified. We saw 14 retail mutual funds with net flows of greater than $100 million over the rolling 12-month period ended March 2014, versus 9 funds in that same period during 2012.","Additionally, there were 21 PowerShares traditional ETFs with net flows over $100 million over the rolling 12-month period ending March 2014, versus 12 in that same time period 2012. We feel good about momentum in our business.","We remain confident in our ability to deliver a high level of value to our clients. And we believe the firm is well positioned regardless of where the markets take us.","Before I turn over to Loren for a more in-depth report of quarterly financial results, let me take a few minutes to discuss our positioning in the EMEA region. All of you are aware of 2 recent developments in U.K. business. St. James's Place made a decision to transition approximately $13 billion out of Invesco Perpetual separate accounts, which will impact the second quarter. On Monday, the Financial Conduct Authority confirmed conclusion of its investigation of Invesco Perpetual's compliance with certain FCA rules and principles during the period from May 2008 to November 2012. These issues are historical issues, and the FCA has noted that Invesco Perpetual acted promptly to enhance its systems and controls. We're confident the systems and controls within Invesco Perpetual are now strong, effective and compliant with ethical regulations. The small number of impacted funds were fully reimbursed. This matter has been fully resolved with the FCA and is now closed. The financial penalties were approximately $31 million, will not have a material impact on our business.","We're pleased to have these issues resolved and fully communicated to the market so we can focus further on building our momentum in EMEA. And so, let me spend a few minutes providing some perspective behind our confidence in this business. As you're aware, investment performance of U.K. retail and across the board, our fund range has been very strong and continues to be. Our well-tenured investment management team has been widely recognized in the market. The transition to Mark Barnett has gone very well. With his excellent track record, the market has been extremely receptive to his leadership in the U.K. equity team. And the team is focused on delivering strong, long-term investment performance to our clients. We have a diversified range of highly competitive funds across the franchise, strong organic growth across EMEA, and a very well-recognized brand in the region.","I'm on Page 12, for those that are following. And in particular, Invesco Perpetual has a deep well-tenured investment team that has consistently delivered investment excellence to our clients. We've talked about this in the past, about the team's phenomenal performance. And you can see, during the first quarter, 97% of the assets across that business were above peers on a 3-year basis. The 5-year numbers were impacted by the market's bounce off the bottom in the first part of 2009. Invesco Perpetual trailed in what would have been characterized as a low-quality rally at that time.","The 2 primary strategies impacted for the high income and income equity funds, which represented 35% of our assets under management. Our projections show strong investment performance in both of these portfolios returning by June of this year, potentially achieving 98% of AUM in the top half over a 5-year -- over the 5-year period.","Investment performance for cross-border fund range has also been strong, with 91% of our assets above peers on a 3-year basis and 89% on a 5-year basis. The top 6 cross-border retail funds by growth flows in the first quarter all had top quintile 5-year performance track records with the Pan-European high income fund, Pan-European equity fund. The top 1% and 2 percentiles, respectively. Strong investment performance drove success in our cross-border retail business, which experienced $10 billion in net flows across all of 2013, and approximately $5.1 billion of net inflows during the first quarter of this year. We continue to make progress, further diversifying our EMEA business with a strong net sales into the European equity and fixed income strategies. A key strength of our business across EMEA is the broad and a highly diversified range of capabilities we provide to our clients. The increase in demand for Invesco's European equity, global equity, Asian equity capabilities, together with the GTR fund, has led to a more diversified U.K. retail business.","As you can see on Slide 14, gross sales are meaningfully higher than a year ago, driven by the long track record of a strong investment performance. U.K. retail gross flows continued to increase in the first quarter to $3.6 billion, up approximately 25% over the same period -- same quarter a year ago. Importantly, flows into the funds have been highly diversified reflecting strong performance across the range. In 2009, 80% of gross sales came through 4 products. By the first quarter of this year, 80% of gross sales were driven by 16 products. We have been pleased by the tremendous support we continue to receive from the advisory market. We're seeing this in our sales numbers as well as the conversation we have with the advisors everyday. During the first quarter, we were in first place for gross sales at 2 of the largest platforms in the United Kingdom. Particularly, I'd like to note that investors' response to the recently launched global target -- targeted return fund has been very favorable. Performance since the launch, although recognize it's only 2 quarters, has been excellent and consistent with our expectations of how the strategy would behave in these market conditions. Assets under management in the U.K. and cross-border GTR funds has raised $380 million by the end of March.","As you can see on Slide 15, our cross-border business has experienced tremendous growth due to strong investment performance and increased distribution effectiveness. Gross sales in the fund range have nearly quintupled over the past 3 years. And for us, a broad range of capabilities. A key strength of this part of the business is the diversity of flows we're seeing most recently across fixed income, European equities, global equities, Greater China, Japanese equities and multi-asset. Strong asset sales has helped drive a steady growth in assets under management. Our focus on delivering strong investment performance to clients has helped our cross-border business improve its market share. Over this time, rate had increased it from 2.5% in 2010 to almost 4% this year.","Given our solid investment performance and strong focus on clients, we're optimistic we can continue to grow our EMEA business over time. Assets under management of our EMEA business totaled $178 billion at the end of the first quarter, as you can see on Slide 16. During the first quarter, net flows into EMEA, excluding U.K. equity income, were $6.5 billion, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 21%. As I mentioned earlier, the market has been extremely receptive of Mark Barnett, who has an excellent track record. Mark is supported by the strong Invesco Perpetual investment team in his leadership role for the U.K. equities. As a result, a number of key clients are choosing to stay the course including Edinburgh Investment Trust, which announced that it's retaining Invesco Perpetual as the manager of the trust. We find these results very encouraging. And we'll continue to do everything we can to deliver good outcomes to our clients, retain assets and grow our EMEA business.","As I mentioned, we're very well positioned for long-term success across the U.K. and Continental Europe. First and foremost, our track record of delivering strong investment results to our clients is superb. We have an outstanding winning investment team and highly regarded investment culture. Given the strong investment performance, we are seeing solid demand for a broad range of diversified capabilities, which is supporting a high-level organic growth across EMEA. With some of the key issues resolved in U.K., we're focused on executing our strategy in building on the tremendous momentum across EMEA. With a little cooperation from the markets, we're very confident on our ability to continue delivering for clients across the business.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Loren to speak, in more depth, the financial results. And then, we'll open up to Q&A.","Loren M. Starr","Great. Thank you, Marty. So quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM increased $8.6 billion, or 1.1%. That was driven by positive market returns and FX of $9.5 billion, and long-term net inflows of $6.5 billion. And these increases were partially offset by outflows in money market funds and the QQQs, which amounted to $7.4 billion.","Our average AUM for the quarter was $779.6 billion. That was up 2.4% versus the fourth quarter average. And our net revenue yield came in at 45.6 basis points. That's an increase of 0.6 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The increase was a result of higher performance fees, service and distribution fees and other revenues, which was partially offset by 2 fewer days during the quarter.","And before we discuss operating results, I wanted to provide a brief update on the second quarter flows. Marty already discussed the $13 billion SJP, St. James's Place redemption, that occurred in April after adjusting for the U.K. outflows. I'm happy to say that we continue to see momentum in the rest of our business. Our long-term inflows x U.K. in April were roughly in line with the monthly volumes we saw in the first quarter.","So with that said, let's go to the operating results.","Our net revenues increased $30.5 million, or 2.6% quarter-over-quarter to $887.8 million, and that included a positive FX rate impact of $1.8 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that our investment management fees grew by $6.2 million, or 0.6% to $989 million, and this increase was in line with our higher average AUM after allowing for 2 fewer days in the first quarter. FX increased investment management fees by $0.9 million. Service and distribution revenues were up by $8.5 million, or 3.7%, an increase reflected higher average AUM, again, after allowing for day count as well as a $6.5 million increase in ongoing asset-based service fees. FX increased service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Performance fees came in at 300, I'm sorry, that's a big number, not that big, at $33.6 million, an increase of $22.5 million from Q4. Our performance fees in the first quarter were in fact greater than expected and they were driven by the U.K., which contributed $27.6 million and by our quant [ph] equity bank loan group, which contributed most of the remaining $6 million. FX increased performance fees by $0.8 million in the quarter.","Other revenues in the first quarter were $35.7 million, and that was an increase of $2.4 million versus the prior quarter. The increase was due to higher front-end fees resulting from increased sales activity in Continental Europe. You should note that these front-end fees in Europe are, in fact, passed through to third-party distributors and are netted within our third-party distribution expenses. FX had no impact on other revenues.","Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which can be net against gross revenues, increased by $9.1 million, or 2.3%. This increase was in line with the day count adjusted retail investment management fees, service and distribution revenues and higher front-end fees. FX had no impact on these expenses.","Moving on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $524.8 million increased by $14.7 million, or 2.9% versus Q4. FX had no overall impact on our operating expenses. Our employee comp at $353.1 million increased by $20.8 million. That's 6.3% increase. This was driven by 3 factors. You had higher seasonal payroll taxes, an increase in variable compensation associated with our Q1 performance fees, and also there was a partial impact of base salaries and share-based compensation increases that went into effect on March 1.","FX decreased compensation by $0.2 million. Looking forward, we'd expect compensation to decline by approximate $10 million in the second quarter and then remain flat for the remainder of the year. Importantly, this guidance assumes flat AUM from the end of Q1.","Our marketing expenses decreased by 6.9%, or 22%, to $242 million. FX decreased these expenses by $0.2 million. The marketing expense was in fact lower than we anticipated this quarter. Now as a result of delayed timing of spend, we expect marketing expense to increase by approximately $5 million to $10 million in second quarter, and then level off at a roughly $27 million to $29 million per quarter in the back half of the year.","Property office and technology expense came in at $77.7 million in the first quarter, and that was up $2.8 million. The increase reflected higher outsourced administration costs associated with increased sales activity in Continental Europe as well as continued investment in our technology platforms. FX increased these expenses by $0.1 million. Looking forward, property, office and technology costs will remain around $78 million to $80 million per quarter but may, of course, experience some variability due to sales activity in Europe.","General and administrative expenses came in at $69.8 million. That was down $2 million, or 2.8%. The decrease was due to lower professional services costs related to new product development that occurred in the fourth quarter. FX increased G&A by $0.2 million. We expect our G&A line item to remain around that $68 million to $70 million per quarter level as we look forward.","And then, continuing on down the page, you'll see that our nonoperating income increased slightly $0.4 million compared to the fourth quarter. And the firm's effective tax rate on pre-adjusted net income in Q1 came in at 27%. This increase in the tax rate quarter-over-quarter was due to a onetime 0.8 percentage point increase resulting from new tax legislation enacted in the New York State in the quarter. Looking forward, we expect the effective tax rate to remain between 26% to 27%, which leads us to EPS at $0.60 and our adjusted net operating margin of 40.9%.","And with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Marty.","Martin L. Flanagan","Thank you, Loren. So we'll open up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bill Katz from Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Appreciate the extra color for core trends into April. I just wonder if we could back up and just focus on the U.K. footprint for a moment. I guess, there have been a couple more portfolio managers that have announced they're leaving to go join with Woodford. So maybe the broader question is, what's been the general reaction into April, particularly given the big outflow out of St. James, for retail at large? And then, just tactfully, what are you doing here to stem any kind of further PM turnover?","Martin L. Flanagan","Thanks, Bill. So again, as I've mentioned earlier, I think the main thing to look at is what's the reaction is. You look at -- let the numbers talk, right? So it's been known for a good long time that Neil would be leaving, and gross flows, sales are up 25% year-over-year. You look at the diversity of the flows, it just gets stronger and stronger. So that's really important. And also, again, just during the first quarter and sort of the continued feedback we get is very strong from the advice channel. And as I said, we actually had the highest place in gross sales in the 2 largest platforms during the quarter in the United Kingdom. So those are all very strong, I think, leading indicators of where we're going to go. And with regard to the 3 individuals that left, we actually anticipated that these individuals might leave. They were junior people. They were not long-tenured and, importantly, they were not contributor to Mark Barnett's excellent long-term track record. And only one of them managed money, and his responsibilities have been assumed by an individual who works very closely with Mark and the core team. And Mark has been building out his support team. And since the start of the year, he's added 3 highly regarded individuals with strong backgrounds. So we view these departures as very manageable and, as I said, they were not fully -- we somewhat anticipated these.","Loren M. Starr","And, Bill, just specifically in terms of the equity income. Other than the SJP announcement, it's been no different trend than what we've been seeing, generally pretty muted response. I mean, still outflow. But not anything that is sort of spiking up or doing anything different.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, it's helpful. And just one follow-up, Loren. There are a lot of moving parts. Your guidance is helpful. But when you think about flows coming in versus what's going out, looks like it's pretty high incremental margin year-on-year in the quarter. But how do you think about incremental margins? Maybe, what sort of a reasonable range of expectation here?","Loren M. Starr","Well, I think we're still sort of in that -- sort of roughly 60% incremental margin range that we've been. If markets are strong, it would be moving up probably to 65%, and perhaps higher. Submarkets, we've said sort of 55% to 60% was the right range for you to be thinking about. And we think 60% is probably a good place to focus.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Worthington, JPMC.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to maybe dig into EMEA a little bit. So what has led to the big improvement that you've been seeing here? Basically, sales have been accelerating at a really rapid pace over the last 12 months. We'd thought that this might be a transition from fixed income to equity, but your fixed income EMEA business is doing well. So I guess the question is, if performance has been good for a while, what's really changed again in the last 12 months?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So thanks for the question, Ken, because you probably won't remember. But if you go back to -- when these conversations by almost 3 years ago, we told everybody that we really wanted to make a difference in a cross-border market. Europe was going to be a focus of ours, and it has been a broad, deep effort over the last 3 years. And what that included was looking at the range of products we had available. There's been a pretty broad revamp of those products. The performance had been very, very strong. We actually redid the servicing model to drive service levels up for clients. And also, a much greater focus on the improvement of our distribution capabilities and how effective we were. And so, it's 3 years of effort that starts to show up in the last 12 months, which is very typical. It's just hard to have that all come together. And as I said, we've been in that region for a long time. We were not happy with where we were. And we'd still say, as we look over the next 3 years, we look to just continue to get stronger in that market.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Any specifics you can give us in terms of the expansion of the sales force for the cross-border products?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. I don't have those specific numbers. But what I would say, this might be sort of boring to you, but it's really taking sort of the best practices that we have in different parts of the world and taking them to Continental Europe and just being much more effective and thoughtful on how we execute with our clients. So there's been a tremendous amount of effort there, but I don't have the specific change in wholesalers, et cetera.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, maybe, Loren, for you. In terms of performance fees, why were they better than you had guided to? I had thought that the majority of performance fees in the U.K. really came from the Edinburgh Trust. And I thought that was restructured when they kind of renewed their contract with you. So if you could just help us with some of the details there.","Loren M. Starr","Yes. Absolutely, Ken. So -- of the performance fees, the $33.6 million, $27.6 million were related to the U.K., $13 million was specifically related to the Edinburgh Trust. And so, that was the part that I would say would not recur. There's about $20 million that is the rest of it. And $14 million of that came from, actually, a fund that Mark Barnett -- close to $14 million of that came from a fund that Mark Barnett himself manages. So it is, again, one of these things that, that performance to that other fund that showed up was very, very good and better than we had anticipated, and showed up as a performance fee that was not in our original forecast. So hopefully that's helpful.","Operator","The next question is from Daniel Fannon from Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, just -- we have the expense guidance, but just generally speaking, given your outlook for what we -- or you're seeing in April in terms of flows and thinking about the fee rate and then kind of the margin outlook as you kind of progress through this year and some of those headwinds and some of the markets are flat, just based on kind of where demand trends are. How should we think about that?","Loren M. Starr","I mean -- so I think in terms about the thing on margin outlook, we talked about incremental margin, roughly 60%. So certainly, we expect to continue to grow organically. And we've been seeing good strong growth. Obviously, the reality is we do have an outflow that's known in the second quarter, $13 million -- billion that is going to take our average assets down. But the good news is, we're seeing offsets to that through growth in Europe and elsewhere. So for us, even though we've had some benefit of market, we're obviously balancing that against the known outflow. So we think the 60% incremental margin for this year target is probably a good place for analysts to put in their models.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And your comments about April in comparison to first Q -- 1Q, should we just assume that kind of the inflow trends were pretty consistent throughout the first quarter to kind of get a sense of kind of the other segment of your business in April?","Loren M. Starr","I mean, roughly, yes. I mean, obviously, things shift around a bit. But yes, I mean, the things that have been flowing strongly, or continue the strong -- strongly flow like bank loans, real estate, some of the Pan-European equity, some of the bond funds in Europe as well. So those are definitely still providing us the lift in April.","Operator","The next question is from Brennan Hawken, UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So net flow number for active was really solid. Do you guys have insights into what drove the incremental increase in redemptions? Is there anything behind there? Maybe, could you help us understand?","Loren M. Starr","Well, we had the one large redemption that Marty talked about, the single account, $3.5 billion low fee. That was an active mandate that was definitely a hit to the active...","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So that was active, but low fee.","Loren M. Starr","Correct.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Oh, I see. Okay. And then, when we think about ABRA, I think you guys highlighted that outflows moderated here in the quarter. This is -- it seemed like a good quarter for ABRA given you guys have highlighted it as a conservative strategy. And we saw some volatility here in the quarter. Is what you experience here this quarter in improving on, maybe some color on the sales versus redemptions, did you see increasing interest on that product given what we saw in the markets?","Martin L. Flanagan","Let me make a couple of comments, and Loren can get more specific. So the good news about sort of volatility year-to-date is that people remember why ABRA was important part of their portfolio, and that has been an important reason for the slowdown in the outflows. I think, also, realizing that in a retail market, the peer groups are really sort of the hodgepodge. But when you look at risk parity, it is a very, very strongly performing capability. And where there interest continued was in the institutional market. And so, again, as we've always said, sort of more challenging markets, you'll see people focus on ABRA. But in a rising equity market, individuals will go to equity capabilities. And we saw that change. And so, again, I think it's a very good product, positioned very strongly, and is being understood that way in the marketplace.","Loren M. Starr","Yes. And I'd say, generally, the level of redemptions has moderated. So it's certainly been helpful.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I guess, where sales...","Loren M. Starr","The level of redemption -- yes, I think sales have been stable and the biggest change has been just lower redemption rate.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Terrific. And then, last one for me. So we heard about reports about Woodford's new fund getting delayed. And I was hoping maybe you guys could help me think about it because I'm not -- I'm struggling whether or not that's a positive for you guys or negative because if it delays, it drags the whole process out. But it gives you guys more time with clients, maybe an opportunity to show better results and keep more AUMs. So how do you guys think about that?","Martin L. Flanagan","Actually, we don't think about it. So the reality is he went from a colleague to now a competitor as of May 1. And we compete with some very talented organizations that have been in the market for decades with enormous resources. And we're going to do just fine. And I think that's what we showed. And I think, really to your point, I think the bigger institutional or single-trigger mandates, we think we're largely through that. I mean, I think the way you should be thinking about this is post second quarter, the toughest stuff is behind us. So I think that's really how we should be thinking about it.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Kim, Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So, Marty, first, just sort of a big picture question. Just being curious to get your take on how you see the underlying mix of the franchise evolving over time from a geographic standpoint. Clearly, momentum continues to build in Europe and Asia. And the U.K. business x Woodford continues to really strengthen. But at the same time, I would imagine the U.S. retail business is picking up, just assuming investors continue to move up the risk curve. So just taking all those things together, what does your footprint look like a couple of years down the road? And what might be the implications for sort of economics of the business?","Martin L. Flanagan","Very good question. So maybe up within the context of what we talked about in the past. So one bigger thought was we wanted to do much better in the United States a number of years ago when we had these conversations. We are starting to do that. We are strongly, strongly positioned here. And we would anticipate with the performance in our certain clients from distribution service levels. We would just look for the U.S. business to continue to strengthen. We did point out 3 years ago that we wanted to be much stronger on the continent, and we are showing that result. I'd still say we're third inning, using the baseball analogy, of where we should get to. One of the strongest parts of the business, quite frankly, is our position in Greater China. And it's -- I think there are some people who have a macro view that China is a headwind. That maybe the case in the short term, but when we look out 3 to 5 years, it is a force. And we could not be more better positioned into that. And then, if you look at, again, maybe some -- what's happening within the marketplace. Our ETF business goes from strength to strength. And we would continue to see that as a big contributor. And I think, also, importantly -- and again, you've asked this. Looking for out 3 years it is very clear to us that the advice channel, retail advice channel is focusing much more on outcomes for their clients. And with that evolution there, looking at a much broader range of investment capabilities, and I just want to say it's, historically, equity, fixed income. Clients are seeking lower volatility. They want some inflation production and all these different types of things. So what you saw from us at the end of last year, in particular, and here, was the introduction in the United States of arguably the broadest range of liquid alternative capabilities that will complement very much our traditional asset classes and focus on this evolution in the advice channel, which is not dissimilar to what the institutional market has done. That focus is not limited for us to the United States. We're taking that approach in the U.K., on the continent. And Asia is coming on also with it's just more complicated to get to the market there. So we think we're positioned for where the market is going, looking out 3 years. And again, I think you just have to look at the depth and breadth of the investment capabilities and the performance. This is very strong. And we'd supportive of strength for the next 3 years.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up on ABRA. You touched on this earlier, but just curious to get an update on maybe where you stand in terms of marketing those strategies into the institutional or the non-U.S. channels. Just trying to think about the growth opportunities and where you are in that process.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So remember, ABRA actually started in institutional market. And it was really the phenomenon that -- it was accepted strongly in the retail market. Where the more recent flows have been a continuation in the institutional market with ABRA. It is available in the United Kingdom, it is a great complement to the GTR fund. And it is also been in the SICAF lineup. And again, it's also being received very well. It is a more complicated product in Asia just because of the regulators' aversion to derivatives. So -- but for Asia, we think it's positioned really quite well for the long term.","Operator","The next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous.","M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP","We all kind of -- we're aware, obviously, of the sleeve of SGP's mandate that was with Woodford fund, but I think everybody was a little surprised by the big slug[ph] that was moved to Threadneedle. Have you guys gotten any more color on what drove that decision? And whether it's performance issues or price issues or just something else?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. I don't have really any more feedback than really the question you're asking. It was a much larger switch than what we had thought the performance of equity. All the capabilities was very, very strong. There had been a review or the balance mandate, and that was really probably the outcome. So some more strategic view that they were taking. And yes, how to have that managed than anything else. That said, we feel very strongly that we would have done an exceptional job, but there was opposition. So...","M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay. That's helpful. And then, in PowerShares, a broader question, I guess, around operating leverage and contribution to the whole. You've obviously seen nice expansion of the breadth of flow there, away from QQQ. I'm curious if you kind of have an idea of what the non-QQQ AUM level is for that business to really -- or you really feel like you're at a scale that the operating margin -- or operating leverage really kicks in there?","Loren M. Starr","And so, Patrick, I think we arrived at that level already. We're seeing significant flows -- continued significant flows into our traditional PowerShares AUM. And so, in aggregate, we are sort of -- we came at exactly like $40 billion, at least $50 billion, probably $50 billion of AUM in our traditional PowerShares. And because the fee rate on those products are higher than the so-called term market cap-weighted type of index, which tends to be 10, 12 basis points, while we are in the 35 to 40 basis points average. We're absolutely at scale now. And the contributions are significant in terms of helping our margins expand as that asset base grows.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Harris, Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Another follow-up on Europe. Just wondering if this region, we know has been performing really well, flow has been great. I imagine it's high fee relative to other parts of Invesco. But how should we think about this region in terms of incremental margin? I know you gave 60% guidance for the firm overall, but would you say that this particular region has -- is maybe higher incremental margin than the firm on average? Or is it a little bit more complicated than that?","Loren M. Starr","I mean -- I think, obviously, it's growing faster, which is great. And it's achieving significant scale to that growth. The fee rates in Europe tend to be higher. And so, I'd say, generally, it's at the high end of that range. And because they tend to be, again, assets that are managed through existing teams, pretty good strong operating leverage. So I don't want to get into specifics in terms of saying where it is, but it certainly is operating at probably at the higher end of the range of operating leverage for us.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, excellent. And then, just a quick follow-up on maybe capital management plans. Just kind of wondering what your appetite is now for incremental buybacks especially now that St. James is kind of leaving. Maybe, how do you think about that relative to perhaps the overall level of the market? Somebody, your peers, haven't been buying as much stock back as we would have thought. And I think there's been some pause due to where the market is trading right now. And so, I don't know, does that enter in your thought process at all? Maybe just a little bit more color on that would be helpful.","Loren M. Starr","I mean, certainly, the opportunities for us to purchase our shares at a what we will see is a discount because of people's reaction to current news is always attractive. I mean, generally, I'd say, our position around capital management is based on our policy or philosophy around capital which is, first, we're going to use our cash to feed our organic needs. Then we, obviously, are supporting an ongoing ever-increasing dividends. And what's left over is available for buybacks. And certainly, we're seen as we're growing more opportunity to return capital to shareholders. And that's, obviously, sort of seen in our dividend -- continued dividend growth. So I'd say, generally, our opportunity to continue to return capital, we think, is growing. We've not seen any real great opportunities nor do we have a strong strategic need to do acquisitions, which we've talked about. So that takes that off the table. And we certainly have locked in our debt levels by going out long. So we're not into any process to delever. So barring any other thing, any other initiatives, we're well positioned for more capital return. We still are working to achieve our goals to maintain sufficient cash on our balance sheet to give us ultimately what we're looking for to target financial flexibility. We've not quite achieved those levels yet. And again, I think the only thing in the backdrop is the continued discussion -- regulatory discussions around capital requirements for financial institutions and, specifically, asset managers is something that we're paying attention to as it might have some impact on our thinking around capital management.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question. Just on the one institutional redemption. Just curious if you had any color on asset class, like bucket or region?","Loren M. Starr","It was equity. Equity and it's in Asia Pacific.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, all right. So I guess, when I step back and I look at the retail number that you guys reported, and I look at the organic growth in retail. It's coming in at 6% or so. And I think if you adjust for the U.K. stuff, it's even higher than that. It just seems like it's a very strong number relative to what we've seen in the industry, particularly this quarter. And I know you mentioned Europe being strong outside the U.K. and the cross-border in the U.S. But I guess, does anything really stand out when you look across the products or the regions? And I know, Marty, if we look over the past couple of years since you did the [indiscernible] in the U.S. and investing in distribution here, and then doing the same thing on the cross-border, like there's been a lot of investment to drive the growth. It seems like that, that level is a lot better just given the volatility that was on the market. So I'm just curious, it was all that kind of playing out, or if there is anything specific that really drove it this quarter?","Martin L. Flanagan","I'd say 8 years later it's an overnight success. I mean, I think you're on the core of it. I mean, we have been absolutely focused to build an independent global asset management with a diverse range of investment capability to meet client needs. And I know that sounds so simple. But if you have to look underneath, and it's really the diversity of that flows, by region, by channel, by asset class, is really the fundamental strength. And where we have had -- we have some big holes to address. And we think we've really addressed them. And we think we're in a position that we're going to continue to do well through really almost any market cycle. Obviously, some are going to be more favorable than not. And I'd still say, when we get the more of an equity tailwind we are extremely well positioned for that.","Loren M. Starr","And one other thing I'll just mention is, I mean, obviously, we have great opportunity in Europe and in Asia Pac as well as in the U.S. But when you're large in a particular location, it's hard to grow organically consistently at a high level. But we're still, I would say, well positioned. The opportunity for us to grow outside the U.S. is enormous. And so, we think, in terms of our ability to grow really more quickly, it's probably more likely to happen outside the U.S. than in the U.S. And we have, obviously, have a great position there.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up. I guess, just any clarity or guidance, I guess, on a few items. So performance fees, obviously, that'll come down. But just anything that we should be thinking about in the second or third quarter from a more seasonal versus the others. And then, same thing in the other expenses. Obviously, I know it's extremely volatile. And then, just on the institutional outlook. Just given that redemption, when you look at the pipeline, whether it's on the real estate, the alternative fixed income side, can you see any color there?","Loren M. Starr","So in terms of performance fees, I would say the step down will take place in the second quarter and third quarter relative to the first quarter because we don't have the U.K. trusts kicking in. But we've fairly been able to generate a reasonable amount of fees from bank loan products and real estate products and other products in Asia. So again, very hard to predict. But I do think sort of more in line with the $5 million level is probably more realistic. I mean, there's always the opportunity to do something bigger depending on if a particular fund kind of hits the target. And so, but those are difficult for me to ultimately predict. And so, I would just sort of suggest think about the $5 million level as sort of a general performance fee place holder for the next couple of quarters. And then, on other revenues, once again, I think probably we had a good quarter in other revenues. It may drift down a little bit into future quarters, but nothing material I think in terms of major changes there. And then, finally, on institutional flows and pipeline. I think we certainly have seen the SJP come and announce. That one's gone. Beyond that, the pipeline looks good. We see continued strong interest in our products, and our fee activity is high. So again, we feel pretty good, pretty confident that the institutional picture is going to improve. And certainly, we don't have any sort of large sort of Asia-esque kind of that particular outflow we talked about, the $3.5 billion. There's nothing like that on our future that we'll be worried about.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Lee, KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess I have a question. You mentioned the press release taking some actions in some business...","Martin L. Flanagan","Robert, you're breaking up. Can you speak in the phone?","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","In the press release, you've talked about some business optimization initiatives took some charges. Could you maybe flush that out a little bit? Should we be expecting more of that? And kind of how should we think about that kind of impacting the margins going forward? I mean, do you have a specific type of cost-savings initiatives or objectives out of those initiatives?","Loren M. Starr","So -- well, I'm happy to answer that. So it wasn't initiative. There isn't anything like that, that you should expect going forward. This is something we've been sort of planning, thinking about for some time. It really, as you can imagine, we have a lot of offices in many different countries. And our footprint is somewhat tied to actions taken 10 years ago when we might have put a lease in place. And ultimately, the firm continues to evolve and change. And one perfect example would be as we continue to leverage our Hyderabad office more, we're adding more space there, continue to grow that. And some of the other areas where we might have been doing some of the activity that we expect will be done in India is shifting too. So basically, this was a cleanup that allowed us to sort of align our \"who's doing what, where\" better. And so, a lot of the colors, so to speak, I mean, was around other shared service office where we had something in Dublin, for example. That was -- we vacated some of the space there. So we are using more space in Hyderabad.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Great. And maybe the follow-up to -- if I think about the revamping of really the whole business in the last 7 or 8 years, whether it's distribution or infrastructure or products, I'm just curious how you're thinking about product pricing as maybe evolved. I mean, for example, you had a large product, a large account leave in your last quarter, $3 billion of assets but low fee. If you were -- if you're sitting where you are today, is that the kind of account you would take on today if there was a very low fee structure? I mean, how you've kind of thought about -- or change you're thinking about willingness to take on large low fee mandates?","Martin L. Flanagan","It's a good question. And I think you have to start by what is the asset class, right? So we feel we're in a position right now that we've highly competitive teams with real talent. And we, frankly, do look at capacity of teams. And if you have a high-performing team and there's limited capacity and somebody wants us to enter something below market, we're just not going to do it. And again, that you only get to that position by a strong investment performance and the like. And we're just really focused on total alignment with the clients. And it should be fair for both parties because mostly, if it's not, you get bad outcomes. And so, we just think we're just -- we're very systematic in how we think about pricing and capacity and the team's ability to manage money. And so, for example, they say we can't manage any more money. Then, we just stop. So you just really have to be quite focused. I think that's really the main theme that we would say.","Loren M. Starr","Yes. And again, I think if you -- I mean, fairly, even though it's low fee, it doesn't mean it's bad business. So I don't mean to indicate low fee is bad business and -- I mean, you can get scale in a particular account or a particular asset class. It very well may be the smart and economically correct thing to do to do that. We do look at that. We do have a discipline around that. So again, I think we do it pretty well.","Operator","The next question comes from Luke Montgomery from Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a quick one on the operating margin. How might we think about adjusting for the performance fees? And maybe you can remind me what the comp ratio is against those fees. And then, assuming a lower level of fees, would your margin have actually been sequentially higher this quarter?","Loren M. Starr","All right. So on the performance fees, I mean, the only thing I would say, I'll repeat. There's about $13 million in this quarter that's nonrecurring. I mean, it's probably going to go away. So of the $27.6 million, I would expect $13 million to not be there. And then, on comp base, it really varies from location to location and team to team. And so, I don't think it's a great sort of practice for us to sort of go in and talk about what the comp ratios are for each performance fee. So if it's okay, I'll probably just beg off on that one.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Fair enough. And then, I just want to make sure I understand you correctly. Between Edinburgh Trust and St. James, we can conclude that pretty much all the Woodford institutional money is that experienced redemption, or have been renegotiated a lower fee rate. And then, it seems like the commentary on the U.K. business implies retail flows are basically flat in April. So can you confirm just seeing that picture clearly?","Loren M. Starr","So I would say you're largely correct on the institutional side, that pretty much everything big stuff is out. There maybe smaller, small-time kind of thing platforms but, again, marginally that was the big news. In terms of the retail side, we've been in outflow. And so, I think my point was more about we continued to be in outflow in April, but nothing has spiked off. There's been no reaction that's been sort of offered around any news particularly around the FCA announcements that we've seen so far.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then, final one, you've talked a bit in recent quarters about your efforts to increase recognition side, third-party distribution channels, and I'm talking about the U.S. here. I think you've been slightly frustrated about the progress there given your strong performance. So maybe an update on how that's going, and then your general thoughts around the sustainability of distribution advantages? And how those, like yourselves, coming from less strong position, can cope with that?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. It's a good question. I think we continue to work very hard to sort of get the recognition in the United States. And I'd still say, depth, breadth of the organization relative to the performance is still not fully appreciated within the marketplace. And so, we continue to make all the efforts to do that. I think the reality, as we've talked in the past, is it's always frustratingly slow closing that gap. That said, and we're putting our heads down and taking through how best we can close that gap. And frankly, from the sustainability of our distribution positioning, I think it does -- it's the totality of it all, right? It has to start with breadth of capabilities are strongly, consistently performing and I think we've not shown that for any number of years. But you do have to have distribution excellence. And I'd say the quality of our distribution capabilities throughout the organization but in particular in the United States, is up quite dramatically. And we think we're strong as any competitor in the marketplace. How we think about it, how we serve our clients, the breadth of coverage, the value added to the marketplace and, again, I think the competition -- if you don't have the resources to compete on the distribution side, I think you are going to be relegated to a second tier status. As the years continue, it's just getting much more competitive as you know. But we think we're very well placed against that thought.","Operator","The next question is from Marc Irizarry, Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Marty, can you talk a little bit about the institutional business by, I guess, by client domicile? If you look at your gross inflows in institutional, they've stepped-up. I'm curious what asset classes or regions are you seeing the most, the biggest wins there? And is that sort -- are we sort of at a new level just given where you are in terms of your product breadth and your institutional capabilities across regions?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So let me -- I'll pick up on some of that, and then Loren can add. So I think overall theme, pretty much globally, real estate bank loans are -- there's a desire globally. But then, when you start to move into other regions, you can get more specific. On the continent there's an focus where we've seen some big strong mandate wins through our quantitative capabilities. Even things like Japanese equities are very mandated, so we're winning in the continent. And when you go that out to Asia, again, you get bank loans, real estate. But again, global equities is a topic there. Asian equities is a topic there. So it just becomes broader in different asset classes in the different regions. We talked about ABRA as another one that you're seeing institutionally continued to have interest. And probably, not far behind that right now, emerging interest in the GTR capability institutionally, specifically in the United States, in the U.K., and on the continent. And we would imagine probably, in time, in Asia, too. So it is just the broadening of the mandates around the world is a very important element of that.","Loren M. Starr","And the other thing -- I mean, we're also seeing some of alternatives like Commonwealth Transportation Fund. That's funded. So again, it's in the U.S. That's probably more of a U.S. focus thing. Stable value in the U.S. So could vary from location to location.","Operator","Next question is from Eric Berg, RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","[Technical Difficulty] I'll give you a minute to turn to it.","Martin L. Flanagan","I think you got cut off in your first part of your statement. Sorry.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was saying that it would appear that you have remaining in the equity income fund, in the U.K., $44.5 billion. First, can you give me the split between institutional and retail at this juncture?","Loren M. Starr","In equity income, it's, post the departure of SJP, it's like probably 99% retail.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So just -- I really have one question only. Going back to Marty's comment earlier and I'm paraphrasing, that the really tough stuff is behind us. What is the basis for that comment in the sense that we now have approximately $44 billion that includes the $13 billion, right? Is that correct?","Loren M. Starr","No. The $44 billion was the end of Q1. As of April, you got to take the $13 billion out, right? So...","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right. Yes. So the number is now in the neighborhood of $31 billion, virtually all of which is retail. Why is the world -- why is the tough stuff behind us? Why won't there be an enormous struggle for these retail assets?","Martin L. Flanagan","My point, Eric, is that the -- what I said was the large single-trigger asset pools, which tend to be institutional, which tend to move almost immediately. Those decisions have been made. The secondary point that I would say is, we're in a battle every single day with a broad range of competitors that have been in the market for decades that are strongly tenured high-performing money managers, highly resourced, and will continue to do that. And we do that very well. That's my point.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And would you say that the -- last question. Would you say that the loss of assets -- the percentage loss of assets institutionally provides an indication of what will happen on the retail side, or by no means?","Martin L. Flanagan","Say the question, again. I'm sorry.","Eric N.

[Operator Instructions]. Now I would like to turn the call over to the speakers for today, Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. You may now begin.","Loren Starr","This presentation and the comments made in the associated conference call today may include forward-looking statements.

On the call with me today is Loren Starr, Invesco's CFO and we will be speaking from the presentation that's available on the website, if you're so inclined to follow. Today I'll review the business results for the first quarter. Loren will go into greater details of the financials and we will open it up to questions. So let me begin by highlighting the Firm's operating results for the first quarter which you will find on slide 3. Long term investment performance remained strong during the quarter. 72% and 76% of active managed assets were ahead of peers on a three-and-five-year basis, respectively. ","Strong investment performance and our continued focus on meeting client needs were not enough offset the impact of the volatile markets, particularly in January\/February. Non-institutional and active demand where offset by volatility among retail and passive capabilities which led to long term net outflows of one $1.3 billion during the quarter. Market volatility and net outflows put pressure on the operating margin during the quarter which is 37.5%.","During the quarter we returned $238 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. In addition, reflecting continued confidence in the fundamentals of our business over the long term, we're raising our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share, up 4% from the prior year. Assets under management were $771 billion at the end of the first quarter, down slightly from $775 billion at the end of last year. More indicative of the results during the quarter were the average assets under management which were down $36 billion during the first quarter as compared to $778 billion at year-end.","Operating income was $307 million in the quarter versus $356 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.49 versus $0.58 in the prior quarter. And as noted earlier, we increased the dividend $0.28 per share and also purchased $125 million of stocks during the quarter. Before Loren goes into detail on the Company financials, let me take a moment to review the investment performance and flows during the quarter.","Turning to slide 6 now, you will note investment performance is strong in the quarter with 72% of assets in the top half on a three-year basis and 76% were in the top half on a five-year basis. One year results partially reflect the underperformance of energy and financial sectors earlier in the year which impacted some of our valued portfolios. We've seen both of these sectors begin to recover somewhat in March and April and consequently possibly impacted the performance here to date, in fact with some very strong performance.","On page 7 you will see positive active flows were experienced during the quarter were not as [indiscernible] to passive capabilities. Active flows were driven primarily by alternative capabilities, as we saw strong growth in real estate including both direct and REITs, a global targeted return. Those in the passive capabilities declined during the market volatility in January and February. They recovered in March, but not enough to returned to positive territory for the quarter. It's important to note that although passive flows were negative they were reduced by $1.5 billion of deleveraging from Invesco Mortgage Capital.","As a reminder, there's no revenue impact related to those flows. Again we saw strong institutional flows during the quarter, in spite of the volatility which continues a series of positive institutional flows going back nearly two years. Client demand trends remain consistent, with particular strong interest in fixed-income real estate and GTR. Retail flows were impacted by the macro environment as investors weighed their options during the volatile quarter, despite seeing outflows in many equity mutual funds in the U.S. and EMEA, we saw continued strength in retail alternative capabilities, specifically GTR and real estate securities.","As noted, our global target of assurance capability continues to attract strong flows globally, achieving $2.3 billion in net flows during the quarter across EMEA intuitional, across border, into the UK, retail, Asia-Pacific and North America. Despite some challenges in the first two months of the year, we still feel good about the momentum of our business. Flows in March were much better than January and February and we're experience solid flows in April. We continue to see strength across our global business, in particular within Asia-Pacific and EMEA. Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few words about the new fiduciary rule released by the U.S. Department of Labor in early April. Ultimately, we believe this fiduciary rule is good for investors.","That said, we continue to be concerned about the potential for unintended consequences of a rule that proposes such dramatic changes within the industry. It's well known that many investors are not saving enough to maintain their standard of living during retirement. The DOL Rule, it was intended to ensure that retirement savers get better advice by expanding the types of retirement investment advice covered by the fiduciary protections. We said all along investors are best served by using advisors who can help and assist -- to help and assess their risk tolerance, savings horizons and other factors to develop a portfolio that help them achieve their investment objectives. The key outcome of the new rule could be greater confidence in the advice that investors are receiving. Investors have been through a lot in the last seven years since this national crisis. Anything that builds confidence could encourage them to save more for retirement and seek advice that helps them achieve their investment objectives, that is good for investors and would also benefit the industry as well.","The DOL Rule is long and complex. The rule and its related documents are more than 1000 pages. We're working to understand how our distributor partners are interpreting the rule which will help us support and assist them. We believe the recent acquisition of Jemstep, the market-leading provider of advisor-focused fiducial solutions, opens up further opportunities to provide meaningful support to our clients. As we engage with our clients and seek to understand how they will approach adopting the new rules, we will look, too, for opportunities for Jemstep to assist our distribution partners. We believe that Invesco's very well positioned to our clients as the DOL Rule is implemented. Because Invesco puts our clients first in everything we do and has tremendous experience in addressing regulatory topics, we view this as an opportunity to further deepen our relationship, provide new capabilities that enhance our business.","I would like to turn it over to Loren to review the financials in more detail.","Loren Starr","Thanks, Marty. Quarter-over quarter our total AUM decreased $4.1 million or 0.5% and that was driven by dispositions of $3.6 billion, negative market returns of $3 billion, outflows from the QQQs of $2.6 billion and long term net outflows of $1.3 billion. These are partially offset by inflows from the money market of $3.8 billion and positive FX translation of $2.6 billion. Our average AUM for the first quarter was $747.5 billion which was down 4.6% versus the fourth quarter. Our net revenue yield came in at 43.8 basis points and that was a decrease of 1.4 basis points versus Q4. ","Currency mix reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points. One less day in the period reduced the yield by 0.4 basis points. A decrease in performance fees and other revenues together accounted for the remainder of 0.3 basis points. Now I'm going to turn to the operating results. Our net revenues declined by $68 million or 7.7% quarter-over quarter to $818.1 million which includes the negative FX rate impact of $12.6 million. Within the net revenue number, you will see that investor management fees fell by $78.5 million or 7.8% to $930.3 million. This reflects the lower average AUM, the changes in AUM product and currency mix and one less day during the quarter. FX reduced fourth quarter management fees by $16.1 million.","Service and distribution revenues declined by $9.9 million or 4.8%, reflecting lower average AUM during the quarter. FX decreased service and distribution revenues by $0.2 million. Performance fees came in at $15.5 million in Q1 and they were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.1 million from UK equities. Foreign exchange reduced performance fees by $0.6 million. Other revenues in the first quarter were $24 million. That was a drop of $5 million due to lower transaction fees from real estates, as well as a decline in new IT rollovers. Foreign exchange decreased revenues by $0.1 million. Third-party distribution service and advisory expense which we net against gross revenues, fell by $28.7 million or 7.6% and this movement was in line with lower revenues derived from retail AUM, foreign exchange decreases expenses by $4.4 million.","Moving on down the slide, you will see that our adjusted operating expenses at $511 million decreased by $19.4 million or 3.7%, relative to the prior quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $6.5 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in $340.3 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 0.4%. This was driven by a normal seasonal increase in payroll taxes which was largely offset by a reduction in variable compensation. FX reduced compensation by $4.3 million. Marketing expense decreased $9.2 million or 26.2% to $25.4 million. This drop is due to a lower level of advertising, literature, travel and client events during the quarter. These expenditures were deferred in light of the volatile market conditions that we were in.","Foreign exchange reduced marketing expense by $0.2 million in the quarter. Property, office and technology expenses came in at $81.1 million in the quarter. That was an increase of $0.7 million over the fourth quarter, driven by additional outsource administrative expenses. FX decreased these expenses by $0.9 million. General and administrative expenses at $64.2 million decreased $12.4 million or 16.2%. This decline was the result of focused expense management during the quarter, as nonessential professional services and other nonessential discretionary spending was reduced or postponed. FX decreased G&A by $1.1 million.","Continuing on down the slide, you will see that non-operating income decreased $2.9 million compared to the fourth quarter. Included in the first quarter were non-cash negative marks to March markets on inter-company loans of $7.1 million and $1.4 million on trading investments. These were slightly offset by a $3.4 million gain which was realized on our pound sterling U.S. dollar hedge. Just to remind people, as we've said in the past, we have in place a hedge through the end of Q1 2017 with a strike price of $1.4355. This is the pound hedge that we put in place. The Firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q1 was 26.5%. That was down from 26 6% in the prior quarter which then brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.49 and adjusted net operating margin of 37.5%.","Before I turn things back over to Marty, I just want to provide a quick update on the business optimization work that we began to implement in Q4 of last year. As a reminder, as we stated, we expect to incur up to $85 million in expenses during 2016 related to these activities, with an expected run rate savings, however, of $30 million to $45 million through the beginning of 2017. In the first quarter we incurred $6.8 million of the $85 million in optimization costs. That was primarily in the form of staff severance costs and as previously discussed, these expenses do impact our U.S. GAAP P&L, but they are being excluded from our non-GAAP results.","And also, just to finalize the point, we did generate approximately $2 million in permanent run rate savings in Q1 as a result of the optimization efforts to date which was in line with our plan.","And so with that I'm going to turn it back over to Marty.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you Loren. We will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. First one is from Craig of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Craig Siegenthaler","Can you provide an update on the U.S. equities business? I'm just looking here at slide 18 and looking at some of the performance across some of these capabilities and I just want to see if you maybe have any plan to sort of get some of this performance stronger here?","Martin Flanagan","Good follow-up question. So, that was my point. Actually, if you look at the value portfolios, they have had quite a bit of exposure to energy and financials in particular. And the year-to-date performance actually has been quite stunning and that's really started in the last couple of weeks here, where things like comstock is ninety-percentile, growth and income four percentile, American value three-percentile, so really, really very strong. So strong teams, really do a good job with their philosophies and it is a high conviction approach and yes, the number are coming in really strong.","Craig Siegenthaler","Got it. And then just a follow-up question for Loren. And Loren, I know there's a lot of moving pieces here and it is always tough to anticipate data, but the operating margin's always depressed in the first quarter due to a few items that we all know about. But A1 finished the quarter much stronger and you have those initiatives in place. So I'm wondering, do we have a shot of getting the margin back to the 40% range with stable market share?","Loren Starr","We certainly would hope to see margins improved through the course of the year. Obviously there is a lot of moving parts, lot of volatility, we've got the pound and the currency topics which have been bouncing around a little bit. So I'm not going to put out a number in terms of what I think margins could be. Obviously, the inherent strength of the business is there and as markets stabilize, currency stabilizes, we should continue to see the very positive trend of incremental margins working in our favor to pull up our overall rate and sort of, margin overall. But it will depend ultimately on what the markets do through the rest of the year.","We're, as you know, still at the level of assets below where we were on average for last year and so I would say we're still catching up to where we were last year in terms of overall margin potential.","Martin Flanagan","There is absolutely nothing in the way of us exceeding 40% margins where they were again. And I think that the issue, as Loren sited, it is a timing issue more than anything else with markets. But I think also very importantly, regardless, even though the market has come back some and flows are picking up again, we continue with the optimization programs. And we're going to finish those and again we'll just be net better off because of all of those activities.","Loren Starr","And just to remind people, the optimization program is operating through the course of 2016 and we do not really get to the full run rate benefit until we get to the end of the year which we talked about the $30 million to $45 million potential. We're going to see some continued benefit through the course of this year, but again, $2 million here, $3.5 million, $4.5 million, you know, it's going to kind of begin to scale through the course of the year. But it's still not at a level, I would say that's going to be the most dramatically move the margin picture.","Operator","Next question is from Glenn of Evercore. Sir, your line is now open. ","Glenn Schorr","Two part on the follow-up there, with ending AUM over 3%, better than average and April positive end-year, positive comments on flows. I look at the revenue decline in the quarter, year-on-year and half of that was performance fees. So the first question is if you could talk through what we should expect from here over the progression of the year on performance fees? I know they're tough to predict, but it was half the decline in revenues in the quarter, so I think that might have a big influence on the margin in question.","Loren Starr","So you get to one of my favorite topics, Glenn, predicting performance fees which again, I still will continue to profess, I'm not very able to do that. Generally performance fees are lighter through the last half of the year, their the heaviest in the first quarter and so you sort of see the heavy performance recorded already.","So my expectation of performance fees through the remainder of the year, as I often said, is sort of place-marked, earmarked, when we're thinking about our planning, somewhere around that $5 million a quarter which is an estimate that assumes a lot of different things kicking in across the globe, but no one thing driving it. We would hope to see the other revenue line improve somewhat because the volatility in the first quarter was pretty extreme.","And so as I mentioned, in transaction fees and real estate rollovers, in the UIT business, were really slowed down by that degree of volatility. If we get to a more stable and that's a big if, but if we get to a more stable market environment that line item should be closer to, sort of, that $30 million to $35 million number through each quarter.","Glenn Schorr","And on the expense side, if you look at comp marketing and G&A oil declines, in line with non-performance fees revenue or better, I know this is a softy question, but how much of that is response to the weak revenue environment in 1Q versus more run-rateish type levels?","Loren Starr","So the optimization work is what's going to drive a permanent reduction and so that's stuff, I don't want to say real, but it certainly -- and there is work we can do and we have done in first quarter and that we're going to continue to do through the rest of the year, in terms of trying to manage our discretionary expenses to lower levels. Some of that you can defer for a reasonable period of time, some of it you cannot defer for forever. And so we do have some seasonal costs related to marketing that will be a little bit heavier in the first and the fourth quarters, as they always are.","And so it's just good to know that we want to continue to be present and then continue to be able to work with our clients and have client events as we've always had. That's important and it helps the business, it helps the growth of the business and we don't want to differ those expenses for a year, for example. So I think the other thing that we see in the second quarter versus the first quarter would be some of the impacts around salary increases and differed compensation which are typically, you get a differential of about two months' worth of impact in the second quarter versus the first quarter and between those two items, that's probably somewhere around an increase of $5 million to $6 million.","So again, there are some things that we're going to manage and we're going to continue to apply a very thoughtful and disciplined approach to our hiring and to our discretionary expense management. I don't want to give guidance explicitly quarter-to quarter, also because just given the volatility of markets and FX, it really becomes quite difficult for us to give useful information.","Operator","Next question is from Bill of Citi. Sir, your line is now open. ","Bill Katz","I want to come back to Jemstep for a moment. One of your peers is out there as well with their own platform, they have actually signed up a few third-party distributors to accelerate the opportunity there. Can you talk a little bit about how you plan to leverage the platform and maybe synthesize that with your comments around the DOL?","Martin Flanagan","Bill, we're very excited about it and we look at it differently than the other, you want to call it technologies, robos out there, it was actually developed for the advisors themselves. And it is an open platform and it can use everything, all vehicles from ETFs to mutual funds and those are the limitations of some of the others. And ours is to be supportive of the advisors, not to compete with them and so there is no direct-to-consumer element to it and that was by design. And so we're able to just have a much deeper relationship with our clients, all the thought leadership that we have is an element also, delivering our solutions capabilities to various different clients through that, so another very good venue there.","And again the combination of the high conviction fundamental and factor based capabilities, whether they are mutual funds, ETFs, UITs. So we think it is also going to broaden our channel, our exposure, in the RIA market and that has been sort of an early indicator and quite frankly, the level of interest has been quite surprising. And I think frankly somewhat driven by the DOL also, because they are looking for technologies to help serve their clients and it is a market that really needs tools like this.","Bill Katz","This follow-up for Loren, on just margins overall I think you talked about -- maybe it was in the press release or maybe it was your prepared comments -- that G&A was a bit on the softer side as you delayed some items. How do you think about that on a go-forward basis? And then stepping back, pretty wide range on the optimization between, it was $30 million to $45 million, what would define the higher end of that range in terms of things to be done from here incrementally?","Loren Starr","So on G&A, that is a line item that we probably in some ways are best able to manage. It has to do with travel and entertainment and use of professional services and so those are things that are easier for us to slow down since they tend to be not as business critical as some of the other things around marketing for example. So we would hope to see continued success in terms of managing that line item. Although I would say there may be some things around some of the regulatory side that could drive certain needs and that could drive some cost in the G&A around risk management and other compliance efforts. But I still think that is an area we're putting a lot of focus on to manage and maintain somewhere around were run rate level in Q1.","In terms of the broad range of the $30 million $45 million, there are still several of these initiatives that are going through the finalization of their planning phases. And so we don't have clear line insight of the ultimate impact and so that's what is driving that spread. Again, I think we're hopeful we're going to get to the higher end of that range, but we want to be thoughtful and not commit to it until we're more certain which we'll begin to get more certain as we get through the course of this year and we will provide that feedback to you as soon as we know.","Operator","Next is from Michael of Sandler O'Neill. Sir, your line is open. ","Michael Kim","First Marty, you mentioned solid flows in April. First, I just want to be clear, does that imply solid net inflows? And then I'm also assuming that refers to the Firm-wide total, so any color on magnitude or some of the underlying drivers behind that?","Martin Flanagan","You're a good skeptic, so thank you for the question. So yes, I meant inflows. Total net inflows is about $3.7 billion right now and $1.9 billion are long term flows. The institutional pipeline, again and you're going to get tired of hearing it, but it is a good news story, it is an all-time high, again, so that is another area of ongoing strength for us. I will say we're in that season where, that's today, what the flows are, this is a month where there is all that rebalancing throughout the industry. So we don't have line of sight, who knows what happens between now and the rest of the week, right? ","So it could be a little noiseful, but I will tell you the quarter, if it stays on this path, will be a good quarter. But it could look a noisy, you know, month to month, just because of all the industries are rebalancing which is pretty typical and will not be unique to us. A very different environment, I'd say right now, than just where we were in January\/February.","Loren Starr","In terms of what is really being quite successful right now, Michael, we're seeing continued things around real estate, fixed income alternative, global asset allocations, multi-asset products at quant, are all highly featured in our institutional pipeline. And then the other -- regionally, we continue to see really strong flow momentum, both on the retail and the institutional side in Asia-Pac in particular. And then another note, just in terms of ETFs. ETFs are positive in every single region that we're operating in terms of positive flows and so we continue to see the interest in that capability being at a high level.","Michael Kim","And then maybe one for you, Loren, sorry for kind of the narrowness of the questions here. But you called out some expenses that were sort of deferred or postponed or maybe some non-essential costs that maybe fell by the wayside. Just so I'm clear, are those items part of the business optimization plan or are the incremental to, sort of, the $30 million to $45 million of savings you've identified?","Loren Starr","Yes, that's incremental. What you are seeing in the first quarter, the expense reduction, only $2 million of that has to do with business optimization, as I mentioned. Everything else is related to us just managing expenses in a fairly disciplined and try and differ what we can differ. We're going to continue to do, as I mentioned, through the course of the year. The business optimization's going to continue to roll and help on top of that activity to improve our overall expense management.","Operator","Next is from Brennan of UBS. Sir, your line is now open. ","Brennan Hawken","My first would be on regulation and Marty, you referenced unintended consequences which is certainly fair as a risk here. But do you have an estimate that you could size of how much of your AUM is in retirement accounts currently in therefore, at least at this stage, given what we know, the most clearly impacted by this DOL final rule? And then, based on what you saw happen in the UK that just went through, RDR, what lessons did you learn by going through that? And I'm guessing that had something to do with the unintended consequence comment and how does that put you in a position to be better prepared for this rule here in the U.S.?","Martin Flanagan","We're all in the advice business, being good fiduciaries is a critical thing. And putting clients first is absolutely essential and the industry of trust matters a lot. And so at that level, the notion of fiduciary ruling having better outcomes for end-clients, that is a great thing. I think we're all supportive of it. But it's really the magnitude of what has been included that went way beyond that notion. And what we learned with RDR and it's just an absolute fact, there are more unadvised individuals because of RDR right now and there probably will be individuals that need advice the most and the totality of the cost has gone up and I think that is a really bad outcome.","And I think there's a lot of -- and you can see that happening here. That said, so what are the lessons learned that we had from that is be aware of that. We also see, that is also why we went down the Jemstep route. We know we can help clients with tools like this, advice more accessible for those that could be hurt frankly from the rule. And again, that is not the intent of the rule, that's what we think as possible. And also, very importantly, how we position the firm. And I think this is what's being missed in the conversation. What money managers are going to do well and we might be challenged. If you are an index hugger, active management, I would say you are in trouble. If you have high conviction fundamentals and factor based capabilities like we do, I think you are positioned very, very well.","And if you look at the work we have done, when you look at high conviction actives, you do get better returns through market cycles, but it is not just excess return, you have better down-site capture. You also have better risk-adjusted returns and I think that's really the value proposition that collectively we need to make clear. It has been a beta run since 2009, largely with lots of government intervention and you start to look at quarters like this where all of a sudden you see active managers outperform the S&P by 300 basis points, 350 basis points that is pretty impressive.","So again, I think you have to have high conviction fundamentals and the factor base, we believe very, very strongly in the combination thereof. We think positions us very well. And much of that would, as you would say, come out of lessons learned that we learned out in the UK. Tried not to be long-winded but--","Brennan Hawken","And then follow-up, just a little bit more ticky-tacky, I think you'd said that the ETF flows were positive across regions. We're you talking about 1Q? And it looked like passive redemptions have been accelerating here over the last several quarters, so is that [indiscernible] driven? What's driving that? Can you help us unpack and square those two statements a bit?","Loren Starr","I will answer that, because it was my statement I think. So I was referring, positive in every region and that's April, so I was really referring to the April numbers. However, I would say in the first quarter, the first two months were not great month for our passive or whatever, ETF offerings, but I would say March was a record in terms of our sales. So it really came back strongly and as I sort of indicated, it's continuing strong into April. The passive category that we show, Marty mentioned it, got very much affected by the deleveraging of IVRs. So it is really is not the fill of noise in our numbers, because the deleveraging has no impact on revenues and even though we count and as an outflow, it's just really part of how their managing that [indiscernible]. ","So I would not read too much into the first quarter passive outflow story, really just understanding that we do believe that our ETFs business is very well-positioned and it is gaining momentum. It is the most diversified set of smart beta offerings and we're gaining share in smart data year-to-date, so we feel very confident about our ability to continue to grow that business.","Operator","Next is from Ken of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open. ","Ken Chow","Couple for Loren. Maybe first, when we think about the management fee rates for active and passive funds, both were down a lot for the quarter, I think maybe largely expected, maybe the magnitude was off a bit. Maybe can you first talk about how the fee rate should recover given the bounce back in equity markets, foreign markets, various currencies? Should we recover a lot of the way or part of the way or all the way, any color there would be great? And then if you could maybe flesh out better for us places where the mix changed in 1Q that maybe had the most pronounced impact on the fee rate declined this quarter? Thanks.","Loren Starr","Yes, so I think we will begin to see recovery of the net revenue yield and particularly as we get into the last half of the year versus the first, there is some day-count stuff that just happens normally and you always have that benefit of the last half having more days than the first half. So I want to make people aware of that, it is no secret. In terms of the mix, obviously we're having some reduced performance fee expectations coming into Q2 versus what we realized in Q1. Some of that will be offset by hopefully higher other revenues which will help move the fee rate up.","And I think we also will see the success of our ETF business, the success of our fixed income business, a lot of that is in the pipeline. They tend to have lower fee rates, so there will be probably some degree of mix issue that's working a little bit against the higher fee. The flows that we have been getting into EMEA and U.S. retail have been more subdued and it can be a driver of fee rate mix. And I would say that is going to be a little bit of a question mark, particularly as we get through the whole Brexit thing and understanding what happened in the UK, that may have some impact, we don't know. It hasn't any impact on flows per say that we can identify yet. But it could have some impact on flows.","Based on our modeling and our thinking, we expect to see the fee rate drive up further each quarter as we move through the course of the year. I think the positive elements generally around mix still exists. And I would say that on the institutional pipeline, even despite what I said around fixed income coming in, overall the fee rate on the products that are coming far exceed the fee rate on the products that would be leading, so again a positive element on the fee rate. FX will also have a big impact, too and I think we saw a pretty big impact on FX in the quarter, 0.7 basis points and so that was with UK down 5% quarter-over quarter, the pound.","Just to understand that those dynamics are probably one of the big drivers of fee rate issues. And hopefully that does recover and we get to break and we get stabilization of the pound.","Ken Chow","And then on the other revenue obviously down a bunch for the quarter, can you maybe help us on an outlook for this? There is a number of components, real estate and UITs are one, how should this line be growing over time? And maybe how should it be growing compared to something like the management fee line? So obviously both will move up and down depending on market conditions, but should the other revenue be growing faster or slower over time?","And then maybe more near term in terms of an outlook. Based on your guys' views on real estate activity and maybe what you are seeing more idiosyncratically in the UIT markets, how should we think about that line item maybe for the rest of the year?","Loren Starr","So I think it will grow, certainly off of what we view as a pretty low base in Q1, that now that I mention it, should pick up. Generally our real estate business has been growing well and so that will as a theme help allow that line item to grow. And I say particularly as it's seeing success in Europe and Asia, that's where a lot of the funds actually do have transaction fees and that work in the U.S., some of the products that are managed by our real estate team aren't able to generate transaction fees so that will be a U.S.\/non-U.S. mix. But we think the outside the U.S. is an opportunity for the real estate business and still has a lot of opportunity to grow at a faster rate even than on the U.S. side.","The UIT business, we would hope to see that grow. It has been a very competitive market, particularly because it is somewhat transactional when people decide to roll their UITs, if you do get volatility they're just going to wait and see. And so we would want to see a market stabilization which would allow our ability to roll those things more rapidly and generate more of the revenues as well. But we think that the UIT business has a lot of opportunity to grow and so we would expect to see between those two elements that other line item grow. Again, on an organic growth basis, we should be able to grow in that 3% to 5% level that we talked about before.","Operator","Next is from Chris of William Blair. Sir, your line is now open. ","Chris Shutler","I think early last year there was a really good story around cross-border, some of the European products are flowing very well. It seems like performance there has softened a little bit on a couple of products, others are still very good. The environment has clearly gotten tougher, so maybe just talk about how you're feeling about cross-border, that product range and the growth outlook for the remainder of the year?","Martin Flanagan","We still feel a very important part of our business, we still look at it as an engine of growth over the next few years. It's the magnitude of change and the impact to the Company has been very positive the last few years. Clearly with the market uncertainty, you then you do some of the macro-environment there, whether it be bright 50, some of the concerns on the continent, it did definitely slow down the quarter. That said, we just feel very well-positioned. We look to continue to gain market share.","With regard to performance, somewhat of a similar story -- some of the U.S. portfolios I mentioned, there's some of the exposure in some European portfolios were in financials and some energy and so there was that little bit of a drag per period, but again, they are very, very good managers, excellent and highly regarded. I would classify it more as market uncertainty than lack of confidence in the investment team. Uncertainty dwindles some, it will never go away. I think we will be back on that growing path.","Loren Starr","Our product range in Europe, still more than half of the assets are in the first quartile, so it is very strong. And when you look at the second quartile, on the five-year basis, it is more than 90% of the assets are beating peers on a five-year basis. So we think there is plenty of opportunity for us to be able to satisfy our clients' needs with the products that we have. You're right, some have soft a little bit relative to the end of the year, but it is still overall exceedingly strong.","Martin Flanagan","Not just retail, but again EMEA in particular is another area where the growth prospects for the institutional business are very, very strong. Early days of success from what we're anticipating over the next couple of years.","Chris Shutler","One other one on PowerShares. There was some talk last year I think of going through a bit of a -- I don't know what to call it, a repositioning or rebranding type of exercise, much better on factors. I know you have done some of that stuff there, rolled out some new product, but it's been I think fairly targeted to date. So I guess the question's just, do you feel like you need to be more aggressive there in making changes to that business? It looks like if you exclude the Qs, over the last year through March the flows have been fairly minimal relative to pretty favorable factor up for the industry as a whole.","Martin Flanagan","Good question, I would answer it two different ways. It is one of the areas that we have invested in quite strongly over the last number of years, because we anticipated, as Loren talked about, the factor base element of it, it's a growing part of the industry. We're a leader there with some very broad, long-dated track record and so the investments have been meaningful. With regard to the flows, I think what you have to look at is how narrow the flows were within the factor based ETFs. And probably from September through the end of February is about as narrow as you've ever seen. ","And what we're now seeing, as Loren was talking about, why are the flows picking up the way that we're? We're seeing a broadening of interest in the range of capabilities that we have. So we look at it as an important subset of that whole factor base that we have as an organization and we feel we're absolutely on top of it. And I think you will start to see it again in the flows here as we move through the year.","Operator","The next question is from Dan of Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open. ","Dan Fannon","First on EMEA or Asia, you continue to have great flows there, the $3.6 billion or so, the only region of influence. Can you talk about the concentration, I guess, within those flows, either through the distribution areas or products or how diversified those flows are?","Loren Starr","In EMEA, generally we have seen huge success with our GTR product, both institutionally and on the retail side. And that has been probably our primary driver of inflows in the region. So it has been probably a little bit concentrated to your point in that capability. I mean we still think there's some very, very strong capabilities, like our Quan capability for example, I think it is called structured equity, doing very well. ","This current environment in the first quarter was an anomaly for everyone in terms of what behavior you would expect. And hopefully we will begin to see more take-on in the broader sales picture than just GTR. But GTR by the way, I just want to minimize that point, is doing very, very well. It is outperforming some its competitors so it has really been a success for us. And the other thing I would also say, I know your question is just on EMEA, again I can't say how happy we're that our Asia-Pac business has been really, really strong.","So the outside the U.S. which is both Asia-Pac and EMEA, has been very diverse in Asia-Pac in terms of what's being taken on through equities alternatives and fixed income.","Martin Flanagan","And I would just add that, again, it's not a concern about GTR success. We think it's a positive and again Loren made the point before, if you look at the range of capabilities in EMEA and the very, very strong performance and the reputation of the teams, it is not a concern as far as I'm concerned.","Dan Fannon","And then I guess to follow-up on the optimization, I think you said $2 million was realized this quarter. Can you give us a kind run rate or path through the year to think about how the rest of that is going to flow through or the piece of that benefit?","Loren Starr","It's just going to step up each quarter. And so the $2 million would probably get to more like a $3.5 million, then $4.5 million, $5.5 million, as you work through the course of the year. Those are sort of rough numbers and so timing could be a little bit off. But that will get us ultimately, as we get into 2017 and that run rate of $30 million to $45 million which we feel very confident and whether we get to $45 million, we'll let you know as I mentioned, as we get through the course of the year.","Operator","Next question is from Eric of Royal Bank of Canada. Sir, your line is open. ","Kenneth Lee","This is Kenneth Lee on for Eric. Just had a question. There was previously mentioned that they tend to do a share repurchase at perhaps elevated rates this year. Just want to get a better handle on potential amounts that you guys could tend to think about, whether there's any kind of restrictions in terms of the cash balance that you have on hand in terms of your onshore or offshore? Just want to get a better handle on how to think about that. Thanks.","Loren Starr","In terms of where we're at the end of the quarter, we had total cash of $1.455 billion -- what's tied up in the UK subgroup, as we've talked about from a regulatory perspective, is $651 million. And so sort of the free and clear is that $804 million. Q1 is always a very heavy cash need quarter because of taxes and bonus payments, so we fell below sort of our self-imposed target of $1 billion, but we're not concerned about that. We're still going to continue to be targeting a very healthy capital return in terms of dividends and buybacks as a percentage of our operating cash flow to shareholders.","So in terms of our Q1 buyback which we talked about, that was up 63% versus what we did Q1 in 2015, so quite a step up, $125 million. But down a little bit versus the fourth quarter due to just generally the lower operating cash that we're generating now because our asset levels were affected by what happened to the market. But in terms of percentage payouts, we're sort of in line with what we were thinking about in terms of last year and the percentage of cash flow. But because our overall operating levels have been impacted by markets, the total levels may be somewhat smaller. If you look at what we paid out, it'd be probably more in line with an $80 million quarter run rate which gets us at that same payout rate that you've seen in the past. But with that said, we're going to continue to be very opportunistic.","If we see further impact on stock price which we think is unwarranted, if we get through some of the Brexit and understand the dynamics there, we may feel more able to commit more capital. Again, it's one of these things that we feel very well-positioned to return capital, but we're being a little bit cautious just given the volatility in the market right now.","Operator","Next question is from Robert of KBW. Sir, your line is now open.","Robert Lee","You didn't think you're going to get through a call without a Brexit question? So I guess I'll ask one. Aside from the currency hedge -- it may be obvious on how you think about contingency planning for it. I mean, how do you -- besides obviously huge unknowns, if it happens or what happens after happens, how can you prepare for that? I know it is maybe less about where products are registered, but operationally what are some of the things you try to put in place?","Martin Flanagan","It's a good question and needless to say, there's a team of people that have been working on it just in case that happens. And the good news, just as you were pointing to, the way we have our product ranges set up right now, we're in a very, very fine shape. And also the way that we have our operations is also set up in a way that we will not be impacted negatively. There is a small exposure. If we sort of extrapolate, I think it's a couple billion dollars of some assets that we think could sort of get caught up in the crosshairs.","But again, this is scenario planning, so exposure's high. So from that point of view, we're very well-placed. The issue is, if it is an outvote, it is going to be the stated time, they have until mid-2018, that they would still be a part of the EU. I would say most people that are very involved in this will tell you the likelihood of trade agreements and the like are going to take longer than that. It's just hard to assess what the psychological impact on investors would be.","That said, we just think relatively, we're very well-placed to deal with it as it goes through. And I think really just getting past the referendum is going to net positive regardless of what the outcome is.","Robert Lee","I guess maybe this is maybe a presentation question or what not. But could you maybe give us a sense -- in the past as AUM, what proportion of that is not fee generating or manager fee generating? Clearly last quarter there were noise and flows around de-leveraging of basically non-fee assets and clearly you break out the triple Q flows which don't generate managing fees, but neither do UITs and other things. So if we're really trying to look at kind of the pure asset base there that's generating the manager fee revenues, what would that be today? And maybe the one request that may be a helpful metric to think about providing going forward?","Loren Starr","Okay, so I think when you look at, the cues, that is about $38 billion, the IBR leverage is somewhere around $20 billion and then the UIT business which does generate revenues when they get rolled, but once they have been put in place they don't -- that is about $18 billion. So those are the big chunks that you'd have to add up to figure out what is non-revenue-generating.","Robert Lee","And then maybe just one last modeling question. I mean understanding a lot of moving pieces in comp and whatnot, if we think of it the first quarter here, was there anything in there -- I mean obviously there is always some seasonality in the U.S. -- but beyond maybe some modest seasonality there, is there anything in there that we should think of maybe that falls away next quarter outside of the expense initiatives that are in place? Or should we be thinking that all else equals is kind of a reasonable run rate?","Loren Starr","In terms of the Q2 through Q1 impact, you have obviously payroll taxes falling away, so that is a benefit of some $15 million, $20 million. But then you've got some offset, as I mentioned, in terms of dollar increases and differed compensation and sort plus $6 million. We obviously are beginning to work through some of the optimization things. And so you will get some continued run rate benefit going -- it's probably a benefit of $3.5 million to $2 million if that does translate, another $1.5 million benefit. ","Now some of that make get offset if we actually have a higher level of assets and revenues, some of our intended compensation will scale up with our operating income, as it always does. So all those things together, you're probably -- hopefully, comp will actually be back up with the benefit of higher asset levels and market driving intended compensation ahead.","Operator","Next question is from Michael of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. ","Michael Yule","Just curious under what conditions you think Invesco can grow organically? Your business closely resembles another in the industry, yet they grow consistently off a higher base. And I know you're targeting 3% to 5% organically to grow and flows sound like they are pretty strong in April. But I'm just curious under what condition can we see Invesco grow consistently from here?","Martin Flanagan","I think if you look, historically we've been one of the most absolute consistent growers throughout all the different market scenarios. I think what we have learned, if you look at the last quarter again, when you are in a January\/February environment it is just very difficult. When you get more to an environment that we're in now where I guess there's still plenty world uncertainties, a Firm like us, you will growth. And you'll see it both institutionally and retail and again as both Loren and I brought out, you can see looking at different parts of the world right, again, each region is actually growing. You don't need a lot, it's just where you have a massive uncertainty that it is very difficult.","Loren Starr","And I think you've said in the past, Martin, too, but when you get an equity-led market which I don't know if we're going to see that anytime soon. But if we do get an equity-led market, we will probably be able to grow much more quickly than you've seen us do in the past because a large percentage of our AUM is equity. Again that would be the converse of what we've been in, right? Just volatility.","Michael Yule","And then just a follow up on operating leverage, you cut expenses nicely about 9% or so year-on-year in the quarter, but revenues fell about 11.5% or so. So just curious how you're thinking about operating leverage here and what level of market return -- A, on growth, do we need to see in order to see positive operating leverage? And can you improve margins at flat AUM levels?","Loren Starr","We've said that when you get no market benefit, so if you just stayed flat to where we're on an average asset basis, the second quarter to first quarter, that organic growth would allow us to see revenues improve and so we would be able to get incremental margins up sort of 50%. And if we had a market that's helping us grow and FX I would say as well, incremental margins could be much higher to 65%.","So we would hope to see, as Marty had talked about, our operating leverage begin to work in our favor as opposed to work against us as assets are recovering. And we absolutely will see that happening, particularly as we manage to maintain a fairly tight control on the expense side. So that would be our hope, is to get us back to that 40% and hopefully this year just through organic growth and expense management. If we have market on top of that, we should be able to do better than that.","So there's nothing that stopped us from generating very strong operating leverage on the plus side if you have positive markets plus FX plus organic growth working in our favor.","Operator","Next question is from Brian of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open. ","Brian Modoff","I'm sorry if I missed this, but the $1.9 billion in long term flows in April, what areas are those in?","Loren Starr","So the $1.9 billion in long term flows were across a variety of capabilities, investment grade fixed income, we had bank loans, we had some aging equity. We had real estates, we also had PowerShares in each of the regions across a variety of capabilities. Probably a lot of it was low volatility offering and I think we did continue to see some positive flows in GTR as I mentioned which has been a big driver. Pretty diverse capability, maybe more heavily focused on alternatives than anything else.","Brian Modoff","And just Marty, I guess a little bigger picture on the Department of Labor, it sounds like you have a very good sort of offensive game plan with the Jemstep product and the open architecture model and being able use your very wide product range, including the factor-based ETFs. But if you think about sort of the defensive nature that a lot of the asset managers will be going through that have high concentrations of active product, is there any type of plan to work with the advisors in terms of pricing class structures of the shares that you have now? And I guess if you could comment on how you think adviser behavior will turn out, post DOL Rule. And then sorry if I missed the assets in mutual funds and IRAs and 401(k)s. I'm not sure if you just --","Martin Flanagan","It's a good question and I think the reality is we've got to believe it's going to be taken by the distributors and how they are going to want to be addressing the rule. That said we're and I'm sure everybody else is wanting to be incredibly helpful to distributors as they work through the issues. That said, what I believe strongly is that there is a very, very important role for advisers.","We believe that's the best way to get outcomes for clients and also believe strongly that high conviction fundamental capabilities and factor-based capabilities are what advisors want to do because they know that's how they can give a better value proposition to their clients. And just mechanically, the industry is pretty close already, through the range of share classes that will be available, that the vast majority, they will be an advisor-based plans.","And these are stripped-down share classes that really you know what's going to be used. And so I would say money managers are -- I'm sure most everybody is well-placed in that area. But again, it is a little bit of -- time to take the lead working with the distributors on it. It is really complex actually, the role, but the high-level assumptions that we've all made are probably still in place.","Brian Modoff","And sorry, did the mutual -- I don't know if you disclosed this -- the mutual fund assets in U.S. IRAs and 401(k)s?","Martin Flanagan","We didn't. Again so much of our assets are in omnibus and quite frankly, if we just made the determination by coming up with a number, it'd probably be more misleading than helpful. We would probably have at industry levels or just slightly less than someone with regard to exposure. That is our estimate.","Brian Modoff","And do you think advisors will factor in the help that you are giving them, including with Jemstep, in terms of thinking about the least conflicted and best product for their clients? And using, say Invesco products, in conjunction with the Jemstep offering as sort of the best low-cost, better-performing option.","Martin Flanagan","Let me answer this way, again, we've talked about the range of capabilities. We think that is very important. Jemstep is open architecture which is very important. That's the only way we can be credible in helping our distribution partners and if it's important to them, it's important to us.","That said, the other element is we have Invesco Consulting which has been a really, really important part of the value proposition we provide to advisors to help them work through all these different topics. That and the thought leadership in combination are going to be, we think very, very strong forces and us being into a position to -- be strongly placed to help our distribution partners do what they need to do.","Operator","And last question in queue is from Chris of Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is now open. ","Chris Harris","The record institutional pipeline, wondering if you guys could speak to the size of that if possible? And then I know we have the State of Rhode Island Mandate in there, so maybe talk qualitatively as to how it looks excluding that mandate?","Loren Starr","The good news is that the State of Rhode Island Mandate is not in this number. It does not include that. And so the record number, we're up 50% versus prior-year. We're up about 5% versus prior quarter. We've traditionally not and I think we will probably continue the tradition of not giving explicit numbers, because they can be misleading in terms the ins and the outs. And this is really what we have line of sight of in terms of the ins, but we don't have as much of a clear line of sight on the out. ","But in terms of indicative levels and the pipeline and the success you have seen on the institutional side which has been, I think you've it in every single quarter. We feel very confident that we will continue to see growth in terms of the sales or success in that channel.","Chris Harris","I want to come back to one second I was asked earlier and that is regarding your long term growth targets, 3% to 5%. I'm not sure if you guys had really thought about it this way, but when you guys were thinking about that growth rate, what kind of level of growth were you thinking you would need in active equity in order to get there? In other words, can active equity sort of be flattish or negative and Invesco could still potentially hit that 3% to 5% target?","Loren Starr","I think absolutely. Across every single market that we're looking at that and I think that is the point, is that it's the consistency. We will not be the fastest grower in the industry because that going to mean you've got the one product that everyone wants in that one market. And then because we have a very diversified set of offerings, some are entirely active, others are on the more passive side and so depending on the market that we're in, we should be able to grow at a more, I'd say, modest rate but a still very good rate of that 3% to 5%. And it could be in terms of those markets scenarios where active is an outflow and we're winning on the passive side. That's not going to be every market, but it certainly has been a current market where we're seeing the interest in passive being at a higher level than some of the active offerings. But again, you've seen our active and passive both actually succeeding in this environment.","Martin Flanagan","And I just want to reiterate a point that Loren made earlier too. We feel strongly that the 3% to 5% is very, very achievable and that's really -- we have not been in, for a good number of years, a market that is kind to active and equity investing. And I do believe that is going to change. I know there's a lot of doubters, but it can persist this way and when that happens, I think you will be at the high end of the range.","Operator","Next question is from [indiscernible]. Sir, your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Marty, just a quick one, two things just on the retail side of the business. When you mentioned the improvement that you have seen in March and April, just wanted to get a sense on the flows that you gave, is that more weighted towards retail versus the strength you have been seeing in institutional? And then diving into that, are you seeing an improvement in sales or some of the redemptions starting to improve? And then longer term, just any concern around some of the SEC proposals on liquidity and derivatives? Or just more manageable, but the industry will be going back and forth to try to figure out what is the right solution?","Martin Flanagan","The flow is pretty well balanced, retail and institutional.","Loren Starr","Although I would say the retail is a little more ETF flavored.","Martin Flanagan","Good point. I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question? I got the third part. I can't remember the second part.","Unidentified Analyst","Whether the improvement that you were seeing in March and April, like sales versus--","Martin Flanagan","It is gross sales picking up. So typically what happens in those downturns is the first thing that happens, people stop buying and that's where you get that -- so you're actually starting to see gross sales pick up which is a very important indicator, I would say a sort of sentiment. And then with regards to the various SEC proposals, my view is the indications I would say is that the SEC absolutely wants to get them done. They also absolutely want to get them right. And they are much more willing and capable of working with the industry to get the right answers and so again we'll have to see one by one.","So that would say they are going to come, but I'd say they'll ultimately get to places that are workable and we will get to a relatively good spot. I will say again though, back to some yet earlier conversations, this does continue to put pressure on -- all it does is drive up compliance costs and you know, in a difficult market is it's very difficult for institutions to -- and these are not optional expenses. You do compliance costs in cyber and I think that's being a larger money-management manager, you'll be in a better place to be able to deal with those. So again, that will be a continued dynamic, I would say in the industry.","Operator","And that's the last question in queue.","Martin Flanagan","Well thank you very much and on behalf of Loren and myself, thank you for your time, your questions and your interest and we will be in touch soon. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"12666":["Invesco Ltd.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Martin Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director of investments. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you very much and thank you everybody for joining us. And if you're so inclined, you can follow along the presentation that's on the website. I'll cover the business results today and talk a little bit about the combination. Loren will get into greater detail of the results and impact of the combination and as practice; we'll open-up to Q&A.","So, let me get started. I'm on Page 6, if you happen to be following the presentation. And as you saw, we successfully closed the OppenheimerFunds transaction at the end of May with $1.2 trillion in assets under management. We're now the sixth largest retail manager in the United States, 13th largest manager in the world, which puts us in a much [indiscernible] position to meet client needs. We're now just two months past close and we are more confident ever in our ability to achieve the deal economics and the tremendous potential of the combination. I also want to point out; we're incredibly pleased that the combination has created a much stronger organization with very talented people. Our conversations with clients reaffirm our view that the expanded set of capabilities we now offer combined with best-in-class distribution format, meaning we strengthened our relevance in the market and of late increase organic growth.","I also want to point out there are very clear benefits to shareholders from the transaction. I want confirm once again we will get the $475 million in net synergies, 85% of that will be accomplished by the end of this year. The additional scale, resiliency and stability resulting from the combination will help us achieve a greater than 41% run-rate operating margin. And finally, pro forma year-end EBITDA on 2020 is expected to be exceeding $2.6 billion.","Turning to the highlights; investment performance remained strong during the quarter. 58% of actively managed assets were in the top half of peers over both the three and five year period are getting greater detail in just a minute. Long-term net outflows totaled $3.9 billion, building on the improved trend over the prior quarter, reflecting stronger flows from our ETF and institutional businesses. During the quarter we began to see the power of the combination of recognizing the deals only close for one month. There is a 16% increase in net revenue quarter-over-quarter. The operating margin expanded 300 basis points to 35% or 27% increase in operating income quarter-over-quarter to $363 million. We're now operating from a position of strength, which has enabled us to invest in the growth of our business while also returning $389 million to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends during the quarter. All of this means we're better positioned to deliver relevant outcomes for our clients invest in future growth of the organization and provide solid returns for shareholders.","Turning to investment performance on Slide 8; as I mentioned, performance remained strong, 58% of our actively managed assets were at 58% of five-year period, 33% of that was top quartile performance. The combination has enhanced the depth and breadth of our investment expertise across the business while further expanding the scale of our investment capabilities. Invesco now ranks Top 10 in assets under management, 10 of the 15 largest asset categories in US retail channel, which is the largest market in the world. Best examples are a second-ranked in bank loans, HY Munis, third rank in emerging markets, fourth rank in global equities. We see three areas where there's an alignment from market demand is strong, long-term track records of our capabilities that being global, international, emerging markets equity, fixed income and alternatives. All three of these asset classes have significant percentage of our assets in the top quartile for all time periods. So, in short, we're very well positioned in the market and the capabilities we are seeing strong demand, which will drive organic growth.","I'll now pass over to Loren to go through the results.","Loren Starr","Thanks very much, Marty. On Slide 9, you'll find an overview of our long-term flows. In aggregate, we experienced net outflows of $3.9 billion in Q2, which is an improvement of $1.5 billion compared to the prior quarter and $4.1 billion compared to prior year. As you can see on the slide, the area is driving this positive change, we're in passive Asia-Pacific, EMEA, ex-UK and institutional. ETF capabilities globally contributed more than $4.5 billion in net flows for the quarter. ETF flows in the Americas were diversified across our smart beta offerings, led by our S&P low volatility suite and bullet shares ETFs.","In EMEA ex-UK, we saw a positive ETF flows across a number of our equity and fixed income ETF capabilities. Notably, our ETF flow growth has propelled us to number two in terms of net new ETF assets in this region year-to-date. In Asia-Pacific, we generated $3 billion of net inflows. We saw a growth in sales surge across many of our fixed income and balanced capabilities with particularly robust growth provided by our China, Invesco Great Wall business. In China alone, we added nearly $2 billion of net flows into several of our active balanced and equity capabilities, reflecting the excellent investment performance and market positioning we have in this region.","Our institutional business continued to show signs of strength, delivering $2.1 billion in positive flows in Q2. Of note, the last time we posted positive net flows in our institutional business was in the first quarter of 2018. Much of this change is due to the improvement we're seeing in redemptions. On the same slide, you can see the areas driving outflows in the quarter, which included active, the Americas, UK and retail. The majority of active outflows were in the asset class of equities, although these were offset to some extent by fixed income net inflows. In the Americas, outflows in our US retail equity products were elevated against the prior quarter due to the partial period inclusion of the legacy Oppenheimer products, which experienced approximately $2.5 billion in post close outflows during the quarter. The Americas were also negatively impacted by outflows across our bank loan capabilities with about $1.2 billion out, as investors redeemed from this asset class on an industry-wide basis. Industry dynamics also continue to challenge our retail flows in the UK as risk assets remained broadly out of favor with investors in these markets, fueled by the uncertainty from Brexit.","Looking forward to the last half of 2019 for Invesco, we expect the factors that are currently impacting our flows both positively and negatively to largely persist. With that said, while we certainly are seeing an elevated level of outflows in the legacy Oppenheimer fund products in the short-term. We believe that we'll be able to improve our level of sales growth in the Americas, given the world-class distribution team and platform that we've created through this combination. It's still early days and the opportunity to drive flows through improved sales and marketing efforts have not yet been realized.","So, before I leave this slide, I wanted to quickly provide an update on our expectations around AUM breakage as it is related to the combination. Our original deal expectations included an estimate as you'll remember of $10 billion in outflows in the first year after the close. As we look to client breakage, the only item that we've specifically identified at this point related to the announced transaction is the transition of the state of New Mexico 529 plan. This transition will result in a $2 billion outflow in the fourth quarter. So, with this known outflow and considering expectations around potential impacts from the announced investment team changes, we believe that our AUM breakage from the transaction will in fact meaningfully less than the original estimate of $10 billion.","Next let's turn to Slide 10 which outlines our AUM. Our assets under management increased by $243 billion or 25.5%, which primarily reflects the impact of the OFI combination and positive market returns, partially offset by total net outflows. As a reminder, the RFI combination added $224 billion to our AUM in May. We saw a quarter-over-quarter growth in AUM across both active and passive and across all channels and client domiciles other than for the UK. The Oppenheimer AUM increased the percentage of the firm's AUM and that is active retail in Americas based while our institutional and passive AUM grew due to long-term net inflows and market appreciation during the quarter. As Marty mentioned, our general net revenue yield excluding performance fees increased 1.4 basis points to 38.5 basis points versus 37.1 basis points in the prior quarter. In addition of OFI AUM for slightly more than one month added approximately 1.3 basis points to our net revenue yield and we also saw one additional day in the quarter which added 0.3 basis points. These factors were modestly offset by change in AUM mix.","Slide 11 provides US GAAP operating results for the quarter. My comments today are going to focused on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures which will be found on Slide 12. Moving to this slide, you'll see that net revenues increased by $145 million or they were 16% up quarter-over-quarter to $1.03 billion. This increase reflects primarily the impact of the Oppenheimer combination and the increased day count in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses at $668 million increased by $65 million or 11% relative to the first quarter; this increase largely reflects once again the impact of the Oppenheimer combination on expenses for the period.","Next, moving to Slide 13, I'd like to comment on the progress that we've made on the integration and synergy capture recorded to-date. As noted in the first quarter, we spent a significant amount of time between the announcement date and closing date defining the leadership and the organizational structure for the combined team. This has allowed us to quickly execute on a number of very important post-close activities required to increase our sales growth for the combined business. These activities include moving to a single brand, strengthening our newly combined sales organization through training and definition of go-forward client coverage and creating a client demand framework and go-to-market strategy for the combined firm.","As I mentioned earlier when I was discussing the Q2 flows, we have not yet to fully realize the benefit of this work and the impact on our sales in the US retail business. In addition to activating the newly integrated US retail sales platform, the pre-close integration work has also enabled us to make meaningful progress on cost synergy recognition. We remain on-track to capture $475 million of net synergies through the first quarter of 2021. As a reminder, this $475 million amount of bottom line cost savings is net of investments we are making, which will allow us to drive future growth and avoid future costs. This combination is allowing us to accelerate investments in areas that strengthen our distribution investment capabilities and processes as well as allowing us to deploy new technologies and automation to significantly increase our operational efficiency while still delivering the $475 million in savings. In terms of timing, to achieve the net synergies, we originally expected to have 52% of total expense synergies captured at the end of the third quarter of this year.","Given the significant amount of progress we've made prior to the deal close to establish, communicate and execute on our end-state organization systems and work placement by location, we were able to achieve this level of synergy captured by the end of the second quarter. With the quicker synergy capture, we remain well on-track to recognize 85% of synergies by the end of 2019.","Next, let's move to Slide 14 which looks at our adjusted operating and net income. Operating income increased $79 million to $363 million, largely reflecting the increased operating earnings from the Oppenheimer transaction. Our operating margin improved to 35.2% versus 32% in the prior quarter, reflecting the positive margin benefits from the combination as well as the quicker synergy capture, I discussed on the previous slide. Firm's effective tax rate came in at 21.8%, which was consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to expect our tax rate to come in somewhere between 22% and 23% starting in the third quarter. Lastly, our net income improved by nearly 25% to $280 million, reflecting continued strong non-operating gains from our investments and adjusted EPS improved to $0.65 versus $0.56 in the first quarter.","Next, move to Slide 15. This presents a snapshot of Invesco's balance sheet and capital management. So, as I had mentioned, we continue to execute in a very disciplined way to achieve the target level of deal synergies and the improved financial position that the deal provides. In doing so, we expect to continue to return significant levels of capital to our shareholders. You saw this in the current quarter when we returned nearly $390 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. This represented a PAT of about 107% of our operating income for the period. You'll recall that we announced a $1.2 billion share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2018 and we successfully executed $600 million against that plan through the end of the quarter as we see a significant opportunity to repurchase our shares given Invesco's stocks depressed valuation and trading discount to peers and given our confidence and the strength of the combined organization.","In addition, we executed a further $200 million forward repurchase agreement in July. That will bring us to $800 million stock buybacks. Once this is completed, we expect to have repurchased some 39 million shares since the fourth quarter, which represents more than 8% of our share count outstanding as of the transaction close. Although there was no preferred payment in the second quarter due to the timing of dividend declaration, we will pay the preferred dividend starting in the third quarter. Note that the third quarter payment will be elevated at $64.4 million as they will reflect the additional 80-day post close period from May. Starting in the fourth quarter, the amount will level out as $59 million per quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet; so, you will see that we have a $7 billion increase in assets during the quarter, largely reflecting the indefinite lived intangible and goodwill assets recognized as part of this transaction. Our equity balance increased by $4 billion, reflecting the preferred issuance to MassMutual close and our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by nearly $200 million. With the increased earning power and cash flow of the combined firm, we expect to reach our targeted $1 billion of cash, in excess of regulatory capital requirements by the second half of 2020. We repaid approximately $400 million of debt in the quarter, largely paying down our credit facility and leaving a near zero balance, which obviously has a positive impact on our leverage ratios. We expect to be able to maintain our current level of debt going forward.","As Marty noted earlier, we anticipate that the combined organization will have a pro-forma annual EBITDA post synergies of more than $2.6 billion by the end of 2020, which represents a significant increase when compared to the pre-combination at Invesco. With this increased level of EBITDA, our leverage ratio would be approximately 0.8 times gross debt to EBITDA based on the US GAAP classification of the newly issued $4 billion of non-cumulative perpetual preferred as equity. Conversely, if the preferred were instead treated as a 100% debt, the leverage ratio would be at a 2.3 times gross debt to EBITDA. This is a level that we certainly view as manageable and one that will certainly come down over-time as our earnings grow.","So I'll conclude by saying that we're very confident in our ability to capture the $475 million in net cost synergies and deliver the deal economics and other benefits we outlined, which include not only the targeted $1.2 billion in stock buybacks, but also a strong balance sheet with little or no added debt and some $1 billion of excess cash, as we get to the second half of 2020.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Marty to wrap-up.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you, Loren. Let me make a couple of comments before we get to Q&A. And as we've discussed on previous calls, we continue to be very focused on improving our leadership position in core markets, which of course this combination has while at the same time investing in those parts of the business where we see rapid growth. This approach has helped us to deliver best-in-class set of capabilities, which will drive sustainable broad-based growth as we look to the future. The combination with OppenheimerFunds has meaning if we accelerated the strategy. Obviously, expanding our leadership position in United States while also strengthen our business in areas where we're growing quite rapidly as Loren mentioned, China ETFs, digital platform solutions to name a few.","So again, we're just too much paths closed and we have all the confidence that the combination is meeting and exceeding our expectations.","And with that, let me open-up to questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I think first prior to the deal; I believe Oppenheimer was sort of running neutral to positive net sales. Since the deal was announced, Oppenheimer has seen a pickup in the outflows. I think you said it was $2 billion or maybe $2.5 billion since the deal was closed. I think originally you were modeling 1% to 2% organic growth for Oppenheimer. What are your sort of thinking now for the go-forward there? And then how quickly do you think you get the benefits from a sales perspective? I think you've suggested that the integration of the Oppenheimer and Invesco sales forces was particularly disruptive. We've got three months of Oppenheimer in 3Q rather than 1Q. So how quickly and maybe what is the cadence look like for an improvement in sales as the sales force is now integrated and hopefully more stable to offset some of these dis-synergies?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. Let me hit some of the high points and I'll let Loren later. So, this is the most talented sales force I have ever seen. And it is literally made-up of half Invesco, half Oppenheimer. That was just the outcome of the exercise that the leadership went through. It is in place; it was in place and closed all of that work was done before. That said, it's a new range of capabilities in the focus area. So, I would quite say, through the end of the year until things settle down is when I think everybody have their sea legs. But that said, each and every day is a better day and had reached degree of confidence there. The other thing that we've talked about is just not the US wealth management platform, but Oppenheimer is a number of capabilities that will be well received in the institutional market and also in the retail market outside the United States.","So literally, some of the retail capabilities will be available on October and we're already working on get it to market with a number of the institutional teams around the world. So again, the big difference is we're up and running and executing where most transactions I have seen this thing starts to happen after close. And from every transaction there I've been involved I can say this is the best that we've ever done. So, I think we're in a very good spot. Loren?","Loren Starr","And Ken, we had an estimate of 1% to 2% organic growth scheduled to begin in 2020. So, at this point, we're still hopeful that we can achieve those types of levels of growth. Again, there is an opportunity to take these capabilities into our institutional channel into our offshore business. There is a lot of activity going on as we speak to actually make that happen a lot of interest in those channels for these products. We have some headwinds on certain key products in the Oppenheimer sort of capabilities, but there are other really high performing capabilities as well that we think we're going to be able to leverage itself. So, I'd say in terms of our distribution efforts that is really being spring-loaded in terms of being able to execute really in a position as we get to the second half of this year. I mean, again, there is probably some headwinds in the near-term, still that we're going to see, as I mentioned, we don't think anything can change, but ultimately, we're going to start seeing the benefit of this really world-class organization coming together and being able to execute.","Ken Worthington","Thank you. And then on the institutional side of the business, you highlighted a move to inflows. But you also highlighted that the drive to net sales was driven by redemptions slowing. It does look like gross sales have slowed too. You've talked about in the past that the institutional pipeline was sort of hitting record levels. Should we see gross sales improve from here. If so, what asset classes and geographies? In terms of the decline in gross redemptions, is that sustainable or might that have just been a one-off this quarter?","Loren Starr","Great question. So, I think the reduction in sales was really just the market environment that we've been in, things slowed down in terms of funding. So, there is some pause that happens. So, the one but not funded pipeline is still as large as it's been in fact it is up 10% versus prior quarter is up 31% versus prior year. So, the pipeline of one not funded is robust, very strong growing. So, we feel confident those assets are going to come through. It's really just a matter of timing on the solar redemption side. Again, it's hard to say what is permanent and what is not. In terms of what we know, in terms of expected outflows, nothing has increased relative to prior levels. So, we think that looks reasonably stable. But there is always going to be potential for idiosyncratic outflows that come from certain key clients. So again, what we can manage at the sales probably more than the redemption side and we are feeling very positive about that outlook into the next couple of quarters.","Martin Flanagan","And let me add. Because you raised a very good point. I have absolute confidence that the operating results are going to be as you would predict, as we've talked about through '19 through '20. That said, two fundamental strength of our organization are seeing headwinds. Brexit is a headwind and for us it is incredibly risk-off in UK in particular. And the trade wars actually do impact our position in Asia-Pac. That said, we're still going to get the results that we're talking about. So, if you see any benefit in that, we would expect real strong increase in inflows.","Loren Starr","And I didn't answer your last question sorry Ken. So, it's about more than 60% of the pipeline is in alternatives, about 23% is in equities and some 10% in fixed income; just to give you a sense of where it is coming from.","Ken Worthington","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. You may go ahead.","Dan Fannon","Thanks, good morning. I guess my first question is on just the synergies, the $475 million. Obviously, you've expressed a lot of confidence and have some good kind of runway to start here. So, Loren you mentioned also just kind of reinvestment back into the business. And so just curious, as we think a bit out if there is upside to the $475 million or if you're going to continue to kind of reinvest in growth in other areas as you achieve these synergies if there is additional things that are found?","Loren Starr","So, Dan, we certainly have seen this transaction is an opportunity to upgrade significantly as we've talked about putting the firm together, becoming stronger firm has been part of the objective. This is not just been about cost saves. It's actually about creating a stronger organization. And so, we actually view this as a fundamental part of the transaction, the $475 million should be viewed as a net number, net of investments in terms of what we're going to deliver. We're absolutely confident we're going be able to deliver that. I think the good news is that we've been able and we expect to be able to continue to invest alongside delivering the savings into critical areas that will strengthen our distribution, our investment capabilities and invest in new technologies automation to augment our operational efficiency, really bringing our firm to sort of the state of the art and basically avoiding sort of the need to invest in the future, so really allowing us to accelerate all this activity right now. Today, we've been able to invest, small amount. So, let's say roughly $30 million. There is an opportunity I think to be able to invest more as we go through, but in terms of kind of the modeling and your thinking I would bank on the net $475 million is what to expect.","Dan Fannon","And then just a follow-up; Marty on your comment about Brexit. Obviously, that's you said risk-off, but also performance in that area has not been good for you guys and some of the your -- I guess your former employee is going through some hard times over there. And then I just want to talk just generally about the franchise you see there, the strategies you have in place, how performance is kind of having through this type of environment and are there anything you guys are looking to do to proactively get in front or institute change or just kind of waiting for the macro to shift?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, it's a good point Dan. I would say it's more broad. I mean, as you know, what has been a fundamental strength of the organization where we had nine years of net inflow up until throughout '17. Much of that was on the back of value biased equity capabilities and we're in an extreme period where it's out of favor almost, the most extreme period that we've seen, that's a record. That said the investors are still very, very talented, have great faith in them and they are going to do quite fine. So, the business issue that you're talking about is the flows and as I keep pointing out, we're posting these results with these extreme headwinds. But now we're not just waiting for things to change. I would pay attention to the Intelliflo announcement came out in June and it is a digital platform that start with our model portfolio, starting in the fourth quarter of this year, it uses a broad array of our capabilities, both active and passive and we looked at it as a game changer in the UK.","Loren Starr","I'd also point out because it's moved quickly, there's lot of currency going on here as well, but pre-Brexit our UK as a percentage of AUM was about 12% of total. And as we show it is about 6%. So again, in terms of kind of the total exposure to Invesco just by the nature of the currency and some of the market and flow dynamics, it is not as large an exposure to the firm as you might have otherwise seen just a short period of ago.","Dan Fannon","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Craig [ph] with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Good morning Marty and Loren. I just wanted to start with the $10 billion of merger dis-synergies, redemption notices have actually been trending better than you initially guided to. First-off, when do you expect institutions to notify you in terms of pre or post-closing and are you really kind of passed that point, so that's a good sign? But then also Oppenheimer has seen very large outflow since you announced the deal. So, I'm just wondering do you not include retail or intermediary redemptions in your dis-synergy number?","Loren Starr","So, in terms of institutional notification, that's not really a factor because I think we really had very limited institutional relationships of any size at Oppenheimer's 529 was the largest for sure. So that's done. We have not seen any sort of notifications large scale institutional or retail-wise that indicate we should expect outflows due to breakage due to this transaction. There are as we mentioned some performance headwind, which we don't think fairly should be attributed to the deal. It's more just kind of the nature of the asset class or the performance in combination. A good example would be around kind of the international growth capability, which I think industry-wide was in significant outflow and so we certainly saw some of that hit our capability as well. So basically I would say in terms of the transaction and the impact -- that's not as we said, it's going to be materially less in terms of the current headwinds around outflows, again some of that may persist into Q3 and Q4, we are hoping to offset some of that through improved sales efforts across not only protecting that current estimates, but also promoting some of the other very strong investment capabilities through channels that had not previously been able to access those products where they weren't on the platform. So hopefully that's helpful in terms of sizing it. I wouldn't say the market has been helpful too. So, offsetting some of the outflow markets have offset that. So, in terms of the overall AUM levels related to Oppenheimer, we're still exactly where we were kind of in Q1.","Unidentified Analyst","Loren, do you have the Oppenheimer total flow number for 2Q '19 not just post-closing, but for the full quarter?","Loren Starr","I don't have that number handy. I'm sorry, Craig.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. You may go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","You guys touched on it on your comments on the UK business. But maybe I could ask overall with now becoming number six I think you said and obviously done the deal to be more important in the retail channel, the retail channel distribution efforts are changing to the more portfolio construction approach. Could you talk about what you have functional now and also how much of the market shifted there. In other words, I get that the future is it now or is it impacting flows now. So, your positioning and then a statement on the overall retail channel.","Martin Flanagan","Yes, it's a good question. So, we fully agree with the notion that clients really around the world are looking much more sort of outcomes, which basically means that we are creating solutions, portfolios of different sizes and make-ups. We are seeing that in the US retail channel too. I would not say it's -- I'd say that is where it's heading, it tends to be right now the largest teams are very focused on it. And as we've talked over the years, where that [indiscernible] through our solutions capability, which is very strong, very talented, it's been marketed, it's been in market for a couple of years and they do anything from building unique portfolios for organizations to analytics for various teams to help them determine how they might shift their mix. So, we do think that's the future. There's no question about it.","The other area where we have made a great investment is in all of our analytics around distribution and again it only got stronger with the combination with Oppenheimer. They had some very talented people there also. And again, we think we're clearly one of the top players with those capabilities. I think what it also highlights to just this kind of conversation. You have to have size of scale to compete and the notion that you don't have the depth and breadth of capabilities, we are active as of only for solutions and to have digital support and capabilities. I just think it's going to be very, very difficult for others to compete.","Glenn Schorr","That leads into maybe a quick question on the passive side. Obviously, you've had good inflows there. Could you broaden out a little bit of what's working best in passive land and maybe even touch on arbitrary associated?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. So, what you are saying, the ETF business in Europe is now kicking-off in a very strong way. We had currently 20% organic growth in the quarter. It's the second largest flow in the marketplace. So, sources absolutely integrated product line is the way it's supposed to be. We're executing on all cylinders and back to the United States. Again, we're also starting to see our ETF flows picked up, again very important element of that is the bullet shares. We're not done with that. The build-out of the BulletShares capabilities yet, but the ones that we have put in place are very strong and again play to just a question you were asking about earlier a huge opportunity in the marketplace for financial advisors in particular with the BulletShares capabilities.","Loren Starr","Glenn just in terms of specifics, I mean some of the largest flows we're seeing in terms of the S&P 500 low volatility ETF, we also saw a significant inflows into a newly launched fund in Europe, which is our MSCI, Saudi Arabia, ETF. Physical gold is another one where we saw interest. BulletShares in the US has been and continues to be a very, very fast growing capability, short duration ETFs as well seem to have picked up a lot of share. So a combination of fixed income commodities and mobile.","Glenn Schorr","Great, thanks. Thanks for all that. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. The first one, just given the flow mix in terms of more passive and then institutional versus active in retail and the impact of that can have on the fee rate outlook versus what happened this quarter with the deal. So how do you think about the incremental margin for the business. If you see the flow trends continue like in that direction versus say over the next one to two years retail are active start to shift back?","Martin Flanagan","Let me make a comment before Loren does. And I think you're hitting on something that is largely misunderstood. So when you look at our business, I can speak to others. The growth in our ETF business is a positive one, a very positive one. The profitability, the profit margins are in excess of our stated profit margins. So it's actually accretive to the business. And so the overall effect of fee rate if it drifts down, it has nothing to do with fee pressure. It has all to do with the mix in shift, which quite frankly is an area where we have greater profitability.","Loren Starr","And in terms of the way we are thinking about it, the incremental margin that we're seeing as we grow, is in that 50% to 60% range, one that we've historically talked about. So nothing has shifted really in terms of our ability to see margins grows as we grow, certainly delivering that the net incremental number well above the firm's overall margin. As we talked about even though passive continues to be a very fast growing part of our business. The incremental margin on that business is actually extremely attractive and also well in excess of the firm's overall margin. So again, we want to differentiate. In fact that we've been focused mostly on the sort of smart beta factor based ETFs, which have generally higher prices than we've seen on the commoditized market cap weighted ETFs. And again that gives those products really strong margin incremental margin characteristics.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks for that. And maybe just a quick follow-up for Loren. Just in terms of Oppenheimer, does that have any impact on the other revenue in the performance fee line, when we think going forward.","Loren Starr","No, it really would not. There are very few places where Oppenheimer is subject to performance fees. I would say that the only caveat is to the extent that we use those capabilities institutionally in places in the US or outside the US. You could see some of those products potentially having some performance fees linked to them, but currently on their current asset base, no and other revenues as well. No.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. You may go ahead.","Bill Katz","Thank you very much for taking the questions this morning. Just seeing one of the slides that you're -- so the EPS accretion is static from the last update, but the market has moved the fair amount. How do you think about market impact to that assumption? I'm just trying to understand sort of sensitivity to the macro.","Loren Starr","So Bill, as I kind of hinted at one of the other questions, we obviously lost some assets through outflow, but we actually gained those that assets back through market. So in terms of general accretion, we're kind of exactly where we were before just happened to be where we are right at that that same level of AUM.","Bill Katz","Busy morning, I apologize if I missed that. And then when you look out into 2021 when you are on the other side of sort of the normalized savings. Does your incremental margin change or maybe another way to ask the question is, what kind of growth rate would you anticipate on expenses assuming a relatively benign market backdrop?","Loren Starr","Yes, good question. So again I think we would expect to see some 3% inflation on expenses generally as you get out into those outer years. I think again, one of the good news elements of that we are accelerating the fair amount of investment through this transaction. So our need to sort of substantially sort of redo technology and other things that other firms might have to deal with it through the course of the next several years. We're kind of getting a lot of that done through this transaction.","Bill Katz","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. You may go ahead.","Patrick Davitt","Good morning. Thank you. My first one is on the, I guess the expected uptick and fee rates from Oppenheimer. I know it's tough to do exactly, but my rough math suggests the full quarter uptick was something in the range of 3 basis points. And I think you guided to 4.5. Am in the right ballpark there and is there a reason to change the expectation for that 4.5 basis point uptick on a full run rate basis?","Loren Starr","We still have in the model an assumption of roughly 2 basis points being lost due to sea breakages, you remember Patrick. And so we still don't know if that's going to be fully the case. But at this point, not able to say that it's not the case. And so I would still assume that there is, that $45 million kind of loss going to happen at some point, particularly as we at some point potentially rationalize products and so forth. So the way that I'd be thinking about it we were 39.1 in Q2. We'd expect to see our basis points climb roughly 2 basis points into Q3, maybe a little bit sort of higher into Q4. So that would be our thinking sort of 40, 41.2 to 45 in that range for the last half of this year.","Patrick Davitt","Okay, thank you. And then on China, obviously good to see the traction there and obviously in some higher fee products. Could you walk through in more detail a little bit what's driving that uptick in inflows? And if you see that run rate accelerating at a similar rate going forward? And then finally any nuances to the sharing of those economics given how they are distributed?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. China is a fundamental strength of ours. It has been for a long time. But what you are seeing now is the growth is just incredible and it was always an opportunity, but now it's literally happening, it's happening at both levels. The institutional level there we're managing money for the sovereign wealth funds etc. But the joint venture is amazing situation right now, Invesco Great Wall. The flows continue to grow and we expect that to continue. And then probably the thing by most unique is we're the only foreign money -- managing money for and financial that money fund and what's happened post that is then adding on traditional long only equity fixed income capabilities. So what they call the e-commerce platforms are very strong and for us is from nothing to a number two distributor in China right now. So we see nothing but ongoing success in China.","Loren Starr","Yes. I'd say, I mean, about half of our flows are coming from those digital distribution channels. The economics on those channels are somewhat similar to what they are for the banking channel. So there is no sort of free gift here, but ultimately, we're very well positioned to continue to drive those types of products through and the overall fee rate in China in particular as well in excess of the firm's overall fee rate. So that dynamic in terms of our ability to distribute our active products into China is one that will have a positive impact, not only on margin and you can see what the margin is on our China Great Wall business, because we provide great detail in our queue and I mean it's in excess of 50%. So you can see that it's going to have a positive incremental margin impact as we grow if we're successful and we expect to be grown in China and our China business.","Patrick Davitt","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.","Kenneth Lee","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on the AUM breakage. Wondering what key factors drove the updated thoughts for being meaningful less the $10 billion? Was it just the transition of the state of New Mexico or was there anything else?","Loren Starr","So I think we announced some changes around our portfolio teams with respect to Oppenheimer and Invesco as we brought the two firms together. And again, it was relatively minor in terms of kind of the overlap as we had hinted. But now that we've sort of fully got our arms around that, the impacted assets are really not large and so when we think about fee breakage due to those changes, the $10 billion is well in excess of what is reasonable to think about. So it's really just understanding what ultimately, we're able to do around those investment teams and ultimately there'll be a follow-up impact on some products in terms of mergers of products and product rationalization. But the overall impact of AUM is not large.","Kenneth Lee","Okay, great. And then just one follow-up; in terms of the alternatives AUM, wondering what key factors drove the outflows there. I think you mentioned in the past there were some elevated outflows in the GTR product. Just wondering whether you still saw that in this quarter? And if so, could you give us a sense of what fund flows were in alternatives, excluding the GTR? Thanks.","Loren Starr","So it actually wasn't GTR, it was mostly the senior bank loan. So that was a massive outflow industry-wide where obviously large. It was about $2.3 billion of outflow for our senior loan business across the ETFs and the actively traded accounts. GTR was $1.3 billion out. So there was something there, but it was not the biggest piece and ultimately, I think GTR flow picture is not one that we are hugely concerned about. There has been some strong improvement year-to-date on the performance, I mean even though it's underperforming on a three-year basis. It actually performed extremely well in some of the most volatile months, doing exactly what it was supposed to do in terms of protecting downside. So we feel reasonably good about protecting the GTR franchise and not seen it so to continue to be a source of significant outflow.","Kenneth Lee","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. You may go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning guys, thanks for taking the question. Loren, I think you had said that 41.2 to 41.5 basis points is the updated expectation for the revenue yield. Does that replace the previous 41.5 and it's just like you guys have a little more granular detail on it now? And so that's why there is an update and why would that rate move up from 3Q, just overall that's a little confusing to me?","Loren Starr","So I think what I was looking at was net revenue yield. So excluding performance fees, it's probably more flat when you think about where the timing is. So you can think about somewhere between sort of 41, as I mentioned 41.2, 41.5 just kind of the 41.5 pickup is just the performance fee impact, which is again are normally sort of weird and lame approach to and forecasted performance fees, which is not very accurate.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. So the 41.2 to 41.5 is not fee revenue ex-performance fees, but it's all in fee revenue?","Loren Starr","The all-in fee revenue, yes.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, got it. So when we look at it like-for-like versus the previous because I think the 41.5 that you guys gave last time was for run rate fee revenue ex-performance fees. So is --","Loren Starr","Right. So again, we've had some outflow. We've said we've had some mixed dynamics that worked against us. So this is kind of where we're landing right now based on today.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, I got it. That's helpful. And then just definitionally understanding some of the deal related breakage in the $10 billion that you guys updated. Is this just when a client indicates that the reason, they are redeeming is due to the deal and therefore it's sort of a high bar to clear in order to get that notification because it certainly seems like from the outside. And if you guys if I'm misunderstanding this, I'd love to hear clarification, but it definitely feels like flows have deteriorated since the deal got announced, it feels like that I recognize 4Q was really tough and volatile and it's been a tough time, but it also feels like especially versus where the run rate was previously on an asset-flow basis it's deteriorated and so isn't some of that probably deal related and the clients just aren't telling you? Maybe you could help me understand that a bit.","Loren Starr","I mean this is impossible to really know. But we look at our outflows relative to the industry outflows and we try to explain how much of the outflow is due to the industry. We also obviously look at our performance and we can explain some of the outflow due to performance. We can explain 80% to 90% of the outflows we're seeing in the Oppenheimer deal due to industry flows and due to performance. So we're not having to attribute nor is it fair to attribute it to the deal. Again, if anyone tells us it's still related, we'll put it into that $10 billion. But we do think that mostly what is happening is due to industry kind of outflows and the performance on certain key large products.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is actually Brian [ph] filling in for Alex. Marty. I wanted to come back to your comments around the divergence between margins and fee rates and how flows into ETFs are actually supportive of the incremental margin. Can you give us sort of similar color around the margin impact for back to the equity book and the active alternative book because I think what we're trying to do from our seats is marry the idea that if you have outflows from what we would, what we see as higher fee buckets. What impact that would have on the margin.","Loren Starr","Yes, I can answer that Brian. It is actually very similar. I think there is always been this perception that lower fee rate products must mean lower margin, I mean that's been sort of the knee jerk on most people when they were bemoaning the dropping fee rate. But the reality is the incremental margin if you are able to grow off an existing portfolio team, I mean, you're not having to add a lot of resources to be able to do that. So the economics are similarly excellence and higher than the firms overall average. So as long as we can sort of grow assets both in active and passive, we're going to see the fee rate and the incremental margins in that 50% to 65% range. I mean again it varies a little bit tend to team region to region, but overall, it's fair to say that it's very similar.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, okay. And then maybe just one more. We've talked a fair amount about the UK business but if you could come back to that for a second there feels like now all of a sudden there is potential for increased regulatory pressure there potentially around some of maybe the way funds are structured, can you give us a little bit of color on what's been the potential impact on your fund flows for the quarter, particularly in UK. And then if any of that was related to some of the issues that were also associated with funds.","Martin Flanagan","No. Look I, we don't see that sort of conversation about the regulatory where it might end up is impacting our flows. I mean it was really has been as we spoke previously its risk-off environment and people in particular hate UK equities just with Brexit overhang and again what we see is the real opportunity for us in the UK. It's a very important market for us. We will continue to be. There have been obviously important headwinds because of Brexit and as we've said we really saw come to light just really last year. It's real in the marketplace and that's where the reactions are, but again I think what we've done, our competitive position with Intelliflo and the impact on flows now it's going to probably kick-in much more Q1 next year, but we'll start to see probably in Q4 beginning of inflows through various models on [indiscernible]. Again, it just puts us in a very different place competitively than the other organizations we compete with there.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe, if I could just go back to the Oppenheimer flow situation really from the sales side in terms of just the trajectory of what you're doing there and if whether we can see that potentially reversing the outflows. And if you can talk a little bit about the distribution, actually the sales force; just the size of that sales force now versus before the deal. How much that's expanded and whether there's been any change in composition either across geography footprint or greater strength in any particular distribution channel and then the status of the work on launching the Oppenheimer products institutionally as well as listing in Europe?","Martin Flanagan","Let me start. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we anticipate the retail products be available outside the United States in October. Institutionally, we're just going through, we call market readiness right now with a number of the Oppenheimer teams. So we'll be in market very shortly. Here already there's been some meetings out in Asia with the teams. So that's all underway. I'll make a comment and Loren speak more specifically of the size. But the US retail distribution force as I said, it's the most talented group of individuals that I've ever been associated with. They're very focused at in-market and focusing on different channels and what we had in the past. Within it, high net worth being one of the areas and again, we just think we're positioned very strongly in that market.","Loren Starr","Yes. I mean I'd say, I mean, it's been a huge effort, obviously the amount of training that had to happen, it has been significant. I mean there have been tens of thousands of hours of busy person and sort of training to get everyone up to speed on the products and the regions and kind of how things work in the combined organization. There has been significant work on the brand and sort of positioning and the digital campaigns with respect to our products and having people understand the combined organization versus the two what it was previously as two separate ones and we are beginning to really get real connection with placements and investment wins, particularly where consultants historically had missed the opportunities of previous firms because of the gaps we had in product capability, combined we have now sort of the full set of capabilities.","So again, I think it's still as we said early days and so we really think we're going to see the ability to grow our sales number off of maybe what you see as a second quarter level. Just how successful we're going to be is, we'll see it when we see it. But we do think it's material and we do think that there is far more upside off of the levels that we're currently seeing. In terms of the other part that we're very excited about is the European opportunity, those products. I think we're ready to go at the end of September, sometime in September. So that's something that you will actually begin to see some activity in flows coming off of those products, hopefully this year.","Brian Bedell","And how big is the sales force increase and the wholesale in fact?","Loren Starr","Just, I mean it was a modest increase. I think there was some change in composition with more use of hybrid sort of crossing between regional and I'm sorry, internal and external or where the hybrids are coming in, but I mean there wasn't a dramatic increase in the net side, it was really just the talent and the skill-set of the people that we retained.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And then maybe just lastly Marty on, just your view on the [indiscernible] active non-transparent ETF. Maybe first of all, just holistically what you think of the ability for that product? Do you significantly help active flows for the industry and then you're in position at Invesco, whether you're ready to launch those products as early as by year-end or early next year?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. Look, I think the excitement around it is ahead of the reality of the impact and I think you're starting to pick that up. I think it's a very interesting vehicle and again we will be willing to participate in our own way in that. But we don't anticipate it being frankly a big change in the industry anytime soon.","Brian Bedell","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.","Michael Cyprys","Good morning, thanks for squeezing me again. Just wanted to circle back on some of your commentary around retail solutions. I guess maybe more broadly as you think about retail solutions, model portfolios, Jemstep, Intelliflo, if you could just update us today on how meaningful those are in terms of AUM flows and revenue at Invesco? What the pipeline looks like and can you talk about some of the actions that you're taking over the next six to 12 months for those initiatives to accelerate?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. So let me start with Jemstep. So still main channel focused, we're now -- as I've said in the past it's literally an application, but you install it literally is integrated into the client's infrastructure, so it does take longer to do that. So that's starting to happen right now. We're anticipating probably into next year when we'll start to see something more material there. Intelliflo is further ahead, 35% market share in the United Kingdom between and telephone Jemstep. There are opportunities outside of the United States and the UK that we're looking at right now. So again, I would say 2020 you're going to start to see flow impact from the combination of those two.","Loren Starr","I mean, so most of the revenues are coming from Intelliflo. It's showing up in our service and distribution fee revenue line. I mean, so those numbers are becoming larger as the business is growing $10 million plus kind of levels. It is one that we have not really used this NPS capability out where you could actually see Invesco products find their way in these model portfolios. The total AUM for Intelliflo is about $450 billion in assets right now and it continues to grow just in the UK. So obviously the impact for us being successful with that activity would be material in terms of assets under management and revenues. So there is a reason to be excited about how this is going to go up.","Michael Cyprys","Okay, great. And just as a quick follow-up on the MassMutual relationship bump. What sort of conversation and dialog are you having with MassMutual regarding the cross marketing and synergies from that relationship? And in your view what would successful look like say three years from now with respect to that relationship in the revenue synergies, how meaningful?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, very strong relationships and the teams are -- both teams are working very diligently and probably half a dozen different initiatives right now. They range from the obvious with their sales force of 8,500 here in the United States and opportunities they are co-product development things in the general account we're having a conversation with and also looking at there is some related things we can do with their insurance capabilities and our money management capabilities. So we're well into it and how big could it be, we'll just have to see, but they're a great partner and they are actually dedicated to success of between the two organizations and frankly very excited about it. You'll hear more specifics in a not too distant future.","Michael Cyprys","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. You may go ahead.","Robert Lee","I just want to talk a little bit about the leveraging of Oppenheimer. I know historically mutual fund track records management haven't really translated into the institutional business or the SMA business. So I mean how do you feel about the extend you're trying to leverage that platform through other channels. I mean is it really trends that transferable to other strategies and other markets or where do you think the do you thinking that the real leverage is a kind of retail outside the US?","Martin Flanagan","No, not just retail. I think what has our experience been and things that will transfer be successful. It really depends on the long-term track records, but really not just that, but the asset class itself. And as I was saying that from the beginning of this, if you look at the capabilities that came over, they are in-demand capabilities. So they have a got a great global equity capability. Global equity is not that attractive here in the United States. Outside of the United States, it's very attractive at the institutional level. And that is one of the areas we're having conversations. There is emerging markets equity, emerging markets debts to other areas where there's institutional demand. And frankly, there's not enough high quality managers in those areas. And so if you look at the combined firm right now, we're very, very strong in emerging market equity. Obviously, we're one of the most important franchises in the industry there. You look at things if you want to get sort of basically have the bank loan capabilities with ours. It is arguably the top in the industry and those are things that are not just in the United States, but outside of the United States, too. So you really have to look at, we keep talking about the makeup of the asset classes that came over. There are really important asset classes that many institutions are interested in them also and not just the retail channel outside of the States.","So again for us if it's going to happen it's just when is it going to happen and just from my past experience, we're further ahead than we've ever been in the combination. And at this time, we're literally in market trying to make things happen where more often than not, you don't start something like that till six months after closing a combination of size. So I can't tell you what quarter we're going to start to see the flows, but we've done everything possible to be in market making impact right now.","Robert Lee","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.","Chris Harris","Thanks guys. If we look at retail investor behavior here in the US, as you know the stock market has gone up a lot, but equity flows in the industry are pretty weak, as you know, a lot of flows going into bonds. And your judgment why our investors behaving this way and really more importantly is your commentary about US sales picking up predicated on investors increasing their risk appetite from here?","Martin Flanagan","Let me hit the last. So, no, it's not predicated on investors changing their appetite. I didn't say that simply because of the depth and breadth of our capabilities. There are very few asset classes that we don't have strong capabilities and so regardless of market, yes that's a topic. You're asking the very important question of what's happening, why our investors stayed away from US equities probably in particular. Look, it's 10 years after the market bottom, I still think investors have been -- retail investors in particular focused on cap weighted indexes. Quite frankly, I think they have too much exposure to it and retail investors that is and you saw what happened in Q4 last year and I think you just again have to look at the narrowness of the equity market and the difference in the value growth trade and that's really where the money is going right now and that is we've said and I'm sure you have too. We hope retail investors understand what they own. It will change and but when will it change, probably after correction in my investment.","Operator","And that was the last question.","Martin Flanagan","Okay, thank you everybody for the questions and I look forward talking to you next quarter. Have a good rest of the day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. All participants may disconnect. Thank you for your participation."],"12664":["Invesco Ltd.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Martin Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director of investments. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you very much and thank you everybody for joining us. Again, if you're so inclined that presentation that we'll be addressing is on the website. So please feel free to follow if you'd like to.","So we'll cover the business results for the fourth quarter today. Greg is going to go through the investment highlights, but also talk about the environment and also what the combined investment firm will look - the investment potential also look like. And Loren will go in greater details on our financials. And then finally, I'll give an update on where we are with the Oppenheimer combination.","So turning to highlights on page five, there's no question that the fourth quarter is very challenging for the industry and for us. Eight out of ten asset classes were negative territory 2018. It's the worst on record in decades, and 74% of all listed companies were in their market territories. So again, much more difficult than I'd say that we've generally understood in the marketplace. And if you look at our fourth quarter results, we were not immune to the impact of these market dynamics.","The good news was gross sales were up, that's a nice health indicator, but absolutely, we had net flows during the quarter, driven by these market dynamics and a big risk off move by many investors around the world. It was further impacted by a number of our key investment capabilities have relative under performance with those with a value bias during that period of time. We did purchased $300 million of stock during the quarter. That's from the $1.2 billion stock buyback program we announced last October. And again I mentioned, Loren will get into the financials in just a minute.","As we have previous talked about, over the past few years, we've been actively repositioning the company to what we think are the opportunities in the market. There's no question that Oppenheimer is an important part of this work and will greatly accelerate our activities. And we'll talk about that more specifically in a few minutes. I do want to make the point we are on track to hit our $475 million of synergies and we're making meaningful progress towards hitting the close in the second quarter of this year with Oppenheimer. And we will revisit the financial returns with a combination, because of the fourth quarter being so difficult and you'll see they're very, very compelling still.","And so with that Loren, you want to.","Loren Starr","Yes. Thank you very much, Marty. So on slide six, you're going to see a summary of the results for the fourth quarter. 54% and 63% of actively managed assets were in the top half of peers over the three and five year periods, while the one year numbers dropped a bit to 41%. We did see significant performance improvement in December and into 2019. And Greg is going to talk about that a little bit later in the presentation.","While gross sales are up nearly 27% versus the prior quarter, the market dynamics that Martin talked about, and some near-term performance challenges continue to set redemptions at a higher than normal level. Total long-term net outflows were $20.1 billion for the quarter, significantly contributing to this results were just a small number of larger institutional client redemptions.","Adjusted net operating income was $300 million for the quarter, down from $358 million in the prior quarter. The lower revenue environment also impacted our adjusted operating margin, which decreased to 32.6% from 37% in the prior quarter. We did returned $422 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter through $122 million of dividends and $300 million of buybacks.","So now let's look at the long-term flows found on page seven. For actively managed strategies outflows remained elevated in Q4. This was particularly true for our U.S. and UK retail equity products, which faced some investment performance headwinds. Active flows were also impacted by a handful of institutional outflows, for example in October we experienced a $5.5 billion low fee mandate redemption associated with a single client.","Our passive flows were also somewhat mixed in the quarter, we saw good sales into our European S&P 500 bullet shares, low volatility and ultra-short duration ETFs. However this was more than offset from outflow due to $1.2 billion of naturally maturing bullet shares at year end and $1.7 billion in negative flows from our senior loan ETF.","The strength of our pipeline was reflected in our institutional results as gross sales were up more than 80% versus Q3. The single account $5.5 billion low fee outflow that I mentioned previously drove us into negative net flow territory. The strength of our gross sales was well diversified and led by real estate stable value, fixed income and quantitative equity products.","I'd also like to note that while you don't see it on these charts we benefited from strong flows into our great wall JV money market products, which added nearly $3 billion in inflows in the quarter.","Next, turning to slide eight, our assets under management decreased by $927 billion or 9.5 percentage points, which reflects the impact of negative market returns and long-term outflows. Our net revenue yield excluding performances fees was down 0.3 basis points to 38.6 basis points. This decline was driven primarily by the negative impact of FX end market on our AUM mix, which was partially offset by an increase in the day count and higher real estate transaction fees and other revenues.","Let's move to slide nine, where we provide our U.S. GAAP operating results by quarter. My comments today will focus on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which can be found on slide 10. But before turning to those results, one item I want to highlight on our U.S. GAAP financials for the quarter is a new expense line item named transaction integration and restructuring expenses.","This line item includes transaction related costs for acquisitions, as well as integration and restructuring related costs. You might remember in fact that we use the same line annual approach when we did the Van Kampen acquisition given the size of that deal and given the size of the Oppenheimer deal.","The presentation to prior period business combinations and optimization amounts has been also reclassified to be consistent with the current period presentation. And finally, I would like to note that this reclassification has absolutely no impact on total operating revenues, total operating expenses or net income on a GAAP or on a non-GAAP adjusted basis.","So now let me just turn to page 10 for our non-GAAP results and you'll see that our net revenues decreased by $47.7 million or 4.9% quarter-over-quarter to $19.2 million. This decrease primarily reflects a lower average AUM for the quarter, partially offset by higher performances primarily earned from our European real estate investment teams.","Our adjusted operating expenses at $619.2 million increased by $10.1 million or 1.7% relative to the third quarter. The expense increase quarter-over-quarter was driven by about $10 million of seasonally higher marketing expenses, which were focused on new fund launches in the UK, ETF offerings in Europe and our U.S. efforts including a focus on our bullet share ETF products.","We also saw a $5 million of higher run rate outsource administrative costs - administration costs that's associated with our digital platforms and outsourcing of our back office services. And then finally about $6 million in non-recurring G&A expense from professional services in Q4 as well as there was a large VAT credit that we recognized in the third quarter. These expense increases were partially offset by about $15 million less in variable compensation expense.","Our adjusted non-operating income decreased $32.6 million compared to the third quarter largely reflecting the negative mark to market on our seed investments during the quarter. In terms of the firm's effective tax rate increased to 25%, primarily resulting from the impact of these unrealized mark to market losses. And that brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.44 and our adjusted net operating margin of 32.6 percentage points for the quarter.","Next, just turning to slide 11. So let me say that when Oppenheimer joins Invesco in Q2 of this year, as you know we plan on reducing the total expense base of the combined firms by roughly 15%. Clearly that will represent a significant spending reduction. However, given the challenging revenue environment that we're currently experiencing, we're implementing a number of immediate cost control measures that should help to limit the negative impact to our operating results, while we continue to focus on the integration efforts.","These efforts are consistent with our historical approach when we manage through extreme volatility like we've been seeing. Some of these actions include deferring new hiring, canceling open requisitions when possible, limiting discretionary non-client travel conferences, training and the slew of other professional service expenses, as well as assessing all other areas of spend for additional opportunities.","So in addition to the mentioned activities, we are also working hard to accelerate many of the Oppenheimer synergies and the combined synergies of the firms that we plan on delivering upon close. This is the topic that will be covered in greater detail in a few minutes.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Greg.","Greg McGreevey","Thank you very much, Loren. There's a couple of key topics that I'd like to cover today just to set the stage. First, I want to cover investment performance for Invesco as a standalone firm and provide some color on our long-term investment performance. And within that context, we'll look at some early signs of improvement.","Second, I want to highlight the significant benefits that we believe we'll achieve through our combination with OppenheimerFunds. And finally, I'll highlight how the expansion of our capabilities with the addition of OppenheimerFunds will enable us to provide better outcomes to clients and that's something we're very excited about.","So if you can turn to slide 13, we'll just take a quick look at performance overall. And as Loren referenced earlier in his remarks, on this slide, this chart shows our one, three and five year peer relative performance on a relative basis to peers for our assets under management for the entire firm.","And as you can see, our long-term performance remained strong with 63% of our overall actively managed assets in the top half of our peer group. In total, our five year performance has remained strong despite challenging market conditions that Marty referenced, to which you're all aware of over the past 18 months.","Favorably and what's not on the slide, we had 40% of our total actively managed assets in the top quartile of our peers on a five year basis, which speaks to our long-term capabilities and a reflection of our quality investment teams.","So let's turn to the next slide to look at early signs of improvement in our investment performance. If you look at slide 14, the market for much of 2017 and 2018 was one fueled by growth and momentum, which should not benefit active management. Our investment team stayed the course, reflecting our strong belief that discipline is critical to producing repeatable alpha through market cycles.","As you look at recent investment results, while it's still early days, we're seeing significant performance improvement in a number of areas. So let me provide a couple of touch points. On the upper left hand portion of this slide, we show our total U.S. mutual fund assets. On a one year trailing basis, performance in the top half of peer groups improved from 11% to 42%, that's the end of November of last year to the middle of January of this year. We've also seen significant improvements in the performance of our largest mutual funds in the U.S.","As important, we're seeing material improvement in the one year peer relative rankings for several strategies that have experienced the greatest flow challenge, as highlighted on the right hand portion of this slide. Specifically, diversified income moving from 88 percentile to 18 percentile on a one year basis; international growth moving from 66 percentile to 46 percentile; developing markets moving from 74 percentile to 46 percentile and UK income moving from 88 percentile to 37 percentile. Again, this improvement was achieved by investment teams staying true to their philosophy and approach.","Now, while six weeks is not necessarily a trend that we recognize the short-term nature of that, we're encouraged by this early improvement in our performance, a continuation of which we believe would set us up for better flow experience in the coming months.","Let me now turn on the next slide to the combination with OppenheimerFunds from an investment perspective. And on slide 15, upon closing the transaction, Invesco will be better situated than it's ever been to serve clients with a more complete comprehensive array of world class investment teams and capabilities that can produce strong relative performance over a market cycle.","Specifically, we believe we'll be better positioned to provide the following benefits to clients post-closing. One, have a stronger deeper investment organization; two, have complimentary investment capabilities that will drive enhanced and more stable long-term investment results; and three, have greater sources of alpha to better align with client needs across the globe and in different channels. So now I wanted to cover these points in more detail given their importance.","Touching on the first of these three points on slide 16. It's very clear that will be better off together that we would as a separate organization. Oppenheimer brings world class investment teams and high demand and high alpha potential asset categories like global equity, emerging markets and international equities. As can be seen from the right hand portion of this slide.","The combination significantly enhances our scale within the U.S. mutual fund market, which will afford us greater platform access and relevance to clients. And we think this is critical in the retail channel as intermediaries are looking to partner with fewer firms. This increased size and scale will also provide greater access to capital markets, which we believe is important and obtaining greater access to deal flow, research and firm exposure.","So if we can now turn to slide 17. As mentioned earlier, Oppenheimer brings very strong performance track records, which improves our combined position in the marketplace. Moreover history suggests our complimentary investment styles and capabilities will produce stronger and more stable investment performance on a combined basis. And the chart on this page supports that assertion. So I wanted just to give you a little bit of backdrop on it.","If you look at rolling three year performance since 2010, the batting average for having 60% or more of our U.S. retail assets under management in the top half of the peer group would have been 66% of the time for Invesco standalone, 83% of the time for Oppenheimer standalone and 89% of the time for the combined firm. And this improved performance for the combined firm over the standalone firms would have shown similar results even if the threshold were made higher.","So driving home this point, Oppenheimer's performance is often Z when Invesco's performance is A and vice versa. Indicated by the fact that the performance between the two firms has been inversely correlated for the vast majority of time since 2010. And what this means from our perspective is the transaction better positions us to promote products and solutions with stronger combined performance through the full investment cycle.","So let me now turn to the final slide in my section on 18. And as we discussed, the expansion of our investment capabilities will provide us with an all-weather product suite to better meet the needs of our clients across the globe. And specifically, having a more diverse set of strategies will improve our ability to meet the unique and varied needs of clients on a product-by-product basis. And in addition to that having greater sources of uncorrelated alpha will enable us to better customize outcome oriented portfolios and deepen our partnership with clients.","We think this represents a massive opportunity for us to increase our relevance to clients by leveraging this enhanced product suite with our leading solutions capabilities across our global distribution network within both retail and institutional channels. So with all this, we could not be more excited about the opportunities created, because of this combination and the positive impact it will have on our clients globally.","So I'm now going to turn the call back over to Marty.","Martin Flanagan","Thanks, Greg. So if you turn to page 20, I'll pick up there and just spend a minute talking about an update on Oppenheimer and to level set, let me put in a context of what I talked about earlier. We have been aggressively repositioning the business over the last number of years, where we think clients are going and where the industry is going. And we've done this by focusing on strengthening our leadership positions in core markets, while at the same time investing in areas where we see rapid growth and client need, ETFs, China, digital platforms, factors, et cetera. You all know that quite well.","But let's put Oppenheimer in the context of that. And it's really the combination of Oppenheimer and the relationship with MassMutual that will accelerate this work. Clearly, we get an expanded leadership position in the U.S. wealth management channel with Oppenheimer, it is actually very important, it is the largest pool of assets in the world and most competitive and being relevant to those client matters enormously. It will strengthen our ability to execute in a number of these high growth areas that we've talked about in the past.","And also and I think very importantly, in particular, in light of this market where we talked about it before you can actually see the unique opportunity for us to create greater operating leverage and scale throughout combining the two organizations.","We're going to do this by using the framework that we used in the past, it served very, very well I'll get in the greater detail about in a minute, but it does the obvious, it's eliminating complexity, location optimization, focusing on rationalization platforms and the like. Yes you save money, but quite frankly we generate greater resources and build a better business and that's the point that I want to drive home as we talked about this.","So let me give you an update on where we are during the quarter, an awful lot got done during the quarter and I want to thank everybody in both organizations it's been quite exciting and a lot of good things have been happening. So I do want to start by making a point that confirming the synergy target that we talked about initially $475 million we feel very confident about that and we also feel very confident that we're going to be a stronger business coming out of it.","Greg's comments highlight some of that in particular, there is no question we'll be a stronger more talented organization post the close, which is what we have been focused on from day one. I also want to reiterate a key element of the value of the transaction is really the highly complementary initiative investment team, which Greg artfully described in a very clear way.","The Oppenheimer investment teams are really excited to be the part of the combine firm. They do have a strong retention program in place, which is important now. But the reality is it's the culture in the combine firm and feeling impart of something important and special that matters and collectively I think we are making that happen as an organization.","A very important milestone happened during the quarter and that was the OppenheimerFunds Board of Trustees approved the transaction. And this is foundational and a real catalyst for us to achieve the synergy targets that we've talked about initially. The mutual fund proxies have been filed with the SEC that will be in the market soon as you know that becomes another gating factor to close. And then finally, we are actively engaged with MassMutual future partnership opportunities. So again, very good progress during the quarter.","Let's turn back to the financials. We wanted to come back and sort of recap the financials in light of that very, very difficult fourth quarter. I think what you'll see is they remained stunningly compelling still, so if you - EPS accretion remains very strong if you look on a pro forma basis, it'll add $0.10 in 2019 and that's assuming the close, so for Q3 and Q4 so half of the year.","When you look at 2020, we expect the accretion to be $0.52 per share and if you look at assets under management at 12\/31\/2018, the IRR 16% it is down three percentage points from time of announcement, but again extremely strong returns in light of the market that we've just been through. And as a result of the combination and inclusive of the expected run rate synergies of $475 million if you looked at 2020 we'll add more than $800 million EBITDA we have an operating margin in excess of 40% and the combined annual EBITDA will be $2.5 billion.","So again, in light of a very, very difficult fourth quarter the financial returns are very compelling to shareholders to say nothing of a firm just being dramatically stronger than prior to the transaction.","So let's spend a little more time go in a greater detail on the synergies. And on page 23 we've laid out the various categories for the opportunities that are emerging. We have robust plans in place heading towards closing and through execution many of which are in execution, consolidating key platforms, addressing overlap in areas such as distribution, consolidating the product support functions and moving to common technology and infrastructure plan. So well underway right now and these are the areas where we see the emerging synergies coming from.","Some of this will be done by day one and other activities will accelerate post close due to regulatory reasons not permitting us to get start ahead of time or frankly a very important part of mitigating our client experiences. All of these activities continue to drive further decisions helping us further refine our location strategy, reduce complexity in the organization, identifying a stronger talented group of people with the organization and the reduced cost and benefits for clients and shareholders ultimately.","And I do want to reiterate, we're taking advantage of this very unique opportunity to materially strengthen the combined organization, while gaining operational scale. Those opportunities don't come along very often and this is one of them and our heads are down on it. We are using a framework and approach that has serviced very well in the past and I just want to make the point again I have a high degree of confidence our ability to get the synergy target and the fact that we will be a much stronger organization post close.","So let me sort of recap before up we open up to questions. As you all know, prior to 2018, we had nine straight years of positive net inflows and as we've talked about last year that that was not the case with the negative market dynamics and the various styles of our approaches. We are disappointed to be in net outflows, but it comes with the territory. Greg made the point, we have a high degree of confidence in our investment teams and the performance and yes, we'll continue to strengthen those the market continues to evolve.","That said, we've made great progress in continuing to invest and repositioning our firm ahead of where we think client demand is and where the opportunities are. And I want to reiterate the combination with Oppenheimer will accelerate these efforts, driving further growth in trading scale and client relevance for us as an organization.","Post close, we'll have approximately $1.1 trillion in assets under management, putting Invesco in a very strong position to serve clients grow our business and provide compelling financial returns for our shareholders.","So with that, I will stop and Loren, Greg and I are happy to answer any questions anybody may have. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Mr. Worthington, your line is open.","Ken Worthington","Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. First on expenses, there is clearly seasonality in 4Q for your non-comp expenses, but maybe why weren't you better able to pivot given market conditions when the market started sort of weak earlier in the quarter? And then Loren, were there any pull forwards in expenses from 1Q 2019 or 2019 in general into 4Q, such as the prepaying of marketing or other expenses? And then, I guess maybe lastly, how much cost cutting from your efficiency program was realized in 4Q both actual and the run rate of savings as we go into 1Q?","Loren Starr","So Ken, let's say in terms of expenses, a lot of the expenses related to marketing were planned probably well in advance of being in the fourth quarter. So these are product launches, these are events that have been sort of scheduled and committed to. So there isn't as much sort of near-term flexibility around marketing expense management as you might think.","Obviously, as we got into the more challenging parts of Q4, what we could pull back we did, but it was really not enough time to really move the dial on the market expense. But I would say that generally there's about $10 million of what I would call sort of unusually high run rate levels of marketing expense that should be taken into consideration.","In terms of any pull forward, no, there was nothing pulled forward from Q1 into Q4. Again, I think the Q4 numbers as I've mentioned were punctuated by some higher expenses, particularly around G&A as well, which was about $6 million of probably one-time cost that should be considered in terms of what a true run rate would look like for us.","In terms of the cost cutting, we feel like we're absolutely on track in terms of the optimization. And so in terms of achieving the total goal of run rate expense savings, I think we are at that level, maybe a little bit still going to happen in Q1.","Ken Worthington","Okay, thank you. And just on the balance sheet post Oppenheimer, it seems like some of the feedback that you're getting suggests that investors characterize the preferred as dead and thus see Invesco as a highly levered asset manager. With this in mind, are your thoughts - what are your thoughts about the priorities for cash post Oppenheimer? And does deleveraging take priority over buybacks once the $1.2 billion commitment is complete?","Loren Starr","Great question. So I do believe we're sensitive to the leverage clearly, but we do feel that the $1.2 billion is something that we need to do as part of this transaction, as part of I think the economics. And clearly we may delay some of it a little bit further into 2020 as opposed to accelerating more in the upfront part of it, but we are still intending to complete the $1.2 billion within the two year timeframe that we originally discussed. We are going to be - clearly looking at the leverage ratio, I don't want to say we're blind to it. Markets will have some impact, it's still I don't want to say it's sort of immutable true that we're going to deliver $1.2 billion. If markets really took another downturn, we might think about it again. But right now where we are, we feel very comfortable completing the $1.2 billion per schedule.","Ken Worthington","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Worthington for your question. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.","Craig Siegenthaler","Good morning, Marty. Loren. I just wanted to come back to slide 16, can you provide us an update on the potential to merge the Invesco and OppenheimerFunds that are in the same categories? And I know you didn't include this in the $475 million of expense redundancies, which is mostly focused on back office. But there is a lot of product overlap between the two businesses. So just wanted an update here.","Martin Flanagan","Yes. So that is one of areas that we will not turn our attention to until after close for various regulatory reasons. There's probably going to be less overlap than you imagine in that. But I will say there is opportunity, I'm sure there's opportunity for rationalization. And again, after close, we will come back to you and give you some insights. And again, I wouldn't look at it as just unique to the Oppenheimer transaction. Again, it's a normal practice that we just look at our product shelf and make those decisions.","So, I wish I could give you a more clear update, but we're just not in a position where we can do that.","Craig Siegenthaler","And then my follow up is on the ETF business. You build a large ETF business both organically and through M&A. But the business really didn't participate in the migration to ETFs last year or in the fourth quarter. And I know some of that was the bank loan ETF, but can you give us your view on sort of what happened in 2018 in terms of share loss? And also, how you're positioned for growth in the future?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, look we think this has been a very important undertaking for us. And I think if you just look at where we started and where we are, we think we're very well placed. We do make some important points of - if you look at where the dollars were moving us last year where our lineup was. And as what we said, on the back of Guggenheim we had a lot to build from utilizing","the self-indexing unit and some of the things like bullet shares. The final launches where we think we will be done will be by the end of Q1 of this year. And we feel that we'll be in a very good position to continue to grow. And again I think you're right. So, [indiscernible] other bank loans in life, those are - that's part of what comes with that market.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thank you, Marty.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Siegenthaler. Our next question is from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, guys. Loren, maybe first one for you. Just given your commentary around expenses and more environmental separating it from say the Oppenheimer like synergies throughout the year. Just wanted to get maybe a little bit more granularity on how you're thinking about maybe Invesco like the core expense base going forward relative to say like the fourth quarter run rate?","Loren Starr","Yes, absolutely, Mike. So, I think, I was giving you some points around sort of run rate versus one-time. So let's say there's in my mind, sort of roughly $16 million of expense in Q4 that, I'd say were elevated and more onetime in nature related to specific events that won't recur on a regular basis. So if you were to take that out of the Q4 numbers, I would say our go forward into Q1 will be certainly down, flat to down to that number. So we feel very confident that that number into Q1 is going to be at a lower level run rate wise versus where we are in Q4 ex-those one-time things.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks. And maybe one\u2026","Loren Starr","Wait, Michael, I think, Marty just want to add\u2026","Martin Flanagan","Yes, I understand, and again, we're being very responsible going through Q1. But I do want to - the organization is going full forced to get this combination done. And I think turning your attention to that is really what matters. There are very, very few opportunities where you can literally create a stronger organization and take out 15% of the operating costs around the world. One in fact this is largely is coming from the U.S. And if you put that side by side, very, very few organizations able to pivot like this in an environment.","So again, it's really the capabilities that attracted us Oppenheimer. But when you look at the scale benefits they are material and real. And I think as we said Q4 really sort of highlight that for everybody is beyond the conversation it's actual fact.","Michael Carrier","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Marty, just on the organic growth or the flow outlook. So clearly fourth quarter was tough for everyone. I think in the third quarter you guys had some elevated outflows. Just want to kind of get your maybe perspective on what were some of the more unusual things or things that were more surprising versus when you're looking at 2019 with markets stabilizing you guys pointed to some of the investment performance rebound. Where you're seeing some of the sales traction where you're maybe most hopeful that redemptions could slow to start to turn the trajectory around.","Martin Flanagan","Yes. So let me put in context, and again, we feel that we've built a very diversified business by asset class and by geography. But if you look at last year and if you line up the organization you almost couldn't make it up thing didn't serve us well because of the value capabilities we had. You saw that quite clearly what happened that largely impacted the U.S. mutual fund business. Brexit is a real topic for us and you just saw sterling dropped from I think a peak a 1.44 to 1.24. But if you literally look at EMEA and use mutual funds flows as a proxy in the year they dropped by 87% there.","So, I mean - and then you look at the trade wars and people will point so well there's nothing really happened in there. I can tell you our clients went risk off. We had some very good capabilities Asian equity capabilities that got terminated during that. So the notion that you could have trade for as Brexit. And saying disproportionately impacting an organization like Invesco.","I would not have thought that's possible. It's not an excuse, it's just a reality. And again, I think, importantly, Greg, was talking about the depth and breadth of the investment capabilities, the performances these markets are actually good for active management and we're seeing that.","I don't know if Greg, if you'd add to that.","Greg McGreevey","The only thing I'd add to, when you kind of look at our pipeline overall I think there's maybe a couple of areas where that pipeline is starting to see a pretty significant increase in fixed income as kind of one factor we kind of talked about that before is too. And then pockets of the alternative business overall where clients out there need income when they need returns. So specifically within real estate and we're starting to see after a very troubled kind of fourth quarter within bank loans overall we're starting to see an increase in the interest within kind of bank loans.","So in our solutions businesses really being ramped up given the investment that we've made there. And so we're starting to see a number of things come out of that engagement that we're having with clients. So those would be I think if you just look at our pipeline the kind of areas we've seen an increase.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Carrier. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open, sir.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, Marty, just kind of building upon your comments about the last quarter and kind of the integration of - and how excited you are about the deal. Can you talk about I guess what you're hearing from intermediaries, consultants, your clients about the transaction? And I know you guys have an outflow assumption based on what you gave us last quarter based on the transaction, maybe update us on if there's any changes to that or how you think that may or may not be conservative?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, look I can speak to my very specific conversation if not every single one of them was incredibly positive. So if you just start with the fundamental strength of where Oppenheimer is in the U.S. wealth management platform the notion of those two firms together that we've had nothing, but very, very strong positive feedback for all the reasons that Greg talked about, right. It's depth of capability, type of capabilities it's beyond investment capabilities what can you serve the clients beyond the investment capabilities. So very, very positive.","There is also institutional clients in different parts of the world that are actually very attracted already to a number of the Oppenheimer capabilities emerging markets, global equities to name two of them. So again, we're just getting very good client feedback of Oppenheimer joining us, but also what we can do together. So again from our perspective the next few months can go fast if we want to get those closed.","Dan Fannon","The redemption assumption on the - because of the deal.","Loren Starr","So I think nothing changed in terms of those assumptions, we're still looking at sort of a $10 billion assumption outflow in 2019 after the deal is completed again that's a degree of conservatism. I think in some ways I mean you're seeing a little bit of the overhang on Oppenheimer flows right now as people are waiting for the deal to close.","And so - but again the good news is it seems to be manageable number, it's nothing that is sort of excessive. We are feeling very confident that once we bring the firms together that we're going to be able to improve the redemption experience for both firms quite honesty.","Dan Fannon","Okay. So just to clarify a couple of things on your change in accretion, can you just give us the specific factor of the change, I think the timing closed and I think obviously markets. But also, could you just update us since the announcement what Oppenheimer's outflows have been?","Loren Starr","So again, I think in terms of the biggest change will be the timing so we only have two quarters of accretion versus sort of roughly the three quarters that we had in the prior assumption. Obviously, we're starting at a lower AUM base for the business, which also has impact on both the first year and the second year accretion numbers. Beyond that all the other assumptions are essentially the same in terms of market and so forth.","The outflow for Oppenheimer, I think is roughly a 4% decay annualized. So again, it picked up a little bit as we've entered the fourth quarter and not to be surprised about that one just generally because of the market environment. So we continue to watch it, but as I said there's nothing extreme or alarming at all in terms of the flow pattern that we're seeing so far.","Dan Fannon","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Fannon. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open sir.","William Katz","Okay, thank you very much. I think in your press release you had mentioned and a little bit in your prepared remarks that you're still pursuing some cost containment work as well. I was wondering, if you could maybe potentially quantify that? And then, how sticky is that, in other words if the revenue backdrop were to improve would you relax some of that with maybe some delayed spending on the other side of that?","Loren Starr","So, I mean, in terms of stopping hiring and freezing it that makes a lot of sense for us in the context of a large transaction that is going occur in the second quarter. We are obviously bringing on a fair number of folks to the combined company.","But I would say that, we are really asking people between now and the time of the close to curtail any hires that they otherwise might want to bring in if they are able to without affecting clients or investment performance really the discretionary elements of what we do. And then, sort of services around training, development, really sort of internal thing that can be delayed.","So some of it is just the time based, can we sort of reduce our spend until we get to the point where the biggest event will be sort of reducing 15% of the combined cost of the firms coming together that is by far in a way the bigger impact. We are looking at - I mean, with that said are there sort of longer term opportunities to reduce cost on a permanent basis as opposed to some of the things that we just talked about.","So that is still happening, but those things take longer and again it is going to be impacted by bringing the two firms together, we see a lot of opportunity to do that.","William Katz","Okay. Just as a follow up two part question, so thanks for taking both of them. In your guidance you also mentioned the pro forma EBITDA being $2.5 billion versus previously $3 billion. So I was wondering, if you could unpack that and I guess you gave some of that around the Oppenheimer assumptions. But how much of that comes from sort of the legacy footprint if you will? And then, as we look into the new part of the year any qualitative or quantitative update on how the flows are both at Invesco standalone as well as Oppenheimer?","Loren Starr","So the reduction in EBITDA is really a function of lower AUM for both firms that is just quantitatively what is driving our EBITDA numbers down. Nothing more in terms of sort of unpacking, it's really just lower earnings. I think in terms of sort of the preview into the quarter I think we feel that there's a lot of variability right now. And so, we're sort of hesitant to sort of provide glimpses into the quarter. We think it will be a better result if we can sort of talk about that when we see all three months' completed as we - and you will see the monthly releases as they come through.","William Katz","Okay, thank you very much.","Martin Flanagan","Yes, thanks, Will.","Operator","Thank you for your question, Mr. Katz. Your next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Blostein","Hey, good morning, guys. So maybe just a couple of specific questions, I know we're kind of go through some of these numbers already. But could you guys give us just the Oppenheimer ending AUM revenue run rate and expense run rate where things done today?","Loren Starr","I don't have that detail for you, Alex. Obviously, we have the AUM of 213 to 214, I think is the number that we provided. So, again, I think it will scale down, revenue will scale down, you should expect kind of literally with the AUM.","Alex Blostein","Got you. And in terms of the purchase price. So, understand, obviously, the market conditions got a lot worse. But, the $0.52 accretion in 2020 or 30% below the $0.80 that you provided in the last call. Can you talk a little bit about it, there's any room to negotiate the purchase price I think there was something there as it relates to flows, but was wondered if you could flash that out a little bit.","Loren Starr","Yes, I mean in terms of the flow, there are some contractual sort of adjustments related to outflows between now the close - or the type of close if we aren't successful bringing over client assets as well there's an adjustment there. So it's a pretty significant hurdle for that to kick in.","I think it has to be at least 7.5 percentage points and it's done on a revenue run rate. So - and at that point and below is when the adjustment happens. So anything between 0 to 7.5 there would be no adjustment made on the purchase price. And Marty, I don't know if you want to talk about sort of concept of renegotiating that's not even a thought.","I think we're contractually bound and happy to continue.","Martin Flanagan","Look, I turn your attention to the financial returns that you just put in front of you after a very, very difficult market are quite compelling. And again, we're going to be dramatically stronger firm coming out of it. So\u2026","Loren Starr","I would say, I mean, obviously markets have improved off that point. I think, sort of 3.5 and above percentage points rose where we are. So all those numbers are going to look better in light of just a few weeks of January coming through.","Alex Blostein","Okay, fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your question, Mr. Blostein. Our next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open, sir.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So just to clarify on the triggers that Alex just asked about. I think you said 7.5% decay rate, is that annualized in the period from announcement to close? And while I appreciate that is at a 4% decay rate, a lot of that seem to come in the fourth quarter post the announcement.","It's hard to unpack exactly how - what attributed to that decline, the announcement of the deal versus a very difficult market period. But when you update us on the $10 billion number or did not update the $10 billion number, that's post to close. So it would anticipate potentially some of those outflows happening ahead of close. Can you just sort of flush that out a little bit for us, please? Thanks.","Loren Starr","So, I mean, what we're doing this is taking the 214 assuming flat markets through the close and then $10 billion out, right. So it's not a not a refined sort of when it happens. But if it happens before 214 sort of becomes 200 before the close, it's essentially getting the same place, right.","So it's not a - that we assumed that outflow was almost immediate when it kind of happened - when the deal happen. So I don't think it would affect the deal economics in terms of when the flow happens it's really just the fact that is $10 billion less off of the 214 numbers, right? So that's the assumption that you should be looking at for those deal economics that still work.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And then the 7.5% decay that you required is that annualized?","Loren Starr","So there is two things, so one there's so that you can look at the filed documents in terms of the contract just all the details there and it's probably a little more complicated I'm making. But that's our run rate, that's a 7.5% revenue run rate decline off of what was originally put in place due - purely due to clients not coming over through the deal. So, I think it's just important to note that, again, there's details around that, I don't know if it makes\u2026","Martin Flanagan","It's a common practice, we have these transactions.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And then, when you guys had announced it initially, you had indicated that you had a repurchase that you're going to be executing in between announcement and close. Can you give us an update on your expectations for those repurchases and the timing, et cetera around those?","Loren Starr","So I think we had said originally $400 million to $600 million prior to the close, obviously we've done $300 million of that already and then the rest being done after that. We're still looking at the market; we're looking at what happens to stock price. So, I mean there's all sorts of elements are coming to our repurchase decisions. We're sort of exiting the blackout period, so we're going to be able to begin to transact again in our stock. And again, also just mindful of the leverage ratios and so forth. So we're going to be sort of reasonably conservative around the pace of buyback prior to the close as you would expect.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for taking my questions.","Martin Flanagan","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question, Mr. Hawken. Our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much. Maybe just coming back to the one more in the cost saves of the $475 million. Just to get it clarified, I think I may have missed this, I think you think the deal is now closing closer to the later part of the second quarter. And then, on the expense synergy on that timing through 2020, can you just give us - just reaffirm sort of that trajectory? And then whether you can - whether you think you can actually accelerate those back office saves given the environment? And then, the walk down of the margin from over 45% to 40% post synergy is that all due to the lower AUM and market conditions?","Loren Starr","Yes. So, Marty you can jump in if you want.","Martin Flanagan","Why don't you start, I'll hop on.","Loren Starr","Okay. So, I mean on - so in terms of the $475 million, you should expect that because the close has been delayed effectively a quarter that our timing around capturing synergies is going to be more pushed into the first quarter of 2020, getting that sort of numbers that we were talking about, 75%, 80% of synergies just because of share timing. So that's kind of one point.","I think in terms of the margin, being 40 - around 40, greater than 40, that's all just due to AUM levels. And so the associated impact. Again, that would be better today just because of the lift that we've seen in the markets with respect to both firms. So again, we'll obviously continue to look at those deal economics very sensitive to where markets are, but again hopefully we've sort of hit a bottom and we'll see more upside in these deal economic numbers.","Martin Flanagan","Yes. And I would just add, the platforms and the like. Look, these are big undertakings. Now we do know how to do it, we have a history of doing them well, we'll do them as quickly as possible. But also very importantly, we got to meet - you got to serve your clients, you need to do a good job. So again, I would come back to the big picture. We will hit $475 million, we will hit the margin target as we talked about markets and it's a very unique opportunity for us to frankly build some very important scale into the organization, which we will do.","Brian Bedell","Great. Okay. And then, as you think about the growth - the revenue synergy and growth opportunity, this is going back to your comments about being able to launch new product structures using Oppenheimer investment management talent on those products and also expanding them geographically into Europe where they don't have a big presence.","Is - I guess the spending around those growth initiatives - how do you think about that like the timing of that? Is that something that you would prefer to get a handle first on whether you're going to combine any investment teams and then go about that process or would you rather try to get that product into these new structures and geographies sooner rather than later and maybe sacrifice some of - have some additional expense against that?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, I think the beauty of the combination is the incremental spend is not very much. The quality of the investment teams are there. We have an institutional distributional capability. There is demand for it. So pace will be determined by the clients and their appetite. And as you know institutionally it takes time to go through those processes. Oppenheimer already has a non-U.S. range, a SECOP [ph] range that frankly it's getting it into our distribution capability.","So again, those are things that will come pretty rapidly. I do want to come back to there is no revenue synergies in these numbers from going to the institutional business or the non-U.S. business or anything between MassMutual and ourselves. And that's just fine, but there's none of that in that as we move forward.","Brian Bedell","And just the timing on that, on the expectation of doing those. Is it synergizing that Oppenheimer product? Would you wait for product teams to be combined first or would you kind of just go right out those synergies?","Martin Flanagan","Look, there are already conversations with what the teams and what the opportunities are. And also we're in deep conversation with MassMutual about what we can do. But again, I don't want to set an expectation other than we will execute and what's in front of us. But the combined firm together and a relationship with MassMutual is going to be an important one.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Bedell. Our next question is from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.","Kenneth Lee","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the - just a question on the OppenheimerFunds.","I think on the last call you mentioned that fee rates have been trending upwards over the last few years. Just wondering what's the expectation over the near-term? What factors or mix shift could push that fee rate either up or down? Wonder if you could just give us a little bit more color there. Thanks.","Martin Flanagan","Yes. I'll maybe start and Loren can add. Look it's no different than us. Our effective fee rate what you see trending down it's really - it is a mix shift topic for us. And you would imagine in risk off environments, people putting money and money funds, et cetera that you see that happen.","Oppenheimer during the period had the exact opposite. There was an aggressive or I shouldn't say aggressive quite successful in emerging markets and international equities and those are higher fee capabilities. And again that is sort of the natural flow of things within an organization. So client demand will drive those mix shifts. There's very little we can do about it.","Loren Starr","Yes, and I'd say, I mean from what we can see, their fee rate is very stable. So nothing is really - even though the market has been sort of negative, I think they've continued to offset that through growth in the alternative platform. And so, overall I'd say it's pretty stable.","Kenneth Lee","Got you. And just one a bit of a housekeeping. Some details behind that $5.5 billion LOP mandate redemption you mentioned, which asset categories were those located? Thanks.","Loren Starr","So that was mostly fixed income. There was a little bit of equity component all single-digit basis points.","Kenneth Lee","Got you. Very helpful, thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Mr. Lee. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open, sir.","Patrick Davitt","Good morning, guys. Thank you. Earlier last year before you announce the Oppenheimer deal, there was a lot of focus and chatter from you guys around 2019 optimism on flows from newer initiatives, in particular, Gem Step [ph] getting ramped up with some new distribution pipes. Could you walk through your expectations on that now?","Has the ability for that to generate a little bit more incremental flow changed, or has been pushed out or pulled forward? Now you're really focused on Oppenheimer, but it'd be helpful to get an update on some of that stuff as well.","Loren Starr","Yes. So we're still on track second quarter of 2019 is when are the largest client that we've sort of one business from is going to start using and putting into production the Gem Step capability along with our models. So we will begin to see flows in revenues coming from that immediately into the second quarter. Again, I think it is one of these things that we said is going to build, it's not going to be sort of a flood of revenues and AUM immediately.","But given the size of this client and the breadth and scope of the advisors they're using and how the model they are going to play out, I think it will built into a material number as we get into end of 2019 and into 2020.","The pipeline for Gem Step is still very strong, continues to win business. And so that is, again progressing, but it is as we said slower than anybody would have possibly had originally imagined in terms of the actual going from the design, to production, to execution just takes time.","I'd say the other thing just in terms of the thing that we are excited about around ETFs and institutional business, China factor-based investing, I mean all of these capabilities is growth engines that we so called characterized have just been growing as a percentage of our overall sales every quarter. So we do see that as being an increasingly important factor in terms of our success. And so the investments that we've made, which we've talked about I believe are paying off for us and will even more so into 2019.","Patrick Davitt","I've got a quick follow up. You mentioned Brexit earlier and I think everybody has kind of decided to trying to handicap what happens there, will be vital at this point. But as that plays out through March and April, have you done any work to kind of gauge how much worse the outflows in the UK business could be if it goes bad? And conversely how much better they could be if it goes good?","Martin Flanagan","Yes. So it's a good question. Everybody is doing those types of calculations, but what I would say and I mentioned this earlier, Brexit for our business really didn't become real until this past year in the second half of the year. And as I've - it's just not the UK it's on the continent too. And I mentioned if you look at flows across, it's literally down 87% year-over-year that - it has been risk off environment like you really can't imagine.","So I don't know what's going to happen with Brexit, there are a lot smarter people than me on it. We spend a lot of time on it, it's important to us. But Loren was talking about this quarter if my perspective and the organization's perspective, if you take a no deal Brexit off the table and it looks like there will be some different outcome, I think that would be very positive for investor sentiment, client sentiment and I would imagine we would be in a better position when you look at clients getting back to making investment decisions. That's how we're looking at it.","The other one that is a headwind that we'll see what happens is the trade negotiations between U.S. and China that is a headwind for us. So anything that moves into positive manner is again I think about positive development for us.","Loren Starr","Yes. And maybe just a bit of information. So one, in the quarter, Q4, the UK equity outflow was under $1 billion. Still a big number, but again in terms of overall size of AUM, it's sort of manageable number. And the other point is, we did just because of the uncertainty around the Brexit outcome, we did hedge through the full 2019 using similar strategy that we've used in the past around hedging the operating income for struck at 1.25 as sort of insurance policy.","So if the pound were to drop below 1.25, I would say this insurance policy would protect us on the down side at worst case scenario. So anyway just so people know, we have it through 2019.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Davitt. Our question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Sir, your line is open.","Robert Lee","Great, thank you. And guys thanks for your patience in taking all the questions this morning.","Martin Flanagan","Yes.","Robert Lee","And again sorry to maybe go back to the expense saves, but I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly. So, I guess, what I'm trying to square is - I mean still the expectation of ultimately an 800-ish EBITDA contribution if I have that number correctly with the lower kind of accretion. So should I was simply be thinking that how you're going to still targeting that, but really maybe some of that benefit because of the later close and timing kind of leads it into 2021, so that's why 2020 is kind of coming down. Am I thinking of that correctly?","Martin Flanagan","No. So I just want to be really clear on this. So the accretion numbers that - for 2019 and 2020 that we laid out, it is based on I mean our expectation of getting to close having the two quarters this year full next year. Then the run rate impact of a $475 million through the programs that we outlined that are in place right now. We know how to do this, we've done it in the past. And the only change that drove the EBITDA from $3 billion to $2.5 billion was the market.","And so, there is - we don't expect or believe the reason why the quarter went back was you really have to get - getting through mutual fund approval is just critical. And that happened at the end of the year into January and other than that we're on track. So again, we have a high degree of confidence that we'll get this done.","Robert Lee","Great. And maybe just to confirm the guidance from a share count perspective, basically where you finished post the share repurchase you've done already plus what you're going to issue and that fit kind of no incremental that filling in the rest of the $900 million every purchase between now through call 2020?","Loren Starr","Yes, so I mean again I think let me just specifically your question is, timing of the 1.2 or\u2026","Robert Lee","Well, no more like if I think of 50-ish cents accretion in 2020 you're not - is there additional share repurchase kind of baked into that from this point forward or you just kind of pro forma we are today plus what you're going to issue?","Loren Starr","Yes it's - I mean it's the exact same pro forma where we are today, what we're going to issue and then buyback as just previously described. The 400 to 600 prior to the close and the rest on was in the year after the close.","Robert Lee","Okay, great. That was it, guys. Thank you.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Lee. Our next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Chris Harris","Thank you. Hey, guys. So on the improved investment performance you're highlighting here, I wonder if you can talk about that a little bit more. Is that mainly attributable to the value style investing coming back or is there something else going on? And if it is kind of an improvement in value should we be assuming that potentially about saying then for the Oppenheimer business?","Martin Flanagan","Yes, so Chris thanks a lot for the question. I think there's a couple of things that are going on I think one of which I mentioned in my comments when we're kind of going through the prepared remarks, a lot of it is just the change in momentum driven stocks that were really a big driver of the market. That really changed or started to change when we moved into December and kind of into January. And so it's become over that time period and hopefully that will continue much more conducive environment for active management.","So it's just the stock selection was really the big driver there. And specifically momentum it was driving a lot of stock performance kind of changed if you will there was a component of that that could be a little bit of kind of value in growth, but that really wasn't the biggest component if you will that would contribute to that performance if you will.","In terms of the second part of your question I mean, I think as we kind of highlighted that we're going to zig and they're going to zag, which we think is a really good thing when you look at stock selection and uncorrelated sources about if you will.","So some of their strategies in the very short run they have fallen off a little bit not necessarily specifically related to the fact that value has come more back into it, I think the headline for what we're really trying to point out is when you look historically at our performance and their performance it's very uncorrelated sources of alpha we think that's very important for our clients kind of over the long on.","Chris Harris","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Harris. Our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","Michael Cyprys","Hey, good morning. Thanks for your patience and taking the question. I just wanted to circle back to the strategic partnership that you have with MassMutual. Can you just talk about what that will entail, how formalized it is and how does Invesco - how do you ensure you get what you need from it in say three or five years' time? Just in terms of the level of commitment and alignment. Thank you.","Martin Flanagan","Yes, Michael, this is Marty. So look, we've a very good relationship with them. They have a material interest Invesco and the alignment of interest starts right there and that's not going to move. Roger is very clear about the long-term nature of wanting to be in the asset management business and that's how they view this transaction it was just broadening their exposure to the sector. And what we are right now assuming a big broad range of conversations of what are the things that we could do together that it could make a difference in the marketplace.","And again, I'd rather come back with facts then to get ahead of it and right now we are assuming zero revenue synergies from anything other than the core Oppenheimer business.","Michael Cyprys","Got it. Okay. And then, just if I could ask a follow up just quickly here, on liquidity in the market and the credit cycle just be curious to hear your perspectives on any sort of implication of a turn in the credit cycle just given the buildup in leverage by corporate to cycle with a larger portion going into daily liquidity funds such as high yield bond funds and loan funds many of which you guys manage? So I guess what sort of risk does that present to the industry? And what's being done to mitigate such risk and how do you see this playing out?","Martin Flanagan","So we're looking pretty closely and I think it's probably a very long winded answer to probably address the heart of your question. So we are - we certainly are seeing those things that you kind of referenced play out if you will. I think the main part that we're dealing with is really looking at from a client fiduciary standpoint, the liquidity within our funds, the ability to be able to respond to that liquidity if you will.","I think the size and scale and a comment that I kind of referenced from a capital markets perspective I think is kind of helpful in our ability to get access to the capital markets and be able to hopefully get improved liquidity in areas like that.","So, the implications I think are multifaceted, when you kind of talk about the industry. So maybe in the second time I'll kind of - just kind of stop there in raising your question.","Loren Starr","I would say though in terms of like our bank loan product we saw absolutely no issues in terms of managing through volatile markets and sort of addressing the redemptions. So it was all done really with no issues. Given the way that we manage that product. So again one data point, but probably one that's relevant certainly for Invesco.","Michael Cyprys","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question, Mr. Cyprys. Our last question is a follow up from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.","Ryan Bailey","Good morning. This is actually Ryan Bailey on behalf of Alex. I guess a question for Loren on the standalone Invesco expense base for 2019. So if we look at expenses for 2018 ex distribution looks like it's about $2.4 billion. Can you help us think about where we should be resetting for standalone Invesco given current AUM levels? And then some of the cost initiatives that you outlined excluding what was happening with the deal synergies.","Loren Starr","Yes. So I think I touched on it a little bit when we're sort of looking into the first quarter versus where we are fourth quarter we are - if you look at the $619 million, which was quarterly expenses in Q4 you subtract out the $9 million kind of one-time expenses that I was talking about I mean you're sort of in a $603 million kind of run rate. And we said we're going to be down from that number.","So again - and that first quarter also includes payroll taxes and so forth, which tend to go away. So again it is a little hard to sort of talk about the full year because we're obviously doing this large transaction and that's the plan. And so, we're planning on taking out 15% of the combined business and post close there is no standalone Invesco anymore. So it's really the combined company.","But I would say in terms of thinking about us the run rate guidance that I just provided should give you the right standalone view if you want to just extrapolate that assuming flat markets across the year.","Ryan Bailey","Got it. And maybe just if I can sneak one more in. What's the minimum amount of cash we should be thinking about that you'd need on the balance sheet just given the seasonal expenses you just mentioned for kind of the first half and then any integration costs?","Loren Starr","So again we - again our capital policy has not changed. We are targeting and continue to target $1 billion of cash in excess of what is required from a regulatory capital perspective largely driven by the rules in Europe that requirement in Europe is somewhere between $600 million and $700 million of capital that needs to sort of stay on the balance sheet. And so we'd have roughly $1.7 billion would be kind of the target on a go forward basis.","Ryan Bailey","Got it, thank you very much.","Loren Starr","No problem.","Operator","That does conclude our Q&A session of today's call, I'll not turn our conference back over to Martin Flanagan.","Martin Flanagan","Again I just want to thank everybody for participation in the questions and look forward to speak with everybody soon. Have a good rest of the day.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. And have a great rest of your day."],"12407":["Invesco (NYSE:IVZ) Q4 2011 Earnings Call January 26, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Loren M.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. ","Now, I would like to turn the call over to the speakers for today, to Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin L. Flanagan","Thank you very much, and thank you, everybody, for joining us. First of all, there's a presentation that's on the website if you're so inclined to follow it. As is our common practice, I'll go through the business results for the fourth quarter. We'll hit some highlights of 2011, since it is the end of our year. And Loren will go into the details of the financials and then we'll open it up to Q&A. ","So those that are following the presentation, I'm now on Slide 3. So taking a look at the fourth quarter and some of the overview points. Long-term investment performance remained very strong across Invesco for the fourth quarter with, again, some areas of exceptional performance. Our strong investment performance contributed to the trend of positive long-term flows in spite of what continued to be a very volatile market. During the quarter, we saw long-term net inflows across all distribution channels. ","Also during the quarter, we reduced long-term debt by $105 million, further strengthening our balance sheet. Reflecting the continued confidence in the fundamentals of our business, we purchased $436 million worth of Invesco shares during 2011. In looking ahead, we plan to take advantage of the many strengths of Invesco, continuing to invest in the business and further enhancing our relative position in the marketplace. We also remain focused on providing our clients with solutions to help meet their needs and their financial objectives regardless of the market environment. ","We believe that important parts of the global economy are on the road to recovery over the long term, but expect that the road will remain bumpy in the near term. And consequently, we will continue to be very disciplined in our approach to our business and the markets while investing for the long term. The steps we've taken to enhance our business in 2011 positions us very solidly. As we look into 2012, we expect solid results, but again, as markets improve, our results in 2012 could improve on the back of those markets. ","Taking a look at 2011 on Page 4 now. If you take a look at the accomplishments over the past year, it really provides some insight into the long-range plans of the organization. First and foremost, we remained absolutely focused and committed on delivering strong, long-term investment performance to our clients, which will continue to drive growth in the core business. And in spite of the volatile markets, we further enhanced our business in key areas. As you all know, we've had a focus on Continental Europe. We advanced that business there. Fixed income continues to be an area where we have great strengths, but further strengths our areas of focus of the organization. And again, our very, very strong real estate team continued to see success, and we continued to expand that business in parts of Asia during 2011. We'll continue to invest in capabilities we see where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by continuing to develop that talent or, where necessary, hire world-class talents, upgrade technology platforms, launch new products or provide the necessary resources. Bottom line, we'll continue to do whatever is necessary to continue to improve our competitive position for the benefit of our clients. ","And also during 2011, we increased the number of PowerShares products available to clients in Canada. That continues to be a nice growing part of the business there. We continued to expand our industry-leading balanced risk allocation capability in different parts of the business around the world, different channels, as that continues to be something that is very much desired by clients. And really, the ability to leverage capabilities such as balanced risk or real estate capabilities around the world or different investment management teams that we have is a key differentiator for us as an organization. We expect that to continue to develop over 2012 and in the years to come. ","Taking a look at the fourth quarter results on Page 5. We ended the quarter with $625 billion in assets under management versus $598 billion at the end of the third quarter. Invesco continued to generate strong long-term investment performance for our clients during the quarter, which contributed to the net long-term inflows of $5.6 billion. This further extended the positive trends we've demonstrated over the past several quarters of net inflows. Reflecting the challenges, the volatile market, adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $250 million -- $256 million, consistent with the third quarter. And earnings per share was $0.42 during the quarter, also consistent with the prior quarter. And as I've mentioned, Loren will go into greater detail in just a minute. ","I'd like to turn to investment performance. And on Page 7, you can see our investment performance over 1, 3, 5 years at an aggregate level. It continues to be very, very strong. And the 1-year performance being 71% of assets beating peers, that's the highest percentage since August '09. And on a 5-year basis, 80% of assets beating peers, again, very, very strong. The relative softness in the 3-year number is reflective of some very strong performance rolling off of the fourth quarter 2008 and the brief period where we trailed the market during that -- the beta rally after sort of March '09. But based on the strength of the recovery subsequent to that, we would expect the 3-year numbers to solidify by the middle of 2012. And again, looking at the underlying performance, it really is quite strong. A small number of funds represent some of this underperformance, they're literally only a hundred -- less than a hundred basis points off the 50 percentile. They continue a positive returns for clients during the period. Half of them continue to be in net flows. So again, it's something very, very -- we feel very good about.","Taking a look at quarterly flows. Again, on the back of the strong investment performance, the enterprise contributed to positive flows during the quarter in spite of the markets. And as I mentioned earlier, net long-term flows totaled $5.6 billion for the quarter, but also $24.5 billion for the year. So during the quarter and the year in total, quite strong from a flow basis. ","Taking a look at sales across channel. Gross sales in the retail and institutional channels contributed to the positive flows for Invesco as a whole, and we continued to see positive flows in nearly every part of the global business during the fourth quarter. ","Turning to Page 10. Let's take a look at U.S. retail redemption rates and how we continue to do relative to the industry. And reflecting a very challenging, volatile market, gross sales in the U.S. retail business dropped 15% quarter-over-quarter. Redemption rates, however, continued to outpace the industry, reflecting the differentiation we're achieving with our strong investment performance, the depth and breadth of our investment capabilities and a focused client engagement effort. In spite of the volatility we saw, we believe the combination of solid performance, the number of high demand capabilities will continue to drive good momentum in the business. And by our internal calculations, we're seeing market share increases in gross mutual fund flows increasing relative to the market, of course, but also trending positive over the long term. ","One of the goals that we've talked to you all about is building brand recognition within the U.S. And during 2011, we got after those efforts, and our brand awareness in the U.S. intermediary and advisory market advanced considerably. A recent third-party study showed that, among mutual fund companies, Invesco achieved the most significant 1-year gain in brand penetration in these markets and is now among the top 10. We're not where we want to be nor do we think we are where we need to be. We'll continue to focus on this, and we expect further improvements in 2012. ","As always, I remain very focused on making further progress to achieve the full potential of the U.S. franchise. All the indications, all the trends look quite positive, and we feel very good about where we are going with that part of the business. ","I'm going to stop there and turn it over to Loren.","Loren M. Starr","Thanks very much, Marty. So turning to Slide 12, you'll see during the quarter, we generated total net flows of $6 billion, with $5.6 billion being long-term, and there was $0.4 billion from Money Market. And similar to Q3, the aggregate flows reflected continued strong client demand for ETFs and other passive products. If you just look at the actively managed assets within the mix, we saw demand grow for the balanced risk and other income-oriented products in the quarter. And that was offset by outflows and active equities, again, as market volatility generally kept clients on the sidelines for these riskier assets. ","With that said, however, we are pleased to see the markets and FX working in our favor as we approached year end. And we added $20.9 billion to our assets under management. And this, quite honestly, is a very stark contrast to Q3 where we lost $57.5 billion in AUM to these same factors. So the resulting increase in AUM quarter-over-quarter was $26.9 billion or 4.5%, leaving us with $625.3 billion AUM at the end of the quarter. It is interesting to note, however, that our average AUM for Q4 ended 1.7% lower than Q3 since we started the quarter at $598.4 billion in AUM, which is, in fact, the lowest AUM level we had seen all year. ","Our net revenue yield in Q4 came in at 46.1 basis points, and that was an increase of 1.5 basis points versus Q3, driven by larger performance fees and other revenues relative to the prior quarter. ","Let's now turn to the operating results and the P&L. You'll see that the net revenues in the quarter grew $10.7 million or 1.5%. And that included an unfavorable FX rate impact of $6.1 million. Drilling down onto that, you'll see that the investment management fees in the quarter fell $3.3 million -- I'm sorry, $33.3 million to $770.8 million. And that was due to lower average AUM but also the market impact on our asset mix and the fee rate during the quarter. The FX reduction accounted for $7.7 million of the $33.3 million. ","Our service and distribution revenues were down by $8 million or 4.2%, and this was in line with our lower average AUM and the investment management fees. And FX accounted for just $0.8 million of the decrease. And truly, again, the 2 line items that came in pretty big this quarter were performance fees and other revenues. You saw that performance fees came in at $24 million, and that was an increase of $21 million versus Q3. And these were generated from our private wealth management business but also our real estate business. And in other revenues in the third quarter -- sorry, in the quarter came in at $44.9 million, and that's up $18.2 million. And this increase was due to a step-up in transaction fees in both our private equity business and also real estate businesses. ","Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, which we net against gross revenues, fell $12.8 million or 4%, and that was in line with a decline in investment management fees and service and distribution fees. And FX reduced these expenses by $2.6 million.","Next, going to operating expenses. These came in at $460.5 million, and that was an increase of $10.1 million or 2.1% relative to Q3. The foreign exchange impact for this was $4.2 million quarter-over-quarter. Looking at the pieces, employee compensation came in at $312.3 million, and that was an increase of $6 million or 2%. And that increase was largely due to the bonuses that were linked to the increase in performance and transaction fees earned in the quarter. And the FX decreased compensation expense by $2.7 million. ","Marketing expenses fell just by $2.3 million to $22.1 million, that was a 9.4% decrease. And FX was just a modest amount on that, $0.2 million. Property, office and technology expense came in $61.9 million in the fourth quarter, and that was a decrease of $0.9 million. And FX accounted for most of that, that was $0.6 million. G&A actually came in a bit higher than our normal run rate this quarter at $64.2 million. That was up $7.3 million quarter-over-quarter. Roughly half of that increase was attributable to a general step-up in the level of business activities in the quarter, which included travel but also, in particular, professional services, costs associated with our increased marketing and IT initiatives. The remaining half of the increase was what I would characterize as one-off product-related costs in the quarter that we don't expect to continue going forward. And FX had a $0.6 million reduction on G&A during the quarter. ","Continuing on down the page. Non-operating income decreased $1.7 million, and that was due to the mark-to-market on certain of our partnership investments, as well as to a general lower level of realized gains on some of our seed capital disposals during the quarter. The firm's effective tax rate came in on pretax adjusted net income at 22.9%, again, a little bit lower than we had originally thought. But going forward for 2012, we continue to see the tax rate drop. There are many regimes around the world that are seeing their tax rate drop. So we forecast that to be around 25% next year, but again, this will move around based on the mix of our businesses and where profits are earned. So overall, EPS came in at $0.42, basically flat to the third quarter. And our adjusted net operating margin was 35.8%, which was a small decrease from the prior quarter. ","And that concludes my section. I'll turn it back to Marty.","Martin L. Flanagan","Great. Thank you, Loren. And just really to sum up the quarter, we thought it was a very good quarter in light of the environment that we've been in. We continue to see strong investment performance across the organization, and we continue the trend of net long-term inflows across all channels of the company, which we think is, again, very, very strong in light of the market that we have been operating in. We do remain cautiously optimistic about the markets, and we will continue to be very disciplined managing the business, while at the same time, continuing to look forward for organic growth during that period. But first and foremost, we'll continue to be very, very focused on delivering excellent investment performance for our clients. ","So let me stop there. And Loren and I will answer any questions people have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question does come from Michael Kim of Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, you've clearly benefited from the growth of the Premia Plus strategies, but my sense is that it's still relatively a small piece of your overall AUM base. So just curious, given demand for multi-asset class strategies continues to be high, and how scalable is this business? And what are some of the initiatives that are in place to further penetrate different markets?","Martin L. Flanagan","Well, first of all, as you point out, it's a spectacular product. I mean, it has a very good track record. It's now -- this one in particular, depending on the channel you're in, it's over a 3-year track record right now. The team has been together 12 years, so highly respected. And this is an example of something that is being introduced in different markets and has been introduced in different markets around the world, whether it be retail or institutional. And there are varying different subsets of the capability that clients are interested in. There's commodities focus and very different elements that way. So it is just one of the different multi-asset strategies that we have. We think we're very, very well placed in doing it. And again, we have a long track record in different markets. So it's very scalable, and we think we're on a good path. And it's early days to where we think it could be.","Loren M. Starr","I think we have, what, about $6 billion in that class, from nothing essentially. So, I mean, $6 billion in a year, and that's without the 3-year track record fully hitting in. So I do think the idea that this could continue to move at the pace and maybe even accelerate into 2012 is quite feasible.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe can you just talk about how the sales and redemption sort of progressed through the quarter? And then any early read into trends thus far this year, particularly as it relates to any pick-up in contributions from retirement accounts?","Martin L. Flanagan","Sure. So I think probably not just for us but for everybody in the asset management industry, context is important. And let me just use the most public data. And it's -- for us, it's only a subset of our business. But if you look at U.S. mutual fund flows as somewhat of an indicator of investors, I think we've all seen it. You ended up 2011 with $62 billion in net inflow. And that is -- if you go back to 2003, it's really 1\/4 of the net inflows you saw during that period of time, but for 2008 where it was almost $170 billion out, and we all know what that was. So it was really a very, very difficult environment. And then, again, within that, the flows, 2011 was almost $90 billion in equity outflows. And the only other period that you saw anything close to that was 2008, which was $152 billion. So if you use that somewhat as a proxy of how investors were thinking around the world and, to some degree, in the institutional market, although recognizing it's a slower period, having net inflows, having gross sale, market appreciation, increasing penetration as we did, we feel very, very good about where we stand. And again, I think it's on the back of, first and foremost, just broad, deep investment management capabilities and our ability to move around the world with these capabilities and into multichannels. So, again, I think our relative success in what really was a very difficult market, I think we feel confident about -- as we look forward into 2012. If these markets stay where we are, we expect we're going to have a -- quite a good year.","Operator","Our next question does come from William Katz of Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just in terms of free cash flow, obviously, you took down the credit exposure a little bit and bought back a little stock. Just looking to this year, someone mentioned sort of manage the business prudently, but could you sort of maybe highlight your priorities for free cash flow? And then secondly, as you're looking at the business, are there any product gaps or areas that you might be able to shed to further hone in the story?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, Bill, I'll try to handle the first part and maybe Marty will take the second one. I think they are somewhat linked, clearly. But in terms of free cash flow, we certainly took more of our free cash flow and used it for stock buyback this year. Our general interest to continue to return capital when we don't see a clear need for it is there. And certainly, when our stock is trading at a discount, which it continues to do, and certainly, when we see the fundamentals improving and maybe it not being reflected in our stock, it's far more interesting for us to be buying our stock now than ever before. We do also clearly buy back our stock to eliminate any dilution associated with year-end grants. So, again, I think you can certainly assume by looking at our history as to how we're going to be thinking about things going forward. There isn't really a change in our capital priority. We want to continue to have dividends to be ever-increasing. I do think the topic about the certainty of dividends and the use of dividends is one that we're still looking at in terms of what's the right level. But between dividends and buybacks, I think it's largely business as usual. And really, the only thing that comes into play other than that is largely acquisitions. And maybe, Marty, you want to talk to that.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So maybe picking up on your point, Bill, just about product gaps. I think we'd maintain we don't have a lot of product gaps, but there are areas where we're always looking to improve relative to performance within an area or success within an area within the product gaps. So our focus will continue to be on really organic development, product development. My other personal opinion is the depth and quality of our investment teams is really -- I've been here 6.5 years, it's really strong. I feel really good about them. And -- so as we look forward, we think that we're going to be able to meet our needs largely through continued organic product development. And as you look at and hear about some of these big transactions that might be in the marketplace, it just -- we've been very clear about what our acquisition strategy is. I would suggest that, that's inconsistent with our need or our strategy at this time.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Very helpful. And just sort of a follow-up question. I think, and maybe it's just sort of seasonal, but I noticed that headcount was down about 30% or so quarter-to-quarter. So I'm intrigued by your comment about sort of leverage to improving market. So as you think about the incremental margin for the business, where are you if the market sort of continues to sort of trend a bit higher? Is it still 50%, 60%? Or is there room for that to be a little bit higher as well?","Loren M. Starr","So, Bill, I think to the extent that the markets are strong and charging forward, we'll definitely see the incremental margins be at the higher end of the range. And so I think when you think about 50% to 60%, it's probably closer to the 60% side. When it's flatter and we're really growing through organic methods, it's harder to sort of generate those same incremental margins, and they tend to be sort of in the -- closer to the 50%. So depending on the markets, that's probably how you're going to see things pan out.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. And I think what I'd add to it, too, I think what you -- again, if you just look at, it's really the asset mix element, too, which has been a driver in the effective fee rate. And I think that's, again, not just for us but for everybody in the industry, if you have those positive equity markets. And for us, if you have relative flows into that, again, that's going to drive to the higher end of that range, too.","Operator","Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First of all, maybe a little bit of a numbers question. But, Loren, you just walked through all the volatile items in the income statement, i.e. performance, the other and G&A. Can you talk a little bit about what you expect there for the next quarter given what you see out there in terms of spending, but also in terms of realizing performance fees in the U.K. and things like that?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I think -- great question and one that is particularly difficult to answer. So, I mean, just -- when we think about our plan and when we think about what we're going to spend and do, we generally don't assume performance fees are coming in. We are very conservative because they're very hard to forecast and it will be very dependent on the market environments in a particular -- for a particular product. We'd say, generally, we'd see performance fees be higher or higher in the first quarter and the fourth quarter. And that's a trend that has been in place for a while. The one place where we've seen higher first quarter performance fees in the past has been the U.K., and that will be very dependent on -- how much we get will be dependent on the market environment that we're in when that's calculated. And if you look at our U.K. product and the performance, it's very sensitive to what is happening in the U.K., whether the banks start performing or not, as an example. And so that's something that is hard to forecast, and it can swing quite a bit. So I do think there's the potential for a nice performance fee given the strength of the performance of the U.K., generally. So I'll just put that out there. But it is something that is hard to bank. I think the other part that I do feel better about is real estate and the transaction fees and the performance fees that we continue to see coming from that activity. As Marty mentioned, real estate has been a very strong product for us, and we've seen a lot of client demand. And we've seen a lot commitments to new products. And as those get invested, we are able to generate some transaction fees on some of those products. And certainly, we have a fairly large pipeline of investment activity in our real estate business that should produce pretty good transaction fees. And then, as well, performance fees will also be -- will come in because it's a well-performing product. So I'm generally quite hopeful. I think the other parts of the business where you've not seen performance fees, whether that's in our private equity business or some of the PPIP products, for example, those are the things that are probably going to be more weighted towards 2013 and later because we can't recognize those performance fees until there is virtually no opportunity for call back. But there is a lot of built-up performance fees, I would say, in those products as well, quite significant. So I'm pretty hopeful overall, the next couple of years, we're going to see the stepping up certainly off of the 2011 levels.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And in terms of the other and G&A line?","Loren M. Starr","And the other and G&A line, so we definitely called out half of the increase, call it roughly $4 million, that was nonrecurring. And those were really related to sort of the step-up in some of the costs of some of our products, dead deal costs and other cost of correction type of items that, again, were really unusual in the quarter and would not recur. So I feel pretty comfortable that $4 million off of that would be kind of the right thinking in terms of run rate going forward. Again, it's sort of hard to predict quarter-to-quarter exactly what happens, but that's the one  that I feel pretty good about.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure. And then just maybe as my follow-up, following on what Bill just asked around capital deployment. I mean, you didn't call out any sort of buybacks in the -- for the first quarter, and you did that in the fourth quarter. I know you didn't do much in the third quarter. So is your hesitation to actually give us a number related to maybe you're looking at a couple of opportunities out there? Or is it just not something you want to communicate at this time and that flexibility? And then just related to the M&A question again, you said maybe not anything large scale right now. But do you think some of the uncertainties out in Europe, in particular, give you opportunity to maybe get little pieces out of some of the assets that are for sale or maybe even, as some people are -- don't know what their future is, pick up some teams? Or do you think we need to hold off a few quarters for that?","Loren M. Starr","Okay. I think I can probably answer. I mean, the sort of number of what the buyback could be, again, I think it's a little hard because the market is moving -- is volatile. And so laying out a specific number is one that people will remember, but it will definitely shift depending on what sort of market you're in. So it's probably more a percentage of cash flow or something like that metric that is more important. And I'm saying, between dividends and buybacks, I think you should look at what we've been doing is sort of roughly in line with how you should be thinking about us going forward. There may be a topic just between the split between dividends and buybacks that we're going to want to look at, how much to dividends, how much to buybacks. But that's really kind of the only science that I think we want to spend a little more time in. And in terms of the acquisitions, no, there isn't any sort of hidden agenda here in terms of holding some offer or -- I think you can take us literally what Marty said, that there isn't any grand plan or sort of money being hidden off to the side because we might be doing something. That's certainly not the thought process now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So definitely take it in this weak environment, but all the flows are on the more passive product side. That's the trend of the world, and I don't know if you see that accelerating. But maybe if you could remind us the fee differential of your passive versus active products. I know the margin held up. And then maybe an additional comment on there about incremental margins on the passive new money because my gut is, is that's even better than the overall firm.","Loren M. Starr","Yes, Glenn, I think we do provide some of that detail in our number of pages on our quarterly asset roll-forwards. And so if you were to look at the passive products for, let's say Q4, you're going to see something around 10.6 basis points. And you're going to see our active being closer to 52. So that's the general spread. It can move around a lot depending on what's happening in a particular quarter, because the passive products can really generate some pretty good fees. Some of the ETFs in Canada so far, I mean, you could definitely see higher fees in some of the ETF products than in the past. And I'd say the incremental margins are probably very similar to both products, it's just you need to generate a whole lot more because it's a lower revenue fee generation level for it to really move the dial. So we don't really look to sort of grow products that are going to dilute margins. We really think all our products need to be contributing positively with similar incremental margin characteristics. So, again, I think we -- we like our passive products, we think they're great. We're very pleased that we have great capability there. And it is a trend that I'd say probably has some legs to continue. But I mean, certainly, early days are showing some of the active product beginning to take hold. Too soon to call it a trend, but January has generally been, I think, more favorable to active products than passive.","Martin L. Flanagan","Just adding to that, I can just tell you what we're seeing. So where our client is interested in and, as you would imagine, the risk -- the balanced risk asset allocation products, multi-strat, very, very interested in that. Our real estate products globally, whether they're global REITs, REITs, direct real estate, very, very interested in that. Bank loan products. And then on the equity side, you're seeing a lot of interest in our equity income type products quite broadly, whether it be DC plans or traditional retail. And so you're starting to see people move more into riskier asset classes, which is a very -- I think it's a very positive and hopeful trend for the market and, frankly, for us as a company.","Loren M. Starr","Also looking at our -- just the institutional business, I mean, we're actually seeing a growth in the amount of interest in equity products. And actually, I think it's about 30% of our unfunded -- one but unfunded business is in equities now. So we're actually beginning to see, I think, some of the smart money coming back into active equities.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. And adding to that, also the international growth products also seem to be getting quite a bit of interest. So as Loren said, early days, but it does feel like investor sentiment is moving towards what does look like very attractive valuations and return characteristics in those products.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Good to hear. One quickie follow-up on the capital usage. It's great to see the share count shrinkage over time. Is there anything special on issuance front in the first quarter that we should have in our models, that there would be, even if you do buy back some stock, no net shrinkage in the share count?","Loren M. Starr","Well, I think we will try to work as quickly and diligently as we can to reduce any impact. And generally, that's been the case in terms of how we've operated. In terms of the amount of equity issued, it can -- you can look to our past history, it ranges around somewhere between -- it can be 130 to 180. I mean, it's in that range. So you can sort of think about that range in terms of equity coming in. Easy enough for us to go in and eliminate that pretty quickly without it having a major impact on EPS.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Great. And just a last quickie is, if you look at the full-year operating leverage, your adjusted revenue is up 15 and your comp and other expenses, 12 to 13. Is that the right operating leverage thought process in a okay market backdrop as you continue to still build out the capabilities?","Loren M. Starr","I mean, again, it depends. I mean, some of the revenue impacts are performance fees-related. And there's different payouts for performance fees than there are from management fees. So, again, it's a little hard to sort of nail exactly what the right sort of relationship between revenues and compensation. That's not the way our plans work. It's not really the way we do it. So I think the way -- the best way to think about it is sort of broadly, year-to-year, this incremental margin concept as to how we manage. Again, that's more a result than anything, but it is one that's sort of held up in terms of sort of 50% to 60% incremental margins, depending on how much revenue is coming from markets versus organic growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the direct real estate side, it seems like you put a bunch of money to work in 4Q. So the questions there are, how much money did you put to work in 4Q? How does the market environment look for putting more money to work in, say, the first half of the year? And if you can, what's the pipeline, the amount of money that's funded but not yet invested or maybe collected but not yet invested?","Martin L. Flanagan","Ken, it's Marty. Let me try to take -- make a couple comments there. I don't know that we've disclosed all those details or Loren is going to see what he has handy. But let me just make this comment. As you probably know, it's just a spectacular team. Our point of view, it's one of the very few global real estate teams in the world now, literally on the ground around the world with clients around the world. There continues to be an awful lot of client interest in the direct real estate capability quite broadly, and you're even seeing clients in Europe interested in the Asian capability.","[Audio Gap]  ","hoping was going to come out of the transaction, the AIG transaction that was done a year ago. So -- and again, the global reproduct, the reproduct in particular, continues to have a lot of interest and is consistent with the commentary I was making earlier where people are seeking income. And that's at the institutional level, too, not just at the retail level. So it's probably been one of the most active areas in the company. So I know that's very high level responding to your question without the details, but...","Loren M. Starr","I mean, I think without getting into specifics, I mean, it's billions of dollars is what we've got in terms of what is to be invested. I do think our real estate team is very disciplined. And so in terms of how quickly they deploy it will be very much, is this in the best interests of the clients? And so it can take time. And I don't have a clear line of sight, quite honestly, in terms of what's moving and what's not. That's really in the heads of our real estate team and sort of transactions that I'm not even privy to and shouldn't be. So it is a little hard to answer exactly how quickly it's going to get deployed, Ken, I apologize. But that's...","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Worth a shot. And then on the management fee rate, in terms of the fee rate on the active assets, excluding the performance fees, what are kind of the dynamics that are moving the fee rates around? Obviously, like Stable Value has been a big, big source of success for you, but what are the other kind of dynamics that are impacting that active fee rate?","Martin L. Flanagan","You're hitting exactly on an important question. So if you go back and look at sort of the effective fee rate at the end of 2007 and compare to the end of '11, it was probably 50 versus 45 during that period. And the vast, vast majority of that movement in the effective fee rate is driven by the asset mix shift, as you're highlighting. There's probably -- so you would then ask the question: so could you expect it to go back to that level? I don't expect it necessarily to go back to that level. At one point when we did the Morgan Stanley\/Van Kampen transaction, some of the important long, very long history funds have lower effective fee rates. So there is a little bit of a cap to where we'll get to, but that doesn't stop the organization from being able to generate the margins that we have talked about in a growing market environment. So that's the main dynamic.","Operator","Jeff Hopson of Stifel.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I was curious on Europe, where there was improvement quarter-over-quarter. What's been helping you there? And then in Asia, it looks like that was -- the flows were primarily on the passive side, I guess, institutional. Is that right?","Loren M. Starr","All right. So, I mean, I think Europe, it's a similar topic, quite honestly, as it is in the U.S. where we've seen great strength in certain products and we have a multi-asset, risk -- balanced risk product in Europe that is flowing very well, very strongly. And so it is really the strength of that. We've also seen sort of lower redemption rates, generally. So that's been helpful for the flow picture quarter-over-quarter. What was the second part of your question?","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On Asia, it looked like most of that was passive institutional.","Loren M. Starr","Right. So that was largely real estate. We actually have certain situations where we manage individual properties, which we put into passive. So it's not really a portfolio management function, it actually gets into an individual property management opportunity. And so that's why we put that in passive. But it's actually got a decent fee rate.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I got you. Okay. And in Europe, is that -- the sale of that product, is that retail or institutional?","Loren M. Starr","Both. Both. It cuts both ways.","Operator","Our next question does come from Dan Fannon of Jefferies & Company.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, Loren, my question would be on the comp. I'm just trying to get what the normalized level of comp would be x the payouts from performance fees and the real estate. I think you might have said flat quarter-over-quarter, but I just want to get a sense if we think about going into the first quarter next year.","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I mean, the first quarter has got some interesting dynamics, as you know. We've got payroll taxes that come into play. We're going to have some of the stock grants and other deferred grants coming in, in February, that begin to roll in. We've got some things that are expiring, too. We have some modest increase across salary. So in terms of thinking about Q1, I think if you look at our Q4, obviously, the $6 million performance fees, you might have some of that again recurring in Q1. So it's -- I think if you look more to Q3 as sort of a starting point level, it's probably easier to think about what the run rate is into Q1 and forward. But, again, it can be very market dependent as to if we continue to see assets do what they're doing, it will obviously flex some of the variable parts of our comp, which will be helpful. But, again, if you're sort of thinking flat markets to end of year Q4, no asset increases, sort of modest performance fees, I think, again, sort of the Q3 level is sort of the general right run rate for thinking about comp.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then the comment around the backlog and 30% being equity base, is that quantitative products? And if not, maybe give a sense, talk about what those products are. And then also the outlook for kind of the demand around the quant products would be helpful.","Loren M. Starr","Yes, it's actually spread across many different equity capabilities, so it's not just quant. Quant does factor in. Particularly, European quant is doing very, very well. But I think there are strong interest in some of the global products, emerging equity -- emerging market equity products, Asia equity products. So it is a spectrum of equity offerings that we have that's featuring there. There's no one  that I'd say points out as dominating.","Martin L. Flanagan","Just on the quantitative capability, again, as we've said, we've had a very, very strong team, been together for a long, long time, highly qualified. And that was an area just in the marketplace where quant fell totally out of favor, '09, '10. But you've seen with our team, in particular, the performance has come back quite strongly. It's done exactly what it's supposed to do. And there's actually a fundamental bias underneath it, so it's not -- it's different than a lot of the quant capabilities out there. And we are actually -- as Loren said, the global quantitative capability, in particular, is starting to get a lot of interest again, and we're seeing net new clients into that capability. Where if you were asking that question a year ago, I don't know that you would have thought that, you'd be saying that a year today.","Operator","Our next question does come from Roger Freeman of Barclays Capital.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on the retail business. Just looking at flows, gross, looks like gross redemptions decreased more than gross sales. And can you talk to whether or how much of this is coming from increased benefits off the Van Kampen deal? And did you move higher on any of the broker platforms this quarter, or get into any of the model portfolios?","Loren M. Starr","I mean, I think, Roger, the sales probably dipped down a bit. That was in line with industry trends. I think so much of our product is equities, and equities were, as Marty mentioned, in significant outflow. More than we've seen ever, I think in this year. Roger was just talking about the year. But certainly, the quarter was -- we did see a continued pressure on equities. So I don't think the experience that we're having, looked at in isolation, is the right way to think about it. You've got to think about it relative to the mix of businesses we've got. So it's actually not a bad sales results, and we're seeing, as I said, sort of the things that are really selling strong offsetting things that are sort of not selling as strongly. And that would be in the -- again, the multi-asset product, some of the fixed income products. And then off of that equities were down. The redemption rate just continues to be a very good story for us. I think we -- performance is a very important driver of that as well. Obviously, I think the depth of our relationships with our advisors and how we're selling it into those channels is also a factor. We are very pleased with the progress that we continue to have in all the channels that we're in. I don't know if there's anything in particular that I'd call out as sort of being fee changing or -- it's just progress, steady progress that we continue to have in each of these channels that gives us confidence. And again, based on early results for 2012, again, we're seeing -- and this sort of a thesis if people start coming, wanting more equity products, we'll see the benefit significantly to us, is something that we're hopeful is going to continue.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess -- I think you mentioned in the G&A commentary, there was a piece of that, that was marketing related. Just wondering, off the back of the survey work you were doing, sort of measuring your advertising campaign around increasing penetration of the Invesco brand, are you working on a new advertising campaign? What's your sort of -- where do you think you stand in terms of brand recognition?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. So the -- we're continuing advertising. We're continuing to sort of evolve the campaign that's out there. And where it was -- and whatever the level of interest is. But it was very much brand awareness. There is actually now some very specific advertising around the strong investment performance of the organization. So it's closing that perception\/reality gap. We've got now years of good performance, and that is probably not recognized in the advisor channel to that degree. So that's a focus. And to be very specific, the core -- we like to measure things, right? So before we started this advertising campaign, we measured where we were. We didn't even show up on the -- they couldn't find us, right? So there was no awareness, is where we started. And as I mentioned, about 12 months later, something less than that, we were certainly sort of top 10 in recognition. But, again, that's not where it needs to be. I mean, we think we really need to move up to get closer to 4, 5, 6, somewhere in that, and that's probably going to be a good place to be. And we would expect that staying on this path with continued focus in that area, we should move up those categories.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","What's your timeframe in terms of goal to get to that 4, 5, 6?","Martin L. Flanagan","Let's put it this way, if you asked me if we would've gone from nowhere to 10 in 12 months, I would have said that's not possible. So I don't want to extrapolate that because I think we'll have a failed outcome. So it's got to be probably, who knows, 3 years? And we should make some progress again this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier of Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones. Maybe on the flow side, you're still in an environment where, for the whole industry, flows are few and far between. But certain products, you guys have the passives, the risk management products, the real estate, all doing fairly well. Any like -- when you look at where those products are distributed, any increased penetration or new distribution into channels over the next 12, 24 months that you see? And then particularly on the real estate side, because it seems like in '07, '08, a lot of firms pulled out. So if you have a good franchise right now, you're obviously benefiting. But just anything from the distribution side where either you can continue to sell those products where you might have some traction relative to peers?","Martin L. Flanagan","You're hitting on -- the 2 areas you talked about are just absolute strengths of the firm. I mean, just pick up on the real estate side, it is exactly the model that we've been talking about in the firm for as long as I've been here. If you have a strong investment capability, identify client needs around the world by channel. And the real estate team, whether listed or direct, it is literally -- we have clients all around the world in those capabilities. And the penetration is quite successful already and will continue to be. So -- but maybe where you're going -- the next question is just this balanced risk capability. I mean, there is no question. I think we all see it. If the Fed is halfway correct in their forecast, these ideas of balanced risk capabilities, multi-strat capabilities over the next number of years, and with an income bias in particular, they're going to do quite well. And that is a capability that started in the institutional market in the United States, ended up in the retail market and is now in multiple places around the world. So again, you could just see that just continue to probably make greater incremental penetration simply because it's relatively new to the market. But it's really these -- the equity income capabilities we have, some of the fixed income capabilities, bank loans, et cetera. I just think -- again, we think we're positioned quite strongly for the market environment, subject to it changing quite dramatically again. But it's -- that's how we see it right now.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Loren, just on the performance fees and then the transaction or the other revenues, just so we don't get too carried away. When you start thinking about 2012, I guess in the first quarter, if we think about the U.K., based on today, any type of range that you could give? Obviously, performance could change drastically throughout the quarter. But just in terms of the 24 versus a normal step-down versus what comes out next quarter that was just in the fourth quarter and what could come in. And then same thing on the transaction side, if the flows into real estate continue, and so you have to continue to put money to work. And then you also will have exits and realizations that will drive transaction fees as well. We've kind of been used to that like 25, 30 level, but obviously, from historical levels, that's very, very low. So any kind of guidance or generalities there, because I know it's volatile from any given quarter.","Loren M. Starr","It is. And you're exactly right. So I think, generally, the step-up, Q4 may be a high point. So the idea of not extrapolating that, I appreciate that because you probably would get it wrong. I mean, I think the idea of 25 is too low. 30 is probably still too low. I mean, 35 is probably the right sort of number. But, again, this is sort of very generic forecasting on my part to sort of get you in line. And then performance fees, really, I mean, for the U.K., it can have gone from 0 to 12. I mean, it could really move all over the place. So that one is just binary up or down depending on kind of that day when they take that picture of that performance. But there are some other things other than U.K. that will continue to show. And so I think, overall, performance fees for 2012, and it's hard to say exactly when and how they all come in, could be sort of roughly in line with what 2011 is, if not maybe a little bit better. But that's really hard for me to lay out exactly.","Operator","Craig Siegenthaler of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Loren, just a question again on performance fees. Can you remind us what type of asset classes crystallized in the second and the third quarter, so have the potential to generate performance fees?","Loren M. Starr","Yes. Historically, and again, you have to go back a few years, we had our quant group were able to generate pretty significant performance fees on a quarterly basis in the second and third quarters. For us, in terms of that particular product, performance has significantly improved. It's still, I'd say, away from the point where there'd be something I'd say you should start thinking about it for your model. I think there's sort of things that might hit second and third quarter would be around some other capabilities that we have, whether it's bank loans, it could be real estate. And, again, very hard for me to say exactly when that happens because it will have to do with what is going on in the portfolio at that particular time. So, again, those are the harder quarters to really sort of forecast from my perspective.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. Then just a big picture question for Marty. Marty, just kind of based on your perspective of what you're seeing in talking to clients in terms of future organic growth punch rates, how would you rank client demand over the next several years in alternatives versus passives versus active equity versus balanced? I know it's a difficult question, but where do you think demand will trend versus those asset classes?","Martin L. Flanagan","Well, I think if you asked me 6 months ago, I could have given you more clear feedback. I think 6 months ago, let me -- so institutionally, you would have said, everybody is going into immunization mode, how can I limit downside but at the same -- sort of passive, fixed income, really locking -- at the same time, topping growth, because people are just so scared about a market depreciation. You are now, at least the feedback we're seeing, you're starting to get the beginning of evolving thoughts. And I was with one important client, multinational client, that literally we just -- of the 3 mandates, 2 of the 3 were, one was international capability, one was equity income type mandate. And the thought of these types of mandate 6 months ago going into pension plans, I don't know that I would have thought would have been on the table. So I think there could be movement again back to some risk assets, which I think everybody would have said that was sort of off the table. But where we are seeing it again, back to what Loren said, bank loans, real estate, commodities within it, Premia Plus type things, so those still are on balance, the headline type things. So I think there is a softening again towards equity products, which I would never have told you that 6 months ago.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It sounds like really kind of improvement in a lot of alternative classes, active equities, but still maybe that doesn't catch up to maybe ETF growth.","Martin L. Flanagan","Well, look, let me say this from this standpoint. So we're happy to say we have very, very strong ETF business. We think it's excellent and growing. So I can say this with -- I don't think the ETFs are going to take over the world. And I don't think -- my history has been, as soon as -- if you extrapolate that into passive, as soon as everybody says the world's going passive, that's probably the exact inflection point in the market where you start to see people going into active equity. And that has been, at least as long as I've been paying attention to the market, that's what's happened. So I think that's probably a hopeful sign, not scientific, but hopeful.","Operator","Our next question does come from Robert Lee of KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Obviously, most of my questions have been answered. Just real one quick one, Loren, back to the capital management. I guess the one piece that wasn't really touched on in that was managing the debt side of it. And you obviously have about $500-odd million on the facility. I think $260 million comes due in April, if I'm not mistaken. Kind of just update us on your thought about kind of managing the debt of the firm. And I would assume, given current rates, there may be an opportunity to refinance the existing debt, plus maybe add some of the facility debt to it at a pretty favorable rate?","Loren M. Starr","Great question, Rob. So, I mean, I think, again, we have articulated that we want to bring the debt down on the credit facility. We've been doing that. We've been chipping away at it, I think, reasonably successfully. It is something that we will continue to work on. So that's kind of one point. I think there isn't sort of this fear -- I mean, for us, it's just we want to be -- have a strong balance sheet, want to have a lot of financial flexibility. It will allow us to actually take advantage of opportunities if they surface in the future. And that's kind of the way we think about debt, too, quite honestly. I mean, it's not debt for the sake of debt. Debt is cheap. I mean, certainly, you go out and raise a lot of debt. But we wouldn't really raise debt unless there was a reason to raise debt. And so, again, I think it would have to be lined up with a reason to need to finance something, if it was an acquisition, that would be out there. And for the same reason that debt that's coming due, it's $250 million in April. Probably all things considered -- we haven't made a decision yet, we don't need to make a decision. I mean, it could be quite easy for us to let that just sort of retire it and let it roll on to our credit facility and continue to chip away at the credit facility. So we are focused on definitely returning actively capital back to shareholders, the buyback is quite important. So, again, there's kind of this confusion about what comes first, what doesn't. I think, again, the message is a balanced, something that's going to sort of work for all parties involved. And so we would expect to see continued sort of work on bringing down the credit facility over time. And probably that debt coming due, we'd probably just retire. Again, if a transaction came up and it was -- again, you heard us talk about there's nothing imminent. But if something were to come up, that could change the dynamics.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And maybe as an adjunct to that, of the $730 million of cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter, I know some of that you have to maintain for regulatory purposes. But how much of that do you actually consider kind of available and free outside of kind of your normal -- what you like to have as kind of a backstop, so to speak, working capital?","Loren M. Starr","Sure. We've said in the past and we still believe strongly that we'd like to see about $1 billion of cash in excess of what is in the European subgroup, again, to help us have the financial flexibility.  It's certainly in line, if not even a little bit less than some of our peers in terms of what they've done. And, again, we don't think it's an extreme position in the sense that we saw how uncomfortable it can be when you need capital, if you can't get access to it, then you're really in a difficult situation. So having some cash that would be available. So that would be over time we'd want to get to that level. Right now, we have about $440 million in the subgroup, European subgroup, of the $724 million. So what's free and available is about $288 million. So that's kind of where the number is right now. But that number can move around quite a bit, and actually in the fourth quarter is when it gets to be -- the European subgroup requirement is the highest in the fourth quarter, and then it can actually drop down to quite a bit lower because that's really dependent on how the bonuses and the accruals for bonuses get paid.","Martin L. Flanagan","Let me -- Rob, it's a good question. Let me step back and just sort of circle sort of the big point that we've talked about over the last couple of years, in that, first and foremost, we're going to be good stewards of shareholders' capital. And as Loren said, we're going to, in combination through dividends and stock buyback, ensure that in a balanced approach, continue to get that back to shareholders. During this past crisis, what is a business fact is that clients actually care about the strength of a business. And if you asked 2005 if clients cared about how strong is the business, how strong is the balance sheet, it just wasn't a topic. It is a topic these days. And we've determined that, over time, if we get this excess capital or excess cash of $1 billion, we think that hits it and we'll have some of the higher ratings ultimately by the rating agencies. And, again, we just think it's a business necessity to get to that point. And I think that's the other color. But, again, we'll continue to do very, very good things for shareholders, so no one should feel that, that's not...","Loren M. Starr","Well, in the end, it's all for shareholders.","Martin L. Flanagan","Right. Exactly. Good point. Yes.","Operator","Our next question does come from Marc Irizarry of Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Marty, we're hearing a lot about convergence between traditional and alternative product. Obviously, with Wilbur Ross and his businesses, there's probably an opportunity there. How do you think about product in terms of both the convergence between traditional and alternatives? And are you seeing that in your business as an opportunity?","Martin L. Flanagan","There's no question about it. And I think that's -- people call it different things, but the current phraseology is multi-asset strategies. And I think it's beyond what -- take off the phraseology, it's meeting client needs and demands. And probably for us, probably the most interesting of that in most recent years was the combination when we became -- when the PPIP managers of Treasury, it was our fixed income team, it was our direct real estate team and it was our distressed private equity, WL Ross, that came together to meet the needs of the treasury. And we've done versions of that for clients around the world. So it's really putting together some of our different capabilities through the different strong investment teams meeting these needs. So it's a realism. I think it's out there, and I think some firms are talking about it, others are doing it. And we have a long history of doing it, whether it be having teams like that come together or, again, through this team that's been together 12 -- more than 12 years, asset allocation team that's doing Premia Plus type product. So it's real, we're seeing it and we're doing it and there's probably going to be more of it.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just maybe one for both you and Loren. If you look at fee rates obviously moving lower just on investment management fees. But the redemption rates, I mean, it appears that the assets are becoming stickier. You had mentioned maybe it was performance, maybe it was -- maybe it's related to mix. Just wondering if you could address the sort of trade-off that you're seeing between the asset base that you have today and the stickiness and the fee rate. And then, Loren, just in terms of the areas, if we are in sort of a lower mix, lower fee mix place, if you will, where do you think you could pull back in terms of distribution and, alternatively, where are you investing?","Martin L. Flanagan","Picking up on just the so-called stickiness. I mean, at a more subgroup you saw, we continue to have a relatively low redemption rate against the industry. We continue to have -- that sort of extends through institutional clients around the world, and I attribute it largely to, first and foremost, doing what we're meant to do for clients and meeting their investment objectives and strong client engagement and service. So as long as we're doing a good job, we would expect that to continue. And, again, I made the point earlier, the lower effective fee rate, if you look at maybe it was a peak around end of '07, and I think that was the year where the vast majority of that is explained by asset mix shift from equity to fixed income, which you would understand with the markets that have been around with one caveat being as equity markets come back, we would expect that effective fee rate would increase with that asset mix. It probably won't get as high as it did just because of some of the very long history of Van Kampen funds that came overhead, lower effective fee rates. But, again, it's very, very strong capabilities. And I don't know if Loren has feedback.","Loren M. Starr","I think you handled that one right.","Operator","Our last question does come from Jonathan Casteleyn of Susquehanna.","Jonathan E. Casteleyn - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Can you talk to remaining capacity in the real estate business on the listed or direct side? I mean, realistically, should we expect some level of saturation over time or are these businesses that can still call it double from here? Is there still ample room to grow? Can you comment there, please?","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes. Let me make a comment, then Loren can. I mean, I think first and foremost, all of our investment management teams are driven by generating the returns for clients. And when they say it's too much, it's too much and they'll stop. And I don't think -- there are natural limitations in different areas. And, again, I don't have -- I have not had the specific conversation. On the direct side, there's probably some limitations. On the listed side, there's probably some  limitations, too. So I think extrapolating through the moon is not a good thing, but I don't know if you...","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I think that's true, and I think the good news is with our footprint in real estate, in particular, the fact that we now have a global capability, I mean, there is opportunity for us to grow and in certain types of disciplines within direct that we haven't had before, as well. So if we focus on core and value, we're now looking at some other opportunity type of funds. So I think our ability to grow is growing, put it that way, through some of the recent acquisitions that we did of AIG's real estate business at the end of the year and our success in the region. So I don't think there's anything that's going to stop our real estate business from continuing to grow.","Martin L. Flanagan","And I didn't want to leave that as a -- we're not near that story yet.","Jonathan E. Casteleyn - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just quickly on the Canadian PowerShares business. Can you remind us what percentage of the current PowerShare business it represents? And then maybe the contribution in the quarter, was the delta solely contributed to Canadian business in the quarter? It was a very strong ETF result in 4Q.","Loren M. Starr","Yes, so I think the Canadian business ETF growth has been significant for Canada in the sense that they've seen a lot of interest in those types of products. And we had listed some products. So I think it's probably at the point of maybe getting to $1 billion. So it's new. And within the quarter, that's not going to be all coming in that quarter because it started before, so maybe it's $0.5 billion. But that is the smallest piece of what's going on with the ETFs in the quarter. I mean, I know people asked and I probably should just let you know. In terms of, in the quarter, we had, in terms of the Qs -- let me just give you that. But between the Qs, the QQQs and the Deutsche Bank PowerShares product, it was $2.2 billion of the flows related to those 2 products. They can move around. Just as a point of comparison in Q3, it was about $1 billion between those 2 pieces. So the thing that's really moving the most would be in somewhat those 2 volatile categories.","Martin L. Flanagan","Well, thank you very much, everybody. We appreciate the interest and the questions, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

And today, I will provide a review of our business results for the full year and for the fourth quarter 2016. Loren will go into greater details of the financials and then, as our practice, Loren and I will answer any question you call may have.","So, let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the full year which you will find this on slide four. Long-term investment performance remains strong ending the year at 72% and 75% of assets, ahead of peers on a three and five year basis. Strong investment performance and our focus on providing outcome oriented solutions to clients contributed to long-term net inflows of $12.7 billion and an organic growth rate of 1.9% for the year.","Total net flows for the year were $22.9 billion dollars versus $2.5 billion in 2015. This result was driven by the success of our liquidity business and represents an organic growth rate of 3% for Invesco during 2016. Adjusted operating margin for the year was 38.7% and we returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders during 2016 through dividends and stock buybacks.","Assets under management were $813 billion at the end of the year, up from $775 billion at the end of 2015. Adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion for 2016 versus nearly $1.5 billion in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2016 were $2.23 versus $2.44 in the prior year. We continued our stock repurchase program, repurchasing $535 million worth of stock during the year.","Let's take a look back at a number of our achievements over the past year, all of which are intended to strengthen our ability to help clients achieve their investment objective and further advance our competitive position. Driven by strong client demand and a compelling suite of capabilities, Invesco PowerShares continued to gain share in ETF market throughout the year. Long-term net inflows for our ETF business totaled $9.3 billion and we have seen the strong broad-based inflow of momentum carry into the first few weeks of 2017.","Early in the year, we completed the acquisition of Jemstep, a market leading provider of advisor-focused digital solutions. This acquisition represents our investment and our partnership with the advisory committee and highlights our efforts to participate in involving technology within our industry. We continue to expand our solutions efforts, which bring together our full capabilities to provide outcomes that help clients achieve their investment objectives. One result of the strategy was winning the Rhode Island 529 mandate of $6.5 billion, which was funded in July of 2016.","We also continue to invest in our institutional business by refining our global strategy, strengthening the team with additional experienced talent and more effectively aligning ourselves for opportunities in the market. This work contributed strong institutional flows during the third and fourth quarters, building on nearly two years of positive institutional flows. For the full year 2016, institutional long-term net flows totaled $11 billion.","On slide seven, we turn to highlights from the fourth quarter. Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter at 72% and 75% of actively manage assets were ahead of peers over three and five years respectively. The adjusted operating margin was 38.9% and we returned $264 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and stock buybacks.","Assets under management were $713 billion at the end of the fourth quarter versus $820 billion at the end of the third quarter. Adjusted operating income was $336 million in the quarter versus $339 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.59 versus $0.60 in the prior quarter. Our quarterly dividend was $0.28 per share, up nearly 4% from the prior year.","Before Loren goes into details on the financials, let me take a moment to review our investment performance and flows during the quarter. Training to slide 10. We continue to strengthen our investment platform to provide the global expertise and support minimizing distractions for our investment professionals, so they can focus on delivering investment results. Our strong investment performance reflects these efforts, 72% of assets in the top half of peers on a three-year basis and 75% in the top half on a five-year basis.","Now as you see on slide 11, active long-term net flows were impacted by a $2 billion sub-advised mandate from insurance client previously disclosed. Passive long-term net flows were impacted by outflows from UITs of $1.5 billion during the quarter. As we noted, this was primarily for short-dated equity trusts that a few of our key distributors have removed move from their platforms ahead of the implementation of the DOL fiduciary rule.","Long-term passive net flows were also impacted by an outflow of $1.3 billion, reflecting a reduction in leverage in our mortgage capital business IVR. This move was in support of our portfolio management strategy. However, the $1.3 billion does not earn a management fee and it does not impact revenues. If you back out the impact of these three items, total long-term net flows would have been more than $2 billion positive, reflecting the continued momentum in our business.","As noted earlier, we continued to invest in our institutional business throughout 2016. As a result of our focus and investment, institutional quarterly long-term flows for the third and fourth quarters were quite strong, extending a series of positive flows that stretch back more than two years. Solid performance of our institutional business was not enough to offset the impact of redemptions within retail. Retail quarterly long-term flows reflect the impact of the sub-advised mandate and the UIT outflows noted on the previous slide.","Institutional flows during the quarter reflect IVR outflow, as noted on the previous slide. Without this, IVR leveraged institutional flows would have been quite strong. At the end of the year, our institutional pipeline was up 22% quarter-over-quarter. As importantly, the fee rate on these assets was well above the overall net revenue of the firm. In January, we have seen flows of more than $1.6billion so far with diversity across all geographies as well as active and passive capabilities.","So now I would like to turn the call over to Loren.","Loren Starr","Great. Thank you very much, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $7.3 billion or 0.9%. This was driven by a negative FX translation of $14.8 billion and long-term net outflows of $2.7 billion. These factors were somewhat offset by market gains of $6.4 billion and inflows from the QQQs and money market of $2.7 billion and $1.1 billion respectively.","Our average AUM for the fourth quarter was $809 billion. That was down 0.6% versus the third quarter. Our annualized long-term organic growth rate in Q4 was negative 1.5%, again based on the reasons that Marty just gave. If you look at the adjustments provided around some of the large client redemptions, the organic growth rate would have been closer to 1%, but that was still down from 7.1% in the third quarter.","Our net revenue yield came in at 42.7 basis points, which is 0.7 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Elevated performance fees and other revenues increased the yield by 0.7 basis points and 0.2 basis points respectively. Net revenue yield was also benefited by year-end contract adjustments and third-party service and distribution expenses, which increased yield by 0.6 basis points. These three positive factors were somewhat offset by the impact of FX on the mix which acted to decrease our yield by 0.8 basis points.","Moving on to slide 15. As we have done before, we are showing you our U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter. However, my comments today will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures which will be found on the next slide, slide 16.","Net revenues increased by $9.1 million or 1.1% quarter-over-quarter to $863.8 million, which included negative FX rate impact of $17.7 million. Within the net revenue numbers, you will see that our adjusted investment management fees decreased by $17.6 million or 1.8% to $965.1 million. This reflects our lower average AUM during the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2016 along with the impact of changes in the AUM product and currency mix. FX decreased our adjusted management fees by $20.3 million.","Adjusted service and distribution revenues decreased by $4.3 million or 2% and was reflecting the lower average AUM for the products that received these fees. FX decreased adjusted service and distribution revenues by $0.2 million.","Our adjusted performance fees came in at $17.9 million in Q4 and these were earned from a variety of investment capabilities, including $5 million from our U.K. investment trust, $4.9 million from real estate, $4.2 million from our global asset allocation strategies. FX decreased these fees by $0.6 million.","So going into 2017, a little guidance here. We expect performance fees to follow a similar pattern to 2016 with Q1 fees about $15 million to $20 million driven mainly by our U.K. investment trusts and then moving to a roughly $5 million to $7 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. I would remind everyone that forecasting our performance fees unfortunately is not a precise science.","Our adjusted other revenues in the fourth quarter came in at $23.2 million and that was an increase of $3.9 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to an increase of $5.3 million in transaction fees from real estate, offset by $3.8 million decrease in our unit investment trust revenues. Foreign exchange decreased our overall other revenues by $0.2 million.","Again, looking forward to 2017, we would expect other revenues to decline to $12 million to $15 million per quarter through the year. This is due to two factors. First, we continue to see pressure on our short-dated equity UITs as a result of the early adoption of DOL rules and we do expect that pressure to continue on into 2017. The second factor is a structural change in the way our real estate products are priced with more performance fee based accounts being used than pure transaction fee-based accounts. In future years, we would expect increased performance fees, however, to help offset some of the impact on other revenues.","Moving on down in the P&L. In Q4, our third-party distribution service and advisory expenses, which we net against gross revenues, decreased by $13 million or 3.6%. That was driven by lower retail AUM at year-end and contract adjustments. FX decreased these expenses by $3.6 million.","So before turning to expenses, let me try to summarize all the revenue guidance I just provided in terms of yield. Looking into 2017, we would expect to see our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, decline by approximately one basis point year-over-year. This net one basis point decline is due to a negative 1.5 basis point impact, one basis point of that is from foreign exchange and another 0.5 basis point is from other revenues, which I then expect will be partially offset by a positive 0.5 basis point impact from asset mix and flows.","To breaking that down even further by taking into account day count, our net revenue yield excluding performance fees should fall to 41 to 41.5 basis points in the first half of 2017. In the second half of the year, this range would increase by 0.5 basis point to 41.5 to 42 basis points. As a reminder, these yields that I am guiding you to, all assumes flat markets and foreign exchange from today's levels.","So next, let's get into expenses. Moving down the slide, you will see that adjusted operating expenses at $527.8 million increased by $12.4 million or 2.4% relative to the third quarter. Foreign exchange reduced our adjusted operating expenses by $9.2 million during the quarter.","Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $337.9 million. That was a decrease of $1.2 million 0.4%. Foreign exchange decreased our adjusted compensation by $5.5 million.","Again looking ahead to 2017, seasonal payroll taxes and a one-month impact from base salary increases will lift Q1 compensation by approximately $20 million. This should then drop-off in the Q2 and level out to roughly $345 million per quarter into the last half of the year, based again on flat markets and foreign exchange as well as the revenue guidance that I provided.","Our adjusted marketing expenses in Q4 increased to $8.6 million or 32.1% to $35.4 million. This reflected the seasonal increases in advertising, client events and other marketing costs in support of the business. Foreign exchange decreased our adjusted marketing expenses by $0.8 million. Looking forward into 2017, we would expect our marketing expense to follow 2016 with roughly similar levels as well as seasonal quarterly seasonality.","Our adjusted property, office and technology expenses came in, in Q4 at $85 million. That was an increase of $2.9 million or 3.5% over the third quarter. This was due to higher outsourced administration software costs. Our foreign exchange impact on this line item decreased expenses by $1.2 million. As some large technology related projects come into service into 2017, including investments around data and cyber security, we would expect to see property, office and technology expenses increased to approximately $88 million per quarter.","Next, our adjusted G&A expenses came in at $69.5 million. That was an increase of $2.1 million or 3.1% quarter-over-quarter. This increase was driven by cost associated with several new product introductions and other product related costs. Our foreign exchange impact on this line item decreased G&A by $1.7 million. Looking into 2017, we would expect G&A expenses to be roughly in line with 2016 levels, around $65 million to $67 million per quarter.","Continuing on down the page, you will see that our adjusted non-operating income increased $0.3 million compared to the third quarter. Fourth quarter included a $7.8 million gain realized in our Pound Sterling, U.S. dollar hedge.","The firm's effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income in Q4 was 27.7%. This increase in rate was driven by the FX rate movement impact on our profit mix as well as by gains from our foreign currency hedge contracts. Looking forward to 2017, we believe our tax rate should stand at roughly 27%, which then brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.59 and the adjusted net operating margin of 38.9%.","So next, let's turn to slide 18 where I will spend a little time just providing more color on the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We have presented our 2016 results on a constant currency basis by restating the 2016 amounts using the average foreign exchange rate for 2015. As you will note, the FX impact has been significant removing $109.6 million in net revenue and $55.9 million in operating income from our 2016 results. The FX movement has also had a material impact on many operating metrics, driving a 40 basis point decline in our adjusted operating margin and a 0.7 basis point fall in our net revenue yields.","As you know, we are protected against some of the negative currency impacts to cash flow into EPS through the use of our Pound Sterling and Euro hedges. These hedges are in place through the end of 2017. We will consider whether to extend them based on our ongoing review of the Brexit situation as well as based on the overall cost of hedging.","So at the risk of beating a dead horse, let's just go to the last page here on 19. We hope that this slide is going to help with your modeling the impact of foreign exchange on our financials. And what we show here is the impact of a 10% appreciation or depreciation, both the Sterling as well as on Euro on our operating results. So on the top part of the page, you will see that our adjusted operating EPS or unhedged EPS would flex by plus or minus $0.07 based on a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the Pound.","This of course is hypothetical since we are in fact hedged. The adjusted EPS, the hedged EPS would decline only $0.02 under a 10% depreciation scenario for the Pound. It would appreciate $0.06 under a positive 10% move. Our adjusted operating margin would be plus or minus 30 basis points and our net revenue yield excluding performances would move plus or minus 0.8 basis points.","The impact of the Euro on our financials is much less than it is based on what happens to the Pound. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the Euro would have only a plus or minus $0.02 impact on our unhedged EPS. On our hedged EPS, again, the reality for 2017 no material impact on the down scenario of minus 10%, we would see plus $0.02 on an upside. Our adjusted operating margin would be plus or minus 10 basis points and our net revenue yields would move by plus or minus 0.3 basis points.","So hopefully that's helpful. And with that, I will turn it over to Marty.","Marty Flanagan","Operator, can we open it up for questions please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Michael Carrier of Merrill Lynch. Your line now is open.","Michael Carrier","All right. Thanks guys. Loren, maybe first, thanks for all the guidance, just given the lower level on the other revenues that you guided to, just wanted to get some sense on are there any maybe expense offsets for those types of revenues? It seems like maybe the G&A line being flat, like in terms of your guidance there is some there, but just wanted to get a sense if that does come in at the low end of that? Is there anything that can be done to offset that?","Loren Starr","We are continuing to focus on optimization opportunities. Those impacts are in fact reflected in some of our expense guidance. It is possible that we could do better than we are suggesting here. So that's obviously some potential positive upside. There is some potential positive upside on performance fees as well. I mean we are guiding based on what we know, but again there are definitely positive potential surprises there which would be very accretive to our incremental margins and to earnings. Overall, I think we are very focused on continuing to invest behind the business. We think it's important that we do continue to position ourselves competitively, particularly given the rapid changes that we are seeing in the environment. But we are obviously going to continue to be very focused on expenses to try to provide a result that you would view as acceptable.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, Marty or Loren, just on the DOL fiduciary rule, just as the industry is moving forward, just wanted to get some sense on where things are trending? How you expect it to impact? Whether it's fee rates, revenue shares? Anything that you are starting to get some color? How you guys are positioning for that as we approach?","Marty Flanagan","So my view is similar to yours. It sounds like others. I think there is some anticipation that the DOL rule will get delayed, I don't know anybody in the industry, whether it be money manager or distribution partners that are slowing down, right. So the movement towards advisory, it is in place and it will just continue, right. It would be a mistake not to think that is the case. The feedback that we are getting from our distribution partners.","What they are looking to do is to work with firms with a broad range of capabilities and that have good performing capabilities and also competitive expense ratios. And so on each point, more specifically what is of interest, the focus on how to combine active and passive capabilities within the channels and an evolving focus on how to use factor capabilities. ETFs, in particular. So we are positioned very well from that point of view, both solutions and with our capabilities and factor.","The other topic is a keen interest now in looking at the use of alternative capabilities within the retail channel now. That's been a topic for a number of years and as we have talked in the past, it did not move as fast as anybody in the industry thought for a number of reasons. One being distribution partners getting organized around it. Secondly, how to use it within the financial advisor and there was a lot of regulatory focus surrounded also.","So that seems to be an evolving focus. So we look at ourselves as we think we are positioned really quite well with this as we look forward. Now again, there is going to take some takes and puts and we have talked about UITs. UITs are something that you have already seen the negative impact to us. The good news is what we are starting to see is a greater focus on the use of ETFs in the place of UITs. So again, it's going to be some evolving, how we partner with our different distribution partners, but again, I would say, at the moment, we feel pretty good about it.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Marty Flanagan","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line now is open.","Ken Worthington","Hi. Good morning.","Marty Flanagan","Good morning.","Ken Worthington","First I want to talk about your marketing objectives for the coming year and your allocation of marketing dollars. Are there any meaningful changes as we think about 2017? Areas where you are increasing or decreasing marketing spend, either by regions, asset classes or even products? And if so, can you give us some flavor with regard to what you are thinking?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. Interesting, Ken. So its an area that we are actually putting a lot of focus on now as an organization and just strategically what should we be doing. And I think the reality is of where the market is going, brand recognition actually matters a lot. And I would say that's somewhat different than years gone by. Maybe it's a reflection of more competitive maturing industry. So our focus globally is extending the brands because what you get with that is quite frankly your reputation precedes you and you do end up doing better in the retail markets, in particular. We are very strongly placed in the U.K. brand recognition. EMEA also has been improving dramatically as in the United States. We are probably not where we want to be. That would probably be the weakest brand reputation vis-\u00e0-vis the other parts of the world. So again, we are just trying to refine that and continue to focus on enhancing that reputation of the firm.","Ken Worthington","Thank you. Invesco's U.S. active equity retail franchise has been pretty consistent outflows with the exception of maybe IBRA and diversified dividend in recent years. I would say performance wasn't great. It wasn't bad and value was out of favor. 2016 seemed to change both the prominence of value investing and the relative performance of many, if not even most, of your U.S. active equity funds. What are your thoughts about the U.S. equity retail business as we think about 2017 and 2018, given both that increase prominence of value investing and the significant improvement of the kind of the former Van Kampen funds? Is there hope or expectations that what's been in moderate but pretty consistent outflows has a chance of turning around?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. We are. So our basic view as we talked before this, but one step higher, is sort of this, debate about is it active, is it passive and our basic view, it's both. I mean that is the reality going forward. In the retail channel active and passive is going to be used. Good news is, we are very well positioned for that dynamic. Then specifically, it has been a headwind for U.S. equities, value in particular, over the years, for the reasons we know sort of from 2009 on that sort of beta run. I think the world has changed, right. I have always been a believer in active. It does play an important part in somebody's portfolio. Again I am probably preaching the choir here. So that said, I think when you start to see the relative outperformance in quite a material way, it will be used in U.S. portfolio and we would look to, as you suggest, just absolute relative strength of the value franchise, we would expect that the advisors would start to more actively use those capabilities.","Ken Worthington","Thanks. And just lastly, Loren, in terms of UITs, what kind of AUM do you have in UITs right now? And any sense of the scheduled maturity of products in 2017 versus what was scheduled to mature in 2016?","Loren Starr","Yes. I mean we have about $9 billion in equities, $8 billion in fixed income UITs. In terms of the maturity, the equities tend to mature more rapidly. So they are probably more like an average 18 months maturity level. So you can assume kind of a book that's every 18 months is going to go away. So you can just take that $9 million and assume a bleed out, at worst case, right where it goes way in 18 months.","Ken Worthington","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line now is open.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much. I guess it's a combo question. You talked about combining active to passive. And I am curious if we can get a little more color into the, sounds good but how do you actually do it? How much is it relying on Jemstep? How much is it wholesale in the channel? How much is your solutions effort? And will we see that in PowerShares flows overtime as you combine the two?","Marty Flanagan","Great question. So it's beyond theory, right. And so when we have been talking about where we have been investing and what reasons, the solution buildout is an important one for us. Actually the immediate focus has been actually on U.S. retail and that might be different than some other focuses. That's because of the dramatic changes going on in the advisor channel. So it's really having solutions experts matching off their home offices to help build different models and solutions for the advisors and then out to the field helping with the models. And it's starting to take shape. I think it's going to be an important way that the business is changing going forward. It will result in greater ETF sales.","There's little question in my mind about that. Jemstep is also, it's been a year since we closed, it is actually being really introducing us to a really new channel of distribution. It's advisor focused, it's not direct. I want to make that very clear. So it's partnering with our advisors, but the inquiring of firms that we are working with, our firms that we never had relationships before. So I would look at the financial impact to that and the flow impact probably in latter part of this year starting to kick in because you have to think of it, it is an application installation and we are well underway in a number of areas. So it is a combination thereof and within Jemstep, it is actually using our models that advisors can use. And again, it's not closed, so actually they can use their own models, et cetera, et cetera. So it's a combination thereof, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. I appreciate that. And then a follow up on your flow commentary, the $2.7 billion of outflows but $2 billion inflow, if you exclude the three one-offs. I take a step back and I see you guys haven't had an outflow year since like 2008 and gross sales in the quarter were actually up 7% year-on-year. So maybe just a high level, which products do you think are going to drive growth? I saw Asia was really good in the quarter. What do think is going to drive growth besides what we just talked about in terms of PowerShares?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. So you are going to get that, so to the extent of my power comments, that will continue. The other area where you are seeing real success is the institutional business and I would say regionally, like all three regions. We are at different stages of success in the different regions but we just continue to see, as we said, the pipeline just continues to strengthen and so we will just continue to see greater impact institutionally around the world.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Thanks very much.","Marty Flanagan","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line now is open.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. I guess if you could just kind of build on the last question and talk about maybe the U.K. specifically where obviously Brexit and some of the macro factors are out there and kind of an overhang for probably gross sales but then you have seen performance within that franchise also on a shorter term basis come in. And what's your outlook as you think about 2017 for that segment?","Marty Flanagan","Let me make a comment and then I am going to turn it over to Loren and he can be more specific. Quite frankly, the EMEA capability within our firm is very, very strong. And I think it's been looked at more, I think, from investors as more of a liability than an asset, which is exactly wrong. We just look to continue to improve our position and we think even with the conversations of Brexit we continue to look to 2017 with things stabling and then moving into growth as we go forward.","But, Loren, do you want to add?","Loren Starr","Yes, I mean just a little color. So one thing I would say, in particular of the roughly $1.6 billion of long-term inflows that we have seen through January, right, more than half is coming from EMEA. So the region is very, very healthy. We are seeing cross-border again coming in. We are seeing very strong institutional inflows. The U.K. retail situation has always been somewhat an outflow just given the size of the book and it's not a growing area of demand, but it certainly would be more than offset by the flows coming in through the rest of the region. So the opportunity that we believe that exists in EMEA is significant.","It's one that people should not see as being sick or damaged or impaired through this Brexit situation and it's one that we feel we are very well-positioned to continue to flow in. So hopefully that gives you a sense of how we feel. Obviously, the Brexit topic is a bigger topic around currency and we been talking about all that but in terms of the actual business and the flows coming into the U.K., it's pretty much not yet seen itself having an impact.","Dan Fannon","Great. And then I guess following up on the UIT segment and as well as the performance fees. And I guess in the context of thinking about incremental margin for the overall business, it's my understanding that the UIT business is very profitable for you. As you think about the incremental margin outlook on a combined basis for the firm, has that changed at all as we think about UITs being lower and performance fees being maybe pushed out and lower ongoing other the revenues up front?","Loren Starr","No. I think because, as Marty suggested, we are seeing the opportunity to substitute UITs with ETFs and the incremental margin on ETFs are certainly at the same level as UITs. So there should be no degradation due to that particular factor. Overall the biggest impact on our incremental margin this year 2017 is everything to do with just FX having a depressive impact on our net revenue yield.","The mix is going to be positive. We are seeing positive net revenue yield lift due to our mix. We don't expect that to change. And so overall we think we are going to be back in that guidance area that we have talked about in the past in that 50% to 65%, again, but that assumes flat markets and flat FX year-over-year which has certainly not been the case.","Marty Flanagan","And in an interesting way, this refocus on UITs or how they are being used in the retail channel actually is turning out to be an opportunity for us longer-term from the standpoint of we are having much deeper conversations with the advisors on how to use ETFs and how to build their books. So we ultimately see that as a much more important opportunity as we look out into the future for us.","Dan Fannon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line now is open.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to start out maybe following up on some of the questions on the U.K. So we have seen the FCA take a closer look at pricing for asset management products in the U.K. Can you maybe give your perspective on where you see that going and whether or not you see that leading to pricing pressure and how we should think about it?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. Look, it's still early days. Everybody is now responding to the initial report. There is an absolute focus really on value for money and we come out very, very strongly through that analysis. So we sit in a good position because of that. We are very engaged like others in the marketplace. The firms that are at risk are and again it was sort of a direct focus on people, sort of benchmark huggers charging active fees is an area that is probably never a good idea to do that. I don't think people were really focused on doing that on purpose but that's really a real big pressure point and we will just have to see where we come. There's really probably not going to be any direct feedback until much later in the year, probably nine months from now, I would guess.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Great. And then can you size for us the sub-advised portfolio? And was the loss of the sub-advised mandate, was that a BA related mandate? And the rest of the sub-advised portfolio, what portion is BA?","Loren Starr","Let's see, I am not sure if I have exact numbers in front of me but our overall sub-advised book is probably under 10% of our overall exposure in the retail space, maybe 15% to 10% out of $170 billion mutual funds. So that gives you a sense of the overall exposure. This particular client was an insurance client. I don't know if we have all the specifics or have provided much specifics around that but it is one that the fee, it was not the highest fee business for us.","So again, it's not relative to our overall net revenue yield that's going to be accretive in terms of its loss. I don't think there is a trend here on sub-advised, per se. Obviously there are some big changes that need to happen here and there as certain clients decide to change the way they manage their portfolios. But at this point, I don't think there's something where we are saying there's that risk a lot of sub-advised assets.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And then just one follow-up for the UIT, just to help us think about what the role rates are. For this quarter, when you had the investors roll off into the next series, what percentage of investors did you see opt to roll into the next series? Just help us gauge that $9 billion over the next 18 months? And what portion, at least based on early days, might actually roll off?","Loren Starr","Yes. It's actually been a little bit better. In the fourth quarter, things actually improved somewhat. So again, it's sort of a dynamic situation. So we are painting somewhat of a bleak picture on the UIT business in terms of the equity outflow, but it is still a pretty dynamic discussion. And one quarter, I just don't know if there's a trend line I can actually point to, to allow you to model this effectively.","It is something that we are continuing to monitor. And so because it's moving around quite a bit, I think it's probably wrong to assume the worst case scenario that I talked about before. Just as another level of information, I mean the fee rate on the equities are roughly 55 basis points. So that's on the sale but then you have to take that number and sort of divide that by an average life of one-and-a-half years.","Brennan Hawken","And you guys recognize that not up -- I thought you have recognized it upfront.","Loren Starr","We do. We recognized it upfront. But just in terms of how the fee rate yield shows up, we are taking that upfront number and we are dividing it by the overall assets that are in place in the book.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Loren Starr","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Bill Katz of Citi. Your line now is open.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate you taking my questions. So Marty, you mentioned that in the retail channel that the distributors are a little more focused on expense ratios which we are hearing from a bunch of your peers. And BlackRock cut some pricing, T. Rowe announced this morning, I did speak with them, they have had some pricing cuts as well. When you look at your retail footprint, putting aside the passive business, how do you sort of look at the active business? Is that an area that might need some, how does this stack up when you look at the expense ratio? Could there be any strategic moves here to try and increase volume by bringing pricing down perhaps?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. So a couple of things. It is an area of focus. It has always been an area of focus for us. And if you look at what we have done over the last decade, we have re-priced our retail funds downward to the point where, Loren correct me, about 90% of our assets are below median and two-thirds are in the lowest quartile of expenses. So we are placed very, very strongly.","Historically, this is not a new topic for us. So we think we are placed very nicely. I also think it's a mistake to think that the first thing that people are looking for is expense ratios. Low expense ratios with bad performance is, it's I don't care how low it is, you can give it to somebody, it's not going to be a factor to drive growth. And still, the primary focus is investment quality.","Is it going to generate the returns for the clients in the portfolio? And I think people, don't forget that, that is the driver. I don't think price cuts are going to change the flow dynamic. What I would say, though, if you are above median and not performing well, that's not a good place to be.","Bill Katz","Okay. That's probably an understatement. Okay. So the other question I have for you is that in the $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion or the roughly $2 billion of flows this quarter, I appreciate the EMEA in the institutional side but from a product demand perspective, what are you seeing? And then maybe the broader question, if you have time, is everyone sort of hopes that active makes a comeback, is there any real-time dialogue with the distributors in the U.S. in particular that's arguing that you are actually seeing any kind of pickup in active demand? Because from the industry level data, we really are not seeing it.","Marty Flanagan","Well, I can just think of a number of conversations that I have been in. And there is a very strong interest, beyond interest, a very important part of the strategy of the distributors to use active capabilities. And in particular for us, the discussions are as high as they have ever been into understanding how to use alternative active capabilities. So I think you are right though from whenever you want to think this started, but the end of last year or so December on, just beginning to see a really strong outperformance of active. It will be taken up, I do believe. But if you look at history, it's always trailed. It doesn't start exactly when you should be doing it.","Loren Starr","And in terms of what's really working for us this last quarter in active, we saw the outcome oriented types of products are doing very well, like GTR was probably one of our largest winners. I think it was roughly $2.4 billion of long-term net inflows into that capability. Our diversified dividend capability, so the yield oriented equity capability, $1.4 billion. We saw real estate, bank loans, CLOs as well all being positive in the active space.","And then obviously the detractors, the outflows were related to some of, as we talked about, the big sub-advised client as well as there was about $1 billion of just a disposition related to a real estate holding. And this was all talking about 4Q right now, just to be clear. Going into next year, as I said, I think those trends are continuing and we are seeing similar take on of that type of product.","Marty Flanagan","And I would just come back to, if you recall, more than three years ago we launched a broad range of alternative retail mutual funds. And if you remember the conversation at the time, we thought the wise thing to do was a broad introduction, knowing that you needed three year track records largely before you start to get traction. We have hit that three year mark and I think in hindsight I think that's going to look like it was a wise thing to do at the time.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thank you for taking all my questions today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line now is open.","Alex Blostein","Hi guys. Good morning. A couple of questions. So just going back to the DOL conversation, So I understand that it doesn't sound like a lot of people are pausing with implementation, but thinking through the potential reversal of the rule, who knows whether or not it actually happens, but playing that out through the P&L for you guys, are any of the revenue challenges that you highlighted on the other revenue line, I guess due to potentially some DOL changes, could they potentially reverse? Or do you think this is more of a permanent phenomenon?","Marty Flanagan","Look, I think it's a mistake not to think it's a permanent phenomenon, right. Our distribution partners prefer the advice model and the DOL was already moving that way. The DOL was the impetus to advance it. So in some ways, I think I don't believe the fiduciary rule is going away. I think there could ultimately be some modifications and the SEC syncing up a synched definition of the fiduciary rule which would be a healthy thing in some elements of the rule that could be better dealt with could get addressed during that process. So that's our view.","Alex Blostein","Got it. And then around some of the expense guidance, particularly I wanted to touch on the higher cost of data. So Loren, you mentioned that you guys are expected to spend a little bit more there in 2017. Can you give a little more color, I guess, like what are the focus of your spending there on? Is it more reactive, meaning that data providers are just charging more? Or is it proactive where you are just finding actually more value and more expanded data services? And how you are incorporating that in your product offering?","Loren Starr","Yes. So maybe I was not very clear it in my term data. So it has more to do with actually the systems and our overall management of data through the firm in terms of our investment book of records having one system as opposed to multiple bespoke systems. So it has really been a redo, a revamp of how we manage data through the firm really giving us even more effective efficient with our information, less manual processing, more straight through processing. That's been a major investment. It's not really the cost of data which, of course, does go up every year. That's not what we are talking about here, per se.","Alex Blostein","Got it. All right. So it feels like more temporary. And then a last one for me on the hedge. Can you remind us again I guess when the hedge expires and how we should think about that going forward? I understand you guys have a hedged for still a couple quarters but what happens after?","Loren Starr","Yes. So right now the hedges are in place through the end of 2017 and so if we were to do nothing there would be no further hedging after that. So as I mentioned earlier, we are going to continue to look at opportunistically whether it makes sense for us to extend those hedges, either both in the Pound and Euro or maybe just the Pound and that will be based on our risk assessment of Brexit and obviously the cost of the hedges as an insurance policy.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions.","Loren Starr","No problem.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line now is open.","Brian Bedell","Hi. Good morning folks.","Loren Starr","Hi Brian.","Brian Bedell","Marty, maybe if you just come back to the active passive comment, I appreciate your comments around that momentum into January. Maybe can you just talk about how that's changed say, pre the Trump administration, as you think about how advisors have been thinking about potentially changing portfolio allocations to comply with DOL earlier in the fourth quarter? Has that changed significantly since the Trump win and into this year? And then also your comments on the alternative side that's been more brewing longer-term, I believe. Where are you seeing that really perk up much more recently?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. So again, it's hard to decipher exactly what the impetus was. I would say this, the advisors looking more to build broad portfolio allocations for their clients has been something underway for a number of years. I think DOL moved it ahead. And then this rally, if you want to say from election day on, has by the combination of all of those three have really put a focus on, I want to use active and passive, I want to understand how to use factor within that with active, I also want to understand how to build alternatives into this asset allocation.","So it's all those things coming together. And there's always been a belief too and it was Ken's question earlier, I think it was Ken, that over the long-term active, even U.S. active equities is a value add for multiple reasons, risk adjust return, downside protection, et cetera, et cetera. So it's hard to point to one thing as the impetus to this but there is a very, very focused effort on using the broad range of answers to build these asset allocation capabilities for the advisor community.","Brian Bedell","Great. And then maybe Loren, if you could parse out the flows for January a little bit more, if it's possible into, I assume it excludes QQQs, but just between active equities and fixed income and alternatives and ETFs? And then on the GTR, I think that's $19 billion in assets, if I am right. Can you talk about your view on the U.S. distribution of that? I know that's been an area that's been building.","Loren Starr","Sure. So I mean within the number, the $1.6 billion, we have got some puts and takes as you imagine. The passive PowerShares, I mean you have got that number yourself, if you go to the website but we are seeing more than $1 billion on the traditional in terms of inflows, long-term inflows. So that continues to be a high growth area for one that we don't expect to slow down at all.","In terms of what is in demand, it has been largely around fixed income and alternatives is where we are seeing most of the interest, as I mentioned, on the active side. We are seeing multi-asset being about $0.5 billion positive in the number. And Asia continues to see growth but largely around fixed income, both bank loans and core fixed income offerings. So around real estate as well that continues to be an area where we see flows coming in. So hopefully that gives you some good enough color in terms of what's driving the flow picture.","Brian Bedell","And then just I guess on the active equities, are they still outflowing at a similar pace as December in the fourth quarter?","Loren Starr","Yes. There has not yet been a sea change at on the flow picture. It's pretty much business as usual unfortunately. Even though performance is strong, we still see outflow. The only other place, as I mentioned earlier, where we are seeing very strong inflow would be diversified dividend which is well in excess of $1 billion in the last quarter.","Brian Bedell","And GTR for January, if you have got that?","Loren Starr","And GTR for January was about more than $0.5 billion.","Brian Bedell","Thanks so much.","Loren Starr","No problem.","Operator","Next question is from Robert Lee of KBW. Your line now is open.","Robert Lee","Thanks and good morning everyone. Just curious, I know you have had over this past year some efficiency initiatives in place and you have talked about in the release about starting to see some impact. But as we look forward and given some continued maybe revenue headwinds, whether it's from FX or whatnot, do you think there's much more you can do on that front as we think ahead to like next year or the year after? Or do you feel like you have pretty much gone to the well?","Loren Starr","Never have we gone to the well. So there's always opportunity. We can only do so much at one time. So obviously we have got some sequencing has been a continued move to improve use of technology, reducing manual, the need for manual work, using our global centers more effectively, more efficiently. I think themes like digitization and robotics are huge opportunities for our industry in aggregate. And we are running after them quite heavily but it's still early days in terms of seeing the full benefits of those technologies finding root.","So I think there will be an ongoing, there has to be an ongoing focus for driving efficiency through Invesco as well as the industry for us to maintain profitability. And I think it requires some investment to get there. So that's kind of the flip side. But we have been making those investments over the last several years and we feel we are very well-positioned to continue to drive our expenses as a percentage of our assets under management down as we have seen continuously over the last many years.","Marty Flanagan","And, Rob, I would probably add to that. The other perspective is where we see ourselves positioned as a firm and where we see the future of the industry, we think we are aligned against very well. And so through these savings we have been reallocating, creating capacity to continue building up solutions, the global institutional business, the PowerShares business, those things that are absolutely making a difference.","I think what the other side of it is, you could stop doing that. And I think it's the most dangerous time not to be investing to the demands in the marketplace. And I think those firms that have stopped investing, they are going to find themselves competitively at a material disadvantage. And the good news is we have been after this for a good number of years and we are really seeing the impact along the way.","Robert Lee","Thanks. And maybe a follow-up question. One of the I guess theoretical impacts as firms look to prepare for the DOL rule, whether it happens or not, as you said, it's happening, is that it would continue to kind of spur demand for SMA accounts versus funds. So I am just curious if you are actually, I mean obviously it's been a trend for a while but if you are seeing a change in that dynamic and if you think of your own flows how you would characterize funds versus SMAs? And maybe just also update us on your thoughts about how you are positioned in that part of the retail market.","Marty Flanagan","Yes. So we have the SMA capability. There's many firms. And, again, it is an area that will continue to be a focus with our distribution partners for various different types of investment capabilities that they are trying to make available to their clients. So I would say it's a continuation of what's been there in the past, quite frankly.","Robert Lee","Okay. And then maybe just one last question, if I could, on capital management. Two accelerated share repurchases this year. As we look to the coming year, how much of that should we think maybe pulled forward share repurchase that maybe next year would be, I don't know, lower than average or something? But how should we think about your appetite for share repurchase in 2017 given what you did this year?","Loren Starr","So a great question. We are obviously operating with our normal capital priorities that have been in place for years. First call on the capital would be seeding products. Next would be dividend growth, modest single-digit growth followed by stock buybacks. And so that's the process were in place. We want to maintain roughly $1 billion of cash in excess of what's required from a regulatory capital perspective and we are sort of largely there, plus or minus a couple hundred million.","So our focus this year or last year was certainly being opportunistic on the buybacks because we saw what we thought was an over reaction obviously to the whole Brexit news and certainly the DOL impact on our franchise we thought was overblown. So we are going to continue to operate with those types of triggers in mind, opportunistically going in perhaps at a higher level because we have the financial flexibility to do so.","But I would say our preference, obviously, is to be back into a more normal approach around our capital management. And we do have some pretty, I would say, sizable seed capital needs coming into next year as we continue to see our client demand for alternatives grow. We need to seed some of those capabilities or co-invest along some of those capabilities and so that will be probably, again as I said, our first call on capital.","Robert Lee","Great. Thanks for the color. Thank you.","Loren Starr","No problem. Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Next question is from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line now is open.","Chris Shutler","Hi guys. Good morning. It looked like the passive yield was up quarter-over-quarter for, I think, the third consecutive quarter. Maybe just talk about the drivers there and what you are expecting?","Loren Starr","I think that was largely because of things like IVR leverage which was a big outflow and had zero fee impact. So it's more noise than anything else. There's nothing really going on, I think per se, in the mix. Although I would say the one thing is, there's been a pretty significant drive-up in the use of bank loan ETFs. And bank loan ETFs are at a much higher fee than the overall average, I think sort of up in the 60, 70 basis point level.","Chris Shutler","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess on the 0.5 basis point of help that you are expecting in the fee rate in 2017 just from mix. I just want to be clear, so that's based on existing mix in AUM? Or does that include your assumption where flows are going to shake out? And given the outflows you have been seeing in equities, are you expecting that to continue and just be offset by alternatives? Just trying to understand what's in your expectations.","Loren Starr","Yes. So that's actually based on a very detailed bottom-up, built-up forecast, region-by-region, product-by-product, institutional retail, equity fixed income alternatives across the globe and so it represents our expectation. It reflects our pipeline of won but not yet funded products which, Marty had mentioned, has a much higher fee rate than the firm's overall average. It reflects obviously the increased client demand we are seeing around alternatives and I think we are also seeing obviously growth in places like EMEA and Asia-Pac where they tend to have a higher fee rate. So that's what's driving the overall fee rate improvement.","Chris Shutler","Okay. And then can I just ask one more real quick one. In the other revenue that you guys talked about, what's driving that change in the real estate contract structure to be more performance fee versus transaction fee? Thanks.","Loren Starr","Yes. So I think clients are just more interested in seeing this back-end loaded type of fee as opposed to the transaction fee. And so we are just responding to the client trends that are in place where I think the clients would rather not be paying transaction fees.","Chris Shutler","Okay. Thank you.","Loren Starr","Yes.","Operator","Next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line now is open.","Chris Harris","Thank you. How do you guys think your platform is positioned for a sustained period of higher U.S. interest rates? And part of the reason I ask is, there is a perception in some circles that you guys have a lot of dividend income producing products that would really be negatively impacted by that?","Marty Flanagan","If you look at, I think you are quite focused on that diversified dividend fund which has been so successful. But if you look at the value suite, there's three elements to it. That has been an area where there's been a lot of focus. There's a deep value capability which is performing very, very well, somewhere between diversified dividend and deep value that's also performing very, very well. So we are positioned, I think, extremely well as you look forward.","Chris Harris","Okay. Very good. And then you guys have a much lower tax rate than many peers and you guys do have a distinctive corporate structure. Any thoughts on how tax reform in the U.S. will flow through to you guys? I assume there would be some benefit but maybe you could help walk us through the puts and takes there?","Loren Starr","Yes. Well, we don't know fully, obviously, what's really happening but what we would benefit from would be the lower tax rate in the U.S. on our U.S. business, which is clearly the largest part of our operating income right now. So that would be a direct benefit to us. There would be no, per se, benefit to us relative to the business outside the U.S. since we are currently living in a territorial tax regime based on our domicile.","So I think it would be limited in terms of what it offers us perhaps relative to other pure U.S. based firms. And as we have mentioned, we are free to bring back dividends without any tax consequences and we do so. And if there was some tax repatriation element, that would not provide any sort of immediate new opportunity for us. We do it all the time.","Chris Harris","Got you. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line now is open.","Michael Cyprys","Hi. Good mourning. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious if we could turn to M&A for a moment. Just wondering how your thinking on M&A is evolving just given the tough operating environment. To what extent would it make sense for Invesco to drive a bit more scale efficiencies in the business maybe with some M&A bolt-ons and even large-scale M&A here?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. Again as we have discussed this in the past, it is a reality now that scale does matter more than it really ever has historically in the asset management business. The good news is we have some good scale. That said, if you could find asset management complementary to what we are to improve capabilities, that has always been our primary focus and get scale at the same time, that would be ideal. So again, we just continue to be open minded to those opportunities. I would say there's nothing blatantly obvious at the moment as we continue to look at the marketplace.","Michael Cyprys","Okay. And maybe if we could just turn to your Asia business for a moment, seeing a lot of success there. It looks like the AUM in your Asia-Pacific is up about 26%, year-on-year or so if my numbers are right. So can you just talk about how you are thinking about building out your business in Asia? What inning do you think you are in terms of the build-out? And what's left on your to-do list in terms of, is it more product focused or distribution? And how do you see the business in five years from now?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. Look, it's a very important part of our business. It is really, as you say, now generating an important contribution to the firm. And the focus really right now is on distribution excellence. We feel we have the capabilities in place, very, very strong management team leadership and we would imagine that it will continue to be a more important part of the business in five years from now. And I will stand at that.","Loren Starr","And in terms of products, we have seen already great take on of products like real estate and fixed income. I think we are seeing growing product take on multi-manage and multi-asset allocation products. So that's a newer theme that is coming in and generally just around the alternatives overall is something where we see more and more opportunity for us in the region.","Marty Flanagan","And I would just add, we really strongly believe we are uniquely positioned in China, both at a retail level and institutional level and we think that the future is very, very positive there for us.","Michael Cyprys","Okay. If I could just ask one last one there just on Asia. Any sense in terms of the breakdown in terms of countries that are larger or smaller than others in terms of contribution to AUM there? And any particular ones where you see more outsized growth?","Loren Starr","I mean I think our biggest contributor would be China generally, probably followed by Japan would be next and then you get into much smaller, Taiwan and Australia. So those would be the two big ones.","Michael Cyprys","Super. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Your line now is open.","Patrick Davitt","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just have a quick one on the bank loan trend. And from the data we can see, it looks like retail is taking a lot of flow share and on the other end of the spectrum it looks like we have seen some institutional outflows from kind of traditional separate account vehicles broadly. Are you seeing it become or the ETF structure become more popular with institutions in that asset class in the Trump rally inflows there?","Loren Starr","Yes. I mean I don't know if we have seen the institutional outflow that you are talking about. We have seen actually strong take on and again this comment though is on a global basis. So globally there's just no question that bank loan, separate accounts, definitely in growth mode. In terms of our U.S. presence, I think it's still been pretty positive but ETFs have been clearly taken on at a much higher pace in the U.S. than any other region. So maybe de facto, your comment is correct because we are seeing that BKLN grow quite a bit.","Patrick Davitt","Is that flow institutional or retail?","Loren Starr","It's a little bit of both, I would say. Our presence has historically been more retail than institutional. And so I would say it would most likely be mostly retail just because of our install base. But we know that there is some institutional buyers of that product as well.","Patrick Davitt","Okay. Thank you.","Loren Starr","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question at this time is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line now is open.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just one quick one. Loren, on the third-party distribution expense, that's been moving down a little bit more than the assets and the advisory fees. So that sounds like it's been helping results relative to some other areas. So just if you can give us some color on the trajectory of that line in 2017? And what some of the big factors in moving that are?","Loren Starr","Yes. I think there was a little bit of movement down this quarter that had more to do, as I mentioned, sort of around contract adjustments at year-end, which tends to happen, true-ups and things of that nature around some of the distribution arrangements and new ones coming in, getting signed. So the trajectory is pretty stable. I don't think there's a major change in terms of that number relative to our net revenue yield in aggregate.","So it is one where from the U.K. obviously the RDR impacts are fully through. And so we have seen the pay way sort of go away on that part. But in the U.S., which may be more the point that you are getting to, there's nothing material changing on that line item.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And is it the base, the $351 million base, would that be actually higher ex the contract adjustments then?","Loren Starr","Yes. That's right.","Brian Bedell","Do you have a magnitude of that?","Loren Starr","I am sorry.","Brian Bedell","That's okay. That's all right. No, thanks so much.","Loren Starr","Okay.","Marty Flanagan","Well, thank you very much for joining us and I am sure we will be talking to people soon. So have a good rest of the day.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining.

Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin L. Flanagan","Thank you very much, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. With me is Loren Starr, Invesco's CFO, and we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on the website if you're so inclined to follow.","Today, we'll provide a review of the business results for the second quarter. Loren will then go into greater detail of the financials and we will then wrap it up with Q&A.","So let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter, which you'll find on Slide 3. Long-term investment performance remained strong across all time periods during the quarter. Strong investment performance, a broad diversity of flows and continued focus on client contributed to strong overall flows for the quarter. These were offset somewhat by a previously disclosed single client withdrawal in our U.K. business, which resulted in net long-term outflows of $6.9 billion. Excluding the single client withdrawal, long-term net inflows would have totaled $6.2 billion across our global business.","Adjusted operating income was up 21.4% over the same quarter last year, and a continued focus on taking a disciplined approach to our business drove continued improvement in our operating margin to 41.8% from 39.3% in the same quarter a year ago, an increase of 2.5 percentage points.","Assets under management rose to $802 billion during the quarter, up from $787 billion in the prior quarter.","Operating income was $377 million versus $363 million in the prior quarter.","Earnings per share were $0.65, up from $0.60 in the prior quarter. The quarterly dividend remained $0.25 per share, up 11% from 2013, and we've repurchased $50 million in common stock during the quarter.","Before Loren goes into detail on the financials, let me take a moment to review the investment performance and some business highlights. I'm on Slide 6 now.","Investment performance during the quarter was strong across all time periods. 80% of assets were ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year basis and 72% of assets were ahead of peers on a 1-year basis. As you might expect with numbers like these, long-term performance for investment team across the enterprise was quite strong with a number of capabilities achieving top decile performance.","Turning to flows on Page 7, you'll see gross sales remained strong during the quarter, although down from exceptionally strong first quarter. As we mentioned on our last call, there was an exceptional single client withdrawal in our U.K. business of $13.1 billion early in the second quarter, which resulted in long-term net outflows of $6.9 billion. Without this withdrawal, total long-term net inflows would have been $6.2 billion. These numbers also reflect the broad diversity of flows we saw across our global business during the quarter, which includes strength in real estate, fixed income, European equities, Asian equities and others.","Gross sales in our retail channel were also strong during the second quarter, although off slightly from the exceptional first quarter. Continued strength in our European cross-border retail product range and solid gross sales across our business helped offset the previously disclosed single client withdrawal we experienced in the U.K. The institutional channel continue to -- saw continued demand for real estate and Asian equities across the globe drove positive flows during the quarter. Overall, sales during the period were typical for the second quarter and reduced redemptions led to long-term inflows of $1.3 billion.","The institutional pipeline of one, but not funded mandate continues to be strong, principally in alternatives, real estate bank loans and non-U.S. active equities.","Let me take a moment to highlight our global business, which you'll find on Slide 9. In the Americas, U.S. flows were driven by international growth and U.S. Value equities, high-yield munis and UITs. And the redemption rate was 22% versus the industry average of 27%. U.S. retail gross sales were up 29% over the trailing 12 months in 2014 versus the same period in 2013. And there was a 65% increase in the number of mutual funds and ETFs with more than $100 million of inflows. A client-focused effort on April flows and top quartile investment performance in the U.S. drove down redemptions and further eased outflows from $526 million in January to outflows of $72 million in June.","In Asia-Pacific, we saw continued strong gross and net inflows with the exception of increased redemption in Chinese active equities where we saw some profit taking after the very strong results a year ago. The Shinko U.S. REIT and the Australian bond fund both enjoyed continued strong inflows. We also so good flows in Asia-Pacific institutional.","Our EMEA business continued to become more diversified with significant flows to the Fixed Income, non-U.S. equities and our multi-asset capability. All driven by very strong investment performance. U.K. retail gross flows were higher year-to-date in the prior year and flows into the cross-border business were significantly ahead of last year.","Assets under management by our EMEA business totaled $176 billion, as you can see on Slide 10. During the second quarter, net flows into EMEA, excluding U.K. equity income, were $300 million, which reflects the previously disclosed single client withdrawal earlier in the quarter.","We're pleased to report that the client reactions to departure news has been subdued and we saw no spike in redemptions at the time of a competing fund launch in June. Given our efforts to thoughtfully manage the transition, assets in the 2 principal funds have fallen just 15% from the departure announcement in October of last year through the end of June. We expect future growth in EMEA to more than offset any potential outflows from the funds. Mark Barnett and the team continue to deliver outstanding results for clients. As of mid-July, the 2 funds were sixth and eighth out of 265 funds in their sector over 1 year. Redemptions from advisors, the largest component of assets in the funds, are returning to industry norms and have clearly not impacted fund performance. This is a good outcome and we remain cautiously optimistic as clients are choosing to remain invested in the funds.","Meanwhile, 2014 gross sales across our broader U.K. retail franchise are at all-time high of $7.3 billion year-to-date in 2014 versus $5.7 billion during the same period in 2013. We find these results encouraging and we'll continue to do everything we can to deliver good outcomes for clients and grow the EMEA business.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Loren for a review of the financials.","Loren M. Starr","Thanks very much, Marty. So quarter-over-quarter total AUM increased $15.1 billion or 1.9% and this was driven by positive market returns and FX of $23.9 billion and net inflows in money market funds of $1.1 billion and these increases were offset by long-term outflows of $6.9 billion and $3 billion of outflows from the QQQ.","Our average AUM for the quarter was $790.1 billion and that's up 1.3% versus the first quarter average. Our net revenue yield came in at 45.6 basis points, which was flat quarter-over-quarter. The decline in performance fees from the first quarter reduced our revenue yield by 1.4 basis points and this was entirely offset by increases in our effective fee rate as a result of improved mix, one extra day during the quarter and higher other revenues in 2Q.","Now before we turn to operating results as we always do, just a quick peek into our current flow trends. As of yesterday, we had $2.3 billion in long-term net inflows across diversified geographies and also diversified across our investment capabilities. The only caveat obviously is we're entering August so there tends to be some seasonality and also obviously there is some market volatility, but we're off to a very nice start into Q3.","So now turning to our operating results. You'll see that our net revenues increased $13.2 million or 1.5% quarter-over-quarter to $901 million. That included positive FX impact of $6.6 million. And within net revenues, you'll see that our investment management fees grew by $65.5 million or 6.6% to $1.05 billion. This somewhat exceptionally large increase was due to several factors: first, in April, aligned with evolving industry best practices, our U.K. business took the proactive step to introduce a single fund management fee for their retail funds in an effort to address complexity in overall fund fee structures. This single fee replaced the separate annual management fee and fund registration fee. The results of this change was a shift, and it was purely a shift, of $29.6 million out of service and distribution revenues and into investment management fees. Excluding the impact of this shift, investment management fees would have increased $35.9 million or a 3.6%, which is consistent with our higher average AUM, an additional day during the quarter and again continued improvement in our effective fee rate. FX increased investment management fees by $8.6 million.","Service and distribution revenues were down $23.9 million or 10%. As I just mentioned, the change in the fee structure in U.K. resulted in a decline of $29.6 million. Excluding the impact of this shift, service and distribution fees would have increased $5.7 million or 2.4%. FX increased service and distribution revenues by $0.2 million.","So in the quarter, performance fees came in at $7.3 million and that was a decrease of $22.5 million from Q1. Foreign exchange had no impact on performance fees in the quarter.","In terms of guidance going forward, the Q3 tends to be a seasonal low point for performance fees and we believe the range could be somewhere between $2 million and $5 million. For Q4 of this year and beyond, the picture is somewhat less clear. There are certain real estate and other alternative funds and institutional accounts that could generate meaningful performance fees, but recognizing this revenue is limited by the potential for contingencies such as clawbacks per our accounting policy.","Other revenues in the second quarter came in at $38.9 million and that was an increase of $3.2 million. Invesco launched successfully a Japanese REIT fund in June, which resulted in $6 million of transaction fees in the quarter. The $6 million in fees should not be viewed as recurring, and as a result, I think other revenues you should think should fall to the level of $33 million to $35 million in Q3.","Third-party distribution service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues increased by $5.3 million or 1.3%. That is in line with our higher revenues derived from REIT-related retail AUM. FX increased these expenses by $2.9 million.","Moving on down the slide, you'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $524 million decreased by $0.8 million or 0.2% relative to the first quarter. FX increased operating expenses by $3.1 million during the quarter.","Drilling down into expenses. On employee compensation, that came in at $344.6 million. That was a decrease of $8.5 million or 2.4%. The decrease in Q2 was a result of the normal reduction in payroll tax costs, which was partially offset by increased incentive compensation and a full quarter's worth of base salary increases that took effect on March 1. FX increased compensation by $2.1 million.","Looking forward, assuming flat ending AUM, we expect compensation to increase by approximately $5 million to $8 million in the third quarter and then remain roughly flat into Q4. This change is consistent with the fact that our current AUM level is about 2% higher than the second quarter average AUM level.","Marketing expense increased by $6.7 million or 27.7% to $30.9 million as a result of advertising and client-related marketing in EMEA. FX increased these expenses by $0.2 million.","We expect marketing expense to remain flat into Q3 and then increase somewhere up to $35 million in Q4 due to our continued focus on EMEA-specific marketing opportunities.","Property, office and technology expenses came in at $76.1 million in the second quarter, which was down $1.6 million. The decrease reflects lower rent and related costs due to vacating of leased properties in the first quarter. FX increased these expenses by $0.4 million.","Looking forward, we'd expect property, office and technology costs will increase to $80 million to $82 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. This increase is a result of continued technology investments, a doubling of space taken to accommodate the continued growth in our Hyderabad office and variable costs related to our elevated sales activity in Europe.","General and administrative expenses came in at $72.4 million. That's up $2.6 million or 3.7%. The increase was due to greater legal, training and other professional services costs incurred during the quarter. FX increased G&A by $0.4 million.","We'd expect G&A to remain around $73 million to $75 million as we continue to launch new products and pursue business growth initiatives.","Continuing on down the page, you'll see the non-operating income increased $12.9 million compared to the first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by realized gains on seed capital investments of $5.7 million and we also had $4.7 million gain from the liquidation of a CLO in the quarter.","The firm's effective tax rate on preadjusted net income in Q2 was 26.5%. Looking forward, we expect the effective tax rate to remain between 26% to 27%, which brings us to our EPS or adjusted EPS of $0.65 and our adjusted net operating margin of 41.8%.","And with that, I will now turn things back over to Marty.","Martin L. Flanagan","All right. Thanks very much, and operator, can we go to questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Daniel Fannon, Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, just on the Perpetual products and more the equity income funds, you highlighted no spike in redemptions. I guess can you talk about kind of the gross sales dynamic in those products pre and post the competing launch. And then kind of the outlook, I think you said you're having the highest gross sale of all time in EMEA. Can you just kind of talk about what the top fund -- the top sales or funds that are driving those sales as well.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, so let me start that and clarify, Dan. So what I was pointing was gross sales in the U.K. are at an all-time high. So you compare gross sales this year to date as compared to last year, year-to-date. Let me pull the numbers again. It was, as I'm paging through it, was -- so year-to-date gross sales in the U.K. were $7.3 billion versus $5.7 billion a year ago. And so the uptake has been a broad -- a real broadening of gross sales into the U.K. business. So that includes European equities, global equities, Asia -- Asian equities, the multi-asset strategies and just the fixed income continues to be very, very strong literally across-the-board. And if you look at the investment performance, asset class-by-asset class, it's just incredibly strong. And so the point that we're trying to make is the business has never been stronger. Yes, there's been a transition to Mark's results who put up some -- and team some really good numbers, but that is the main message there. And I don't have the specific gross flows of the U.K. equity income products, but what I can say is the redemptions are back to industry norms and typically when you go through changes like that, you start by being put on hold and some of the holds are being taken off and so you're starting to see gross sales pick up also. So it's a really -- again in the context of an important change, the business has never been stronger.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. And then I guess, Loren, just to clarify the comment around the fee change in the U.K. with regards to the management fees and I guess the impact on sales and distribution fees, is that ongoing when we think about the economics today and that impact is kind of the run rate from here?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, Dan. Yes, it's purely a shift. It has nothing to do with RDR. It's really just the shift that is onetime, and then foregoing, it will continue on that same track.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And any change in client behavior as a result of that shift?","Loren M. Starr","No, I mean, I think we've gotten very good praise from the industry, from regulators and others who care about this. So, so far, it's been well received and I think we are sort of out in front of many, many others in the industry first with this. We'll see how others follow.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Harris, Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So a quick one on Perpetual. I know we've talked about the outflows for some time now and it's definitely good news that there's been no spike since you've launched the competing fund. But it doesn't appear to me that the outflows are slowing that material there either. Just wanted to maybe if you can confirm if that's accurate, number one. And then number two, do you think you have any sort of visibility on maybe when those might kind of decelerate in a more significant degree? I know it's hard, but maybe just many of your discussions with clients or what have you that might give you a little bit of comfort or color about the trajectory of that.","Loren M. Starr","Look, Chris, I think what you're seeing is there's still some smaller platforms that are sort of making smaller moves, much, much smaller level of magnitude relative to what you saw with the SJP and that's really what you're seeing currently and that probably persists somewhere between now and the end of the year, quite honestly. We do think X those little kind of smaller platform positions, the overall trend in the core retail advisor-led book of business is definitely stabilizing. But we're definitely looking to increase our advertising in Q4 and marketing. And so we're not being complacent around everything is fine still. There's still work that we think should be done. But factually, we've not seen big spikes and it seems more of a business as usual addition in the U.K. than anything else.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, that is definitely good news. Okay. Real quick follow-up then on the margin. Very specific guidance you've given us, but just more kind of broad, big picture question. Incredible improvement in the merger and you guys are kind of exceeding what you had said you'd do there. I know some of that is market related, but as you sit here today, where do you really think this number can go? I mean, do you think there's a lot more room to run on your operating margin?","Loren M. Starr","So I think, Chris, as we've said in the past. It will have a lot to do with sort of marketing environment we're in and what sort of help we're going to get from equities versus fixed income-led type of environment. We have and can and will grow under sort of flat markets. We have very good product that will be very much in demand under a sort of volatile-type market environment. We think that when equity markets are stronger, however, we actually will fare even better generally and so our incremental margin is probably going to be higher when you're in an equity-led market than otherwise. But with that said, we're still sort of in that range sort of 55% incremental margin, 60% incremental margin, which should help us continue to drive the margin upward over time. So there isn't anything structural that would prevent our margins from continuing to expand as you've seeing them do right now.","Operator","The next question is from Bill Katz, Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just to follow up on that thread of question, just to work it the other way. Given such high incremental margin and a good performance of the platform on what appears to be overcoming the Woodford attrition nicely, why not step up the spending earlier to really capitalize on the positioning of the platform and maybe trade a little unit growth for margin?","Martin L. Flanagan","So I'm surprised you asked that question, Bill. The fundamental fact is what you're seeing with the margin expansion, what is going along with it is strong reinvestment in the business right now. We've continued to do, it but we're getting margin expansion while reinvesting in the business. And the areas that we've talked about over time, Continental Europe was a focus and you can see things coming from that. Fixed income has been a focus. You can see the investment performance in fixed income is very strong right now. That was another area that we think were followed by flows. Also very important to us is the alternative platform, which has been, really, we think it's a core strength of the organization. And we've been expanding that and taking it globally. And so we're trying to be very, very thoughtful in our expansion, investing while at the same time generating the returns that you would expect of us as good stewards. So I appreciate the thought, but we are very much investing.","Loren M. Starr","I can confirm that.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's more of a devil's advocate question. The second question I have is when you look in Europe, and maybe I did the math a little too quick this morning, I think it was about 30% annualized rate of growth in new business. What is it that's driving it? Is this a further market share opportunity, broader geography reach, better distribution, a combination thereof? What are some of the key drivers to that solid growth?","Martin L. Flanagan","So yes, again that was one of those overnight successes that we started 4 years ago and it was across-the-board. And you should go back a few years, you'll look at it so redoing the servicing platform, which was fundamental; realigning the product lineup, and if you look at it right now, this is very robust product lineup with the investment performance being extremely strong across the asset classes there; and with, frankly, a strategy that you would hope, very concentrated on those areas that we think we could make a difference and sales execution and taking care of clients. And that's what you're seeing happening. And I think importantly, if you look at the flows there going into, we should want to call it, core asset classes, which years gone by it was much more smaller asset classes. So again, we just feel the robustness of where we are and the future opportunity is very, very strong for us in the continent. So we don't think we're done.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just one last one. When you think about money market reform, a couple of your peers have sort of commented on what the implications might be. It's obviously early days. Just based on your mix, how do you sort of see any impact on the business and maybe what are you hearing from clients?","Martin L. Flanagan","So good question. It's hard to believe what started in 2008 is finally coming to an end. I'd say in the -- again, put on your analyst hat in the worst case, if all our prime went away, it's what, Loren?","Loren M. Starr","$30 billion, about $30 billion AUM.","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes, so it's not...","Loren M. Starr","11 basis points.","Martin L. Flanagan","11 basis points. So it's not a huge financial impact, but let me -- but here's the reality. We don't think that's going to happen to us. If you look at the suite of money fund capabilities we have, they're very, very competitive. We think we're going to be really very fine in it. And again, I think we'll be positioned very, very strongly in the changes as they come through. And clients are still trying to -- look it's been a -- it's not a new story. So clients are banging [ph] their heads around this potential outcome probably for 24 months, I'd say, already.","Loren M. Starr","So I mean, we've created other products that would be nice alternatives to prime fund option, which we think would capture a significant amount of people who want to find something of a similar nature. We obviously have a government fund where people might go to initially. So in terms of the loss of the full $30 billion, I think that is sort of the very tail of risk to the business.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Kim, Sandler O'Neill + Partners.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So first, just in terms of flows. Loren, you'd touched on this a bit earlier, but just looking ahead, do you feel like you really need sort of a sustained favorable market backdrop to really drive organic growth to the next level, if you will, understanding that there are still areas of the business that can continue to grow even assuming the markets remain somewhat choppy?","Loren M. Starr","Yes, I mean, I think we have close to 48% of our assets, something around there, in equities. So the reality is for us to be able to grow our AUM as a percentage, sort of organic growth rate, equities need to somehow be plain enrolled there. Otherwise, we can grow and we have certainly huge diversification growth of other asset classes that would be in demand when we weren't or not in an equity-led market. But we do think, overall, our ability to get organic growth to the highest level would probably be under on an equity-led market. But again, it's all relative, right, to peers and competitors. So we still think we should and we obviously aspire to do better than our competitors under all markets in terms of being able to grow.","Martin L. Flanagan","And I'd probably add to that, Michael. So Loren is especially correct when you saw that happen this quarter where it was less of an equity-led market this past quarter. And we still did quite well, but getting back to the point I made earlier, I think if you were looking out a couple of years, you have to expect some volatility. You have to expect rates to go up at some point and a pullback in the equity markets. And so that gets back to this point of we thought it really, really important to have a broad suite of alternative capabilities that were in place for those types of markets, focused much more on outcomes for clients. And so again I think the diversity of the business and the strength of the alternative capabilities along with fixed income and equity just put us in a very unique position regardless of the market.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it, that's helpful. And then just on the capital management front, continue to repurchase shares, cash continues to build. So just curious to get your thoughts on sort of the regulatory front across regions, and how that may be playing into your capital management thinking, if at all?","Loren M. Starr","I don't think we're -- it's business as usual on the capital management front right now. We are, obviously, keenly observant and listening to -- and observing on what's going on, on the regulatory front, as you said. But there isn't anything imminent that we're seeing that is going to affect our business-as-usual approach, but it is something that we are smartly watching. Marty, I don't know if you have any further...","Martin L. Flanagan","Yes -- no, I agree with that. So we're on the -- our stated capital policies that we have been on. But I think it would be unwise to ignore the regulatory focus and we're very engaged in trying to understand what's possible. But again, we're still heading down the path that we've been on at the moment.","Operator","The next question is from Glenn Schorr, ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","On the alt front, we talked -- danced around that a little bit. So I want to do 2 things: one is talk about the new product launches that happened, I guess, over the last 2 quarters, particularly on the liquid alt front just talk about performance, talk about what you've been able to muster up in terms of sales; and then, two, at a broader level, performance at least on what we can see on the equity side of alt isn't where you wanted to be. Just talk through what particularly you see the most positive outlook on the alt front?","Martin L. Flanagan","Sure, so let me get started. So it has been, as you point out, end of last year versus part of this year, so introduction of really suite of alts more broadly not just in the U.S., but in the U.K., in the offshore range also. Our view is, as we said in the past, when you introduce capabilities you have to think that it's a 3-year outlook and if it happens before that, you're quite fortunate. But that's been our framework. That said, if you look at the teams, these are teams who've been managing close to the same strategies for a very long time institutionally with some very, very good track records. That's a very helpful element, too, and some of them are extensions of what's been done in the past whether it be around IBRA and different extensions there. So that's helpful. I'd say the shorter-term opportunity probably looks more with the GTR capability, global total return capability that's getting some traction. But again, I'd say early days. It will be -- the first launch in the U.K. was September a year ago, so you're coming up on 1 year, performance is very, very strong. And it's that type of asset class or product that people are looking at is more a less volatile targeted return and...","Loren M. Starr","I think we have about $1 billion in that capability.","Martin L. Flanagan","$1 billion so far. So again, our view is 3-year view and we'll have some likely positive surprises within that period, but it's hard to identify.","Loren M. Starr","I think we're also having great, I wouldn't say success, but early success with our long\/short capability, which the performance is very, very strong. So there may be something we'll see, but these are all small products right now. It takes a while. And then on your question on the equity side of alt, I'm not sure exactly what you're referring too, Glenn, but when you look at our performance, I think you may be looking at the REITs more than in an equity part. So maybe can you just clarify what you're talking about, Glenn?","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Sure, just Slide 18. It just shows those little ring charts on percent of assets in the top half, first bottom half.","Loren M. Starr","Core, is that what -- so you said alts or you said core?","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Alternatives.","Loren M. Starr","Okay. So that is dominated by -- because alternatives, the way we capture this information for performance is when you have publicly available peers that we can compare to. And so the vast majority of our alternatives don't have public -- publicly available peers that we can talk about relative ranking. So this one slide is really being dominated by the REITs that are publicly traded. So it's not really an equity. It has to be -- everything to do with the way we manage that REIT product is very conservatively managed with some strong positive fall has been, I mean, we're generating sort of billions of sort of interest in that product. So it hasn't affected the demand for the product. So it's a little misleading, I think, when you look at that slide and you sort of broadly brush alternatives in terms of the performance.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last quickie, if I could. It's good to see the buyback and the share count down 3% year-on-year. And I know you guys are planning conservative, but you've got a lot of cash, you keep making more every quarter and the stock is cheap. I'm just curious on just increasing the pace at some point. Meaning, if things are going well and your producing a lot of cash flow and the stock is cheap, if not now, when, is, I guess, the question I get?","Loren M. Starr","So I think we've been of the mind that sort of being opportunistic when we think about buybacks and we continue to do so. We've also seen sort of rushing in and doing big buybacks can often lead to poor choices around the timing of markets. So the consistency of sort of averaging it through over periods of time has generally seemed to work better than sort of rapid step-ups. And so we have continued in terms of aggregate amounts to continue to buy back more of our stock. You should expect us to continue to do so, but I think it is in terms of what we said earlier, our priorities have not shifted in terms of how we see the needs of our capital and we continue to focus on sort of reinvesting in the business as our number one draw. And we have seen, more recently, some bigger needs around some seedings and co-investments as some of these alternative products have been getting off the ground.","Martin L. Flanagan","And I would add the other thing, which you would know very well. What, 2 years ago, we made a permanent change to materially increase the dividend and sort of make a permanent commitment to paying back to shareholders. And so when we looked at it, it was a totality of giving back to shareholders and a much heavy emphasis on dividends, not to say that we won't do stock buybacks. We'll continue to do it, but I think that was another strong message we are trying to get across.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Worthington, JPMC.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So Marty, I think you undersold this, so this I'm going to give it another shot at it. So you launched a host of new products in the U.S. The uptake of GTR has been excellent, even though it's really young product. So how far along is the product in terms of getting on new channels in the U.K. and Europe? You took in, I think, over $0.5 billion last quarter. So given the young age of the fund, why has it been so successful because it seems like the launch is doing even better than IBRA did and IBRA kind of peaked at $30 billion. So...","Martin L. Flanagan","All right, Ken, well, thank you. You're correct. And so let me put it in more context. So the U.K. is really certain. Again, that was the first launch last September. First, let me say this, across-the-board performance is very, very strong. And on the back of our client -- we came this way because we thought, in time, clients will be looking towards broadening their -- how they build their portfolios and this would be another important part in it. I'd say we're really early days in that development. That said, flows are really strong in U.K., as you pointed out. On the Continent, too, they are taken up much quicker than we thought they would. So again, as we look out to the next 12 months, we'd anticipate that would be another market where they would really probably do well. And I'd say, the teams reputation is more recognized in the U.K. and on a continent, as you would expect, coming from the U.K. originally. So those are probably be the 2 early markets where you'd see continued expansion and acceleration of flows. In the U.S., again, relatively early. There's quite a bit of interest. There's emerging, as you would imagine, institutional demand and that could probably be the area in the States where it might pick up more rapidly than in the retail channel. But again, I think it's a really attractive product with good performance. And again, you can do the extrapolation on IBRA, I won't. But again, it's strong performing and we think it's a very big opportunity.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","How far along is it, though, in terms of getting on platforms because it's a new product. Is it half the way? Is it all the way? Is it 10% of the way?","Loren M. Starr","So I think in the U.S., it's on a lot of the platforms, if not most of the platforms, but it is not yet sort of been sort of gatekeeper approved in terms of the models. So it is one of these things that just getting on the platform doesn't mean that it's -- we're going to be able to sell. And so it is one of these things, it's the first step of many to really have this product succeed in the U.S. But don't take this from saying that -- I mean, we're definitely working it hard. We think it's a huge opportunity both on a global basis.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just second question. The income in high-income funds got downgraded after Neil's departure. Based on your experience, how long would it take for those funds to kind of get back on the preferred list and recommended list if the performance remains? And I think those funds under Mark, more recently were in redemptions. What do you think needs to change to actually push those products to actually generate net new flows? Is it a simple as just keeping the performance where it is?","Martin L. Flanagan","Good question. So I don't have all the specifics on the radius, but you can -- look, you can read publicly, people are actually already considering, already putting it back in the buy list. So as you said from the beginning, Mark is highly experienced. The team is highly experienced. Great track record. So I think the wholes will participate more rapidly than you would expect in a different situation because of that. And so you're seeing early [indiscernible] But let me put this in perspective, Ken. So those 2 funds were in net redemptions before Neil's announcement and I think it's a really important point because these funds, they are very large, they're very old and when you look at the historical redemptions because of the age of the holders, redemptions are a material thing each and every year. So just to get into net flows, the level of sales that you have to meet because of the sheer size is material. So if we move back to the flow levels, preannouncement, which we are getting close to, that's not a horrible thing. Now our goal is not just to remain there, it's to get back into net flows, and we think, in time that will happen. So I think that's an important point to look at also. And if you look at, take -- I don't have the specific numbers, but if you look at the combined, those 2 funds combined, they still represent, I think, they're in the top 5 of gross sales selling funds in U.K. today. So I think that's really the perspective. They're just very large and very old client base. But again, we're moving into a very relatively very good spot at this stage of it. So long winded and hopefully that's helpful.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Shutler, William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a quick question on IBRA. So the performance there actually has turned around nicely for this year. So just want to get your updated thoughts on the pipeline, both retail and institutional there?","Loren M. Starr","So Chris, I think we're seeing redemption rates continue to drive lower on that IBRA product. I think it was on actually out of July on a global basis, I think the flow has turned positive. So again, I think it's -- I hate to say it's a turnaround now and declaring it fully, but certainly the performance on 3-year number -- 3-year track record year-to-date are sort of in the top quartile. So the product itself is becoming, I think, far more sort of attractive again to clients who are looking for what we originally promised to give, which is a sort of balanced risk across different asset classes. And it's -- I think sales are still sort of lower than we've seen them in the past. It's actually -- that's correct on a global basis, but the flow picture has been improved largely through and much lower redemption rates. So again, the goal was obviously to drive sales higher in that product over time, if we can.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, got you. And then a totally different question, bigger picture. With the PowerShares franchise, it's mainly a retail business today, I believe. So just curious to get your take in the ETF business of the institutional opportunity. So for instance, UBS was recently in the news. For putting a big portion of your DB plan and noncap-weighted indices, which is a lot of what PowerShares does. So -- but I believe they're mainly partnering directly with the index providers instead of using off-the-shelf product. So just want to get your take on institutional opportunity in terms of alternative weighted ETFs.","Martin L. Flanagan","So we do think it's an opportunity. It is one of those areas that, when I went through the litany a few minutes ago, that I didn't address but that's within it. So it's been very, very successful for us. There are further opportunities and really would be in the institutional market and it has not been an area where we have historically focused more recently we have headed down that path, so we think not just in the U.S., but in a couple other important markets we think that is an opportunity for us. So we think that will just continue to add to the ongoing success in PowerShares.","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Berg, RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You indicated that of the 13 approximately billion dollars of withdrawal that took place in the U.K. related to St. James's Place, that just over half of it related to the equity income funds being managed by Neil Woodford and his team, what's the remainder?","Loren M. Starr","So the other half, I think it was about $5 billion in what -- I think it's called a distribution fund, which is some mix between equity income and our corporate bond offering. And the remainder is in global equities.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So just to provide a rough sort of back-of-the-envelope reconciliation of where we are now relative to where we stand, how are those numbers go? And by that I mean start with how much money, please, Neil is managing at the time he announced his departure. I realized he remained with the organization for many, many months before departing and ultimately starting in his new place. But if you could just really in synopsized form start by telling us how much money he was managing in dollar terms, how much was lost to the institutional business, I think it's close to all of it, and where we stand on the remaining money, which is the retail side?","Loren M. Starr","So Eric, I think originally, preannouncement, it was around $48 billion was the amount and it's currently at $37 billion roughly. So we obviously have the big institutional redemption of $13.1 billion. I think in terms of the retail outflows, generally they've been somewhere around $0.5 billion to $1 billion a month, just normal. We're just getting a lot of that. It's consistent with what we've seen historically, so nothing different than what we've seen in the past. So again, I think you could probably take that and do the math here or someone smartly doing it for me. We had $17.7 billion of outflow in the time frame. And how much of that was retail versus institutional, I think probably most of it is going to be institutional largely.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So you started -- in the short\/long, you started with $48 billion.","Loren M. Starr","Yes.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The redemptions have been in $17 billion. That takes you down to -- so you wouldn't, therefore, $37 billion. You'd have $48 billion minus $17 billion or 31, is that correct or...","Loren M. Starr","We had market and FX that have helped to offset that.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And of the $17 billion in redemptions, most of it has been institutional. But just to be clear, while you talk about redemptions returning to more normal industry levels in the equity income funds, are the -- I just want to clarify, sort of triple check, the funds are in that redemption mode still, but at a lower rate than they have been. Is that kind of the point?","Loren M. Starr","That's absolutely right and maybe the net redemption since 2011. So just factually, again, this is what Marty said that's part of the fabric of being biggest in the industry. But I think, yes, they've sort of returned to more normal levels. They're still, as I think we may have mentioned slightly, some elevated levels that are 2 smaller platform outflows that could still occur. But not material in any sense of close to the magnitude of the St. James's Place. And we believe, again, broadly, in the context of EMEA business, that we can grow flows to more than offset that going forward.","Operator","The next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research.","M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP","We've heard anecdotally that the marketing of PowerShares in the U.K. pre-Woodford was fairly low. And I can't remember if you confirmed or denied that, but can you, I guess, talk about what is being done to improve the profile of that business there, particularly as it does look like the passive opportunity has gotten a little bit more interesting over the last year or so.","Martin L. Flanagan","So we actually had not been in the U.K. The focus have been on the continent for us. A number of years, it's probably 2007 that we went to the ETF markets. As you know, the market was very, very different than that of the United States and has gone through tremendous change from sort of derivatives-based ETFs to really cash-based ETFs. So we think there is quite a big opportunity within EMEA, within between the U.K. and Continental Europe, in particular. And that is back to one of the earlier questions, we see the institutional opportunity being one in the U.K., in particular, to be something very, very attractive and smart beta, in particular, seems to be not just confined to ETFs, but institutional clients as an opportunity that we think we should be successful in over time.","M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP","Do you think it's fair to say that, I guess, the thinking around, I guess, how much weight you want to put behind marketing PowerShares specifically in the U.K. has changed since the PM changed? Or is that not the case?","Martin L. Flanagan","No, our effort has nothing to do with -- first, I'll say it's the strategic focus. Again, originally focused on the continent. We think one of the opportunities in the U.K. really has come -- is emerging because of RDR. The emergence of RDR actually, we think, is an added opportunity to the ETF markets, smart beta and also the institutional market. And U.K., as you're obviously noting is a very, very important, large ETF market that we have not historically participated in.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Bedell, Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. Kind of actually have my question on the PowerShares, but maybe just to -- just an extension of that, how should we think about timing. You are underpenetrated in that area and the opportunity seems pretty compelling, like you said, Marty, post, especially post RDR. Should we be thinking of that as a bigger effort over the next, I don't know, 12 to 18 months with a potentially stronger ramp throughout that period? Or is this is a much longer-term group?","Martin L. Flanagan","I'm sorry, you're breaking up some. Let me just confirm. So it's the ETF opportunity, what's the timing of it?","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Sort of the pace of that given that it's been more of a newer effort in terms of post-RDR that is. So I\u2019m trying to get the sense of timing now that were through the RDR process.","Martin L. Flanagan","You're exactly right. So I would be, again it's probably the next 12 to 18 months that you'll start to see we're clarifying how we want to play what we think the opportunity is. And again, you'll see what we choose to do over that period of time.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Okay, great. And then maybe shifting gears to defined-benefit market. Maybe just some color on -- obviously, you have a very good product set for the potential outflows and active equity and the shift towards passive and increased barbelling that we're seeing through some alpha products and a more liability-driven investing. Maybe just some color on how you're positioned there. Should we see potential increases in mandates for you on that side? Or do you view it as more of a balanced risk for your franchise overall?","Martin L. Flanagan","Let me try to answer the question, if I understood it. So if you look at our capabilities, very, very much focused on active investing and whether it be -- it went from alternatives through our historical capabilities, whether it be equity or fixed income and broadening of the alternatives capabilities more broadly around the world as we talked about. Where we then see an opportunity for ourselves is the strength that we have with our quantitative teams and with PowerShares around what people are referring to smart beta and variations of that. And we think the combination of that range is very, very strong and competitive globally, but also within retail channels as you're speaking off.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So on the defined-benefit side, you feel that you can be a net winner over the next 2 to 3 years versus some other more plain active equity managers that are losing share to rebalancing?","Martin L. Flanagan","No question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Okay, great. And maybe just one quick one on the U.K. and it has already beating a dead horse in this, but I think just using -- looking at the math of the U.K. equity income product, looks like you had $3.3 billion in outflows in the quarter. Just trying to get a sense of that trajectory over April, May and June and whether that sounds like it's improving that outflow pace into July.","Loren M. Starr","Yes, so Brian, I think that's one that we probably are going to be somewhat better than the pace, we would hope. Again, it's not getting worse. We think it's one that's going to continue to improve through the course of the year. But again, it's a little hard to say with great certainty because there are these smaller types of platform that may make decisions along the way and those can be $0.5 billion here or $0.25 billion there. But overall, I think what you're saying is sort of that level and improving through the course of the year and then probably, by the end of the year, we'll have much better clarity in terms of just say all that will be more solid in terms of whether people are coming or going or leaving.","Operator","The next question is from Greggory Warren, Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just on the Perpetual sort of a housekeeping note. There were no non-compete agreements that we need to worry about where 6 months or a year from the road now that he'll go out and start poaching more of our clients. Is that an issue for you?","Loren M. Starr","Yes. So Gregg, I think what we're used to fighting on the retail battlefield whatever and so in terms of loss of clients and we compete with them, and gee, we compete with many others. So there's nothing that will prevent anybody or Neil's fund to take clients from us if they win them fair and square. And so I think it is one where we think that we're well positioned to compete. And we have significant marketing dollars and we have significant sales force strength and obviously a fantastic investment team that is sort of tried and true. So we think that will win and we don't necessarily have to worry about structural sort of legal non-competes or anything like that.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay so basically, it's kind of fair game right now then.","Loren M. Starr","Fair game, yes.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the other question I had is it looks like your net revenue yield before performance fees came down -- or came up actually pretty considerably quarter-over-quarter. Was part of that the shift in institutional -- the outflows in the institutional side? It doesn't really seem, I mean -- equity AUM seems to be about the same level as it was in the first quarter. I'm just kind of curious what caused that shift in the net revenue yield.","Loren M. Starr","Yes, about 0.6 basis point is just due to day count, so that's a normal second quarter to first quarter impact. But we definitely have mixed benefits that is still driving forward. It has more to do with geography than it does sort of what type of asset class as we continue to flow strongly with growth sales -- record sales outside the U.S., which is where the fee rates tend to be higher that is helping to drive our mix and our yields to higher levels.","Operator","The next question is from Brennan Hawken, UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All my questions have been -- has, I think, been asked at this point.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Lee, KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And also if you may have touched on this earlier, but I have been kind of jumping around different earnings this morning. The only question I have was in, I guess, it relates to PowerShares. I mean, some of your competitors and whatnot out there have an ETF business, have been, I guess, fairly loud or noisy, however you want to describe it, about why they would not do or don't think things like bank loans are appropriate for an ETF structure and I know that's been a pretty successful product for you in PowerShares. So I don't know, to what extent do you see that as you're comfortable with some of the concerns that they raised? Or how do you view those -- how would, how should we put those comments in the context?","Martin L. Flanagan","Thanks for the question. So look, you would know and just for everybody else, we have a very, very strong bank loan team. We manage $30 billion in assets more or less. They've been doing it for decades. We've actually have had an open-ended bank loan funds since the '90s. It is something we are -- feel very comfortable managing. I think it is something that we're not concerned about. And also when you look at the liquidity within the ETF up to 20% of it is in sort of very liquid assets, which would probably meet anybody's idea of redemption. On top of that, there is a line of credit if there is something beyond that. So the idea that this is much different than other open-ended funds, I think, whether it be bank loans or high yield or you could go to small-cap stocks, I mean it is just part of what comes with managing various funds, and if you look at the sheer size of the markets and the redemptions that was less than 1% of the redemptions that you saw in the bank loan market during the period where there were some redemptions of bank loans. So again, I don't see it much different than how we manage our business on a daily basis.","Operator","And sir with that, I'm showing no further questions.","Martin L. Flanagan","Great. Well, thank you very much for joining us, everybody. I appreciate the engagement and the questions, and we'll speak to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, and this does conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time."],"12668":["Invesco Ltd.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director, Investments.","Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Marty Flanagan","Thank you very much, and thanks everybody for joining. This is Marty Flanagan, along with Loren Starr, our CFO, and Andrew Schlossberg, Head of the Americas. And if you're so inclined, the presentation is on the website if you want to follow along. That said, we're going to follow the format that we did last quarter where much shorter prepared remarks so we can get to Q&A. Loren will get a brief overview of the business results before we get into the questions though.","And as we've discussed on previous calls, we view this combination with Oppenheimer's multi growth - multi-year growth story that deepened our relationship with Invesco clients, expanded the capabilities offered globally, scaled the business for both the benefit of our clients and shareholders, and we're already seeing that. This expansion meaningfully enhances our ability to grow our business, achieve very strong operating results, and compete in the ever increasing dynamic market environments.","Importantly, this is a long-term growth story. That said, we are seeing real and meaningful signs of the power of the combined firm. We ended the year with just over $1.2 trillion in assets under management. That's a 38% increase year-over-year. That's a record high for the firm. We also have higher assets under management across all channels and all regions as we ended the year.","Long-term outflows for the year were $34 billion. That's a 11% improvement from the prior year. We hit record levels of revenue and record levels of operating profits for the year ended 2019. We also achieved significant expense savings delivering ahead of schedule and at $551 million is more than $25 million ahead of the synergy target that we talked about at the time of the combination. And we'll continue to look for additional synergies in 2020.","Lastly, and importantly, we did return $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2019. And looking ahead, we believe we are well on the path to continue to make progress to move into positive flows in 2020.","The key factors that we've looked at are improving equity performance and several capabilities where they're in high demand, continued very strong fixed income performance, meaningful progress on the integration of our U.S. sales team, strong momentum in our growing China and ETF business, a very strong institutional pipeline, including large ones and solutions. And finally, the clarity on Brexit will help the investors who backs away risk on mindset and we are beginning to see that.","So, I'm going to turn it over to Loren to give our results.","Loren Starr","Thank you, Marty.","So, I'd like to spend the next few minutes highlighting some of the key items for you on the topic of flows, expenses and capital management. So, starting on flows, as you can see on Slide 7, we're seeing year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter long-term net inflow improvements in the regions of EMEA ex-UK and our Asia-Pac area.","The Q4 net flow growth in EMEA ex-UK was driven largely by our ETF business as well as our direct real estate business. So we saw, for example, $0.9 billion in the S&P 500 UCITS ETF and $0.7 billion in real estate.","The Q4 growth in Asia-Pacific is largely centered in Greater China and is driven by strong flows into our joint venture. The JV flows were $2.6 billion across many asset classes with fixed income contributing $1.7 billion followed by balanced $0.8 billion. We are also seeing quarter-over-quarter improvement in our UK business.","We had positive net flows in our institutional business, and that was driven by direct real estate primarily but also fixed income where we had $1.3 billion in real estate and $1.1 billion in fixed income. Our retail flows do remain somewhat challenged.","You'll see the majority of the $16 billion in net outflows in Americas was attributable to the retail business, and that was driven by a $9.4 billion in outflows from some of the legacy OFI funds, some of the largest outflows included. OFI global equities, there was $3.9 billion there and the OFI senior loans $2.2 billion.","We didn't see a natural redemption out of maturity of our BulletShares. There was $1.7 billion out of that activity. $0.8 billion came from Invesco International Growth, $0.7 billion from stable value, and $0.6 billion from global asset allocation. I'd like to note though that about $2 billion of these outflows is due to the previously disclosed New Mexico 529 plan. It was a deal related redemption that we discussed earlier.","So, on the next page, let's drill down a little bit on net inflows in the Americas. So you'll see on Slide 8 we show the 2019 history of AUM monthly gross sales and net flows for the Invesco and the OFI U.S. active retail products combined, which includes periods both pre and post close. So, another way, this reflects the two firms together over the entire period, including the pre-acquisition period.","So these tables highlight a few points. So first, both the legacy Invesco and OppenheimerFunds have maintained AUM levels aided by the market. Net revenue yields are stable across the timeframe.","Second, you'll see our gross sales post close are still well below the pre-close levels, and they did dip in Q4 although we did see a stronger December. We've made progress with the integration of the two sale teams and we worked to provide the teams with the tools that they need to hit the ground running in 2020, but we are not fully operational yet. We do have Andrew Schlossberg, as Marty mentioned, the Head of our Americas business here with us on the call today and he'll be able to elaborate on this during the Q&A session.","Third point I'd like to make is, net outflows have been elevated post close. And this is largely a function of the abnormally low gross sales levels in conjunction with performance challenges we have in some of our active equity portfolios. As you can see on the chart in Q4, outflows were impacted due to the previously announced $2 billion deal-related redemption of the New Mexico 529 plan.","As we get to the second half of 2020, we expect the U.S. retail net flows to be on an upward trend, and this should be driven by improved gross sales levels and moderating redemption rates on many of our portfolios that have recently seen a significant step up in investment performance.","So next, let's get to expense management and the P&L. So, on Slide 9, we set out our revenues and expenses. You'll see revenues included $52.2 million in performance fees in the period compared to $18.7 million in Q3, and that was largely from our real estate business.","Of particular note, expenses are up $36 million a quarter that was driven by several factors, among which the most significant was the movement in foreign exchange rates and global markets in the quarter. Despite these factors, we maintain our focus on expense management and achieving our expense synergy targets discussed last quarter.","So, on Slide 10, we provide additional information about our expenses to highlight the foreign exchange and market impacts and the other factors that drove Q4 expenses above Q3 levels. I'd like to walk you through briefly these variances that are shown in each of the columns on Slide 10 before turning to the impact of these items on our 2020 expense run rate.","So, first, foreign exchange and market. The FX and market both increased expenses in the quarter by $21 million. We saw a strengthening of the pound and the euro against the U.S. dollar during the quarter. Pound was up 7%, euro is up 3%, we also saw other currencies like the renminbi up 3% in the quarter.","Additionally, markets increased significantly where we had the S&P 500 up 8.5%, MSCI Emerging Markets Index up 11.4%, Russell 2000 up 9.5%, MSCI All Country Index up 8.5%, all that impacted our variable expenses.","The next column is our integration impacts and you'll see that we realized $3 million in integration savings in the quarter. And there were $9 million more in savings related to compensation that was largely the result of the decline in our bonus pool related to the transaction and integration departures in connection with the confirmed exits of employees in Q4.","These savings, however, were offset somewhat in the period by about $6 million in property, office and technology costs. That's related to the step-up in outsource admin costs, some of which will go away when we get to a single operating platform by the end of 2020.","The third column to talk about is seasonal expenses. We had about $9 million of our operating expenses in Q4 were due to elevated seasonal expenses primarily related to marketing spend. And then, the fourth item is non-recurring items.","So, we saw about $9 million in expenses following that quarter or occurred in the quarter that were non-recurring, and that's largely in the G&A area with the small amounts in property, office and technology. These expenses included regulatory, legal settlement, security-related expenses as well as product launch costs.","So, let me next move to the 2020 expense run rate. So, if you'll recall, we indicated in the Q3 - in the third quarter that our operating expense levels of $726 million would be a good expense run rate for 2020, but that was assuming FX and market levels consistent with those at the end of the third quarter.","So, if FX and market levels remain consistent with the 12\/31\/19 levels or end-of-year levels of the revised 2020 quarterly expense run rate will be $755 million per quarter. And that's comprised of starting with the baseline of $726 million as discussed from the third quarter, adding in the fourth quarter FX and market impacts of $21 million or add in an incremental full quarter run rate expense impact of $9 million resulting from the FX and market levels at the end of year-end 2019.","Then you add in the savings related to integration of $3 million, and then one quarter of the impact of the seasonally high expenses that occurred in Q4 since that will probably happen again since our seasonal. So, the resulting $755 million represents an average quarterly run rate for the operating expenses for 2020, and realistically, I mean, there will be some quarterly variation around this average.","A good example of the quarterly variation is the Q1 increase that we often see, or we always see, in compensation expense to the seasonal payroll taxes, which we'd expect to be about $15 million to $20 million for the combined organization in Q1 of this year.","So, the full year 2020 guidance for operating expenses based on year-end 2019 market and FX levels is $3.02 billion. And we're confident with our ability - confident in our ability to maintain this level of expense based on year-end 2019 market and FX levels, which means that we're achieving our targeted cost synergies of more than $500 million. And we will continue to update you with respect to our ability to generate more and greater cost savings as we move through 2020.","So next, let me move to Slide 11 and talk about the increase in operating income quarter-over-quarter that was offset by some large movements below the line. In fact, non-operating net expenses impacted our EPS for about $0.07 quarter-over-quarter driven in large part by two big non-cash items.","So, the first was - that we recognized $15 million in negative valuation adjustments on our co-investments related to our CLO holdings. These marks are booked on a one-month lag. And so, the pickup that we actually saw on the bank loan market in the month of December was not reflected in these results. But importantly, this is a non-cash item. This is really just mark-to-market activity.","And then additionally, we saw positive market gains on our seed portfolio as you might expect with the strength of the markets in the quarter. But that was offset in other gains and losses by the FX impact of the settlement of an economically hedged cash transaction we had in place related to our intercompany dividend.","Basically this item is really just the FX impact on an intercompany loan. This represents about a $27-million swing quarter-over-quarter. And then once again, this is a non-cash item.","So, let me move to capital management, and you'll see on that slide, Slide 12, I think, that we did have - did not have a significant buyback activity in the quarter. I'd also like to note that we paid down our credit facility balance to zero.","And then, after completing about $975 million in stock buyback since the announcement of the Oppenheimer deal in October 2018, you'll see that we've transitioned to a more balanced approach towards capital management with a greater focus on our strengthening our balance sheet.","So let me just in summary say we remain diligent in our approach to expense and capital management. We continue to pursue greater cost synergies related to the Oppenheimer transaction. We are focused very much so on increasing U.S. sales in the U.S., and we believe that our sales teams are now positioned for 2020 with the tools that they need to succeed.","And with that, operator, I think I'll now ask you to open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. You may ask your question. Your line is open.","Robert Lee","Maybe despite the start out with the - in talking about the trajectory of new sales in the U.S. I mean, obviously you've talked about the integration of the sales force and product performance. But maybe - I'm just kind of curious how long do you think the lag is between - you've had the combine forces now for, I guess, going on about six months and what's kind of the lag between when you get it together and you get out in the field and they start talking to advisors that you think you can really start to see get back to where you - the combined firms you are pre-deal.","And then maybe you also have a little more granularity if there's in the U.S. kind of the handful of products that you think could really kind of drive that demand, where you think you could really kind of leverage sales?","Marty Flanagan","All right. Andrew?","Andrew Schlossberg","Maybe it's rather important to kind of take a step back for a minute. While we did put the two companies together six months ago, it was one of the largest asset management transactions in history, as you know. And we started putting the teams together then, and we're just kind of getting them on the field now.","One of the really important strategic decisions that we took when we integrated the companies was to rapidly change the distribution force to meet where a client needs are moving to. So we took a very holistic look at all of our resources and took a real sense of urgency to try to make change and to fully integrate them systems and people.","So that was something we wanted to do swiftly and right at close. So, the last six months, we've made a lot of - we've had a lot of progress since then, and we positioned ourselves to start to hit the ground running here in 2020, start to see the progress throughout the year.","And as Loren said, I think get into the back half of 2020 in a real way. Maybe to get a little more specific about your question though, I think there's three key reasons why we're confident in the progress we've made. I think, firstly, we've established what we believe is the leading distribution force in the U.S. wealth management intermediary industry. As I said, the second reason is that we've built out a single fully integrated team and product line by end of 2019, and that's pretty important that we were able to do that.","And then, lastly, I think we created a truly relevant platform for top U.S. wealth managers that we serve. And as you know, they're consolidating those relationships pretty rapidly at the asset management level. Let me just put a little color around each of those, and then I'll pause and get to your second question.","In terms of establishing a leading distribution force, at close, we selected the team and we were about 50\/50 from Oppenheimer and from Invesco. So, we've got the top talent. We also achieved the synergy targets that you're familiar with, but we also repositioned the firm toward growth trend.","So, we positioned towards high net worth or IVs well centers, digital data, things like that, while focusing on core key clients and segments like regional broker dealers, home office platforms. So, we think we've got that leading team in place now, resources repositioned towards the things I mentioned. I think we feel like we've built out an integrated team and product line by 2019.","We announced the mergers of our products, ETFs and mutual funds in December. That was a big milestone. I gave clarity to analysts that cover our products on where we're going, and I think that was important thing to do. We've also got territories and training in place. We did a lot of that during the back half of last year to get running for 2020.","And then, lastly, in terms of having a relevant set at the top of U.S. wealth managers, we have a significant seat at the table. I mean, now we have over $600 billion with client AUM. With U.S. wealth managers, we have client AUM, with U.S. wealth managers, we have half dozen clients greater than $25 billion in AUM and a top 10 position and the largest active fund categories and the largest sort of alternative beta ETF player out there. So, we've got everything served up we think for success into 2020.","Robert Lee","Maybe just a quick but I mean maybe this is a little old fashioned way to look at it. But I guess I've always historically thought that any distribution forces, I know, some number half dozen, 10 strategies products that you kind of focus on and really drive. So, just kind of trying to get a sense of what you think those are this coming year?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. No. Thanks. Probably three things I'd mentioned, I think the first and biggest driver of our net flows success in the U.S. is going to be in the fixed income space and that's both active and passive. So, as Marty mentioned and you can see in the deck, our fixed income performance is quite strong across the board. Those products are capable and ready and in particular in the muni space, core plus multi-sector again across active and ETFs, that's a big area of focus for us and where we think we'll see success.","I'd say, the second is ETFs in general and factors. We had strong momentum in 2019 and we did around $16 billion positive net flows globally in ETFs. In both income and volatility mitigation strategies, that we believe is going to continue to be important to us by the second area.","And then, lastly, I'd say on the redemption side just slowing the redemptions on the active equity strategies, improving performance is common international equity, certain U.S. equity strategies and we think coupled with that product integration clarity that I mentioned, and the sales team focus on those redemptions that should be a point of improvement in 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. You may ask your question. Your line is open.","Patrick Davitt","I think there's been a little confusion on the comment you made in December on inflows and kind of what you said today. So, is the view that you could be in inflow by the end of 2020 or the full year could actually be an inflow year? And more specifically, I think you mentioned earlier a strong pipeline and solutions wins. Could you maybe help frame that a little bit more specifically? And within that, how should we think about the $11 billion solutions when coming through over the next few months?","Marty Flanagan","Great question. So, we're not talking about the end of the year. We look at it as 2020. We see the line of sight for inflows for the year with everything that we've just been talking about today. So it's not - you'll start to see it pretty quickly here.","Loren Starr","Yes. And I think, in terms of the institutional pipeline, we've seen continued growth in the pipeline. Quarter-over-quarter, it grew about 4% to 5% both in AUM and revenue basis. A lot of that is being driven by real estate and other traditional areas, but we're now competing in RFP businesses or opportunities around solutions that we haven't in the past. And so, as a result, we're actually seeing larger scale win opportunities than we've ever - never - haven't seen those in the past.","The one that you referenced, the $11 billion, is going to happen probably in the second quarter of this year. I think it was just as we said in the first half, it's probably more likely to happen in the second quarter.","We're seeing similar opportunities like this of similar magnitude, plus or minus, that we expect to also be generated as an inflow in this year. So, more to come on the solutions, but we really, I think, are seeing significant success now bringing our solutions capability to clients in a way that we hadn't in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Kenneth Lee","Just a follow-up on - wondering whether you have any update thoughts on potential incremental expense synergies? Just want to gauge any relative confidence you have potentially on achieving incremental synergies. And also as well, when you originally broke out the categories for the synergies, there are some longer tailed categories such as property and office as well as G&A. Just wondering whether those are the particular areas where you could see some potential incremental synergies? Thanks.","Marty Flanagan","Yes. So, Ken, thanks very much for asking. Yes, absolutely, because when we first talked about this transaction, as you remember, we said that there was a long tail to the integration that would take us through the full year 2020. And they were related largely to some of these technology and back-office elements.","And I even referenced, obviously, there was $6 million that stepped up in this quarter really to outsource admin cost, and some of that will go away as we get through the end of this year - full expectation. So, order of magnitude is - there's something there. Probably if you look at the numbers, it was in the order of magnitude of, sort of, $10 million to $14 million that could be possibly generated. We still feel very confident that those numbers will get delivered.","I think, as we said in the past, we still are evaluating how much of that might drop to the bottom line, guess - versus getting reinvested in some of the high growth areas that we've talked about like China or digital. But we are absolutely, through the course of 2020, going to give you full line of sight as to what we think can drop versus what we feel we absolutely need to use for reinvestment.","Kenneth Lee","And just one follow-up question, if I may. Just on that slide showing the U.S. retail active net revenue yield ex-performance fees, it looks as it's been pretty stable recently. Wondering if you could just give us some color on any relative impacts from either mix shift or changes to gross fee rates? Thanks.","Loren Starr","Yes. Again, so the one thing I would say that obviously this is just ex-ETFs. This is really just the core mutual fund products, additional products. There isn't a huge amount of shift that happens between the mutual funds. The biggest shifting that we've seen really has been the mix between mutual funds versus ETFs. This we don't think is going to change, I mean, even with the sale of more fixed income. I don't think it's going to have a massive or sort of material impact on these types of fee rates.","But probably, as we do sell and continue to look at ETFs, that will have a bigger impact overall. And so, I do think there's still some amount of expected fee decline for the firm as a whole as we continue to sell ETFs at a higher rate.","Marty Flanagan","Yes. But I think an important point that often gets lost is, don't correlate levels of fee rates to profitability. The ETF business is very, very profitable for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Your line is open.","Ken Worthington","Can you talk a little bit about the balance sheet? Loren, I think you mentioned the pay down of the credit facility and you talked about reprioritizing the balance sheet with regard to capital management. What does that mean? How aggressive do you want to be here on the balance sheet? Are there any targets or goals that you can share with us in terms of deleveraging or debt pay down or a couple of ratios, that would be great?","Loren Starr","Yes. So, I think you should expect us to live up to our commitment of the buybacks, which we've talked about, $1.2 billion. We've got about $950 million completed through when we first announced. So there's some $200 million left that we're looking to complete in this year 2020.","Again, we can do more or less depending on how markets react. But in terms of kind of what you should expect from us, it's probably a much more sort of steady normalized buyback pattern along the lines I'm just mentioning versus the very accelerated front-end loaded buyback that we were doing when the deal was announced.","What we want to do is be able to build up some cash. As we've said, we want $1 billion in excess of regulatory capital levels. Generally we're not quite there yet. So there's still opportunity for us to build some more cash. And we do want to have some flexibility. Come 2022 when some debt is coming due, there's $600 million to potentially allow that to be paid down or we might roll it. But having that financial flexibility by continuing to build little cash is we think prudent.","Ken Worthington","And then, just following up on some earlier questions on the Oppenheimer deal. I think the original target was organic growth of, say, 1% to 2% for Oppenheimer for 2020. Is that still a realistic target? And if it is, can you kind of walk us through either by distribution channel or maybe a couple of the big products like, how do you get from sort of the bigger outflows that we've seen more recently to that flip to 1% to 2% organic growth?","Marty Flanagan","Yes. Let me make a couple of comments and then maybe Andrew can pitch in. So, it's really - we still think it's - that is very typical issue will be timing, right? So, what you can't foresee when you begin these things are relative performance. Loren hit on two important areas, the headwinds around bank loans that came over and one of the international funds. The performance in international is improving. I think it was - Andrew was talking about when you first to look for slower redemptions.","But when you look through the totality of what's on that platform, we feel very confident about the opportunities. And we're also seeing opportunities outside of the United States already institutionally and also retail in EMEA. So, again, what we saw at the beginning is something that we still feel very confident, and it's going to be an issue of timing.","Andrew Schlossberg","I mean, maybe the only two things I'd add is, we saw - I think through some of the disruption that we mentioned earlier and combining the distribution forces, you can look back at Page 8, we're still operating pretty well below our gross sales that we had as two individual companies.","And just getting back to that level, which we think will happen sooner than later, then lets us sort of go into that acceleration mode. I think you'll see it - we're going to see it on the gross sale side I think to make that pickup happen.","The other thing I would mention is, we've been focused a lot on the active U.S. retail position on page 8, but the ETFs are going to be a really important accelerator. And with this stronger distribution force together, we have a lot more energy and resource against growing that business rapidly as well.","Loren Starr","And obviously some of this has to do with the performance of the products. And we've seen some improvement. Obviously we continue to see an improving trend on some of the core products like international growth as a good example. That's going to really help us achieve those levels. But probably realistically within 2020 getting to 1% or 2% is probably not realistic at this point, and I think we have a path to it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Shaun Calnan","This is actually Shaun Calnan on for Mike. Just going back to the product offerings, in 2019, we saw significant pickup in industry ESG flows and it looks like more of a - there's going to be more focus on this from competitors and investors. So I'm just wondering what your current offering is there and what your plans are going forward? Thanks.","Andrew Schlossberg","Yes. Hey. It's Andrew Schlossberg. I'll jump in the first instance. We've been, like many others in the asset management space, investing in the ESG space for some time. So, our first focus really is making sure that sustainability and other ESG factors are incorporated into our active strategies as a factor that they look at. Most of the demand we see from clients, including in places like Europe, is for inclusion portfolios not exclusion. So, our first protocol is to make sure that we're contemplating that.","Where we anticipate seeing some increased demand though is in ESG portfolios and things that - that's the core focus of it. We've incubated and put strategies in place across our entire platform. One area of note, and then maybe Marty can pick up more fully, but in the ETF space in the U.S., we've been sort of running sustainability focused ETF since 2005. And they are in place.","We have, I think, six or seven of them, and we're starting to see more demand. We expect to see more demand into next year. And likewise in Europe, we listed a set of strategies last year to address the same set of challenges and opportunities.","Marty Flanagan","If you look at where the impact is, where it's been real, it has been on the continent. If you're not absolutely engaged and focused on ESG inclusion, you have a real business problem regardless of what you think about it. And you can tell in the United States where from my perspective has been more of a conversation - pick up. So, it is definitely a real opportunity and really frankly something that is going to be actually pervasive, I'd say, throughout the whole industry globally, which is a good thing.","Loren Starr","Yes. I would just say, I mean, in Europe in particular, I mean, we just launched some new ETFs that were ESG focused in Q4. I know we have a bank loan capability that's all ESG focused that is also being told and doing well. And the big solution when we had in the U.S. that we've talked about was actually focused around ESG offering. So, we have the capabilities to deliver on ESG and we're actively pursuing those.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell","Can we just go back to the organic growth trajectory and let's put the positive in sort of the timing of that. So, you mentioned, Marty, the institutional pipeline, what's strengthening. Of course, we've got the - I think it's announced as $11 billion mandate that's funding in the second quarter, if you could just sort of go into the different components of that.","Obviously, you mentioned Brexit is a little bit more - the situation there is a little bit more favorable. And if you combine the nuance - maybe you can talk about actually the new products that you plan to launch on the Oppenheimer strategies during the year in terms of the institutional products and then the launching of maybe euro down the sales front. How that plays into that trajectory of positive organic growth. It certainly looks like the second quarter, you can achieve that with the funding of the mandate. Do you think you can possibly achieve that in the first quarter given the trends you're seeing so far?","Marty Flanagan","The answer is yes. So let me try to hit the highlights. So, you're seeing continued rapid growth in China, we expect that to continue. The ETF business, what Andrew talked about, globally we continue to see that positive flows and increasing. There's more to do in Brexit, but round one has actually been very important. You can already start to see more positive activity on the continent.","You did see some improvement in our UK business just in the fourth quarter. So, those are two areas where they were very strong contributors to our business a couple of years ago, but as Brexit became very real, I mean, we just saw an incredible drop off in any real activity as people went to the sidelines. So, those are all very positive, along with the institutional business that you talked about. So, again, this is - you're going to start to see, very quickly here, all these things starting to show up in the numbers. And it's quite broad, it's not one area.","Loren Starr","And I mean, what we're just seeing is - I mean, solutions is, by far, in a way, the fastest growing part of our institutional pipeline. The other parts continue to grow, direct real estate and bank loans are - they are fixed income as well would be the areas that we see growth and interest.","Marty Flanagan","And you talked about the Oppenheimer. So, right now, I think it was Q4 introduced four different Oppenheimer capabilities into the use of products on the continent and they were often roadshows in Q4. So, again, that's the beginning of that and also where we've seen interest is, in the global equities, emerging markets equities, emerging markets debt, all outside of the United States institutionally. So, again, they're longer tailed engagements institutionally but they're well known, well recognized and there is real demand for the asset classes.","Brian Bedell","And then maybe just to put two expenses real quick. I missed the comment about the incremental cost sales in 2020 on that $3.02 billion. Maybe if you can just re-highlight the principle, the $3.02 billion, does that include additional market returns in 2020? And then, I know you're still wrestling with when you get cost, incremental cost from the deal you may reinvest them. So and maybe just a little bit more color on, if that 3.02 billion could be improved by additional cost saves from Oppenheimer.","Loren Starr","Yes so, on the first question you had. It does not include any incremental market returns that have already happened in 2020. So there may be some lift depending on where, what and how the quarter comes through. It's really based on year-end levels December 31 levels. In terms of incremental cost saves again, there is probably 10 to 14 that we easily see in terms of opportunity to deliver more synergies.","And so that is something that we will as I mentioned sort of, be able to talk through as we get through 2020 as to how much of that could drop in the bottom line versus not. But the 3020 does not include any incremental saves at this point, it is really consistent with the 501 that we originally talk about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Your line is open.","Chris Harris","Just to follow-up on the 2020 expense guide how would equity markets up say 8% or so effect affect the outlook?","Loren Starr","So again, I mean - you can kind of look at what happened in this current quarter to get a gauge where we did have equity markets sort of similar levels. So again - there maybe some parallel there now about the market and FX, about half of that was market and half was FX. So of the 21 that we are showing so you can get a sense as sort of roughly $10 million that could be due to an 8% lift.","Chris Harris","And then just wanted to talk to you guys a little bit about Brexit so on the one hand actually signing a deal would remove a layer of uncertainty, but I guess there is additional uncertainties regarding how the new Brexit situation might affect the local economy. So, like what are you guys seeing and hearing from your investors I mean are you actually seeing and focusing, hey look once this deal is inks that might remove so much uncertainty that we can get involved in equities again or I guess I was kind of hoping to get some thoughts about what's driving the confidence there?","Marty Flanagan","Yes it's a very good question. And people are quick to point out there is the second part of Brexit is a trade deal - and how that's all going to turn out. You could absolutely sense incredible sigh of relief on the continent and in the U.K. with but just round one of Brexit being agreed. You can start to see that in the activity on the continent, in particular in fund flows it's trailing in the U.K., but again it's just total sense of relief that there is a pathway forward. Yes how high would that enthusiasm be is unclear but everybody that you talk about, talk to, there are record levels of cash on the sidelines in the U.K. and on the continent.","And you're not making very much money at all needless to say with the rate environment and negative rates in particular. So that's why you're starting to see some sort of activity emerge. Yes, I can't predict how disruptive this next round of trade talks will be, but everything that we're seeing is round one is actually a very, very important positive step.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. You may ask your question. Your line is open.","Dan Fannon","So a follow-up on expenses. And I understand you're talking about synergies and incremental savings. But if I were just to look at core Invesco and we are sitting here today, after the kind of the results and the flows you're seeing. I think we would be talking about cost cutting, or other ways to curtail investments. So could you talk about, obviously do you have the integration and what you've outlined and you've achieved that but at the end of the day the business are doing worse than you expected.","So what are you doing I guess when we think about incrementally to adjust for an environment that we are now. And I think you've talked about any additional savings or expenses being have to being reinvested in the business. So can you help us think about the market backdrop, maybe that's not as favorable what you can do or other things beyond just the integration that are keeping expenses under control?","Loren Starr","Yes, great question, Dan. So I mean we have been very focused on this deal and the synergies coming out of steel but I want to say it\u2019s not where our focus stops. So there is a greater larger focus about what happens sort of day two kind of ideas around how can we make the entire firm more effective, more efficient and there is work being done completely separate from the Oppenheimer transaction about looking at.","How can we simplify some of our technology and systems, particularly sort of some of the systems that may not be directly back office or middle office, but others that sort of get more into investment support and other things that could simplify the way we manage our various capabilities. And that's just as an example of something that is interesting to us, because obviously, we do have a fair amount of technical debt associated with supporting multiple teams.","There may be opportunities for us to sort of streamline some of that infrastructure. So that's a good example of an area that could be quite large. Other things that have been clearly talked about beyond Invesco, but we are actively pursuing is how can we move more to the cloud. Having things that are on-premise is very expenses due to a lot of maintenance and support required for that kind of physical maintenance.","And so if we can move more to the cloud, there really is a significant opportunity to sort of eliminate a lot of cost data centers and other things that are just not necessary anymore. So, those are things that we're working on through 2020. Probably as we get through its more of a 2021 opportunity for us, but we absolutely will want to talk further through 2020 about some of these ideas as well, not just the Oppenheimer ones.","Dan Fannon","And then can you expand upon the MassMutual relationship and what has happened or what you are planning in terms of 2020 from a contribution through that channel of those advisors and what kind of the potential could be there?","Marty Flanagan","Yes, I'll make a couple comments and Andrew can chime in. So obviously in the first quarter call is the 8,500 advisors and literally it\u2019s onboard and capabilities that couldn't make available historically looking at areas of alternatives that could be made available to that sales force. Also and some conversations going on looking at their general account around the portfolio\u2019s capabilities that we have that they will take on as mandate.","So again it's a very strong relationship, and we're expecting it to be beyond the important shareholding that we have, but also doing business together.","Andrew Schlossberg","Yes, the only thing I'd add is on the Advised insurance side, one of the bigger opportunities we mutually see is with model portfolios and solutions into that channel. Open architecture but also highly inclusive of our active and passive strategies. And so that's - what we see, it's a maybe one of the larger opportunities in the advice channel.","Dan Fannon","And is that in 2020 or is that beyond?","Andrew Schlossberg","Through 2020 and beyond yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. You may ask your question. Your line is open.","Adam Beatty","This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan, just wanted to focus in on China a little bit more on your business there it sounds like things are going well. I appreciate the breakdown on the flows just wanted to get a sense in terms of the financial contribution the magnitude and timing that you might be expecting. Also any regulatory updates and when you might increase the stake in the JV and finally, any thoughts on the competitive environment there? Thank you.","Loren Starr","Yes, so in terms of the financial again I'd point you to our press release, we do provide detail in the footnotes that allow you full transparency in terms of the revenues and the expenses in our joint venture. What you've seen is that the margin sort of range somewhere between 40% to 55% I mean if it was down a little bit quarter-to-quarter I think, it dipped down a little bit this quarter. But generally they are well in excess of the firm's margins and it is a business that has the same kind of very positive incremental margins.","You would expect for something that has generally higher fees and there is a lot of infrastructure necessarily required to support the growth. So financial I think it is a one that is going to help accrete our margin as we continue to see that business grow. I forgot the other part of your question.","Marty Flanagan","Yes I will pick up, so the shareholding. So we continue to be - there is - meeting of the minds that will increase the shareholding - we\u2019ve not come to final terms. But I think a very important point is it's less relevant for us than others because the point is we have management control and we have had management control of the joint venture. And so, we operate in China, as really a combined firm because of that and that's what's unique about it. If you look at the competitive nature of it, there is estimates that half the flows in the industry over the next 10 years can come from China.","We been managing to Chinese securities since 1992, in the joint venture was 2004, very strong expertise management of clients in China $50 billion of Chinese whether it be large institutions or the retail business and we continue to see growth. So it is people look at as an opportunity, the fundamental fact very competitive, and to me my sense is that the start-up time to become successful is quite long tailed. So having the depth of capabilities and tenure and experiences. What we look at is a very important competitive advantage for us.","Loren Starr","Yes, I think I'd also say just the investment performance of the products that they're managing is spectacularly strong, and so they really do have wonderful position in the market right now, and which has allowed them to be able to launch products, probably more rapidly than others, just because of there has seen as being experts in this area when regulators are looking at kind of who is equipped to do these product launches.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Alex Blostein","Wanted to pivot the discussion on organic growth from AUM to fees for a second, I guess, first maybe you could talk a little bit about the fee rates on the $11 billion. When do you expect to fund in the second quarter and then Marty just given your comments around line of sight on positive flows for the year, what are the fee rates you guys expect to get on that pipeline and I guess just taking a step back, if you could talk about organic fee growth for 2020 is both organic AUM growth that would be helpful.","Loren Starr","Yes. So I think we're said it for solutions - at the solutions kind of typical fees I think single digits. So it is not higher fee, it tends to be at a lower fee, which is generally what we've seen. I mean a lot of the capabilities are going to be in the ETF space as well. So we're going to sit somewhat consistent with the overall FX strategy. So in terms of overall feed progression.","I think we said we're not into forecasting kind of fee rates just because it is so hard with mix and hard to figure out different things around foreign exchange market that he was at around, but clearly with ETF growth you'll continue to see some focus on fee rates coming down as ETFs become a more prominent part of our overall mix, but as Marty mentioned is not margin sort of dilutive.","This is very high incremental margins for that growth. So we absolutely have no issue with sort of our fees coming down due to ETFs growing the bigger topic has been outflows in the higher feed product and so that's the wildcard in terms of predicting this and we've talked a little bit about how quickly can we, so the stem, what we've seen around some of those higher fee redemptions were hopeful that we can get there through some of the things we've talked about, ","but that's the bigger part to forecast and is the hardest wanted to say how quickly that's going to happen.","Alex Blostein","And then the second question I had for you guys was just around the non-US growth dynamic particularly U.K. and Europe. So clearly, lots of money on the sidelines. You mentioned that, and we have as you see some of that as well. As you think about prospect of some of that money coming back into the investment products. Can you share some of the perspective of whether or not you think it's going to be more of a money flowing back into the active products or the passive products. So just some flavor what you actually hearing from the distribution channels in the UK and on the content that would be helpful.","Marty Flanagan","Yes, I'll make your comment Loren can pick up. So what you saw last year. You know our ETF flows were sort of record flows right. So the second largest inflows in Europe into our ETFs that's going to continue. Look it's early days post the Brexit, but the focus on active is actually picking up and we're seeing that early trend. And again, I mean, we're not even - we're almost done with January. So I don't want to extrapolate too much, but there has been a change already.","Loren Starr","Yes, I mean, I would just say I think probably it's going to be a mix, but probably there is going to be a heavy component of ETFs flowing into Europe. Really, we've seen that and we don't expect that to change what we do think is probably helpful that some of the active is going to start coming back.","We have some great products that are performing really well. European balance high income European corporate bonds are examples of the products that are doing really well from a performance perspective. So our European lineup on active is actually pretty strong. And so any sort of improvement on the risk off we're getting more risk on is going to be helpful for some of those cross border flows coming back to us.","Marty Flanagan","I think I might just add two quick things, one is that initially cash balances being high the equity demand has been so depressed the last few years that just a pickup back into equity strategies off a low base is both active and passive we expect. And then the other thing I'd mentioned, which is relevant in EMEA, but also globally that we didn't talk about was we're seeing more demand come into alternative strategies throughout the world. Institutionally, I mean emerging retail. So I probably look for flows to return there as well as people come off the sidelines.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question and please standby. Your line is open.","Craig Siegenthaler","First, I just wanted to come back to be positive net flow commentary earlier in Q&A, were you specifically called out the Oppenheimer international fund, just given the trailing performance that fund. I wanted to hear why you thought flows would be improving over the next several quarters.","Loren Starr","Yes. So the one-year performance has significantly improved on that particular product. And ","screaming a little bit to see if I can find it right now, so I can actually tell you, but I think we've seen a real pick-up in is it\u2026","Marty Flanagan","It is 32nd","Loren Starr","32nd percentile on a one-year.","Marty Flanagan","One year.","Loren Starr","So it's definitely improved from where it was. So it's not so much that it's going to turn it around dramatically, but it will allow us to protect it and sort of maybe stem redemptions little. So that's going to be a big help to the flow story overall.","A \u2013 Marty Flanagan","It's a well-established team with high conviction and again money comes back also into the international equity space with some of the headwinds changing are continues to come in with the performance improvement we feel better about the redemption rate.","Loren Starr","Yes, I mean just anecdotally, I know it's a short period, but I think on a three-month basis it's it percentile. So it's really come up well and so near term it's definitely performing well.","Craig Siegenthaler","And then just my follow up on Jemstep. Can you provide us an update on this business and also do you know what the current AUM contribution is from Jemstep, which I assume would mostly be inside of PowerShares.","A \u2013 Marty Flanagan","Yes, so the total digital platform right now, there is $900 billion in assets under administration. So it is due to certain to come online. Pretty quickly you will see some advancements of clients into Jemstep here and then next little while the business on the continent continues to be very, very strong. This fourth quarter, we talked about the model portfolio launch, clients are starting to come online in that we suspect up probably mid-year before you start to see meaningful flows into that, but again we feel really good about the strategy and you'll start to see some good things happening here, but we'll talk holistically about.","Loren Starr","Yes, I think, I don't have much more to add other than. Yes. So it's a huge opportunity, I think is less than 2% of Invesco AUM and the share of you just mentioned. So it's not material at this point, but the opportunity that is before us in terms of being able to actually penetrate the AUAs is very real one. So I think it's a story for 2020 that we hope we're going to be able to tell more fully","A \u2013 Marty Flanagan","And to put in a context. So with the active model portfolios that were introduced in the U.K. about 18% to 20% of that content is Invesco products and so you put in the context of open architecture and the other distribution platform if you at 18% to 20% of the mark share that would be is basically 4 to 5 times higher than having a successful position and a traditional platform.","Operator","Our final question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. You may ask your question","Robert Lee","Actually my follow-ups were asked and answered. Thank you.","Marty Flanagan","Great good. Well, thank you everybody and have a good rest of the day and will be shared with you soon.","Loren Starr","Thanks everybody.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco and Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you and thank you everybody for joining us and I appreciate you changing your schedule so quickly. Some very, very good news, we're going to talk about the transaction between ourselves Oppenheimer and MassMutual and also go over the third quarter results and if you're so inclined the presentations on our website if you want to follow along. [indiscernible] has been quite a bit of news in the market about this combination for a period of time, but before we get into the third quarter results, I really want to clarify some very important key points.","The combination will result in Invesco being the thirteenth largest global asset manager in the world and the sixth largest manager in the US retail channel, both are very important when you think of the importance of scale and client relevance as we look forward. The financial returns are extraordinarily compelling. For the partial year 2019, we're expecting 18% accretion, in the full year 2020 27% accretion and post synergies we anticipate an additional billion dollars of cash flow for the combined company, so really quite extraordinary.","We're also very excited that MassMutual can be a long time strategic shareholder of 15.5% equity stake in the $4 billion of preferred, but Loren get into details in a few minutes, but what's really important, MassMutual is not selling or taking every dollar, all the proceeds to the backing of the combined institution, showing their commitment and the excitement for the opportunity in front of us. And the other point I want to make, we're going to initiate today a $1.2 billion stock buyback which is also an important part of the discussion that we'll be having today.","So with that Loren, you can talk through the financials, yeah.","Loren Starr","Yeah, thank you very much Marty. So on Slide 7 you'll see a summary of the results for the third quarter and continued to demonstrate strong long-term investment performance with 63% and 67% actively managed assets in the top half of peers over the three and five years.","Our year-to-date gross sales are up 16.7% versus prior year, market dynamics and some near-term performance challenges continue to impact redemption leading to total long-term net outflows of 11.2 billion for the quarter.","Adjusted net operating income was 358 million for the quarter, that was down from 377 million in the prior quarter and that was driven by a lower revenue yield resulting from a change in AUM mix, the negative impact of foreign exchange and the impact of lower transaction fees within other revenues.","Additionally, on expense side, we saw some elevated marketing and technology expenses this quarter. These items are also impacted our adjusted operating margin, which decreased to 37% from 38.7% in the prior quarter.","We returned 124 million to shareholders during the quarter two dividends and we've made good progress in paying down the balance on our credit revolver in early October and we expect to have our leverage ratios buffer in line with our previous Guggenheim acquisition levels by the end of the fourth quarter.","Moving on to slide eight, we highlight more in terms of investment performance for the quarter over the one, three and five years. As we've noted in past conversations, our investment processes and approach are focused on generating our performance over a full market cycle, so we typically see fluctuations between quarters.","The current market cycle is impacting the relative performance of a number of large value-based equity investment approaches representing more than 10% of included AUM, but some of their recent market volatility and more favourable market condition, however, the teams have seen near term improvement as you would expect. As an example, diversified dividend is now in the top debt file [ph] on a quarter-to-date basis, and also our UK equity portfolios and international growth portfolios are in the top quartile.","Let's turn to flows on slide 8. As I noted, while gross sales have been robust for the quarter up more than 17% on a year-to-date basis for 2017, we did see net negative flows during the third quarter as market dynamics weighed on redemptions and the net results.","With a pockets of strength within ETFs with nearly 1.5 billion of employees in US ETFs and that included nearly a 0.5 billion of flows into our bullet share franchise winning new flows in these products based closed to nearly 1 billion. Commodity ETFs in Europe and then commodity ETFs in U.S. were weaker in line with industry trends, which led to modestly negative path for the ETF flows for the quarter.","On the active side, the outflows were largest in the U.S., the U.K. retail equity products, which continue to face some of the challenges as noted earlier. Additionally, on the institutional side, we saw a two sovereign wealth fund up close with total nearly 2.5 billion.","We also saw varying outflows from an Asian client in our bank loan strategies and there was a $1 billion real estate outflow, which we had mentioned on the previous quarter call, all of which contributed to the negative flow this quarter.","So despite these one-time outflows in our institute outflows, I want to mention that our institutional pipeline is in fact an all-time high in terms of both AUM and revenues with AUM in the pipeline, which is one but not funded up more than 35% versus the prior quarter and up over 30% versus prior year, and that should help elevate our flows in future periods.","And also like to note, that while you see on this chart, we did see very strong flows and there are great wall JV, money market product with nearly 5 billion in inflows for this quarter and that's a trend that we would expect to continue in Q4.","With that, I'm going to turn it back to you Martin.","Martin Flanagan","Thanks, Loren. And why don't we now turn to the transaction. As again, we're very excited about it, it's 100% consistent with our strategy and really it's going to rapidly advance the strategy that we've been talking about with all of you. But if you turn to page 11, I think importantly, you really want to know the fact is Oppenheimer Funds because it's clear, it's not understood really that robustness of Oppenheimer and how it's consistent with the strategy that we've been talking to you about. The first thing we're really excited about, obviously, it's the strength to the organization, it's incredible talents with group of people who are looking forward to working with them going forward and helping create something really quite special.","The organization has $250 billion dollars in assets under management, 75% of the assets are hard to replicate differentiated active and alternative strategies. They have exceptional investment talent generating very good consistent long-term performance. 59% of assets are in four and five star rated funds and the business is financially robust. Net annual revenues of $1.4 billion, the net revenue yield is 56 basis points and operating margin of 40%, all of which is accretive to Invesco.","On page 12, I want to make very, very clear, our strategy is unchanged, we continue to focus on strengthening our leadership in our core markets while executing high growth areas and we believe you must do both of these to be successful going forward. And one is not going to be satisfactory for success as you look to future. If you do both of these very well, we feel very strongly that you generate lead set of capabilities for the benefit of both clients and shareholders.","What we truly believe is unique about Invesco is a combination of our leadership in core markets and our investments into these high growth areas. The combination with Oppenheimer, now, the relationship with MassMutual will meaningfully expand our leadership in the U.S. wealth management industry, while also strengthen our ability to execute in several of these high growth areas. This transaction rapidly advances our growth strategy and it's fully aligned with our clients' needs as we look to the future and that of the industry.","One final point that I would like to make on page 14, is that from a context point of view of the $87 trillion in assets under management in the industry, the U.S. wealth management segment is the largest segment in the world with 23% of global assets under management is going to continue to grow. I think what's also very important, I think it's all clear to all of us that it will grow and be important but to be concentrated in fewer investment managers hands in the years ahead. The notion of having client relative to scale is an absolute necessity.","So turning to the combination itself, creating a $1.2 trillion global asset manager, the vision of Oppenheimer Funds provides a number of benefits to the combined organization for our tenants, our business and shareholders represents a strong strategic and cultural fit for both of our organizations and the power really comes from a combination of four different areas, scale and client relevance, differentiated investment capabilities, compelling financial returns and the strategic relationship with MassMutual.","If you take a look at client scale and relevance, as I mentioned, will be the 13th largest global investment manager in the world providing the necessary skill to compete and invest on behalf of our clients and our shareholders, but importantly the immediate impact of the combination will create a clear leader in the US retail with Invesco becoming the sixth largest U.S. investment manager with $680 billion in client assets.","Another point of client relevance is looking at the relationships with the top 10 US wealth management organizations in United States. Our relationships will be meaningfully more important, as you can see with these key platforms at the close we will have five relationships with more than $30 billion in assets under management.","When we turn to the investment capabilities of sales and the impact on the combined organization is incredibly compelling. Invesco's and Oppenheimer's strengths are very complimentary to one another. It broadens our comprehensive range of investment capabilities, which will not only benefit the U.S. retail market, which is what we're looking at here.","But opportunities in the combined firm and the institutional market both in the United States and outside of the United States and again a number of these capabilities in the retail channels outside of the United States too. Importantly, 85% of the Oppenheimer Funds are in high demand Alpha persistent, your asset classes you can take a look at international equities, emerging markets, global equities, and also very important income-focused alternative areas, high yield muni's bank loans et cetera, so again, the combined rankings post transaction are incredibly compelling.","If you take a look at the investment profiles, the investment performance profiles of the two firms, they are also highly complementary as you would imagine, from my prior comments, they are generally counter cyclical, so this is great news for our clients, it will help them through different market cycles and it is also a business benefit at the same time.","So I truly believe and the organization believes this is incredibly powerful combination that will immediately benefit our clients, our shareholders and both of the organizations and we could be more excited about it.","I'm going to turn it over to Loren have him go into more depth of the financial results of the combination.","Loren Starr","Thanks, Marty. So, in addition to a very compelling strategic rationale for the combination that Marty just outlined. We expect the transaction to provide strong returns for our shareholders in line with our previously stated financial criteria for acquisitions.","For those following along I'm now on Slide 20. Excluding the impact of incremental intangible amortization and one-time integration charges, our pro-forma EPS accretion is approximately $0.38 or 18% in the year of closing and this is to - second quarter closed it in three quarters of accretion.","In 2020 with the full benefit of the cost synergies in place and a full year of financial accretion, we expect to achieve $0.80 or 27% EPS accretion. As a result of the combination and the inclusive - an inclusive of the expected run rate synergies of 475 million, we expect to add nearly a $1 billion in incremental EBITDA and by 2020 we project to have an operating margin well in excess of 45% and a combined annual EBITDA of more than $3 billion.","The purchase price will be satisfied with a combination of roughly 81.9 million common shares and 4 billion in non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares that has a 21 non-co-op period and a fixed rate coupon of 5.9%. Today, stock price based on where we are today that translates into a total consideration value of approximately 5.7 billion.","In addition, MassMutual will become a long-term shareholder and our largest shareholder at 15.5%, MassMutual intends to be a long-term strategic partner and a shareholder of Invesco in this regard they're entering into a two-year lock up on the common shares.","In addition, MassMutual has indicated that they do not intend to sell their common shares after the lock-up period expires, the transaction is a tax free reorganization for them and it's highly tax efficient for MassMutual. So any sale of shares in the future could trigger a sizable taxable event for them, again, incentive for them to continue to hold their shares on a long-term basis.","So reflecting the financial strength of the combined business, as well as the additional cash flow that will result from the combination, as Marty mentioned, we are announcing a $1.2 billion common share buyback program, which is to be completed within the next two years, importantly this will be funded through operating cash and as such we do not intend to take on any additional leverage to satisfy that.","Moving to the next page, as noted, we expect to add nearly 1 billion in incremental EBITDA after synergies in terms of the modelling for your purposes we included some assumption of breakage and we acquired AUM of about 4 percentage points in 2019 and a modest level of organic growth in future years.","Additionally, we've modelled modest fee reductions of approximately 45 million in future periods. We have a plan to capture by 2020 and approximately 475 million in cost synergies within the combined organization and that represents approximately 14% of our combined expense base.","We have a high degree of confidence that we can achieve our synergy target and it clearly is something we demonstrate in the past through prior acquisitions. The savings will come from the scale benefits and the platform synergies and this will be focused primarily in the middle and back office areas and activities such like such as streamlining operational technology platforms, leveraging preferred vendors and rate cards across the combined organization. And the transaction which has been approved by the Board of Directors of both companies is expected to close, as I mentioned in the second quarter of 2019.","And with that I'm going to turn it back to Marty.","Martin Flanagan","Thanks, Loren, and I do want to come back to the history of our success in making these combinations work on page 22. A number of you have followed us for years and the track record is a proven track record and I have a high degree of confidence in the team, it's highly experienced, I believe we have the industry leading track record of success in delivering the benefits of clients and shareholders as we've discussed and laid out here.","And if you just look at what's happened from PowerShares with $6 billion in assets under management originally in organic growth and to follow on acquisitions, $230 billion in assets under management today and the number two position in smart beta and four - number four position in ETFs overall really quite compelling. The Morgan Stanley, Van Kampen track record by all accounts was also an incredible success for the organization for our shareholders. So when we look at our history, we have delivered each and every time and I have tremendous confidence in our abilities to that.","With this combination between the two organizations, we will create an exceptional organization. We're going to have a better client experience by the time that we're done with this. It's going to generate excellent results for our shareholders. We're going to do this on and on with our new colleagues at Oppenheimer and I couldn't be more excited. And to put this all in context, we believe this transaction is incredibly compelling bringing scale and client relevance, differentiated investment capabilities, really compelling financial returns for our shareholders and important strategic partner MassMutual. It is going to be really a special organization and we look forward to doing it with our colleagues at Oppenheimer.","So with that why don't we open it up to Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Bill Katz and please state your company name.","William Katz","Okay, thank you very much, from Citi Group. So thank you very much for taking the question this morning. So I'd like just to come back to the savings opportunity for a moment, I think you the highlight 475 million and Loren just gave a little bit more detail when you post your comment here. Can we break that down a little bit more a couple of different ways, how much of its coming from standalone Invesco platform? How much of its coming from the legacy Oppenheimer foot print? And then can you break it down maybe by a line item between - in between - you mentioned mid obvious, but comp versus non-comp just to get a sense of the savings because here the question is, you're running at about 45% margin round numbers, they're running at 40%, both are pretty good, I'm just surprised by the amount of redundancy that you've identified.","Martin Flanagan","Thanks Bill. So, I appreciate the question, you should be surprised. So what has been presented right here something is going to conversation amongst the industry in the benefit of scale. And if you think of the Oppenheimer organization, incredible organization largely in the mutual fund industry, but their capabilities are beyond that. So that's another topic. There is the opportunity, as I said earlier for institutional channel non-US, but when really going with this is you're looking at the organization where we have a mutual fund operation too. The scale benefits from operation are astonishing, right, it's really the systems conversion that come out of it, just all the benefits you get from scale, that's really the model that we're looking at and if you compare that to different combinations that you've seen in the marketplace, it is two organizations and two different industries or two different segments or two different continents, you can't get scale benefits. This place right down in the middle of something that will be a huge benefit to the organization. So where we are right now, this we have a high degree of confidence in these numbers, it comes from all of our experience and what we know about the operating platforms, Oppenheimer was already heading down the path to make a number of changes themselves, you do have to look at it across the combined platforms. Our next step is to use our playbook and we'll team up area by area with each of our colleagues at Oppenheimer and work through the plan and execute it over the next number of months and again we just feel very confident in knowing the path forward. So the level of detail that you're asking for now, we're not in a position to share that we have to create the plans with Oppenheimer and but do know - we know how to do this.","William Katz","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Schorr and please state your company name.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks. Could we first talk about distribution, I get the scale and I get all the advantages you talked about at the scale and the rankings and each of the channels and wealth management's important. But is there much unique overlap on distribution where you were strong they weren't and vice versa. [indiscernible] bring specific distribution?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, so the best way to look at the complementary nature of it is on page 17, where we list the top 10 wealth managers and you'll note where we're stronger and we've been very stronger and again it's a combination that is creating much better set of outcomes, so that's at that level. So client relevance is kind of really come through with those wealth management platforms. But I think what I really want to point you to is that if you look at the investment capabilities between these two organizations they're very complementary. And if you look at really where you're going forward the impact is in high demand asset categories right, international equities emerging markets global et cetera and you can look for yourself. And although we're presenting it from a mutual fund point of view for the two organizations, these are capabilities that are in demand and different channels beyond the U.S. retail channel and again I think it's very important understand I often do want to make a point. There is no revenue synergies contemplated at all in what you're seeing today and so it's a very focused view on the existing business. Does that recon to the point?","Glenn Schorr","No it definitely does. I appreciate that. It brings up the other interesting point of - you noted 85% of assets are in those categories where passes a sub 10%, and you mentioned that international EM and global. Do you have high confidence that those aren't just next on the passive hit parade because I'm pretty sure you have passive strategies that are trying to get add at assets in those categories. So I just want to make sure that we're not buying into just the next piece of secular decline?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, so it all depends on your core belief. Our core belief is that passive in a particular factor, high-conviction active and alternative is here to stay. And if you - the notion that you're going to have a passive across the different asset categories is correct, you're going to be generating alpha from active capabilities, it's just not going to go away and that is not a common belief I would say right now, but if you look at the track records they're compelling.","Glenn Schorr","One last quickie on fund mergers, on Slide 18, as much as there's not lots of overlap on the high demand strategies there seem to be within each of those categories enough overlap. Have you worked through some of those decisions and within each of those asset classes?","Martin Flanagan","No. Look, we were all of two hours into the go forward and again we will work with our colleagues at Oppenheimer and over the next month, create a plan and again we'll share it with you, but we don't have that level of detail right now.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Thanks Marty.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Lee and please state your company name.","Robert Lee","Right, thank you. Robert Lee, KBW. Thanks guys for taking my question. Maybe we're going back to the phase of expense synergies, if I remember correctly when you did the Van Kampen deal you were able to pretty much get this - get synergies like day one after close and not that you're necessarily expecting this, but can you give us some sense of kind of how you expect that to kind of layer in. And then maybe as a follow-up with the breakage assumptions, I mean understanding mainly mutual funds or maybe little less breakage, it has institutional. But just given the importance of platforms and centralize research, can you kind of help us get to how you compliment that only $10 billion of breakage from Oppenheimer is kind of a good number or a conservative number?","Loren Starr","So what we have assumed in terms of the modeling and we have a view or sense of confidence around is that most of the synergies we think would be sort of taken in the first year close, I think we have somewhere between 75% to 85% assumption in terms of what could be achieved with the rest being fully achieved in 2020. I think again it's something that we feel like we have a good play book in terms to have execute this, so once again it should not be very hard and complicated for us to go forward. I think in terms of the breakage, the numbers that we are actually quite similar to what we had thought of the percentage Van Kampen, again it's based on what we've done in terms of our studies of how things work, we do think $10 billion is a reasonably good estimate obviously there's some swing around that number, it doesn't make a huge difference. It is a few percentage points maybe accretion here and there, so but we don't think it's going to be anything much dramatically offer those numbers.","Robert Lee","Great and if I can just one quick follow-up, just maybe going back you guys have obviously been talking a lot the last couple years about the investments you've making in the platform whether it's Jemstep and other things and certainly have been excited about that and thinking about 2019 as being the point in time where may we start to see some of the fruits of that start to come through. I mean are you all concerned that this - given the size of this transaction that it just becomes kind of a distraction over the next six, nine months or year as people kind of wonder about where they shake out in this and maybe that actually pushes the ability to realize some of those benefits out?","Martin Flanagan","Good question, the answer is absolutely not. So again we wouldn't be doing this if we think with macro trends the business and at the same time be able to advance a number of those growth efforts that we've been on and [indiscernible] management team we've been through that have with the high degree of competence that we'll not do it.","Loren Starr","Yeah I would say I mean year-to-date, we've had about $13 million of net flows into the areas that we have been focusing on growth we talk about a lot of already ETF through example from the factors based capabilities a lot of that's in the pipeline, institutional pipeline. We're actually seeing an enormous sort of buildup in our Jemstep pipeline where we've got I think really very close to production and ongoing support as part of this process, a very large client that will come through in short order and the area we're seeing more sort of in contracting we're winning probably the majority - we're actually winning share in this space. I think we have sort of generated four out of 11 kind of major banks and so we're feeling good about Jemstep into the digital advice and where that is going. So across the board, I'd say our growth engines are moving forward in a very positive way and again I mentioned China if you have another example. So obviously we didn't have a lot of time to highlight it in this call, but I think we're absolutely going to continue to provide the visibility in terms of how our areas of growth are going to continue to allow us to sort of turn that low trajectory to a positive number into 2019.","Robert Lee","Great, thanks for taking my questions, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Worthington and please state your company name.","Ken Worthington","Hi, Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. So the deal comes nine years essentially to the day after you announced Van Kampen and so I guess we're going to have to pay attention, closely to what you're doing in October 27 for the next one. So I guess congratulations. So what are your thoughts in terms of cross marketing or cross selling with MassMutual over time? Maybe is a place to start, what percentage of Oppenheimer's AUM is actually sourced from MassMutual and then what kind of incremental investment dollars might you expect from your new partner and what products investor products seem best positioned?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, so great question Ken. So we've already had half a day conversation with the respective leadership between the two organizations and there are a number of areas where we think there are opportunities by the way we're just into it right now, so let me give you - as you know they have 8,500 advisors in the United States and so that is something that's going to be an obvious focus area for us. MassMutual's also doing some very interesting things out in Asia, very complementary to what we're doing, so that's another area where we think there's some real opportunity for us, those are two to name a few. And with their knowledge and skills in insurance and risk along with what we do in investment management, I'm sure we're going to find some very interesting things. There's going to be quite a bit of focus in this area. I really can't get through to disclose the level of what they've done together historically that's just not in our permit to do right now but it is actually something that is from our perspective is going to be quite powerful as we go forward.","Ken Worthington","Thanks. Maybe a little one for Loren, you guys mentioned AUM was about $250 billion. Market conditions particularly outside the US have been poor so far this quarter. Do you have a maybe more accurate AUM figure for us to kind of start out from or even as of date of the 250 billion?","Loren Starr","I mean it's moved around plus or minus, I mean they've actually held pretty closely to the 250, I think it probably still rounding roughly to 250 million. So it has not been a lot of turmoil into the AUM number and flow trajectory we do have seen is been on a very positive trajectory for their franchise, so some outflow, but in on the positive trajectory over the last two months. So I think again in terms of numbers I would still be thinking 250 million is the right modeling number for you.","Ken Worthington","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon and please state your company name.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Dan Fannon, Jefferies. I guess just building on that last comment and talk about a little more detail about recent flow trends and we obviously saw your results this morning on a standalone basis where outflows are close to 11 billion, you just mentioned, I think with the data we can see is Oppenheimer has generally been in a little bit more outflow, it's improving but still been an outflow. So give us a little bit more around why you think flows on a 2020 basis will be positive given what we're seeing today from performance and kind of current industry trends?","Loren Starr","Yeah. Back again and - again for all of us who are long-term investors that look quarter-to-quarter, which is probably not very constructive, so I'd put it in the context of - I'm very bullish on the industry, it's $87 trillion initiatives it's not going to go away. The organizations that get it right are going to be very successful we intend to be one of those organizations. So now when we bring it down here, we have seen net inflows for nine years. Some headwinds and because of where we are in this market cycle for some of our value capabilities as we told you that will change and it is changing as you know we'll again will continue to see the impact there. But what we're doing is building organization that to push through these more extreme market environments - long talk about the institutional flows Jemstep in 2019, the opportunities that we're talking about with Oppenheimer here, but stay back to even put that off to the side. What we are seeing in the factor capabilities and our solutions capabilities are multi asset capabilities where we [indiscernible] meaningful and we're expecting to be very successful as we go forward.","Martin Flanagan","I think I already mentioned Dan, is there any global and international capabilities that are hard to replicate that are persistent. They've actually done very well in terms of flows and it's really some of the other areas, some of the domestic kind of equity areas that has been an industry trend when you see the biggest outflows. So we do think as we are able to leverage the capabilities on a global basis, which are in demand that we're going to be able to bring the whole franchise a positive flow and again we've talked about our own strategies around growth and how we think we can bring sort of the core Invesco capabilities also grow. So that's why we - 2019, definitely we got some outflows, nothing happened up overnight but we do think by 2020, that's the reason will remain] modest but certainly positive.","Dan Fannon","Got it and then just a couple of questions on the accretion assumptions that you're making just to be clear is that on based on consensus estimates and then also is the buyback that you announce this morning included in that accretion. And then or so just kind of like what does - and it's also kind of what market assumptions are in that?","Martin Flanagan","So, yeah. So effectively it versus consensus, so that is the right assumption. In terms of the buyback, the 1.2 billion there's about 400 million of incremental buyback that we have modelled in as a result of the transaction occurring but the 800 million is pretty much consistent with consensus and so we're - that's not part of the accretion numbers. So I'd say there's about 1% accretion in 2019 due to that incremental 200 buyback and another sort of 2.5 in 2020.","Dan Fannon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Cyprys and please state your company name. Mike Cyprys, your line is open. Please check your mute feature.","Martin Flanagan","Mike, we cannot hear you.","Operator","We are getting no response. We'll move to the next question. The next question is from Brennan Hawken and please state your company name.","Brennan Hawken","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. From UBS. So just a quick one on the $45 million fee rate cut in your merger Mass, I think that gets me to about 2 or so basis points, which would suggest about a 59% I.A.C. for Oppenheimer. Can you - number one, is that generally right and number two, how much fee rate pressure has Oppenheimer experienced over the past year or two either through their own fee cuts or the headwinds that we've seen from remix in across the industry?","Loren Starr","Let me hit the second part and then Martin can pick up the one. Literally their effective fee rate has gone up over the last three years by I think it's about 3 basis points, so they've been doing quite well. And again their fees are very competitive, generate very good active managers.","Martin Flanagan","So again the $45 million has been estimated, really at this point we don't have a build plan in terms of how funds come together and which ones are going to sort of win in terms of fee rates but there's definitely some amount of breakage that will happen when we bring funds together. So $45 million is the number that I think it still needs to be ultimately let it out and more obviously give updates as we get closer to a real plan around how the funds come together. But we think it's really conservative number right now little bit more than we actually hope will be the case. But it does have that impact from in terms of basis points as you mentioned. There is no assumption of further because going forward per se because of their price; their products are actually reasonably priced. And again in terms of the alpha creation and the ones that are higher priced, some of the alternative capabilities are all sort of reasonable on the core products reasonably left there. There's no significant pressure on having the cut fees on the active capabilities.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks for that color. And then have you spoken with the rating agencies about the potential impact of issuing this extensive amount of preferred equity? And is there any reason why the first wouldn't be viewed as the fact that given that they're non-callable in 20 year? And then finally, if you do see a downgrade for a rating agency, what kind of impact did you expect that would have?","Martin Flanagan","So, again. I think the agencies will release their reports and ultimately after they go to committee on this and we hope we will hear some of the answers today, so we're not going to sort of go ahead of them doing that. I mean I think we have our own user on the preferred and what it is. Obviously, there is a perpetual coupon 226 million that is going to be part of this deal. 5.9% coupon right now as you said might feel expensive, but we think over time it might not seem like expensive to you. You find there is no commitment for us to have to repay the 4 billion perpetual, there's a whole option and it's out 21 years really is part of requirements to have qualifying equity as part of the tax free reorg that's necessary for MassMutual. So, again, we don't, I mean, personally I don't view it as debt. It has got a lot of equity like characteristics in terms of be non-cumulative and again whatever you can sort of make your own approach and or your own assessment, surely you'll hear from all our ratings partners in terms of how they perceive this and you can assimilate that.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Cyprys. Please state your company name.","Mike Cyprys","Great, thanks, Mike Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Just a question more broadly on M&A, so look across the industry mix results, M&A has been put it kindly. So I guess just what do you see to look across what others get wrong with M&A? What lessons do you take away with that? What do you think you have to get right to make this a highly successful transaction on the execution side for Invesco?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah that's a good question. So it's just my opinion. I think trouble happens when you look at a piece of paper and it looks good on a piece of paper and you actually lose track of what really matters and these are fiduciary organizations with talented people and the value is really the understanding what the value is and how do you maintain that and how do you have that talent and how do you have that drive and so we're very focused on being very clear and jointly working through the execution with our partners as we've done historically and it might sound pretty basic, but that is in my opinion where things break down.","And I - but let me come back to this. So Mike, you know that we've talked about this in the past. You know, there is this notion that there's going to be massive consolidation in the industry maybe may be not I do that the premises that there's with that thought is that there's excess number of money managers that might be doing a middling job and I think that is the case and that will get resolved one way or the other, but the notion that if you are going to see this massive consolidation with people that have not had experience and that is going to be done well, I think is a misnomer and there so I'd look at this experience here but the first experience I had was 1992 when Franklin bought Templeton when I was there and so I've been on both sides of these things and there is a way to do this and do this successfully. And I understand your sweeping comment but I point you to our track record and we know how to do this.","Mike Cyprys","And somewhat related to that, you maybe you could talk a little about the risk around the large fund franchises that Oppenheimer has? How do you manage that? I guess particularly if you can talk about the incentive structures, retention structures you're putting in place to retain key investment professionals and to what extent are they going to be integrated or not? What the broader investment Invesco franchise?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, so important question, so MassMutual has put in retention program which is great but more importantly, people will stay at organizations for money, they stay at organizations because they want to be there because they thrive in a particular for investment managers, so they can actually express themselves through their craft and we actually run our investment teams in a very similar way that MassMutual does, they're separate, they're distinct, we want them dedicated to present process and philosophy, we reinforce that. We wanted to make sure that they have the tools they need to continue to generate alpha for their clients that's what Oppenheimer has done in the past, that's what still going to happen going forward, that's not going to change. And we had the opportunity to meet with some of the senior leaders of the great culture, they really love what they have and that's going to - it's going to continue that way. And I think that's really important and that's what matters and again this is where I come back to you, yeah, when does it fail? It fails when an organization combines and somebody thinks they're going to institutionalize on process and it's probably the worst thing you can do.","Mike Cyprys","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Carrier and please state your company name.","Michael Carrier","Mike Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Thanks guys. First one, just on the core business, Martin or Loren, I think you mentioned just the institutional pipeline is strong, maybe when we saw especially heading within August just some of the elevated outflows. Just maybe what you are seeing and what gives you mainly the confidence with that pipeline that we're not kind of seeing in the same level of redemptions or maybe any color on what drove some of those redemptions in the quarter?","Martin Flanagan","Again, I think I gave some color already. Obviously, I hear sort of individual accounts that we decided and terminate I think the sovereign wealth is one that we see few times, that was the largest outflow. And so it's not a performance related topic, if not something systematic not a trend and it's really just a single coin topic more than anything else. I could - you know, and not going to happen again, but it's not something that is sweeping across our institutional business which is really localized to a particular client. I think we do feel very good about the pipeline because this broad basis across equity, the alternatives, balanced fixed income and so it is actually again I think it is a function of maybe things have shifted in terms of we're going to manage go in and we are actually heading into new found areas of demand around factor for example and some areas we're on alternatives that we haven't seen in the past.","So for us revenue yield is also extremely strong and so the revenue level is also all time high. And then when we look at, we do look at the pipeline of expected losses. That is not, I mean that's funding flat quarter-over-quarter, so it is not escalating out. So I mean that's why we feel that we're just going through a rough patch here in terms of the intuitional side and it should be persistent going into 2019, certainly not anything we see with the information that we have today. Again, redemptions do happen and they can happen, we could get surprise but it just doesn't feel like a trend and it's not based on performance. Again, when we look at the products that are selling either products that are in high really performing well, we will stay in bank loans and other products that are done very well.","So, then the other side of the full story I think is the one we all know which is just domestic, equity, retail US has been an outflow some of the value oriented capabilities that we talked about have been under pressure. So that is something that I think in terms of the near term for the turn around that we've seen in October and particular just given the market is sort of a proof point to our client that what we said what's going to happen is happening. Now, again, if anybody's guess as to where the market actually go, because the fact is we've said that this would happen when markets begin to sort of turn around and you begin to see momentum become less interesting that our products are going to outperform, if we do see us we're kind of moving in that direction, it should be really helpful for us, I mean some of the redemptions going forward.","Michael Carrier","Okay, that's helpful and then maybe one more from Marty. I look at the history for you guys and even the industry, it seems like you've done M&A on for the gross side and then you've also done some scale transactions and in terms of a little bit of both, but when you think about Invesco going forward like in the areas that are very competitive like the US mutual fund industry, if you just create like an upscale that if you think over the next three, five years that you can combat any future exceed pressures, out flows. And then on the flip side, a lot of the [indiscernible] you guys have made over the past three years on the growth front and it seems like that you're still positioned in the higher growth in your differentiated areas. But just when you think about that combination, you think going forward Invesco, you know it is well positioned as you can get it to basically grow where you can and offset the headwinds through scale.","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, absolutely, again, also the points I was trying to drive home, I mean if you look at the US retail industry, we become the sixth largest within that and we end up as one of the absolute leaders and I think that's but I also think what's important just not the number, it is the capabilities that we're bringing there and so historically if you think of the active management capabilities, the addition of Oppenheimer it's dramatically expanding that are in high demand there. You then add that with the early days of factor capabilities being picked up in net retail channel, early days of trying to get alternatives into that channel on a way that works for the channel, the solutions capabilities that are being taken up right now the models that are being built by organizations such as ourselves for that channel. We're uniquely placed there and there are not many competitors that can do that but the scale just puts us on another level there. So I think it's really important. And the other thing I do want to make really clear where you're going is, the information you're seeing today that we're putting forward the expresses the vast majority of Oppenheimer's investment capabilities happen to be an image of fund wrapper. They're capabilities that are beyond but there is greater demand beyond mutual fund capabilities of excess, so it's the institutional opportunity, the non-U.S. opportunity both institutional and retail, the opportunities are meaningful. And again you really have to put this in the context of everything that we've been talking about in executing against right it is a combination of this high condition active, passive factor in particular for us alternatives and I really feel really good about where we've gotten the organization over the last number of years, the last couple years actually in particular with this very rapid advancement of our strategy. And as I've said it in the past it's [0:08:25] combat back to the future, it is changing, it is changing rapidly. And our efforts to then get ahead of that curve in a meaningful way and we think we've done that.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kenneth Lee and please state your company name.","Kenneth Lee","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Kenneth Lee, RBC capital markets. I just want to know whether you guys have any updated thoughts on long-term organic growth targets post-acquisition you know maybe post 2019 as well, proved to do sort of like a 3% to 5% range, wondering that's changing? Thanks.","Loren Starr","I think we still believe that 3% to 5% is doable for us as a fund across market cycles, this acquisition, we think is going to help significantly improve our ability to grow not just in the U.S. in a more consistent way but also as Marty mentioned taking some of the capabilities globally is going to be a big opportunity for us. So I think there's nothing that's really changed, our belief in the market itself will have something to do with ultimately where we achieved and how we're going to keep the growth. But the growth engine that we talked about are still one that we feel strongly are sort of at a very high level, higher than the industry average physically around digital advice, China those things are at double digit kind of growth opportunities and factor based, we think we can continue to really drive more growth there, so I think long answer to 3% to 5% still feels quite achievable for us.","Kenneth Lee","Okay, great. And just a follow up on an earlier question about the strategic partnership with MassMutual. Just want to clarify, is there is some sort of agreement in place for Invesco to provide asset management services going forward or MassMutual insurance and retirement products?","Martin Flanagan","No. No there's no agreement. I think what's really important to understand is the MassMutual has put every dollar of the proceeds back into the combine of situation. There's a high degree that they are not getting out of the asset management business, they're staying in it and they're expressing it through their equity holding and the preferred that Loren talked about. And as I said, we have had high level of conversations, I feel very strongly that the appropriate ways to work together will emerge and it will be official to both organizations, so again just very confident in the relationship.","Kenneth Lee","Got you and just one last one, just in the quarter within the EU region there were some outflows there. Just wondering whether what key factors drove some of those flows banks?","Loren Starr","Yes. So that was the sovereign wealth outflows that I mentioned physically it was around some of our Asian equity capabilities managed out of our [indiscernible].","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Shutler and please state your company name.","Chris Shutler","Hi, guys, good morning. Chris Shutler from William Blair. Within retail, how much of Oppenheimer's AUM is in the broker dealer channel relative to the RIA channel?","Martin Flanagan","What I do know is - Loren is looking for some numbers that we have it but they have an incredible distribution capability probably one of the better in the industry is very highly regarded and the results show that. They also have some very good success in the [indiscernible] segment of the market which we do not have, and again, so we look at a combinational thing. We will be better half with the Oppenheimer real talent and I think that they have done.","Loren Starr","Yes, so, again, I'm not sure if it's - if I have enough transparency to really start comment in detail around the various assets and channels that it looks like RIAs, bumping around 15 billion of the total numbers, so it's marching [ph] to be mostly through the wealth management platforms, yeah.","Chris Shutler","One-five, 15.","Loren Starr","One-five, 15, Chris.","Chris Shutler","Okay. Thanks a lot. And then correct me if I'm wrong there, it looks like I think about 85% of their Oppenheimer's AUMs in mutual fund wrapper. Can you give us some kind of breakout of what the other 15%-ish of the assets look like how much of it is institutional versus sub advisory, whatever kind of flow trends in that piece of Oppenheimer?","Loren Starr","So I think they have smaller institutional capabilities. That's been in an area that we've been trying to grow, there's probably about 10 billion - 12 billion sub advisory fee around 27 billion, 25 billion. So those are the big other pieces that you might not see through the normal sort of channels that you see. They do have smaller other business which again I think it's about 6 billion, so it's mostly in the mutual fund side and ETFs, right.","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, 3 billion ETFs, but - So let me come back to that. So what I do want to make very, very clear is that the bulk of the business has been a mutual funds, that is a vehicle, the capabilities with the mutual funds are really very, very strong and we look there is going to be an opportunity for a number of those capabilities to be taken to the distribution channels we have outside of the United States, retail probably, the most immediate followed by institutional both in the U.S. and non-U.S. So again, the high quality investment seems really offer us a real opportunities as we look forward.","Chris Shutler","Last one, guys, real quick. How much - and you may have stated this already, so I apologise if that's the case, but the - how much of the AUM at Oppenheimer is in kind of an overlapping strategy with Invesco, where there's two strategies that look pretty close.","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, very little overlap which is actually what is so attractive about the other combination. So again we look at the combination of the teams in the strategies as complementary an additive as we look forward.","Chris Shutler","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Blostein. Please state your company name.","Alex Blostein","Hey, good morning, thanks, Goldman Sachs. I would like to go back to the cost synergy question just one more time guys and I'm sorry if I - if I missed it, but if you think about the $475 million, it looks like it's 50% to 60% of Oppenheimer's cost base that's well above what we've seen with any other transaction and management space of the size in recent history. So what makes this one different I guess to get you guys to this level of synergies that's I guess part one. And part two when you guys talk about the 450 of integration costs that also feels pretty sizable , so maybe help us maybe break that up kind of what that comprises of and how long do you think these integration cost will be in Invesco's run rate?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, so the - I want to clarify that point, so you cannot look at it as a percentage of Oppenheimer's basis, it's not factual or correct. So what we said earlier was the opportunity becomes the dominance of their platform being in mutual funds and our mutual fund capability all being in the United States. The scale benefits that come out of systems integrations and the operations supporting the mutual fund business across both platforms is material and real. And Oppenheimer already was heading down a path of simplification in the like, so this will just speed that up, so again it is - that was very different than the other combinations that you've seen in the marketplace.","Loren Starr","Yeah and then the 450, so again there is all sorts of cost associated with completing the transaction and getting process solicitation so forth and so we have some estimates in here in terms of getting to one platform plus one platform and get one platform, so there's cost around technology and integration to get there. So it's a generous number, but it's one that we think as conservative, but you know potentially going to be all used given the degree and the 475 is a big number as you mentioned. So we would expect to see that sort of in line with the timing around the synergies, so you can think of it sort of occurring roughly in step with mostly in year one and then the rest sort of getting finished up in year two being the smaller piece.","Alex Blostein","Got it and the 450 is mostly cash I'm assuming, right, cash expenses?","Loren Starr","Yeah, those would be cash expenses one time sort of cash expenses.","Alex Blostein","Sorry, last one on the tax rate, so I'm assuming you guys will kind of proceed with the adjusted tax rate methodology in terms of how you report earnings. This probably creates a pretty sizable amortization shield. What should be sort of the adjusted tax rate we should be thinking about post the transaction and does that feed into your accretion enough?","Loren Starr","Yeah, there's no benefit here from a tax perspective for us, so there's no element in the accretion related to tax benefits. The accounting around the intangible amortization is going to be small, modest, probably somewhere between $50 million $70 million a year, but there is no tax benefit associated with that, so nothing. So the step up in tax rate is going to take our current rate of roughly 20.6% and probably add another two percentage points to it for the firm as a whole just because of the degree of US earnings that we're going to be generating.","Alex Blostein","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Campbell and please state your company name.","Jeremy Campbell","Hey it's Jeremy Campbell from Barclays, most of them have been answered, just got one quick clean up question here on the OpEx thing. Loren, I think you obviously mentioned that 75%, 85% is going to come in '19, with a few months of planning, how do you guys in the books here? Are we really looking at something where you can come up pretty hot and heavy out of the shoe or is it going to kind of gradually build from 2Q through 4Q?","Loren Starr","Yeah, I think again a little early for us to get into details. We need to work with our colleagues at Oppenheimer to really understand how to execute this. Obviously our intention is to go reasonably quickly, we don't think sort of long timeframe is helpful for anyone, but we need to be thoughtful in terms of doing this is the way we executed so. I think will be able to provide more color exactly around kind of how it gets by quarter as we get a little bit closer to close.","Jeremy Campbell","Got it and just one quick follow-up on Alex's question there, just want to be sure, kind of clarification that - that's sort of like the OpEx and the very kind of small extended the buyback here there's no other kind of elements to the accretion math that we might be missing there right?","Loren Starr","Nothing else no, as I mentioned the only thing of 200 million of extra buyback in two years and so as to quantify that, that is - that's about the only thing, everything else should be straight from the numbers that you are seeing.","Jeremy Campbell","Great, thanks.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Bedell and please state your company name.","Brian Bedell","Brian Bedell, Deutsche Bank. Thanks very much for keeping the call going here. Two mean questions one on the cost synergies side and one on the potential for revenue synergies and maybe just starting on the cost side. You naturally took a crack at trying to estimate the synergies after this is zooming in the press, 14% cost saves on the total base is pretty high and implies some product rationalization around this and so we took a crack at that and [indiscernible] with around 150 billion of AUM on the mutual fund side to both organizations that could potentially be merged and that was almost 200 billion in costs the way we came up with it. So just wanted to see if that's way off pace and then if you can just talk about the process of timing of doing this fund mergers, for example, do you have fund board approvals yet or does that come after the deal, poses and then would you look to integrate funds in fairly quickly as - so that you're not put on gate keeper watch list.","Martin Flanagan","Yeah. That would all the respect that's not how we do it. Though there are no plans for fund mergers, our focus right now is to get to a combined operating platform that will be 100% focused between now and closing. And the synergies that you're seeing are coming from what I've talked about, this is the benefit of scale within an organization and again it happens because it's operational benefits that you get through emerging operational capabilities within - largely mutual fund capabilities within the United States, that's where that's coming from and there's no contemplation, no plan for fund mergers in this work and it won't be until after - yeah we'll turn ahead to sort of what - after the closing and what makes sense there.","Brian Bedell","And so if you do you come up with fund managers later down the road would that be upside to the 475 then?","Martin Flanagan","Yes.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. And then maybe on the distribution synergy side, so I appreciate your comment on the new products structures I mean obviously mutual funds has been a challenge product structure for a long time, but if you have the investment teams in there and Oppenheimer didn't really create a big product range in that area. How quickly do you think you can come up with institutional product structures to really crank up the net flow ability of the franchise and the 10 billion that you estimate, I assume that's a gross outflow number or is that net of potential of new products offsetting some of the mutual fund have?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, so let me hit on that. So again we're all of two hours into this, so we have some work to do and being clear. But what we do know spending time with the teams that are high quality teams, they are in high demand areas. We as an organization have a very robust instructional capability to get teams what we call client ready for the institutional channel and we are very well equipped to introduce if you want to call it retail structures outside of the United States. But it's just not the structure, it is really the go to market strategy matching up against clients demand, the sales forces, the marketing capabilities, that's what is so robust about this, so again once we spend time with one another figure out what clients are looking for we'll get after pretty quickly.","Loren Starr","And the 10 is a net - it's a net outflow number, so it's not a just a redemption number it's a net flow.","Brian Bedell","In a number, okay and then without the fund mergers, so you really don't anticipate being put on watch list from other DT specific [ph] distributor [indiscernible]?","Martin Flanagan","No.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Thank you.","Martin Flanagan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Davitt and please state your company name.","Patrick Davitt","Hey, good morning. It's Autonomous Research. Appreciate Slide 17, that's helpful. I imagine most of these probably want to be doing business with less managers, but is there a risk of hitting any exposure limits with big bigger with all these guys?","Martin Flanagan","I wish we had that problem but no.","Patrick Davitt","Okay. And then you mentioned the great wall flows, I imagine that's all money funds still if not that's great, but what kind of runway to getting more non-money fund kind of flows from that from that distribution level?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, so a couple points, so let me - we can be more excited about that actually. So if you look at our transaction partnership there it is very digitally based economy with the retail world and through we have financial. We are the first and only western joint venture partner that's in there and it starts with money funds and by the way it's 10 basis points so that's 10 basis points and tens of billions of dollars isn't so bad, but if you have a natural follow on is including further investment capabilities in that platform and we anticipate that happening in future here, I don't have the specific dates of it though, but it's a good start for us.","Patrick Davitt","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Harrison, please say your company name.","Chris Harrison","Good morning, Wells Fargo. Can you guys talk to us a little bit about how this transaction came about and maybe share your perspective on why MassMutual's selling?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, let's see. The transaction came about simply from conversation of where we think the world is going. We were very likeminded in where we thought it was going. All the things that we talked about today are real in the meaningful and when you have an alignment like that we turned consider your focus on what can you do together. But I do want to clarify a point, MassMutual is not selling and they're making that very, very clear and they are taking - they are holding the 81 million common equity shares and $4 billion preferred over the long term. As you know they are a mutual company, they talk about having a long-term view, it's extraordinary. And every single dollar that would be proceeds is going back into this combined intuition and I think it's really important for people to hear and understand, they're committed to combined firm and they have a high degree of confidence in what we're going to do together going forward.","Chris Harrison","Okay, understood and kind of unrelated question and some of the larger Oppenheimer Funds we looked at that have had a really extraordinary performance. They do have a large overweighting in the tech sector and so I guess I'm wondering is there a way you guys can mitigate the risks or how do you mitigate the risk of acquiring that after what's been the very good run for stocks in that particular sector?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, so you're really hitting on a question that comes up a different way. No different than Invesco the investment team's managed money consistent with investment philosophy and that's one, two, three in the list that's what we want to do in the going to continue to do that and they generate as you say very good performance over market cycle and within the portfolio sort of the full discretion of the portfolio managers that like a change in our time or has never changed at Invesco. The way that it gets if you want to call it mitigated is through having complementary strategies and that's what we're trying to point out earlier. And so when you look at the lineups side-by-side - if you want to call it that's how you're mitigating the different styles, styles are in favor and out of favor as an organization. It gives clients choice but it's also good for stable - having a more stable business.","Operator","And we do have time for one final question. Our last question today is from Greggory Warren and please state your company name.","Greggory Warren","Good morning. This is Greg Warren from Morningstar. Just a quick question want to step back to kind of the breakage forecast you guys put out there. I understand that you're basing it on what you saw with Van Kampen, but in all honesty that was 10 years ago and that was a completely different market environment. So what gives you the belief that with the disruption like this with you guys picking up Oppenheimer Funds that you're only going to see 10 billion in outflows out of the gate, I would assume you see something slightly higher than that and I guess a follow-on to that is how much of MassMutual is actually invested in Oppenheimer Funds. How much business are you guys getting from them?","Loren Starr","I think with the Van Kampen transaction we used - we estimated 10, it was nothing close to that, it was much less, so that 10 was way conservative back then and we think it's probably still conservative, but we're using it and again when we think about it it's really - because there is no real breakage, we're not foreseeing teams to sort of come together do anything different with the process, so maybe that 10 is just not going to happen, so there are just as a - point of conservatism in the modeling. I don't think there's anything explicitly that we expect from the trigger big outflows as a result of this transaction, but we really needed it when we're thinking about just uncertainty. So that's why the10's there, it's not based on fact or data or it's more kind of conservatism. I think - what was your second question, Gregg I'm sorry?","Greggory Warren","Yeah surely how much - how does MassMutual actually have because usually in those situations where the life insurer or an insurer owns part of as a management firm, there's a plenty of cross business between them, so I was just wondering how much MassMutual actually have invested in Oppenheimer Funds at this point?","Martin Flanagan","Yeah, no it is not a large number and again I am not trying to - I just don't feel liberty to - that I can have a conversation, so if not a large number of the intent going forward though is - one of the first parts that we collectively want to look at is making available more robustly the investment capabilities here in the United States at 85 - 8,500 advisors.","Loren Starr","In terms of the General Account there is really no relationship between what Oppenheimer is doing in the management those of MassMutual has more count.","Greggory Warren","Okay. And then Loren, just a quick, I don't know if I caught it or not during the course of the call, but you've got 1.2 billion share repurchase sort of authorized now. Did you give an indication of how soon you might start buying back stock or how much of may be a quarterly run rate you're looking at?","Loren Starr","So we can start and we have an intention of beginning after obviously this release gets its due process in terms of two days, so you think about starting next week. And so we're going to be obviously interested given the fact that the stock we feel is credibly undervalued particularly in light of the transaction. But we're also being sensitive to the fact we haven't yet completed the deal and a lot of the buyback and the extra buyback is really on the backs of this deal ultimately bringing more cash flow. So without that said, we are so intent on sort of starting in a very serious way the 1.2 - was now laid out by quarter at this point in time, but we will be in the market almost immediately.","Greggory Warren","So would it be comfortable, say you could easily finance a third of that right out of the gate?","Loren Starr","No question.","Greggory Warren","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Martin Flanagan","Thanks, everybody. Operator I think that's it.","Operator","I would now turn it up call back to speakers for closing remarks.","Martin Flanagan","Good again just want to thank everybody for changing their schedules and really appreciate engagement the questions and we're very excited about the opportunity in the future here. So thank you very much and we will continue to communicate progress on this combination, but also as Loren pointed out, many good things are going on in our core business and I will bring up to speed on those in future calls. So have a good rest of the day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."]}}
