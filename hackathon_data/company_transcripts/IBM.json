Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from us in Investor Relations.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark Loughridge.","Mark Loughridge","Thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we reported $23.4 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $3 which is up 8% year-to-year. But this quarter certainly didn\u2019t close the way it started. We had solid profit performance in January, but as the quarter ended hundreds of millions of dollars of very profitable software and System z mainframe deals fell short of the goal line.","This impacted the first quarter close, but the rollover of these deals positions us for a strong start in our software and mainframe business in the second quarter. Taking full consideration of our first quarter performance and the number of actions to improve this performance, we continue to expect operating EPS of at least $16.70 for the year.","Now let me make four points about what we saw in our business this quarter. First, our total services business performed as expected with year-to-year constant currency revenue growth in line with last quarter and pretax profit up 10%. Our backlog was up 1% year-to-year or 5% constant currency driven by a lot of new business in the quarter.","Second, we had a shortfall in sales execution in our software and mainframe businesses, but with a good list of rollover transactions coupled with improved execution, we\u2019ve got a strong hand going into the second quarter in these businesses. Third, in our growth initiatives, Smarter Planet was up over 25% and Cloud over 70%.","Business Analytics was up 7% led by double-digit growth in GBS. But our growth markets revenue was up 1% at constant currency, clearly not what we expected or what we needed. Across IBM we delivered strong growth in several of our offerings to address market trends like SaaS and mobile where we grew over 50% leveraging our organic and acquisitive investments. As these become a larger part of our business, that will contribute more to our growth.","Finally, there are parts of our business that are in transition or have been underperforming like elements of our Power x and storage product lines that showed disappointing performance in the first quarter. Here we\u2019re going to take substantial actions.","Now, let me describe how this impacts the year. With the improved execution in our software and mainframe businesses, we would expect the operating EPS growth in the second quarter to be similar to that of the first. However, given our first quarter performance, we now expect to take the bulk of our workforce rebalancing actions for the year in the second quarter, as opposed to last year when it was distributed across the quarters.","Though we certainly don\u2019t have a specific approved action, this will result in a charge that will additionally impact the operating EPS we report. Like all years, we have a number of actions planned to improve the business for the long-term, acquiring and divesting businesses and rebalancing our resources. This results in charges in the second quarter and gains in the second half, which we expect will roughly offset for the year.","By the end of 2013, taking into account our operational performance benefits from the workforce rebalancing activity and gains and charges, we\u2019re confident we can achieve at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the year.","Let me now walk you through the financial metrics for the first quarter. In total, IBM\u2019s revenue growth at constant currency was down 3%. We entered the quarter with a modest currency headwind, but became more pronounced due to currency movements over those last 90 days especially in the yen. When you look at the reported revenue for the quarter, currency impacted our revenue growth by two points.","Turning to the profit metrics, our ongoing focus on productivity and our shift to higher value contributed to our margin performance. We expanded operating gross margin by a point led by services and an improving mix and we expanded operating pre-tax margin by 0.8.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%, down approximately 3 points year-to-year. The lower tax rate is primarily due to benefits recorded to reflect changes in tax law enacted during the quarter, including the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2012. We expect our ongoing operating tax rate for the next three quarters to be in the range of 25%.","Our operating net income grew 3% and our margin was up over 1 point. With nearly $12 billion in gross share repurchase over the last 12 months, we reduced our share count by 4%. When you bring all of this together we delivered operating EPS of $3, which is up 8%.","Turning to cash, we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12 billion. Now we\u2019ll get into the results starting with revenue and gross margin by segment.","Year-to-year constant currency revenue performance in our combined services businesses was consistent with the fourth quarter. At constant currency, GBS performance improved a couple of points while GTS revenue growth slowed due to continued pressure on sales into existing accounts and actions taken to restructure the low margin outsourcing contracts.","In software we had good performance in several key areas such as Smarter Commerce, Social Business, Security and Storage Management, but our growth rate was impacted by the inability to close some large transactions at the end of the quarter. In Systems and Technology, while we\u2019re delivering good performance in System z mainframe despite the slipped deal, and in our PureSystems offerings, weakness in Power, System x and Storage resulted in overall decline.","Looking at our gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 1 point driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both Services segment and an improving segment mix.","Looking at revenue by geography on a constant currency basis, Americas\u2019 revenue was down 3% with declines in both the U.S. and Canada, mitigated by double-digit growth in Latin America led by Brazil and Mexico. Our EMEA revenue was down 4% year-to-year, about a 0.5 lower than last quarter. Most of the major countries declined though Spain returned to modest growth.","In Asia-Pacific revenue was down 1%. Within that Japan revenue was up 3%. This was the second consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Japan reflecting the stabilization of our business in that country. The balance of AP, which is part of our growth markets declined.","Across all geographies, our growth markets revenue was up a disappointing 1%, though five points faster than the major markets. BRICs were up 3% led by Brazil, while China and Russia posted modest declines. China\u2019s performance was impacted by weakness in large deals and a slowdown in our low-end and mid-range products.","Now let\u2019s take a look at our expense profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 4%. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove two points of expense growth. Currency contributed a point of expense decline, driven almost entirely by translation. Consequently, our base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was better by five points.","I\u2019ll comment on a couple of expense items that have larger year-to-year impact to our profit. First, workforce rebalancing was better by about $200 million year-to-year driven by a charge in last year\u2019s result. Second, our IT income was down over $70 million year-to-year.","Typically, we talked about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense. In first quarter, the hedge activity was neutral year-to-year with very modest gains in both periods. In the quarter, we were impacted by significant depreciation of the yen. As our business in Japan is more heavily skewed to local services, the ability to hedge cross-border cash flows is low compared to most other countries. This had a profit impact in the quarter, which would continue at current spot rate.","So, now let me go into the segment. This quarter the two services segments generated $14 billion in revenue, grew pre-tax profit 10% and expanded pre-tax margin by 2 points. Total backlog was $141 billion, up 1% at spot rate, but up 5% at constant currency. Backlog grew in both the transactional and outsourcing businesses. In fact, we had 22 deals greater than $100 million. We closed large transformational deals in every geography, but we have particularly good performance in our major markets where the vast majority of these 22 deals were done, and nearly half of those were new services contracts. These deals contributed to our major markets backlog, which was up 3% at constant currency and grew for the first time since the end of 2010.","Turning to the two segments, Global Technology Services revenue was $9.6 billion, down 4% as reported and down 2% at constant currency. There were two major categories affecting revenue growth. The first was a continuation of the decline in revenue from sales into existing base accounts. This activity tends to be more transactional in nature and economical sensitive. And as expected, GTS revenue continued to be impacted by the work we\u2019ve done to improve profitability of the restructured low margin outsourcing contracts. That initiative has helped improved our margin performance again this quarter, but does reduce the top line. We estimate that impact to be about a point of revenue growth to GTS and to Services in total. These two items were reflected primarily in GTS outsourcing revenue, which is down 3% at constant currency.","In the Integrated Technology Services, revenue was up 2% at constant currency, led by continued strength in the growth markets and the third consecutive quarter of growth in Japan.","GTS delivered 7% pre-tax profit growth in the quarter and expanded pre-tax margins by about two points. This quarter margin expansion was driven by continued efficiency improvements, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives and lower workforce rebalancing charges.","Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.5 billion, down 3% as reported and flat at constant currency. This represents an improvement of two points quarter-to-quarter at constant currency. From a geographic perspective, the growth markets in Japan drove the strongest performance while North America slowed its rate of decline versus last quarter.","Looking at the GBS business by offering, we had good results in our solutions that address the digital front office. We delivered double-digit growth across the initiatives; Business Analytics, Smarter Planet and Cloud. As these become a larger part of GBS, they\u2019ll contribute more to the top line performance.","And as we address the globally integrated enterprise, our traditional back-office solution, we\u2019re continuing to focus on improving our performance in implementation services that support the traditional packaged application.","Turning to profit, GBS pre-tax income improved 17% year-to-year and pre-tax margin expanded three points. The main year-to-year profit drivers were continued benefit from our enterprise productivity initiatives, lower workforce rebalancing charges and improved contract performance.","So to wrap up Services, we grew backlog 5% at constant currency with the major markets up for the first time since the end of 2010. Growth initiatives continue to perform well or continuing to improve in transition areas like traditional packets, application implementation and we expanded profit margins and delivered 10% growth and a pre-tax income.","Software revenue of $5.6 billion was flat year-to-year or up 1% at constant currency. Pre-tax income was up 4% year-to-year and pre-tax margin is up 1.2 points to 31.5%. As I stated up front, software growth was impacted by a number of large transactions that rolled into the second quarter. Key branded middleware grew 1% or 2% at constant currency.","Now let me give you some insight into our branded middleware performance. WebSphere grew 7% at constant currency, for the 12 consecutive year Gartner designated IBM the worldwide market share leader in the application infracture and middleware segment. In the quarter we had strong double-digit growth in Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities leveraging our organic and acquisitive investments. Our SaaS offerings contribute to the strong performance.","To address the emerging opportunity around enterprise, mobile computing, in the first quarter we introduced MobileFirst, which combined deep mobile expertise with cloud based services.","Information Management was down 1% at constant currency. The brand most impacted by the large roll over transactions. However we did hold share. Tivoli was up 3% at constant currency, driven by security and storage. Security was up 15% at constant currency driven by a security intelligence and identity and access management product segment. Security intelligence was more than double this quarter, provides solutions to help client to identify threats more quickly, prioritize risk more effectively and automate compliance activities.","Identity and access management was up double-digit, allowing organizations to mitigate risk by controlling and monitoring users\u2019 access, which is even more critical as IT infrastructures become more interconnected.","Tivoli Storage which enables customers to manage their rapidly growing data grew 11% at constant currency. Social Workforce Solutions, which includes our recently acquired Kenexa Business grew 9% at constant currency. We began building our social business platform several years ago and we\u2019ve been ranked as the number one enterprise social software vendor for three consecutive years by IDC. Across the software brand, as we close the transactions that rolled over, we should deliver double-digit growth in key branded middleware in the second quarter.","Systems and Technology revenue of $3.1 billion was down 17% year-to-year or 13% at constant currency, adjusting for the divestiture of Retail Store Solutions. System z grew 8% at constant currency. MIPS were up 27% and more than half of the MIPS were from specialty engine, which were up more than 65%. Within that Java was up 70%, database 24% and Linux nearly doubled.","Like software, as we close the large transactions that rolled over from the first quarter, we should be able to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our System z business in the second quarter. We\u2019re also continuing to see traction in PureSystems, our expert integrated systems. We completed our first 12 months of operations for PureSystems and have sold over 4,000 systems in over 90 countries.","Power revenue was down 31% at constant currency. Our declines were driven by both the high performance computing segment where we had a strong performance last year and the impact of the transition to POWER7+","Let me step back to provide a broader perspective. We are by far the market leader in Unix. We are expanding our power platform to go after the Linux opportunity. This opportunity is of similar size to Unix but growing faster. We\u2019ve already had some key successes with wins this quarter in China and in Europe and in fact Watson is based on Power Linux. Though this will take time to mature, it provides a real opportunity for future growth.","System x is down 8% at constant currency and our storage revenue was down 10% at constant currency. With strong growth in our new midrange products, storage growth profit was up as our organic Storwize products grew over 50% and replaced older OEM products. The value in storage continues to shift the software. Our storage software which is reported in Tivoli grew 11% at constant currency.","For systems and technology, this is not the quarter we expected. Our performance was impacted by product transitions and our own execution. We expect to improve our revenue performance in the second quarter and return to profitability excluding the second quarter workforce for balancing activity.","Moving onto cash flow in the quarter, we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow down almost $200 million year-to-year. The year-to-year performance was driven by a decline in our accounts receivable clearance rate and an increase in cash tax payments. These are mitigated by year-to-year benefit associated with the timing change of funding our 401(k) and a lower level of CapEx.","Looking at the uses of cash, we closed two smaller acquisitions this quarter, StoredIQ and StarAnalytics. We returned $3.5 billion to shareholders including almost $950 million in dividends and $2.6 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back 12.3 million shares in the quarter, and at the end of March we had 6.2 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12 billion, up $900 million from year-end. Total debt was $33.4 billion of which over $25 billion was in support of our financing business, which has leveraged at 7.2 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $8.2 billion, down $600 million from year-end. At these debt levels non-financing debt to cap was 34% down two points from year-end. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long-term.","So now let me start to wrap up with the summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Our revenue decline impacted our earnings growth by $0.14. The contribution from margin was $0.23 with gross pre-tax and net margins all up year-to-year, driven by our move to higher value, margin expansion and services, and a lower tax rate resulting from changes in tax law during the quarter. A lower share count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed an additional $0.13.","For the quarter, we delivered 8% operating earnings per share growth. As I said at the beginning of the call, the quarter didn\u2019t end the way it started, so we are going to roll up our sleeves and get this back on track. First by improving our sales execution to close the roll over deals in software and mainframe, and recover our position in the growth markets. Next by taking the bulk of our workforce rebalancing actions in the second quarter, we will start to get the benefits from those actions earlier in the second half.","Finally, by taking actions to improve our under performing businesses including expanding our power platform to address the Linux opportunity and leveraging our investments in Flash and midrange storage solutions. Some of these actions will yield benefits quickly while others will play out overtime.","And of course, we are going to continue to deliver on the core elements of our business model, as we continue to shift to higher value, leverage our key growth initiatives, drive productivity across the enterprise, invest in innovation, and return value to shareholders.","Now we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do, but we know how to get it done. By the end of 2013, taking into account our operational performance, benefits from workforce rebalancing activity and gains and charges, we expect to deliver at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the year. All of this is consistent with our objective to achieve at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015.","Now Patricia and I will take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multipart questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. Operator, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we would like to begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. Mark, I just wanted to make sure I understood what you are commenting for Q2 and how that relates to the rollover impact that you have also mentioned, so I think you said that operating EPS growth would be similar in Q2 to Q1, which I think was about 3.5%. I am surprised that that\u2019s not dramatically higher than it was in Q1, because you have a much easier comparison. And also because you\u2019re suggesting that you had several $100 million in pushed out revenues that\u2019s high margin. In fact, I think if you work backwards from consensus, you miss revenues by $1.4 billion, if you take our currency you miss by almost a $1 billion. If you really were on plan other than flip deals that would suggest that, you should have a $1 billion of high margin incremental deals next quarter. And I\u2019m not sure why your pretax, why your EPS growth wouldn\u2019t be a lot higher?","And related to that, are you expecting any EPS growth after your restructuring charges in fiscal Q2?","Mark Loughridge","Okay, let me talk through that. First of all, when you look at the second quarter, in your comments on the second quarter, we have a very good set of rollover transactions going into the second as you correctly pointed out and if you look at that composite that rolled over the deadline for us. We\u2019re talking about more than $400 million of mainframe software and intellectual property.","Now, so that does give us confidence in the second quarter. But Toni, I did not mean to indicate that all else would also be on the original performance track. So, in fact, I still believe there are parts of our business that are in transition or have been underperforming that also were disappointing that are going to take some time to recover.","So, let me do a couple of things to help clarify that. If we look at the first quarter, I think our total services business did perform as expected on an I&E basis. Revenue was about what we saw in the fourth quarter, pretax profit was up 10%.","The real positive news out the services business in the first was in fact backlog performance. So backlog was up 5% at constant currency, and I am sure you\u2019ve looked at all the supplementals. We\u2019ve really had a great quarter for bookings, up almost 50%. So that drove a lot of new business in the quarter. That backlog performance is well distributed. Major markets backlog is up 3%, growth markets backlog is up 10%.","If you look at the other elements through the different axis, outsourcing backlog up 4%, transactional up 9%. So I think the teams in services delivered on their objectives on profit and they did sign a lot of new business and I would tell you, when you look at the content of the deals they too have rolling into the second quarter, they\u2019ve got a very strong lineup.","So with that I think that for both of the services businesses, by the time we get into the second half, they should be growing at the low single digit and I peg that at about 2% constant currency for both of them. We\u2019ll start to see this backlog really improve their performance.","Second, as you did point-out and I quite agree with your comments, we had a shortfall in the sales execution in our software mainframe businesses, those should rollover and they should present us with very good performance in the second quarter. Now, buyback, I mean in that over $400 million of mainframe software and intellectual property that rolled over, we should see our strategic middleware, I think in kind of the double-digit framework which will give us total software in mid-single digits, we should see our mainframe business at double-digit as well. So with that performance, really our STG business should return to profit in the second quarter.","Third, when you look at our growth initiatives, I think that to be quite clear about it was mixed, Smarter Planet I think did well, up 25%, our cloud business, up 70%, I thought they did well and it came across content that we sell to our customers, so they can setup a private cloud, that was up more than 75%, managing that content for our customers in private cloud doubled our software as a service business, was up 65%, so all those elements have performed well.","But on the other side, our growth markets revenue was up only 1%, so they need to get that back to that mid single digit characteristic that we\u2019re looking for in the second quarter. If you looked at their metrics today and put them on the table, they would be pointing at mid single digit performance.","But I think to the point that I was making earlier, there is certainly our parts of business that I put in the category of underperforming and they did disappoint us in the quarter, power storage products within that, and I do think in Power, if you look at their performance in that opportunity of unit space, once again they picked up share, but it doesn\u2019t mean much if you\u2019re declining at double digits.","Now, part of that was compared based on high performance computing, but even if you subtract that they are double digit decline, so new products are going to take some time to improve their performance, by say six to nine months, but they also need to move into new opportunity spaces like Linux in a bigger way, we do have some real success there and the Linux market right now is as big really the Unix market and growing more rapidly.","And then in the storage products, we need to take advantage of the flash memory content that we built-up and that we reviewed in Almaden, if you look at the second quarter flash memory could improve that storage growth rate by about 1.5 and by the time we get to the fourth quarter by three to four points, but those elements are going to take more time than I think we would originally have thought.","The other point that I would tell you about the second quarter, I want to be clear about is the Yen. So the Yen had an impact, total currency had an impact of about 1.5 in the first quarter, and then we see about two points in the second quarter in the current spot rates, it would lead to a year of about two points impact; a lot of that impact is frankly the Yen, and you have seen how much the Yen has moved in a short period of time.","Now, when we hedge free cash flow, we hedge the underlying cross border cash flows, so you tend to have royalties for software, you have class or hardware content, really related to the big export business that we do.","But on services, you don\u2019t have that underlying cross border cash flow to hedge and most of that is done on a local basis with local resources and local competitions, not many cross border cash flows and a lot of that content especially in Japan. And in Japan, the lion's share of the business and I mean we are talking 75% to 80% is service\u2019s content.","So when we get hit by the Yen in our largest country without the ability to hedge that free cash flow on a cross border basis, that does fall to the bottom line and we have looked at the impacts in the second quarter at about $0.10.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Toni, can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steven M. Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC ","Thanks Mark. First I wanted to clarify the employee workforce charges in the second quarter, are you excluding that from your operating earnings guidance or is that somehow in there? In the past, you have often been able to find gains to offset that. But it sounds like you\u2019re kind of excluding that. Now, I just wonder if you comment on the environment, you have some execution problems in the third quarter last year. You have currently got some at the first quarter, it sounds like either you need to maybe swap out some managers or more likely everybody is missing enterprise numbers this quarter. What do you think is going on? Is it macro or is it people looking at their cloud architectures, and just delaying things and why particular at the end of the quarter.","Mark Loughridge","Okay, let me take both of those questions. I\u2019m going to start with your first; first of all let me put this in context. So, when we gave our original guidance in January this year, we said that this year would be like other years in that we are going to buy and sell businesses. We\u2019re going to record gains and charges, we are going to invest in innovation, and continue to rebalance our workforce to future opportunities. And we said that in an all-in basis we feel confident with an at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the full-year and that is still the case.","Now, in the first quarter, we recorded 8% EPS growth and as we look at our book of business especially the strength of the rollover deals for software mainframe, we should see similar year-to-year EPS growth in the second quarter, just as we had the conversation around Toni\u2019s question. However, this will be further impacted by workforce rebalancing charges, which I will come back to, so in the second half of the year, we would expect our EPS growth to improve in the third quarter and further improve in the fourth quarter to double-digits. So, even excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge and second half gains we feel that very confident we can achieve the 9.5% EPS growth for the year to drive at least $16.70 of EPS.","Now, remember last year we had about $800 million in workforce rebalancing charges spread across the year. This year we expect the workforce rebalancing charges to be closer to $1 billion and concentrated in the second quarter. So we really haven\u2019t finished the work for a specific action yet. Like last year, we expect the bulk of that charge to be outside the U.S., and with that on an all in basis including all gains and charges, we\u2019re confident we can achieve at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the year just as we said in January.","Now, on your second question regarding the first quarter, let me give you a view on kind of our side of the table, the IBM Corporation and then I will give you a feeling for some of those macro issues that we also faced. So I think as we explained in the prepared remarks that by and large this is an execution problem. I mean we should have closed on those rollover deals and we thought we had them right up to the end and we put a lot of work into how to build that pipeline and our execution against it to compensate in a way for Easter at the end of the quarter. And the last time we had an Easter in March was 1Q \u201905 and that was also very disappointing quarter for us.","But with those deals affected by Easter well, the bulk of that 400 plus deals that closed across the deadline, the bulk of them I mean really by far of the majority were in Europe and they were in the U.S., so it\u2019s hard to imagine that we weren\u2019t affected by Easter.","Secondly, if you look at the U.S. weather effect of the, some effect of the sequester that\u2019s hard to measure, I can\u2019t tell you that our U.S. Federal business is down 13%, which was certainly a drag on the U.S. performance. But I think the other element that in a way, we kind of misjudged. The change in the Chinese government really ripples down all the way to the provinces and state-owned businesses. And as we went through that, I mean we\u2019re talking about once every 10 year event, as we went through that with the team, I don\u2019t think we fully accounted for the impact that would have.","And then the last point I would make is the yen. But once again, I want to return to the point that had we simply closed on those deals, at the end of the quarter, we would have certainly had sufficient business to close the first and enter the second with the strength.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Steve. Operator, can we take the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question","Benjamin A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Mark. I wanted to ask about your cash usage in the second quarter, if you had such good bookings, in the second half it is going to be so much better. It would seem that it would be prudent to accelerate your buyback and you have the $6 billion left. And then, I also wanted to sneak in another and ask, there are some speculation that you might sell the x86 server business on the tape and maybe you mentioned divestitures in your prepared remarks, just wondering if you could elaborate on that and clarify what we\u2019re hearing?","Mark Loughridge","Sure. First of all, let\u2019s talk about the cash and the implication for cash. So, if you look at the first quarter, our free cash flow was $1.7 billion and as we pointed out that\u2019s down $200 million. Now there were two very distinct implications to that that I will cover now. But first is the impact of cash taxes; the second, sale cycle working capital. So let\u2019s take cash taxes first. If you look at cash taxes, in fact on a year-to-year basis in the first quarter, cash taxes were an impact about $200 million, and as we phase the second quarter there will be an impact of about $900 million and for the year, as much as $2.4 billion.","So if you look at our free cash flow performance in the year, excluding that cash tax implication, I feel confident that we\u2019ll be growing our free cash flow outside of that, but we\u2019re not going to overcome $2.4 billion of additional taxes in the year. If you look at that as a percentage against the booked tax rate in the first quarter of about 17% on an operating basis, actually our cash tax rate was about 30%. And if you roll that out through the quarters for the year, this year it would be cash tax rate and the book tax rate we expect to relatively converge on a full year basis.","Now, let\u2019s talk about sales cycle working capital. That too was an impact of about $200 million in the quarter. Against that what we did see is a growing propensity for late payments on customers\u2019 growth and frankly our receivables clearance rate, the rate at which we clear them was not as good as we had expected either. And then lastly, in the negotiations on deals a lot of attention on our customer side on Ts and Cs affecting the cash flow elements, receivable payables, in some respect even more than price. So what we saw, what we took from that is lot of attention to their cash balance and holding on to that cash balance.","Now all of this content however I want to reassure you what\u2019s considered as we went through the view of free cash flow across the roadmap in that range of $90 billion to $100 billion. And so very, very confident that we\u2019re going to complete the $50 billion of share buyback. If you look at it, we\u2019ve done almost $30 billion to date, $20 billion of acquisition is a very realistic number both from cash availability and opportunities and $20 billion in dividend for a total of $90 billion and with that we should still have good financial flexibility at the end of 2015.","Secondly, on speculation and rumors I\u2019m obviously not going to comment on rumors Ben.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Ben. Can we go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Hi, Mark. First how much of the $400 million Intel 8 deals have you closed so far in April. And then just curious if you think there is a reasonable explanation for why, IBM was able to close so many large services deals in the quarter, but customers at the same time are delaying the existence in software purchases, could we be seeing customers taking a step back and reconsidering their IT infrastructure, and maybe looking more at the cloud and needing services for that that\u2019s delaying their infrastructure purchases? Thanks.","Mark Loughridge","So if you look at the $400 million in deals, my experience in this area is when you close that baseline you kind of reset to a skew across the quarter, it does all close if you go into the next month period. Now that said we have closed some substantial deals in that category, but we\u2019ll see those, I think kind of generally feathering across the quarter based on our customer buying patterns, not just ours.","Secondly, when you look at the services content, they just had a great pipeline of deals teed up right from the beginning. And so, if you looked at their performance on a week by week by week basis they just had a head esteem the entire quarter. If you look at the software mainframe content, I still think mainframe did a reasonable job of 8%, but compared to a more typical z series cycle, I think they could have done by our math another 100, 150 and that kind of is the quantification of the deals crossing the date line into the second quarter.","On the software side of the house they had a very good listed deals and I think this was just pure execution. We should have closed those on a sales side. We got to get off to a good start as we go into the second quarter. We had tremendous number of views with the management team and software and the financial team and software and they felt very confident in our position going into the second quarter.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Katie. Can we got to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Bill Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Great. Thanks. I have a question on the guidance as well. Mark, can you clarify the effective tax rate you\u2019re assuming for the full year? I know you talked about the next three quarters, but your previous guidance coming into this year was for 25% rate for the full year and obviously this quarter the tax rate was a fairly healthy benefit for EPS. So including that does your full year guidance imply pre-tax performance that was quite a bit below what you previously expected, and given the incremental restructuring you\u2019re talking about as well as the closing of some of these slip deals, can you talk about that shortfall relative to your previous pre-tax expectations?","Mark Loughridge ","Yeah. We would see the balance of the three quarters per year at a book rate of relatively 0.5% and putting everything into those categories and any unique events that we might have, we think that full year is probably going to be in the range of about 24%. So going through a first quarter that full year view of the business being within about 1% as I think pretty reasonable.","Now when you look at the tax rate, there are really two things that really drove that. You got to recognize when we get an event within the quarter, we have to recognize that on our tax rate, our book tax rate within the quarter. Like many that are reporting, we took advantage as we were required to. The tax extenders that was excluding the investment tax credit was in a sense the retrospect of reinstatement and that affected our tax rate, but the results so within the quarter change in tax law within New York state that also had an effect. So, really that change in the tax rate was due to change in tax law within the quarter, and the change in New York state was like March 29.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Bill. Let\u2019s go to the next question.","Operator","The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.","David Grossman \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thank you. Mark, you have mentioned comments about the growth markets and it sounds like if I heard you correctly that the rollover was primarily in the U.S. and Europe and I know you mentioned China is being a surprise initiative in the quarter, but were there any other things that you can talk about that impacted growth in the growth markets and help us understand what kind of visibility if any you have on improvement as we go into the second half of the year?","Mark Loughridge","Yeah. So if you look at the content within the growth market and you look at it by the business categories, about 20% of the business in the growth market is the hardware STG content, slightly over 20%. So if you look at about a fifth of it and look at the balance of the business, the balance of the business in the software services content really performed in that kind of mid-single digit framework that we discussed.","Now, underneath that we certainly weren\u2019t satisfied with that hardware content, but I think outside of the hardware content they did come through in that mid-single digit category that was consistent with their objective. Now if you look at GMU from kind of a category, really Latin America did a great job, up 14%. When we look at Central Europe and Russia, they tend to be transactional deals more volatile. We had in the CE or Russia, it was pretty broad swings in the quarter.","So the issue that we saw really was the growth market content in Asia, and with Asia it was pretty much specifically China. So China needs to do a good job responding from that going into the second quarter. They do have tough comparison rearview mirror for the second and third quarter. They were up mid-20s and 19% in the third. But I think they too have had a good record on hardware content. We\u2019re not solely dependent on that hardware content and if you look at even from a services standpoint, the backlog growth in growth markets was up 10%, which should give them some opportunity there as well.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks David. Operator can we take the next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter J. Misek with Jefferies LLC. You may ask your question.","Peter J. Misek \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Just a question on Smarter Planet Watson pipe initiatives, can you walk through how much of hardware revenue was tied into that and how we should be modeling that going forward? You reported that some of the Smarter growth initiatives were outstanding, but correspondingly we had weakness on the hardware side. Seems to be bit of a disconnect there. Maybe you can help reconcile that?","Mark Loughridge","Well, when you look at the business analytics content and you look at the Smarter Planet content, really the key in them is the relationship between the GBS content that lead those engagement, and frankly, the more important linkage there is the software content. That\u2019s why when we look at the margin along those key initiatives access, they tend to be really high because that mix in software tend to be about 50%. So when you look Smarter Planet and Business Analytics, the missing ingredient there was the software content. Again that kind of got hung up at the end of the quarter.","Actually the GBS team did a very, very good job on both. And frankly, if you look underneath the GBS profile and break it down to the components parts, they did a great job in the parts of their business aligned with those growth initiatives. They were still some impact and some categories on those traditional packaged apps. Those traditional packaged apps tend to have been more a rapid turnover, but the content and the backlog that they are building along these growth initiatives should be sustaining and long-term with, I think, good margin performance. But when I look at the growth initiatives in the first quarter, the impact that was a more material I think was the software performance, the services performance did very very well, it\u2019s that software performance that drive the margin content within them.","Patricia Murphy ","Thank Peter. Can we take the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.","Keith F. Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hi Mark could you talk a little about your confidence for the services more broadly. In the past you\u2019ve been reluctant to provide top line expectations and you\u2019ve indicated that you thought both GTS and GBS would have positive growth in the second half of the year, I think you even called out kind of 2% constant currency. Could you just tell that a little bit because the signings were very strong, but particularly in outsourcing so I\u2019d be surprised if that really helped as early as the September quarter, was there other things like, you are not loosing share in the market as you, I think have been over the last couple of quarters as you get more selective, is there something going on there. In addition if you could just talk about what the pipeline looks like after the $17 billion in signings this quarter. Thank you.","Mark Loughridge","Yeah, when you look at the content in the services performance again I would kind of steer the conversation to backlog and on a constant currency basis our outsourcing backlog was up 4%, but our transactional backlog was up 9%, so we\u2019re now seeing the GBS business as an example that they\u2019ve been piling up backlog growth now for four years and that is going to materialize, it just tended to be as we did further analysis, it was a longer term contract, but mathematically as we went through with the team, if they can continue this rate that we\u2019ve seen and they do have a very good deal structure going into the second quarter. Simply the math would suggest that they should be able to get back to this low single digit kind of 2% constant currency revenue growth and with that with all of the work that they have done on their cost base, which they do so well they should get a lot of leverage of that capability in the second half.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Keith. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. You may ask your question.","Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott","Hi, I just wanted to kind of follow-up on that, the last question that was asked, in the services business do you feel like you fully turn the corner there, and do you expect the backlog to grow, I know you\u2019ve given some commentary on the business growing, and then finally can you quantify or help us understand the margin impact as you become more profitable on the GTS side?","Mark Loughridge","Well, I think when you look across those services business they have done a very good job of kind of delivering on the margin capability even through more challenging revenue quarters. So the key ingredient I think to continue that margin performance is getting back to revenue performance in the second half of the year. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say we turned the corner on growth I think we\u2019ve got to get to the second half to see the growth, but it\u2019s pretty encouraging if you can see, 5% growth in the constant currency backlog when you\u2019re talking about $141 billion of that. I mean that\u2019s a lot of backlog to move in a quarter. So that\u2019s the number one point I would make on that. But number two, we had a lot of deals in the services side of the business across that date line as well end of the second. So they certainly did not believe the pie just establishing this level of performance at the first quarter, they should have based on the deals based on the trajectory, a lot of opportunities to have another very good quarter.","Now, obviously within next quarter, mainframe or software or services, you have to close the deals, you go to win and you got to win in the customer office, so, that dimension of course, but within that the opportunity to do well in the second quarter I think is certainly there and that should drive second quarter revenue performance.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Joe. Operator, let\u2019s take one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. You may ask you question.","Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you very much. And Mark, just a quick follow-up; on the service side, where do we take a look at the backlog and or the signing, can you help us understand about, were those improvements that you saw, are they concentrated on a couple of customers that were larger in size or they\u2019re just scattered amongst a lot of smaller ones and maybe what geographic locations that you saw on backlog and signings?","Mark Loughridge","Well, I think the best answer, when you look at the content underneath that, I mean we had, it wasn\u2019t like one content. We had 22 deals over 100 million, so there is a lot of flow in those deals and there was a lot of flow on the GTS side, there was lot of flow on the GBS side. This was not just one deal. It was well distributed. We had 22 deals over 100 million, there is a lot of deals over 100 and it was across the geography. So I think that was good performance.","So now let me make a few comments to wrap up the call. We are clearly not immune from changes in the global economy. We have a good set of plans and actions to achieve our objective of at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the year. First, our sales team need to close those rollover transactions that we discussed. Second, we\u2019re going to regain our position in the growth markets and the growth markets team need to lead that. I mean if you look at the metrics right now, it clearly points in GMU to that mid-single digit constant currency performance and mainly to get that back on track.","Third, we\u2019re going to rebalance our workforce to better align our resources to opportunity. Fourth, reposition Power to address the Linux space. And five, capitalize on our flash technologies and storage node. Clearly those last two will take some time, it\u2019s not going to all prop back in the second quarter, but it should give us a better trajectory as we go through the year.","We\u2019re managing our business to be successful over the long-term. So not only did these actions support our view of the year, but they\u2019re part of a model that continues transformation as we move towards the 2015 roadmap objective of at least $20 of operating EPS. So thanks again for joining us, and now as always get back to work."],"11746":["International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) Q3 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call October 20, 2014  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Patricia Murphy - VP, IR","Martin Schroeter - SVP and CFO","Ginni Rometty - Chairman, President and CEO","Analysts","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","Steve Milunovich - UBS","Jim Suva - Citi","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Operator","","Welcome and thank you for standing by.

As you know, Ginni is IBM's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.","First, Martin will go through our prepared remarks and then Ginni and Martin will take your questions. The prepared remarks will be available in roughly an hour, and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I'll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

You will find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation, and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Martin Schroeter.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks Patricia. We've a lot to cover today, our third performance, actions that accelerate the transformation of our business, including important announcements that impact our results and the basis of our reporting, our 2014 guidance and what it means as we move into 2015. Let me start with the top level results.","We reported revenue of $22.4 billion, which is down 4% or 2% at constant currency, excluding our customer care divestiture. We delivered operating net income of $3.7 billion and earnings per share of $3.68, all excluding the discontinued semiconductor manufacturing business. These results fell short of our expectations and I would attribute the shortfall to three primary drivers.","First, our software revenue was weaker than expected. We had some sales execution issues and in addition we've made it easier for our clients to manage their IBM software capacity across new and more traditional workloads as they invest in our platform for the longer term. I'll expand on this later.","Second, we didn't get the productivity required in our services business, impacting both our profit and margin and third, the environment including currency isn\u2019t helping.","With a sharp movement in currency rates in September, there was some effect in the quarter and we expect it to have a larger impact going forward and for the business overall, we did see a slowdown in September, which had a particular impact on us given the skew of our transactional business.","I'll get into the details of the quarter shortly, but let me first describe the actions we are taking and put them into context. For some time now, we've been clear about our strategic direction and how we address the market shifts around data, cloud and engagement. All of this year, we've been launching initiatives and making significant investments to drive this shift.","We've been very successful, with strong revenue growth in our strategic imperatives and you'll see in our third quarter results that the strategic imperatives again delivered double-digit revenue growth, but some of these fundamental shifts in the industry are happening faster than we planned.","So we're putting in place a series of actions to accelerate our transformation. I want to address these right up front. First, we're continuing to remix to higher value. We just took a bold step in our transformation going fabless with the divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing business.","We have world-class technologist and intellectual property, but this is a capital intensive business, which has been challenging for us without scale. With future node progression and the potential transition to larger wafer sizes, the capital requirements will substantially increase.","Global foundries will acquire our Microelectronics business and will become the semiconductor technology provider for our future systems. This agreement leverages the strength of each company.","IBM semiconductor and material science research, development capabilities and leadership in high end systems and global foundries leadership in advanced technology manufacturing at scale and commitment to delivering future semiconductor technologies enabling them to address new business opportunities.","With global foundries operating at scale, we'll get supply at market based pricing for the long term and we'll exit a business that was not only capital intensive, but also a drag on our profit. Clearly, this is the right move for our business for the long term.","Also in January, we announced the sale of our x86 business to Lenovo and earlier this month, we completed the initial closing. This was a $4 billion business for us in 2013 with effectively no annual profit.","With the transaction, IBM and Lenovo have formed a strategic alliance, which includes an agreement for Lenovo to resell selected IBM storage and software products and to ensure a smooth transition for our clients, IBM will provide x86 related maintenance on Lenovo's behalf.","We'll continue to remix our portfolio by investing in higher value areas and making decisions on businesses that no longer support our high value strategy. Second, we're implementing changes that make it easier to consume our capabilities and innovations and increase our agility.","We're creating vertically integrated units to address key growth areas. As we did with Watson earlier this year, we're creating a dedicated business unit for cloud and other integrated units to address growth areas like security and smarter commerce.","This enables more focused investment and improves our integration and speed in bringing solutions to the market and with our clients.","We're also providing more flexibility to clients in the way they buy our software. Specifically, we're accelerating investments to make our software more directly consumable through digital channels, but we'll have an end-to-end digital sales and marketing channel, which will improve our reach.","Third, we're taking additional actions to simplify our structure and accelerate productivity. For example to improve productivity and services, which at the same time providing greater value and innovation to our clients, we're implementing a number of actions.","These include accelerating the use of automation in our data centers and being more aggressive in our use of global delivery skills and intellectual property across our service lines. Let me tell you what these actions do for our financial model.","In the near term, our revenue will be down, not surprising since the three divestitures this year represent about $7 billion of revenue with pretax losses of about $500 million. So clearly we'll have improved margin profile.","These actions also free up our spend and capital to be reinvested to areas that will accelerate our transformation and these allow us to continue to provide very strong returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","All of this is consistent with our strategic directions and while there are impacts in the short term, we've improved our position for the longer term.","I want to spend a minute on the high level financial implications of the two most recent transactions. We've posted additional information in two articles on our Investor portal.","For the System x business, as I mentioned, this was over a $4 billion business for us last year. Though the business is breakeven on an annual basis, the transactional skew would have driven profit in the fourth quarter.","Starting in the fourth quarter this year, we'll no longer have the System x hardware revenue and profit and the related maintenance will be at a lower revenue and profit level, reflecting the new relationship. At an IBM level, this will result in about a four point impact of revenue growth over the next four quarters, but an improved margin profile.","Our fourth quarter results will include the gain on sale associated with the countries closed net of related transaction and performance based cost. This net gain, as well as the operational profit we lose in the fourth quarter will be included in our view of the full year, which I'll talk about later in the call.","Free cash flow will be impacted by two items, accounts payable for the balances at closing as well as the future procurement IBM will perform on Lenovo's behalf and for cash tax payments made in 2015.","We estimate this will be a use of cash of approximately $0.5 billion in the fourth quarter and another $0.5 billion in 2015.","Turning to the Microelectronics business, the 2013 OEM revenue associated with the divested business was $1.4 billion and our STG segment included pretax losses for this business of over $700 million.","This is being reported as a discontinued operation. In the third quarter disc-ops will include both losses from the ongoing operations of about $90 billion after tax and a one-time after tax charge of $3.3 billion, associated with the transaction.","The transaction had no impact to free cash flow in the third quarter. Now let me spend a minute on the reporting structure.","All of our results obviously start with GAAP, which is in the middle of the chart. To the left is a reference to our prior definition of operating results, which we introduced a few years ago to provide a better perspective on the operational performance of our business. This presentation excluded non-operating retirement related and acquisition related items.","Operating results is the basis of our 2015 roadmap objective and we've provided a view of our results on this basis since 2011. This definition of operating results no longer exists.","Now moving to the right side of the chart, with the reporting of our Microelectronics business as a discontinued operation, all of the financial impacts of that business are lifted out of each line of our P&L and reported in one line, loss on discontinued operations net of tax.","Starting in the third quarter, our GAAP P&L will be on a continuing operations basis. We'll make the same non-operating adjustments to determine our operating results. Then are operating results definition will now be continuing operations basis. This is the basis for our third quarter and year-to-date results, all historical periods presented and our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year.","So now let me get into the third quarter results and again, these are all operating results, which exclude the discontinued operations. We delivered $3.7 billion of operating net income on revenue of $22.4 billion. Revenue was down 4% or 2% at constant currency, excluding the divested customer care business.","On that constant currency basis services was flat, our software segment declined 2% and systems and technology revenue was down double-digit. 90 days ago, we expected that currency would be a modest help to our revenue growth, but in September we saw a sharp move in the currency markets. I'll talk more about currencies later.","Our margins were down with weak hardware performance and insufficient productivity and services. We had a tax headwind of three points year-to-year and we generated $3.7 billion of net income in the quarter. On the bottom line, we reported operating EPS of $3.68, which is down 10%.","Looking at our free cash flow, we generated $2.2 billion, which was relatively flat year-to-year.","Turning to revenue by geography, when you look at the year-to-year performance at constant currency, major markets decelerated two points from last quarter and growth markets one point. These results aren\u2019t normalized for the customer care divestiture. Both major and growth markets are impacted by a point of growth, consistent with last quarter.","As I mentioned earlier, we saw a deceleration in September. This is true in nearly all regions and was most pronounced in our growth markets that have a higher transactional content. Within the growth markets, we again had double-digit growth in Latin America, led by Brazil and good growth in the Middle East and Africa region.","I think it's important to understand the impact of the System x divestiture on the geographic results going forward. Given the geography mix of that business, major markets growth will be impacted by about three points and growth markets by about nine points.","Reporting our divested semiconductor business as a discontinued operation will adjust the OEM revenue, but not impact the geographic results.","Turning to the segment perspective, I'll cover the revenue drivers when we get into the segment discussions. Looking at the gross profit in total, our operating gross margin was down 90 basis points driven by margin declines and systems and technology and in both of our services segments.","The six point decline in systems and technology was due to a combination of lower margin across the brands and a mix away from higher margin z due to the product cycle.","In global technology services, we did get the savings from the workforce rebalancing actions we took earlier in the year and we continue to make investments in capacity and skills, but we didn't get the base productivity we had planned through automation and the transition on some new contracts took longer than expected.","In global business services, we had strong growth with good margin performance in the strategic imperatives, but in the more traditional back office implementations, we continue to see price pressure.","Our total operating expense and other income was up 2% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the 12 months drove two points of expense growth and currency drove one point. The base expense, which is total expense less the impact of acquisitions and currency was essentially flat.","Within our base expense, we've been shifting our spending to drive our strategic imperatives and differentiated offerings and with the actions we're taking, we'll accelerate that shift. There are few items that are impacting the year-to-year expense dynamics.","First, we increased our accounts receivable reserves, which impacted expense by over $70 million year-to-year. This coverage is now at 2.2%, which is up from a year ago, but not as high as 2009 levels.","Second, as you would expect; our accrual for 2014 variable compensation is down relative to where we were at the end of the first half. However the reduction in the quarter was not as substantial as last year and so across cost and expense, this element was up $230 million year-to-year.","Finally I want to spend a minute on the impact of currency. The dollar appreciated dramatically in the last several weeks of the quarter and as you know when the dollar appreciates broadly against other currency, it impacts our revenue and earnings.","What is unusual about this is not just the sharp move, but the movements were nearly all in an unfavorable direction for our business profile. We hedge a portion of our cross border cash flows, which as you know differs the impact of the currency movement, but doesn\u2019t eliminate it.","While our hedges are designed to provide stability around the receipt of cash, there no year-to-year benefit in the income statement when a currency's direction is sustained over a longer period.","Looking at the third quarter, we had a modest impact of profit from currency. However at current spot rates, we would expect a significant impact of fourth quarter and into 2015. Now let's turn to the segments and we'll start with services.","This quarter, combined services generated $13.7 billion in revenue, which was flat year-to-year at constant currency adjusted for the customer care divestiture.","Services pretax profit was down 13% year-to-year. Total backlog was $128 million. Adjusting for the divested business and currency, total backlog was down 2% year-to-year.","Global Technology Services revenue was $9.2 billion, down 3% as reported, but up 1% at constant currency, adjusted for the divestiture. In the third quarter we ramped on the SoftLayer acquisition and it continues to attract new workloads to the platform.","We're expanding our footprint, and in the third quarter we opened cloud data centers in London and Toronto as well as two federal data centers outside of Dallas and Washington DC. We also added cloud capacity in Singapore.","GTS outsourcing grew 2% at constant currency, adjusted for the divestiture. That growth was driven by IT outsourcing performance from the substantial new contracts we brought on in 2013. GTS pretax profit declined 11% in the quarter.","While we continue to benefit from the rebalancing action earlier this year, this was more than offset by the investments across our portfolio in areas like new resiliency centers, additional security skills and the SoftLayer cloud hub expansion.","The loss profit associated with the divested customer care business and we didn't get sufficient productivity in the base. Part of this is due to the large deals we signed last year, which have lower margins in the early stages and we didn't execute those transitions as rapidly as expected.","Global Business services revenue was $4.5 billion down 1% at constant currency. Consulting and Systems Integration declined 1% year-to-year and was flat at constant currency.","We had strong double-digit growth in our practices that are highly differentiated in the marketplace, which address cloud, analytics, mobile and social, offset by declines in the areas that are becoming less differentiated such as the more traditional back office implementations.","During our last call, we discussed our strategic partnership with Apple to deliver a new class of enterprise ready MobileFirst business applications for iOS, combining mobility and analytics. This quarter, we will launch the first dozen applications.","Application outsourcing was down 6% at constant currency, reflecting modest sequential improvement. Our performance continues to be impacted by pricing pressure and client renegotiations as well as a reduction in elective projects.","GBS pre-tax profit was down year-to-year. Hereto we got the benefit from the previous workforce rebalancing actions, but it was more than offset by couple of factors. Lower revenue on a relatively fixed cost base and where we have strong differentiation such as our solutions that address the strategic comparatives we get good growth and margin performance.","But in parts of our portfolio that aren\u2019t as well differentiated, we're continuing to see price and profit pressure. These are the areas where we'll be more aggressive on the use of global delivery centers and applying intellectual property for faster time to value for our clients and improved business results for us.","Software revenue of $5.7 billion was down 2% and middleware was flat. We had solid growth in many of our solution areas like security and mobile and cloud. Across our software brands, Software-as-a-Service offerings were up nearly 50%. But overall software results didn\u2019t meet our expectations.","First, we clearly had some sales execution issues and second given our client's substantial investment in the IBM Software platform we've been providing more flexibility on how they deploy our software with economics that enable their mobile and social work loads on our platforms.","This enables them to better manage their capacity and commit to our platforms for the long term. This will drive higher utilization of our middleware as these mobile and social platforms drive additional on-premise work load.","Looking at our results by brand, WebSphere had another good quarter, up 7%, but by commerce, mobile solutions and business integration offerings. Both on-premise and SaaS offerings contributed to WebSphere growth, with the majority of growth continuing to come from on-premise solutions.","In commerce we saw broad-based growth with strong momentum in commerce as a service, which includes our recent acquisitions such as Silverpop and Aspera.","Across offer and services, IBM\u2019s mobile business more than doubled from the prior year. Information management software was down 5% where we were impacted by our sales execution challenges and some product transitions.","Tivoli revenue was up 3% at constant currency, driven by security and storage software. Security once again grew at a double digit rate. Workflow solutions grew 1% with growth in our social and collaboration solutions mitigated by decline in notes. Rational software was down 12% facing a tough compare.","Across software, we are transitioning our portfolio to capture growth areas. We continue to drive innovation in our core franchises and we will be accelerating investments to make our software more consumable through digital channels.","Systems and Technology revenue of $2.4 billion was down 15%. This reflects the product cycle of System z, and declines in Power, Storage and System x where both power and storage improved sequentially.","We got a lot done recently, including the initial closing on the sale of our industry standard server business to Lenovo, an agreement to divest our semiconductor manufacturing business to Global Foundries and the introduction of our first OpenPOWER based scale out system.","Looking in our results by brand System z revenue was down 35% now in the ninth quarter of the current product cycle. We continue to innovate on this platform and as an example we have recently made available new analytics offerings for the mainframe to provide real time customer insights. With this, IBM adds new analytic capabilities to the mainframe platform, providing clients with the ability to integrate Hadoop big data.","Power revenue declined 12%, which is a significant sequential improvement in year-to-year performance. We have repositioned power. We introduced scale-out systems based on POWER8 in June, and earlier this month we announced high end POWER8 based enterprise systems. These systems are highly scalable and can handle the most data-intensive mission-critical applications in the industry.","In addition, we saw continued expansion of the OpenPOWER consortium now with over 60 members. Through the efforts of consortium members, we have for the first time introduced a system built on IBM\u2019s POWER8 processor that tightly integrates IBM and other OpenPOWER member technologies including end videos, GPU accelerator technology.","Our System x revenue was down 10% and this of course was last quarter before the divestiture. Storage hardware revenue was down 6%, sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter.","We again saw strong contribution from our FLASH systems and our store wise portfolio. This was more than offset by weakness in high-end disk and the continued wind down of our legacy OEM business. We see value in the storage business shifting to software and this quarter, our storage software grew.","We will continue to expand our software defined storage portfolio. So across our systems and technology business, we've taken significant actions to reposition our portfolio and maintain our commitment to driving innovation in our high-end systems and storage.","We committed $3 billion of investment in the next era of chip technology as we strengthen our semiconductor research and development and systems innovation with future chip supply coming from an at scale provider.","We repositioned power through creation of our POWER8 systems, which are built for cloud and big data and also made available the POWER8 architecture through the OpenPOWER consortium to build an open ECO system and an IP Play. We are repositioning storage to capture values through software defined environments and we divested our low end System x business","Moving on to cash flow in the quarter, we generated $3.2 billion of cash from operations, excluding our global financial receivables. We invested a $1 billion in Cap-EX and we generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow, which was down 60 million year-to-year. This includes a $300 million year-to-year increase in cash tax payments.","Through the first three quarter of the year, our net cash from operations excluding financing receivables of $8.6 billion was down $700 million year-to-year. Within that, our cash tax payments were up $1.5 billion year-to-year.","We invested $2.8 billion in capital expenditures, which was up about $100 million from last year. This includes about $350 million investment in software. So this was a good example of where we are shifting spending in the base to new areas. The free cash flow was $5.8 billion down $800 million or up $700 million excluding the impact from cash tax.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.6 billion. Our total assets reflect a reduction of more than $1.5 billion associated with the semiconductor transaction. This concludes a non-cash charge for fixed assets and an increase in deferred tax assets.","Total debt was $45.7 billion, which includes just over $28.5 billion in support of our financing business. We target global financing leverage to be in the range of 7.0 to 7.2 to 1 and we do not have plans to change this model. However, the late quarter impact of foreign exchange on equity was the main driver of the leverage being slightly elevated 7.4 versus our model.","Our non-financing debt was $17.1 billion and our non-financing debt to cap was 62%. While the semiconductor manufacturing divestitures does not affect that levels it does impact equity by approximately $3.3 billion resulting in a seven point impact of the debt to cap ratio. At these levels we continue to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term.","Before we ramp up, I want to spend a minute on the performance of our strategic imperatives that address the areas of data, cloud and the way our clients are engaging.","We have a broad analytics portfolio that helps our clients to extract value from their data. This is a large business for us with revenues last year of $16 billion.","Through September our business analytics revenue was up 8% this year with the strongest growth coming from GBS. Our cloud portfolio support the full scope of enterprise client cloud requirement including solution for private clouds, hybrid clouds and public clouds. Our revenue was up over 50% year to date.","Our as-a-service component was up over 80% and we existed the third quarter with an annual run rate of $3.1 billion. Addressing engagement on year-to-date basis, our mobile revenue more than doubled, our social offerings returned to growth with double-digit growth in the third quarter and our security revenue was up over 20%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and security. Together the revenue in our strategy imperatives was up double-digits and about half of the content was in software.","Now let me bring all of this back together. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we're driving the shift toward our strategic imperatives. Earlier this year, we created a Watson Unit and committed a $1 billion to bring Watson cognitive capabilities to the enterprise.","We launched the BlueMix. We're globally expanding our SoftLayer cloud data centers and we formed a partnership with Apple for enterprise mobility. Now as we exit the third quarter, we're making it easier to do business with us, including creating vertically integrated units to address key growth areas and making our software more consumable through digital channel.","We're taking additional actions to drive more productivity and increase the agility of our company and while we invest the drive for the growth areas, we're also aggressively moving away from the businesses that don\u2019t fit our strategic profile.","The sale of our x86 business and the divestiture of our Microelectronic business are the two most recent examples. Earlier this year, we divested our Customer Care BPO business and as I mentioned, the revenue from these three businesses were $7 million in 2013 and in aggregate, they incurred of pretax loss of more than $500 million, all supporting the shift to higher value.","So let me spend a minute on our view of the full-year. As I said earlier, our operating results are moving to a continuing operations basis. So they exclude the financials associated with the semiconductor business in the current and prior periods.","So when we reflect the discontinued operations in the base, our full-year 2013 operating EPS was $16.64 versus $16.28 based on the prior definition. Within this new operating definition, we've considered a number of items in our guidance for 2014.","First we have completed the initial closing of the sale of our System-X business and as we said, we will no longer have the revenue and profit associated with that business. But in the fourth quarter we will report a gain on the sale, net of related deal and performance based cost.","That net gain will contribute about $0.75 of earnings per share, but that does not reflect a loss profit in the fourth quarter. Additionally, as we execute some of our plans to drive simplification and accelerate productivity in our business, we expect to take a workforce rebalance charge in the fourth quarter.","We are striating to work through our plans, but at this point, we would expect to take a charge of up to $600 million. We've also had a dramatic move in currencies. We've taken into account an impact based on current spot rates. We will see how that plays out.","And of course we've considered the rate and pace of business coming out of the third quarter including the environment. As I noted, we saw slowdown in September in the fourth quarter as our largest transaction quarter.","Put all of this together and we expect full year 2014 operating EPS to be down between 2% and 4% and that's off of last year\u2019s computable base of $16.64.","Given that reduced outlook for earnings, we see a comparable impact of free cash flow for the year. As I mentioned, we can estimate the x86 divestiture impact at about $0.5 billion in the quarter and so with that included, we see free cash flow for the year between $12 and $13 billion at this level of income. Of course this doesn\u2019t include the gain from the divestiture.","Looking forward to 2015, we've always considered a few factors as we look at the progress toward our 2015 objective. The trajectory of the business including the macro environment, the investments we need to be successful over the longer term in enterprise IT and our return of capital to shareholders. Two of these have now changed. The trajectory of the business and the timing of investments we need to make.","Of course it remains a priority to return significant value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Given our third quarter performance, the actions we're taking and with only 15 months till the end of 2015, we longer expect to deliver $20 operating earnings per share in 2015. As is our practice, we will provide our view of 2015 in January.","In the mean time, we have a clear and compelling strategy and we're accelerating our implementation. We will continue to manage our business for the long term and we will absolutely continue to return significant value to our shareholders.","Ginni I look forward to your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I would like to mention a few items. First we have supplemental chart at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information.","As Martin mentioned earlier, we've also posted articles to our Investor website that contain additional information on the two transactions discussed today. Second I would ask you to refrain from multipart questions. And finally I want to remind you that Ginni Rometty has joining today's Q&A.","Operator, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we would like to begin the question-and-answer session of the conference (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Sir, please check your mute button.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Sorry, can you hear me now.","Operator","Yes sir. Go ahead.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Okay great, thanks. I have a bit of a broader question. Obviously, there is a lot of new inflow here. So I am trying to understand or clarify how we should think about the unifying theme here for the shortfalls you are seeing.","The challenges that really began in 2013 were primarily centered on the growth market. Can you talk about how much of your current challenges are still centered on that issue and how much of it is now is well beyond just a geographic problem at this time.","And I guess related to that, how are you thinking about the potential for stability and growth markets and what that would do for your turnaround potential in 2015? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. Thanks Bill. I guess from a unifying theme perspective, the theme that we've been talking about since 2013 is both the secular and cyclical challenges we had in our hardware business and we talked about the profit loss year-to-year last year.","Now relative to the growth markets, that hardware business has slight of assortment outsized effect because it does represent a more of the business there than what we see in the major market.","So that theme within their current results continues despite the actions we've taken within the hardware business to reposition that. We are not yet seeing the benefits -- all of the benefits of that repositioning.","So as we've talked about, we've repositioned power. We have divested of the X series business. We will ramp on the Z series cycle if you will, that's the cyclical element of this.","So the ongoing theme of the hardware business continues and it does have an outsized impact on the growth markets. Now relative to the growth market, specifically the one other point I would make is that there is not a homogeneity around the performance of these growth markets.","What we saw in the growth markets is a continuation of what I would call desperate revenue performance. So Brazil continues to do well. China continues to decline as that hardware business affects them fairly substantially. India declined in the quarter.","What we see in the third quarter was where we have heavy transactional content we tended to have a much bigger decline in that September month. So again the unifying theme around hardware continues and specifically in the growth markets, we're seeing the disparity of performance continue and September impacted those transactional business much more dramatically.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Bill. Can we go to next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Beyond what\u2019s already been announced, what are the paths to accelerated transformation going forward? Are there additional assets sales on the table and also how likely is it that we see more transformative acquisitions going forward?","Martin Schroeter","Well, I guess I would say a couple of things Katy. First, we do invest at a high level every year. Already we spend as you know about $4 billion in capital. We spent $5.5 billion in research and development as examples and we remain acquisitive.","We've had a number of acquisitions this year to solidify if you will the core capabilities we filled around our strategic comparative. So when we think about accelerating the shift, think about it from a SoftLayer prospective for instance.","We said earlier in the year, we put about $1.2 billion into capital into SoftLayer to expand their footprint around the world now. We're not going to add over $1 billion to our overall capital bill. We'll probably wind up adding just a few $100 million year-to-year, but again, we're shifting that into the SoftLayer business and that shift happens over time.","And we think we have a pretty good set of facts around why and how that's working. So you saw again this quarter how the double-digit growth in our strategic imperatives. So as that shift happens over time, we've been able to shift. Now we're going to accelerate that and rebalancing our skill is an element or a means by which we can accelerate that shift.","So yes, we will remain acquisitive. We still believe we have the core capabilities for our view of enterprise IT around data and cloud and engagement build and so we'll continue to add capabilities around those. But our core capabilities are in place. We do invest at a very high level and so we'll just accelerate the means by which we're shifting.","Patricia Murphy","Okay. Thank you, Katy. Can we please go to the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein","Yes. Thank you. I have a question for Ginni. Ginni, IBM is missing its free cash flow goal this year by $3 billion to $4 billion, which certainly in investor's eyes is a really significant margin.","The announced actions feel not that different quite frankly from what IBM has been doing for the last 10 years ongoing restructuring, organizational changes and select dispositions in the migration to a higher margin businesses.","So I guess my question for you is do you think this time is different in the sense that do you view the current results as effectively a crisis at IBM and how do to gauge this magnitude of disappointment.","And given that, do you believe that your responses should be outsized and different from what you\u2019ve done historically and do you believe they are because certainly at the surface, they feel somewhat consistent with what you\u2019ve done before.","Ginni Rometty","Okay Tony, look, let's just back up one second and first let me get the context. As you said, does this time feel different? And so as you and we and I've talked with all our investors, this time in this industry is different, all right with these three shifts all going on at once. So it is unprecedented change, which then leads to your question.","There is no doubt look in this quarter and part of the reason I am on the call, obviously we were disappointed in this quarter, but when we talk about what we're doing for the long term and these actions, these actions go on the heels of what has been a series of what I think are very bold actions from the entire year with a very clear strategy, one that's around moving to the enterprise IT to the era of cloud; one that's around data and analytics for transforming our client's industries and professions and then social, mobile and I can't underscore enough security.","So when you step back and look at the full year, when we said these will reorder our industry and therefore we've got to reinvent ourselves like we've done in prior generations, but it will be around these things and just go back to January, Watson, $1 billion investment to start the Group.","As Martin just talked about $1.2 billion to extend our data centers, 25 to 40 for cloud then a $1 for Bluemix. It is a platform, a platform-as-a-service that will provide a platform for innovation for many years to come.","Not to mention the POWER8 having been redone developed bottom up for data and cloud, then $3 billion of research and development for semiconductors that secure our long-term future, not to mention what we did with Apple, with SAP, which are really a fundamental change in partnering strategy that not only apply to Apple and SAP, they really point to us being the go to enterprise that people come to and how to change and how to enter into the enterprise business along with having divested as you just heard as you well know $7 billion of revenue, which by the way was at a loss, $500 million loss right. So empty calories as some of my investors would say.","And then the re-profiling of the STG business. So on the heels of those bold actions, these are three more that can sit, that continue and I consider them quite bold. The idea of cloud altogether integrated verticals and then not to underestimate this point about speed and what we're doing.","In fact, I am going to really sort of punctuate this point on speed, these divestitures do give us some opportunity to go ahead and simplify the business and remove layers. Make no mistake, that's important because the strategies correct and now it's our speed of execution that needs to continue to improve.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. Can we please go the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays","Yeah, thanks a lot. Quick question I guess for both of you. I wanted to talk about earnings power. I am an old free cash flow guy call me antiquated, but the free cash flow has been averaging let's call it between $12 and $14 last two years.","Your guidance now is about $12.40 if I take the midpoint and you're still reporting EPS and guiding for EPS at $16 plus and we've just had obviously a major setback here and usually when we're dealing with IBM, we've a roadmap and all those things to kind of guide us, but in my training, free cash flow EPS usually migrates towards free cash flow.","So it seems like you have -- the lot of increased investments and what not that are going to keep the free cash flow low for some time, so I guess I wanted your view of earnings power and could we see flat to down EPS for several years now as these two numbers meet in the middle or is the EPS set to have growth from this $16 level despite free cash flow being significantly below. Thanks a lot.","Martin Schroeter","Sure Ben. Thanks for the question. A couple of points. First from a free cash flow standpoint and your data that you just quoted, I won't re-hash it, but with the cash tax headwind this year, which we've talked about in the past, that's obviously an impact and the way the Lenovo transaction is structured has a free cash flow impact not only in the fourth quarter of this year, but that will carry through a little bit to next year as well.","In terms of capital investment requirements and what we need going forward, as I mentioned on Katy's question, we'll grow -- we'll grow capital where we see opportunity and the software example is a good one, but in total, I would expect that our capital requirements to be fairly flat to up a little bit. They won't change dramatically going forward.","And so once we get through some of these -- some of these impacts if you will, some of these headwinds on the cash line, I think we'll have in our relationship that is more like what you're used to from us.","Now there are some other impacts that will affect if you will the ratios as opposed to the free cash flow alone. So as an example, you noted the earnings number on an earnings per share.","Now that has obviously the gain from the Lenovo transaction in it, but that goes into the investing section of free cash flow. It doesn\u2019t go into the free cash flow area. So there are some other impacts or some other dynamics around the free cash flow in the near term that are going to impact those ratios.","The balance sheet itself -- when we look at the balance sheet itself, it looks -- it looks as though it's tracking. When you start and once you make some of these -- once you recognize some of the adjustments that we made, it was the balance sheet itself is continuing to track to the profitability and we would expect that to continue as well.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Ben. Christine, can we please take the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","Thank you. Martin I can appreciate the comments you were making earlier about the hardware business and the impact that it's had on earnings and cash flow; however, you obviously have two very big important businesses beyond that both services and software.","And I guess specifically in software, you had a pretty easy comparison this year and I am wondering if you could just better help us understand exactly what the issues are in software and what you mean by making software more consumable through digital channels and how that's going to impact the business?","Martin Schroeter","Sure David. A couple of things on software, first when we say more consumable through digital channels, when we look at how the world is evolving in terms of how our clients will try, will then buy, a lot of that's moving into a model where they essentially have it through like what we have with our Bluemix or our store if you will, our platform that allows them to try and get access to Bluemix.","So if you haven\u2019t looked at our Bluemix content yet, I would encourage you to get a sense of what we mean by moving to a more digital engagement.","On software specifically on performance, we did see as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see a slowdown in September and that was true in software as well and obviously the software performance has a pretty profound impact on our profit given the margin.","Within software when we looked at our performance, you saw that our WebSphere business continued to grow. It did reasonably well. Our SaaS business, our software-as-a-service business across all of software continue to do well.","Where we had a bit of a struggle was in our IM business, in our Information Management business. Some of that's due to product transitions and some of it as we said in the call is the way we're providing flexibility around our clients as they engage in these enterprise license agreements as they engage to try to manage their capacity requirements.","So again, the software performance impacted certainly in September, but not uniformly we did have pretty good growth in -- as I mentioned in WebSphere and some challenges in IM business, but disappointing as we said, a disappointing quarter for us in software.","Patricia Murphy","Okay. Thank you, David. Can we please go to the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steve Milunovich - UBS","Thank you. Ginni, thanks for joining us today. A question for you. I believe you recently took some of your executives out to the Valley and I know when I go out, I generally come back pretty depressed, they all argue of course they're going to disrupt the large companies that the large companies basically have to break up. There is an inevitability to the difficulties that companies like IBM face.","I was curious what you took away from that if you feel better or worse about IBM's ability to come back and conversely our survey suggests a lot of your customers do want IBM to help them to move forward, but I think investors are concerned that you won't get a lot of these new companies who do start out with a different kind of infrastructure. I wonder if you could comment on that.","Ginni Rometty","Okay. That's a great question Steven. From a couple of different perspectives, first I've out there many times actually. So not even just one and you take a look at our software business and I think this is actually an important point as we've moved not only Watson, but software itself to be a platform for innovation for many companies.","And so what we are finding is that many are very interested in software and software runs some of the most interesting start-up companies that there are. So on one hand, it's about providing them with infrastructure, but then Bluemix and this platform as a service and then the idea that Watson as a platform, which as you know the very different approach we've taken already 3,000 of those partners are in line to get on to Watson, many of those from the West Coast.","So that's one set of messages I pick up that pertain from our what I would call the start-up, but to your other question I think as well an equally interesting to our current client base, I was with 30 CIOs of our biggest clients, just the tail end of last week and to me it was very interesting to hear them talk about what they really need and are going to need even more of our help from.","And if the one -- of all that one of them called being a navigator that there are many of these startups out there and that's interesting for innovation and I agree.","Every company will do some innovation and many of these are cloud companies and the like, but at the end of the day this gets integrated with how their businesses operate today and you can see this now sort of peaking into a point to say, hey look, you are the one that understand how an enterprise operates and how we should pull all this together.","This is a wonderful opportunity for us and it really matches and I believe we've placed the right bet when we said in cloud one of the most important attributes would be hybrid and that's idea of all of us will build businesses part on the cloud. In fact you'll see most of that around things that need to move fast and then you'll have your systems of record.","You'll need to integrate them, that's the world hybrid and we're seeing that play out. That's what people are looking for and that as you know, where we doubled down in creating a lot of capabilities around hybrid in the cloud, about data. We said at the end of the day, it's going to be all about data and it's going to be about security and I believe sure enough all three of those are coming to pass.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. Can we please go to the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks so much. Just wanted to ask a big picture question on people, labor and culture and things like that. I heard words like workforce, rebalancing, it sounds like you're shifting more to global delivery, more automation right in sales and processes.","So what does this all mean for headcount? Could we see a big change in headcount and more importantly what's the impact on culture? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks Tien-Tsin. It's a good question. So a few things, we have -- we have been reducing headcount just as a function of some of the divestitures that we've been in.","So as an example when we divested our customer care business, our headcounts come down and when we finish the x series divestiture, again same kind of pattern. So our overall headcount is obviously down.","From a culture perspective around the shift to -- around the shift to global delivery centers, quite frankly we've not been as aggressive here as others have been. So we think we have an opportunity -- we have an opportunity move more that work to where we can put it into a more common platform.","So yes, the overall -- yes the overall headcount is coming down and yes, we will be moving more aggressively into the global delivery centers, but again we have not been as aggressive as others and then the other thing I point out is that reduction in overall headcount also allows us now to think about how we simplify our business and some of what you heard in my prepared remarks were around trying to simplify the business.","So yes, the overall headcount is coming down and I think what we would expect is not a dramatic shift if you will in the employee base, but just a reflection of what you\u2019ve seen us publicly announce.","Ginni Rometty","Yes and let me Tien-Tsin, let me go ahead and add, I really want to talk about this point on culture because this is something that we've been working on and I think it's again important as part of any reinvention of any company you have to go and match the culture with it.","And I think of a couple defining characteristics of the culture we are building is. One is speed. The second is the word \u201cengagement\u201d and the third Martin just mentioned around simplification. And so make no bones about it on speed with the whole team and as many of you know, I've been on this and with our teams and it's not enough to tell teams about that you need to go faster.","The point is you point them to where we're going to go. We've been very clear about the strategy and then it's also how you work and many people call that agile or DevOps.","It's this kind of speed that comes with you try things, you fail, you correct them, you keep moving forward and that in fact is what we're building around the company in many of the places where we've done that already; great results and we're going to continue down that path.","So I underscore speed and then the second is this idea about engagement, which really our use of social and mobile within our own company. This of that as a production engine that makes things go faster and it's also by the way what we do with commercial clients, but we've done a great deal of work on this topic to allow the IBMers across the 170 countries to both move to the future and move there with speed, this idea of engagement.","And then as I said Martin mentioned simplify, and partly simplifying is this idea of taking layers out, which is what I just talked about a minute ago. So culture is paramount, take away the word speed and engagement.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. Can we please go to the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. You may ask your question.","Jim Suva - Citi","Thanks very much and Ginni, appreciate you coming on the call giving the changes in challenges and what's going on. Maybe if you can help us understand a little bit, when we look at the results geographically, it looks like all geographies were down and some may say it's more of an industry situation, but then when we look at IBM's results and compare them to the peers out there and the contenders who may be unique individual companies, they are all seeing a lot better growth.","So then when they say, it's actually IBM focused challenges, can you help us better understand if you view this more as industry or IBM not being nimble enough or how is you kind of view the value trying to paint the culture in IBM to adjust to this new age and these new three focus areas.","Ginni Rometty","So Jim first let me, when I think about revenue in our company, I think first and foremost about moving us to higher value and so when you think of higher value, as we've clearly staked out this idea around data and analytics, around cloud and around social, mobile and security, I want to take you back and just remember that in this quarter and in fact by the way those collectively grew almost 20% and it's improved every quarter, grown every quarter a higher number.","And you take a look at, they're not small businesses. Big data and analytics which ended last year at what we think $16 million and now this quarter, year-to-date 8% and you take a look at cloud, already greater than 50% year-to-date and I think of how we ended last year what we were about $4.4 billion and the as-a-service was about $2.1 billion.","On a run rate, we just now left or exited the $3.1 billion. If these were individual businesses, they would be very highly applauded for their growth rate and then on social, mobile and security, again eight quarters double-digit and so these are in and of themselves large businesses with very high growth rate.","So I view those compared to their peers in those areas. They're doing quite well. Now when I take a look and you say what do I see overall, now we do at core franchises, core franchises that we've said they do mission critical work.","In many cases, we need to keep innovating on them to improve their margin, but they may not be in growth markets and as you know we just as well added to the growth challenge and no apologies for divesting a revenue that is not high value, not core, we need to redeploy that capital to other things.","This announcement this morning of global foundries is a great example of that right. That is a business that requires a fair amount of capital, but require even more going forward. As you look at what's happened as you go from 20 and use a 10, to seven nanometers, let alone a larger wafer size and so that is someone else's business. They're going to do that well. We're going to redeploy that capital into those growth areas.","So when you think of growth, I want you to keep -- and we keep saying the word mix. We're mixing into what we believe are the areas that are aligned with the shifts in the marketplace and then managing for high value.","Well, I guess one last question or one point I would make kind of on macro that might be of interest, I take a look and as Martin said, I can only speak to what happened in our September as what we saw was both broad based across the world, but clearly in the areas where we were high transaction revenue impacted more, but as well I did see when you look by different industries, I see different industries doing different things.","So as an example financial services very focused on things like omnichannel, cyber security as you might expect. In fact I had a dinner with some of the largest CEOs of all the clients in France and there were two topics we talked about; data analytics and security, the entire four hour dinner.","And so this topic and certainly in cyber -- in cyber itself and then married with when you do omnichannel and the impact you have with channel reach, big in financial services, same in retail. So you see some industries pointed more one way. Others pointed more towards efficiency.","So I do see differences around the world, but again back to that September, just based on what we saw and time will tell whether what we saw is pure execution, we're treating it that way or time will tell whether it was something broader.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. Can we please go to the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Hi. Thank you. My question relates to services and it's a two part question, can you grow services? Outsourcing is about 45% of revenues, services revenues and outsourcing backlog is down about 8% in constant currency, outsourcing signings and constant currency declined 17%, coupled with that, maintenance is about 13% of services revenue continues to decline.","So when you think about that question, I wanted to add on to, why is IBM underperforming Accenture so dramatically? Is this part of the organizational structure so it really, Ginni you mentioned speed and engagement, it seems like IBM continues to underperform. Would IBM be better off with a different organizational structure perhaps even breaking up the company further allowed for greater speed and organization.","So the two part question is can you grow services and then why is IBM underperforming market leader like Accenture so dramatically? Thank you. ","Martin Schroeter","Sure Keith. A couple of things. So in terms of services, we did not have the signings performance that we were looking for. Now we have some pretty big deals. I wouldn\u2019t say that those deals are gone. Those deals are still out there and the teams continue to work them.","There are -- as always, there are series of complexity in a regulatory environment and things. So we had a large pipeline and when we entered and unfortunately because we didn't get them done or fortunately maybe we have a larger pipeline as we exited the quarter as well.","So we did not get the signings that we wanted. Now as we've talked about in the past, within any given quarter, but if I look at it over a longer term, about 70% of our revenue growth is driven by the backlog that we enter a year with and our backlog now adjusted for -- adjusted for the divestiture of our customer care BPO business is down about 2%.","But what we've been seeing is better yield out of that backlog than what we've seen in the past and so a few dynamics. Backlog down a little bit, but with better performance in terms of what we were getting out of the backlog we've done a bit better.","And then on the in quarter signings what we've in the past talked about in terms of base growth, which the way to think about that is sales into existing customers where we already have contracts there are generally two what I call forms of that.","One form is where we are adding more work, deploying more service on their behalf or something of that sort and we did not see that as much as we expected in this quarter and also there are -- some of our contracts have more volume related metrics tied to their performance and we didn't see the volume levels that we had expected.","Now that could be again macro related. So from a services signings perspective and how it feeds in, I would say that we are not relying on in our guidance a dramatic turnaround. That business however does have some pretty strong underpinnings in it with regard to what we saw in the -- in kind of the base strategic outsourcing business, very good signings growth.","Bear in mind that with the divestiture of our customer care BPO business, that GPS business is going to be down obviously because we're not in that business any more. So across services, not the quarter we wanted in signings but some metrics and some dynamics underneath it that are kind of consistent with what we saw coming out of the third quarter.","On our GBS business, very good performance when we move and where we moved to the new areas including front office digitization and things we've talked about.","So very strong performance in the GBS elements of the business where we see the future and in fact the pipeline now is more than half of that future business and also we'll start to see -- we'll start to see the benefit of -- some of the benefit of our partnership with Apple in the GBS business as well as they start to deploy those mobile apps that we're going to announce this quarter.","So the GBS business -- the GBS business is kind of a mix between very strong performance where we move to the future and continued price pressure and profit pressure in that more traditional packaged applications business. It is very price competitive.","The incumbents are -- the incumbents in an account are protecting those accounts and obviously to break in, we're having to be more aggressive. So it's a pretty aggressive environment.","Ginni Rometty","Yes, I will just add a couple of points here in that, one the comment about versus Accenture right, now remember, managing for high value. So when you look at that from a margins point of view, you would say something different and so a couple of things.","As Martin just described where we grow, I think it's important to see in their business, the team has aligned across where the growth areas are and then aligned in other areas where they need to really just focus on efficiency and productivity.","That will allow them to continue to go faster. So as an example, the team is aligned around strategy and analytics together. We just talked about that result. They\u2019ve aligned around what they call mobile and interactive. In fact we put another $100 million into these mobile studios, interactive design studios around the world.","We are now the largest digital agency as measured by Ad Age, not ourselves, the largest digital agency out there. So their strategy and analytics, big practice, big practice around mobile and interactive.","Both of those have very good growth and then I'll just complement it where Martin said, the other two practices ERP and then the other is application development and maintenance and between those you saw pricing pressure on application packages and you saw it as well as you just described it on application and maintenance area.","But I believe the right way to grow, they\u2019ve actually aligned themselves two different formulas and that is the right focus because remember again it's about managing for higher value.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. Can we please go to the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Thank you. Martin, I was hoping you could give us a little more detail on the FX impact specifically. So it was going to get worse in the fourth quarter and continue into 2015. So just hoping you could give us some detail on the magnitude and how that runs through the P&L? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. So as we've talked about in the past and I mentioned on the -- in my prepared remarks as well. As currencies have a kind of a one directional long-term trend here, our hedging programs to help us manage our cash position really have no benefit to the INE anymore.","So it was the sharp move in the third quarter, was relatively small. It was an impact in the quarter, but relatively small to what we see coming in the fourth and next year.","Now this is all based on the most recent exchange rates and we don't know where this is going to wind up, but in the fourth quarter alone, as an example, FX could be up to the $0.25 in EPS on a year-to-year basis just from the moves to date.","So it has a pretty profound impact on our profitability in the near term and again the hedging programs don't have an INE benefit if you will on a year-over-year basis as the currencies continue to move.","Now next year, we'll talk more about next year when we get together in January, but that magnitude of impact is consistent with what we see in the fourth. Again it's a pretty substantial impact to us and as I noted in the prepared remarks, it wasn\u2019t just, but it was a sharp move, it was that interestingly each of the currency seem to work against us.","Most of the time we see some benefits from some of the crosses, some of the cross FXs, but we just did not see that this quarter.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Sherri. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning, guys. So may be just wanted to talk a little bit on the capital -- free cash flow usage as you go forward. We're obviously talking about a bit of a down tic on the free cash flow number, but I am curious how do you view the buyback program as you go forward?","It's only has decelerated in the last few quarters and then when you talk about, excluding your initiatives into the newer IT markets, does that suggest maybe we start to look at more deals or maybe even bigger deals. So maybe if you can start on the buyback and the M&A side of the equation as we go forward?","Martin Schroeter","Sure Amit, sure. So maybe I'll address the acquisition side of this first. We do continue to see ourselves being active. Now our acquisition model, which we think is a powerful one that works quite well for us is really built around a couple of basic principles.","One is that we're not looking to acquire to change if you will who IBM is right. We have a very good position in enterprise IT and our acquisition strategy is to supplement our view of where we see enterprise IT moving around data, cloud and engagement.","Two, we need to in order to drive the economics out of these acquisitions; we need to find things that we can put into our distribution channel immediately and get the -- and start to get the returns immediately and what that tends to me for us then is that acquisitions tend to be smaller because they have not yet fully globalized and we want to take advantage of that by bringing those products out to our clients.","And then three, the basics here and my boss sitting next to me is going to remind me as well, we don\u2019t do what I would call strategic and I\u2019ll do the air quote, strategic acquisition they have to make sense economically and we will continue to make sure that our acquisition content is on a sound economic basis.","In terms of share repurchase, we have been quite aggressive and the share repurchase and the resulting reduction in shares is -- it's fairly linear. It's something we've been doing for a long time. We've been returning capital to shareholders.","The result or the impact is as mentioned fairly linear, so if we were to reduce -- if we were to reduce our share repurchase going forward, it would have a commensurate reduction in how many shares we take obviously.","That\u2019s not going to surprise you, but remember we've been -- since we've been aggressive, we can still have -- going forward, we can still have a very meaningful share reduction even if we were to reduce our levels going forward.","And we feel very comfortable with the capacity and the flexibility we still have to continue to return capital to shareholders both through share repurchase as well as through dividend.","Patricia Murphy","Okay. We've run a little late here. So Christine, why don\u2019t we take one last question.","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your ask your question.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Good morning, I just wanted to be clear what did the chip business lose in 2013 and what are the expectations for loss in 2014? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter - SVP and CFO","","I think. Hi Brian, I think we have provided this detail in the portal article, but just to go through the data, 2013 we had a loss of $700 million on a pretax basis and '14 is basically flat to what we saw in 2013.","Ginni Rometty","Slightly better than that.","Martin Schroeter - SVP and CFO","","Little bit better. So 2013, $700 million loss, 2014 a little bit better and again the details are in the portal.","Ginni Rometty","Okay. So let me -- I think it's probably good time for me then to wrap up here and I would like to make a couple of comments.","And first I would like to just really summarize for everyone why I thought it was important to join the call today. As many of you referenced in your comments, we had two strategically important announcements that we made.","One was this divestiture of the Microelectronic business. It's an important strategic move and very important to us. Martin just commented about some of the financial around it, but it is more than that. It is about strategy.","The second is and the second important reason I wanted to join is, we no longer expect to deliver that 2015 EPS objective, which we have talked about and as you know it has been in place for some time.","But these two things do come together and are underpinned by what I believe is a singularly importantly message to our investors and that we are reinventing and we are managing this company for the long term.","So while make no mistake, our results this quarter were disappointing and we don\u2019t want to minimize that. We have though been very clear that this industry is shifting and we have been executing our strategy that moves this company to the future.","Now I am absolutely convinced that we are over the right target. We see the evidence of it. You see it in the results and analytics, in cloud, in mobile, social and security and we have taken, as I was going through very big steps and bold moves to move this company to higher value and that does include -- it does include divesting businesses that really don\u2019t fit our strategic profile including today's divestiture of Microelectronics.","In fact, I\u2019ve asked you just to keep remembering that the divestitures this year alone represent $7 billion of annual revenue, but revenue that is absolutely with considerable loss this time.","So our company it is fundamentally better positioned than it was a few years ago, but as I said, we have more to do and we need to do it faster.","Now while many things are changing, as I always say to our team, they're changing because they must. There are some things though that will not change and they have not changed and I wanted to end our call on those couple points.","We're going to continue to shift this company and this business to a higher value. We're going to continue to manage this business for the long term and we will continue to deliver significant value to shareholders. In the end I believe these are the principals that are the hallmark of the IBM Company.","So on behalf of Martin and I, let me thank you for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today's call.

I'm here with Martin Schroeter, IBM's Senior Vice President and CFO, Finance and Enterprise Transformation. I want to welcome you to our second quarter earnings presentation.","The prepared remarks will be available in roughly an hour, and replay of this webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I'll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the company's filings with the SEC.

You will find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation, and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Martin Schroeter.","Martin Schroeter","Thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter and first half results reflect the stability of our overall business model, as we transform the company.","Looking at the dynamics of our portfolio, we're continuing to drive double-digit growth in the parts of our business that address the emerging trends in enterprise IT. We had stability in our core franchises, where we continue to drive innovation. We're dealing with secular shifts in parts of our hardware business and as we shift to higher value, we have the impact of a divested business.","Overall, our year-to-year revenue performance improved from last quarter at actual rates and was fairly consistent at constant currency. We expanded margins and we grew earnings per share. The profit dynamics also reflect the actions we've taken to transform our business. I'll get into that shortly.","In the first quarter, you'll remember that we announced a number of initiatives that support the shift to our strategic areas of data, cloud and systems of engagement. These included the launch of Bluemix, which is our cloud platform-as-a service for the enterprise. It included a $1.2 billion investment to globally expand SoftLayer cloud hubs, and it included a $1 billion investment to bring Watson's cognitive capabilities to the enterprise.","In the second quarter, we made progress to implement these initiatives, including in June, Bluemix became generally available. We opened new SoftLayer data centers. We started to ship POWER8, and expanded the OpenPOWER consortium. And we completed substantially all of the divestiture of our customer care business.","More recently, we announced additional actions to continue our shift to higher value. You saw last week that we're investing $3 billion over the next five years in research and in early-stage development to create the next generation of chip technologies. Those will fuel the systems required for cloud, big data and cognitive systems. And just a couple of days ago, IBM and Apple announced a strategic global partnership to provide a new level of business value from mobility for enterprise clients.","The underlying theme of all of this, from the expansion of our cloud platforms and capacity to the OpenPOWER consortium, to the partnership with Apple for enterprise mobility to next generation chip technologies, is that we're leveraging our unique strengths and innovation, and enterprise capabilities to maintain our differentiation in the emerging areas of enterprise IT. While some of these actions impact our results in the short-term, they better position our business for the long-term.","For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $24.4 billion and operating earnings per share of $4.32. Our revenue was down 2% or down 1% at constant currency, adjusting for the customer care divestiture. We improved gross margin by 10 basis points, the 22nd consecutive quarter of operating gross margin expansion.","Our pre-tax and net margins are up significantly. Last year's profit base was lower, due to a workforce rebalancing charge of about $1 billion. We took a charge of a similar size in the first quarter of 2014, and so on a six-month basis the charges are fairly neutral to profit growth.","On the bottomline, we reported operating earnings per share of $4.32 in the second quarter, which is up 34% and we generated $3 billion of free cash flow, which is up $300 million over last year.","Let me spend a minute on the first half performance. The revenue performance for the half is very similar to the second quarter. Through six months, we had double-digit revenue growth in strategic initiatives, stable performance in our core franchises and the impact of some secular trends in parts of hardware and from the divested business.","Looking at profit. We expanded gross margin 50 basis points, pre-tax margin by 70 basis points and net margin by 50 basis points. All while shifting investment to key areas. Operating earnings per share for the first half were up 9.5%. We generated free cash flow of $3.6 billion, which is down $800 million, though up $400 million without the higher level of cash taxes we paid in the first half.","So now I'll get into the details of the quarter, starting with revenue by geography on a constant currency basis. Americas' revenue was up 1% year-to-year, a 3 point sequential improvement from the first quarter rate. From a regional perspective, the U.S. rate also improved 3 points, and we had another great quarter in our Latin America region. The improvement in the Americas was driven by the strong System z mainframe performance.","EMEA declined this quarter. Within Western Europe, we had continued growth in Germany and Italy, though the U.K. and France were down. Eastern Europe also declined. Our performance in Asia-Pacific was pretty consistent with last quarter. We had another good quarter in Japan, our seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth in the country. Asia-Pacific, outside of Japan, declined at a double-digit rate.","In total, major markets were down 1%, while growth markets were down 4%. Within the growth markets, the BRICs were up 1%, which is a 7 point sequential improvement from the first quarter rate. The improvement was driven by Brazil, India and China, each up between 9 points and 10 points sequentially.","Brazil grew over 20% year-to-year, driven by large deals in the financial sector and India returned to growth. Our revenue in China was down 11%, effectively halving the rate of decline from the last couple of quarters. So this is a change in trajectory in China, but we haven't yet seen improvement in the other Asia-Pacific countries. Put it all together, and we had modest sequential improvement in our growth markets performance.","Turning to the segment perspective. Our Services revenue was up 1%, adjusting for the sale of the customer care business. Global Technology Services performance at constant currency was similar to last quarter, with growth in cloud and a ramp in the large outsourcing contracts we signed last year. Global Business Services once again had very strong growth in the practices that address the digital front office, however performance in the globally integrated enterprise offerings lagged.","In Software, middleware is up 3%, while operating systems were down, resulting in modest reported growth for total software. We're continuing to drive strong results in strategic areas like mobile and security, as well as in some of our core franchises like our app servers and distributed databases. While still down, our hardware year-to-year revenue performance improved significantly from the first quarter rate, driven by our System z mainframe, System x and Storage.","Looking at the gross profit, in total, our operating gross margin improved modestly. The increase was driven by margin improvement in Global Technology Services and an improving mix. This was mitigated by margin declines in Global Business Services and in Systems and Technology.","When you look at gross profit dollars, the year-to-year decline was driven entirely by our Systems and Technology business. Aside from STG, our gross profit is flat, even after a $70 million impact from the divested customer care business, and while we transition to some of the emerging areas, where the profit and margins will benefit from scale.","Our total operating expense and other income was better by 14% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. For the last three years, acquisitions have contributed between 1 point and 3 points of expense growth each quarter. Currency drove 1 point of expense growth; so base expense, which is total expense less the impact of acquisitions and currency, was down 17 points.","There is one large item that is impacting the year-to-year expense dynamics. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we had $1 billion workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter of last year. This impacted the base performance by 12 points. So without the impact of that item, our base expense would have been better 5 points year-to-year. This is a better indication of the productivity in the base.","The other item I'll mention is the gain of over $100 million from the sale of our customer care business, associated with the country closings we completed in the second quarter. This is in other income and expense. Keep in mind, the divested business removed about $70 million of gross profit.","Within our base expense, we're also continuing to shift our spending to drive our strategic imperatives and differentiated offerings. The substantial investments we're making in cloud, which includes Bluemix, in Watson and in chip innovation are examples of this.","Now let's turn to the segments, and we'll start with Services. This quarter, the Services businesses generated $14 billion in revenue, which was down 1% at constant currency. This is where we see the impact of the customer care divestiture in the year-to-year results. So adjusting for that divestiture, total services revenue was up 1% year-to-year.","Services pre-tax profit was up 26% and margin improved over 4 points. I'll discuss the profit drivers within the brand details. Total backlog was $136 billion. We reduced backlog by nearly $4 billion, when we divested the customer care business in January. Adjusted for the divested business, total backlog was down 1% at spot rates.","Global Technology Services revenue was $9.4 billion, down 1% as reported, but up 2% at constant currency, adjusted for the divestiture. SoftLayer contributed about 1 point to GTS revenue growth in the quarter. We're expanding our footprint, and in the second quarter, we opened a cloud data center in Hong Kong, and followed that with London, earlier this week. We'll continue to roll out additional capacity in the third and fourth quarters.","GTS outsourcing, one of our core franchises, continue to improve, with revenue growth of 2% at constant currency, adjusted for the divestiture. Revenue growth was driven by the substantial new contracts we brought on in 2013 and we expanded gross margin.","GTS pre-tax profit was up significantly in the quarter. The profit performance was driven by several key factors: first, we're continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as mobility, security, and cloud. These investments result in a differentiated set of capabilities that complement our clients' systems of record, and are a good example of how we continue to evolve our core franchises.","Second, profit reflects the gain from the completion of several country closings in the customer care divestiture, partially offset by the profit lost from the divested business. Finally, we have the benefit from the past rebalancing actions. The year-to-year growth also reflects the absence of workforce rebalancing charges compared to last year.","Turning to Global Business services, revenue of $4.5 billion was down 2%. Consulting and Systems Integration grew 1% and flat at constant currency. We had strong double-digit growth in our practices that address the digital front office, particularly in cloud, analytics and mobile.","This was offset by declines in our traditional packaged application implementations. As our Digital Front Office offerings become a larger part of the portfolio, they will contribute more meaningfully to topline performance.","Two days ago, we announced a strategic partnership with Apple to deliver a new class of enterprise ready, MobileFirst business applications for iOS. With this partnership, IBM's consultants and other client-facing specialists will help expand mobile device productivity, enabling big data and analytics at the point of contact.","Application outsourcing was down 9%, in line with last quarter's results. Our performance continues to reflect pricing pressure and client contract renegotiations as well as a reduction in elective projects. GBS pre-tax profit grew 34% year-to-year, and reflects both year-to-year benefit in workforce rebalancing charges and the impact of lower revenue on a relatively fixed cost base.","Software revenue of $6.5 billion was up 1% and flat at constant currency. Middleware grew 3%, and within that the branded middleware was flat at constant currency on a tough compare from last year.","We had good growth in several of our strategic areas, cloud, big data and analytics, mobile and security. Across our software brands, Software-as-a-Service offerings are growing very quickly. This quarter our SaaS offerings grew by nearly 40%.","Looking at our results by brand. WebSphere had another good quarter, up 5% at constant currency, led by app server, commerce and mobile solutions. Both on-premise and SaaS offerings contributed to WebSphere growth, with the majority of WebSphere growth coming from on-premise solutions.","Our Application Server business delivered strong growth, with an increase in demand for on-premise software that was driven by mobile and analytics workloads. We continue to have strong growth in MobileFirst, leveraging over 5,000 mobile experts and our expanding capabilities. Supporting our partnership with Apple, our software group will develop unique enterprise cloud services, native for iOS, to deliver the full enterprise-class mobile experience from analytics to cloud storage and data security.","Information Management software was down 2% at constant currency. Once again, relational database grew, though some product areas in the brand faced tough compares.","Tivoli revenue was up 3% at constant currency, driven by security software. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of growth in security software, with most of those quarters up double-digits. That's also every quarter since we acquired Q1Labs and built our security division around that acquisition, supplemented by additional analytics capabilities. Workforce Solutions declined 8% at constant currency, as we transition from on-premise Notes, to our SaaS offerings.","Across software, we are transitioning our portfolio to capture growth areas, and we continue to drive innovation in our core franchises. We're growing and building capabilities in emerging areas like Software-as-a-Service, mobile and security and also in more traditional areas such as application server and relational database, as new growth areas drive the need for on-premise capabilities. This quarter we faced a difficult compare, we expect our revenue growth to accelerate in the second half.","Systems and Technology revenue of $3.3 billion was down 11%. This is a significant improvement in the year-to-year performance compared to last quarter. The improvement was driven by System z as well as sequential improvements in System x and Storage. This, together with actions to align our structure to the demand profile, resulted in progress in stabilizing our profit.","Looking at our results by brand, System z revenue was down 1% on flat MIPS, which is significant performance in the seventh quarter following the product announcement. In the quarter, we had large deals in the financial sector in China, the United States and Brazil. When you compare this cycle to date versus the prior cycle, we have shipped 25% more MIPS, and the STG revenue and gross profit are each about 98% of the previous cycle, net of currency.","The System z platform is one of our core franchises benefitting from IT trends. The value proposition for z becomes stronger as the scale of data and transactions grow as well as the need for security of that data and those transactions.","Power revenue declined 28%. The year-to-year performance reflects fundamental changes in the business, and as we have talked about in past calls, we have taken actions to align our structure to the demand profile, while investing to address where we see opportunity in the future.","First, we launched entry-level or scale-out POWER8 in June, and had a good start compared to previous cycles. Keep in mind that entry-level is a small portion of the Power business. POWER8 will be introduced into the mid-range and high-end segments over the remainder of the year.","And second, we expanded our OpenPOWER consortium, doubling the number of alliance members in the second quarter. At the end of June, we had 36 members across 10 countries, including nine in China, so globally diverse. The membership is across the stack, from chip designers to hardware component OEMs, to system vendors to middleware and software providers.","With this alliance, members have access to high-end technology, as the Power architecture is available for open development and to integrate new designs into their hardware platforms. For example, alliance members can design and control their own encryption.","Our System x revenue was down 3%, which is an improvement from last quarter, when revenue was down 18%. As you know, we're in the process of divesting this business to Lenovo, and are awaiting regulatory approvals. Storage hardware revenue was down 12%, a sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter.","We saw strong growth in our Flash Systems, as we doubled our revenue over last year and in our Storwize portfolio, which was up double digits. However, this was more than offset by weakness in high-end disk and the continued wind-down of our OEM business. We had a number of launches this quarter, including the V7000 update to our Storwize portfolio and Flash-enabled DS8K.","As we've discussed over the last couple of earnings calls, our focus for STG in 2014 is to stabilize the profit base, and after the first half we are on track. Within that envelope, we will continue to make investments in this business to remain a leader in high-performance, high-end systems.","Our announcement last week to invest $3 billion over the next five years to tackle the challenges of the post-silicon era, demonstrates our commitment to innovation, and to leading in the new era of enterprise IT.","Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $3 billion of free cash flow, which was up $300 million year-to-year. Through the first half, our free cash flow of $3.6 billion was down $800 million year-to-year. This performance was impacted by the significant increase in cash taxes in 2014, which I talked about earlier this year. Without the impact of cash tax payments, our free cash flow was up $400 million year-to-year.","Looking at the uses of our cash in the first half, we spent $600 million on acquisitions, including Silverpop and Cognea in the second quarter. We returned $13.9 billion to shareholders. Of that, $11.8 billion was in gross share repurchases and at the end of June we had $3.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. In June we reached a milestone, we finished the month with fewer than 1 billion shares outstanding.","Let me put this in perspective. We started our share repurchase program in 1995, when we had more than 2 billion shares outstanding. So we've reduced our share count by more than 50% and the average price we've paid from the start in 1995 through June 30 of this year is less than $100 per share.","We took our dividend up 16% in April, and through June we paid out $2.1 billion this year. This is the 19th consecutive year that we raised our dividend and the 11th year in a row of double-digit increases. With our cash flow performance in the first half, we are on track to generate $16 billion of free cash flow for the year.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.7 billion. Total debt was $46.5 billion, which includes over $29 billion to support our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $17.1 billion and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 56%.","As I mentioned last quarter, given the skew of free cash flow, we expect our debt-to-cap to be in the 50s through the third quarter, and roughly flat year-to-year at the end of the year. We continue to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term, as we transition to the new areas of enterprise IT.","So now let me wrap up the discussion of the first half results, and put it in the context of what we discussed at our Investor Day in May. We have set of offerings that address the strategic areas of data, cloud and the way our clients are engaging. We said that the model was to deliver double-digit revenue growth for these areas, with high software content.","Our first half results were consistent with that part of the model. Our business analytics revenue was up 7% on a large base and cloud revenue was up over 50%, with our as-a-service business doubling once again. Our security revenue was up over 20% and we more than doubled our revenue in mobile. Together, the revenue in our strategic imperatives was up double-digits and about half of the content was in software.","At the same time in May, we discussed our core franchises, where we continue to innovate. These include our longer-term services business, our recurring software business and mainframe business with our large capacity clients. The model is a stable revenue base and we are on track here too.","Finally, we have transactional businesses that are shifting to higher value. We're continuing to evolve the portfolio, investing in capabilities in some areas, while divesting businesses that don't support our shift to high value.","In the first half, we completed the sale of our customer care business and announced the sale of our industry-standard server business to Lenovo. These impact our topline performance, but are clearly the right moves for us for the long term.","We continue to drive these shifts. Let me summarize what we've gotten done in the first half of this year. We took Bluemix live, we're adding new SoftLayer cloud hubs and we're ramping our investment to commercialize Watson.","We've introduced POWER8 for big data and cloud at the entry-level and are expanding our OpenPOWER consortium. And we've committed $3 billion to drive chip innovation, while launching an important new partnership with Apple to extend IBM's position in the enterprise mobile space.","When you pull all of this together, for the half, revenue was relatively flat at constant currency, adjusting for the divestiture, pre-tax margin expanded by 70 basis points and net margin by 50 basis points and operating earnings per share were up 9.5%.","As we look to the full year of 2014, we expect to deliver at least $18 of operating earnings per share. And we still expect to deliver at least $20 of operating earnings per share in 2015. These are points along the way to delivering performance and shareholder value over the long term.","Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information. And second, as always I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Christine, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Can you comment on how you're currently thinking about the potential for stabilization and perhaps even growth in the Asia-Pac, x Japan region, obviously, you saw some improvement in China? But in terms of the overall region, how should we think about the revenue and profit trajectory from here? And then I guess related to that, on the profit side, can you walk us through some of the permanent changes you're making to your cost structure in that region specifically?","Martin Schroeter","I guess, I'd say a couple of things. As you noted, we did see a pretty good sequential improvement in China and in India as well in the second quarter, but as we noted in the prepared remarks, we did not see that sequential improvement in AP. And notably within that, I would say, we saw degradation in both Australia and Korea within that AP geography.","Now, when we look forward, in China, we still see a continued improvement in the sequential performance out of China now. It's important to note in China, even though we were still down year-to-year sequentially, not only do we see a year-over-year improvement, but our business in China was about an $800 million business in the first quarter and in the second quarter it was over $1 billion. So we see a very typical sequential skew in China, which is growth in the second.","So again, as we see that year-to-year sequential improvement in China that we expect, this is still a substantial business for us. Now, we did not see and we do not see yet a material change in the trajectory in the rest of Asia-Pacific. As I noted, Australia and Korea were slow in the second, and we don't see that.","Outside that area -- I'll comment also on some of the other growth markets. Latin America as an example, as you heard in our prepared remarks, had another strong quarter, again led by Brazil, which was up double-digit. And although they are going to ramp on a strong second half from last year, we still see good performance coming out of Latin America.","From an investment perspective, we have made substantial commitments to those growth markets and we see good opportunity to deploy the IBM platform. And we continue to invest in those growth markets to get that IBM platform deployed across the growth markets.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Bill. Let's go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein","I appreciate all the investments in the pace of change that IBM is undertaking and accomplished so far in the first half. I guess, the question that I hear a lot from investors is, is that change big enough to offset what appears to be deterioration or secular pressures in the core franchise? So very specifically, coming out of last quarter, you did not have a good Software quarter, you were optimistic that Software would be notably better this quarter, it was worse. It was flat at constant currency.","Similarly, when I look at Services, which is really the other big core part of your franchise, Services signings are now down 33% for the first half. The signings this quarter were the lowest in more than six years in absolute term. And you've got nine straight quarters with negative revenue growth in Services.","So very specifically, can you address what was the shortfall in Software this quarter relative to much more positive expectations you had coming in? And secondly, when you look at Services, given the preponderance of data, I just offered to you, and given the leading indicator of signings being so weak, what secularly is going on there and how does the business get better from here?","Martin Schroeter","Thanks, Toni. There is a lot there. So let me try to talk a bit about Software first and talk a bit about Services next. So first on Software, my view 90 days ago was that Software would accelerate through the remainder of the year. And I still feel like in second half, we will see Software acceleration back to mid-single digit growth.","Now, in the second quarter, we saw a couple of things: one, the headwind that we have in that total Software segment from the operating system, content was 3 points and that's kind of the high point, if you will, of the headwind that we expect from that operating system content. So that headwind diminishes a bit; and then secondly, we continue to see a very good Software performance coming from our kind of typical Enterprise License Agreements, as we go through the second half, again to drive that mid-single digit revenue.","On Services. Services, we said 90 days ago that we would see revenue performance kind of consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, and we still feel that way. Services was, when you adjust for the divestiture, Services was up 1 point and we continue to see that.","Now, as you noted, we had a weak signings quarter in the second. Now, that was on the back of first quarter last year of signings growth, first and second quarter of last year north of 30%. So we had a difficult compare. We knew that in the first half. But we do see getting the signings content growing again in the third.","And so when we look at the revenue streams for Services. Again, we expect them to be consistent with what we have seen to date. I think we feel, as though that the yield were getting out of the in-period revenue is a bit better than what you would normally do if you just ran it mathematically, we're getting the better yield.","Two, we have outside of the backlog, you see, we have content, the transactional content like our cloud business, which continues to grow. And then third, we will, as I mentioned, get additional third quarter signings growth that will deliver the rest of that pretty modest 1% growth on an adjusted basis, without the divestitures going forward.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Toni. Let's go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","As a follow-up to last question on the weak Software and signings numbers, did you in fact see deal push-outs in the quarter? And if so what do you think caused that and have you been able to close the business in the third quarter?","Martin Schroeter","There are deals that come in -- I don't know, I would not characterize it as a deal push-out. There are a few phenomena though, that I think are worth noting. In our key branded middleware business, it's a mix of both, transactional content as well as subscription and support, which comes in over time. So it's a mix of transactional content and subscription support, but very heavily transaction content.","In our total middleware business, so in the other middleware that comprises that total middleware business, we have a mix, as well, some transactional content and some subscription content, but the mix is kind of flipped in that case. So there is a lot more subscription content. What we see in any given quarter, you can see this kind of a mix shift, we saw a much higher transactional content in that total middleware line. And then the key branded middleware quarter-to-quarter behave very similarly as what we saw in the first quarter.","So last year in key branded middleware, first to second quarter, we grew that content just under $800 million quarter-to-quarter. And that delivered 10% growth by the way. This year we grew that same key branded middleware a bit over $800 million. So a bit more than last year, but because of the strong compare that drove kind of a flat year-to-year performance. So we have a phenomena of different mixes between transactional and subscription support, and we have quite frankly a tough compare in key branded middleware.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Katy. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus.","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","Martin, I think you had mentioned that free cash flow is down $800 million year-over-year for the first six months, and I think the math suggest that $1.2 billion of that $2 billion cash tax headwind is reflected in that figure. So assuming the $18 in earnings is a good number, how much visibility do you have on the change in working capital at this point in the year? And your ability to hit that $16 billion free cash flow target for the year?","Martin Schroeter","I would say, there are couple of phenomena that are going to drive that free cash flow. So first is, as you pointed out, when we make earnings -- I guess I'd say it this way, when we make earnings, we'll make the free cash flow number. And I think that that phenomena that drives that obviously there is profitability skew in the second half here that drives on an absolute basis that drives that.","And secondly, within the sales cycle working capital component, the other phenomena is our Enterprise License Agreement cycle we're in, that software content drives a substantial amount of free cash flow as well. So between, again, the profit and the mix towards the second half as well as the phenomena of the cash structure, if you will, of our ELA cycle, I think we have a very strong statement to say, when we make profit, we'll make cash flow.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks David. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","I want to ask about hardware, and just sorry a two-parter, but mainframe down only 1% was much big improvement, very big improvement from last quarter. So what happened there and is that sustainable? And then, there are some reports out there, and I know you're aware of them about your -- what you might do with your chip making capabilities? And you announced a very large investment commitment to your chip making R&D during the quarter or during this month. So can you just reconcile that, I think you understand what we're hearing out there and what is the commitment to the chip making business as well?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Ben. So couple of things, first, on mainframe, we did have a very strong mainframe quarter, as you noted just down 1% and in the seventh quarter of the cycle down 1% is quite good. Now in the first half, we were kind of down in the mid-teens, right, in the first quarter we were down pretty healthy double-digit, down 1% in this quarter gets us to a down mid-teens, and that's very typical, that performance, that mid-teens is very typical of where we would expect the next couple of quarters to be again given the cycle.","Now, I think the reason that the mainframe continues to do so well and we had in the prepared remarks that in this cycle the revenue and GP is roughly 98% of where it was in the prior cycle. This continues to be now a core franchise for us. But it is the critical infrastructure that drives still 70% of the world's enterprise data.","And as our clients are moving towards new systems of engagement and mobility and they want the most secure platform, the mainframe remains the premier platform on which to drive a world-class enterprise structure. So I don't expect that we're going to see a minus 1% going forward. But I think that first half performance is consistent with what we would expect.","And then, on the semiconductors, as you said, we did announce a $3 billion investment in semiconductor research and development. And as we've said a number of times it was in our Chairman's letter to shareholders, we've been very, very vocal about our goal to remain the leader, the absolutely leader in high performance and high-end systems. We're the leader today and we would expect with this kind of investment we can continue to maintain that leadership.","Now, this R&D investment is clearly focused on the distant future where we have, we have to figure out how to scale semiconductors to seven nanometers, that's a big challenge. And then, obviously, we're also thinking about, as we indicated what the post-silicon world looks like. So we remain committed to being the leader of high performance and high-end systems. And we have not changed our view on that at all. We've been very vocal about it and we'll stay on that path.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Ben. Let's go to the next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA.","Lou Miscioscia - CLSA","Maybe if I could link something about China, and also your x86 business. I guess the question is that, we continuously hear that the Chinese government is pushing away from big U.S. tech companies, but obviously the x86 business bounce back, and it sounds like China bounced back, is the sale of that helping the situation there? And I guess I'll leave at that.","Martin Schroeter","Again, we saw a sequential improvement, as I noted earlier in China quarter-to-quarter. And as I also noted, we would expect that sequential improvement to continue. Now, interestingly I would not characterize that sequential improvement as driven solely by x86 or any other of the single brands, in fact, it was across all of our segments, Global Technology Services, GBS, Software group, STG, all showed sequential improvement in China.","And in fact, when we look at our strategic imperatives content that sits in China that was up very solid double-digit as well, which is consistent with the overall performance and our strategic imperatives. So really no difference from what we're seeing in our success in China from what we're seeing anywhere else in the world.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Lou. Chris, can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS.","Steve Milunovich - UBS","Couple of odds and ends, Martin. First of all on these share repurchase, you did I think $11.8 billion through the first half. Does that mean you have roughly $3 billion to do in the second half? And then second, on emerging markets, I think in the annual report that you guys suggested you would see emerging market revenue growth in the second half? Is that correct? And does that still stand?","Martin Schroeter","So on share repurchase, we have about $3 billion left on our authorization. And as we've said in the past, we would expect to spend about what we did last year, maybe a little bit less or something. I haven't changed my view on that capital allocation. But we do have about $3 billion left in our authorization.","On growth markets, as I mentioned earlier, I would say that we would say a continued sequential improvement in growth markets. And as I noted earlier, L.A is going to ramp on a strong second half, but continues to do quite well. AP we do not see that sequential improvement yet.","And I guess the other thing I'd point that's worth noting, particularly in the growth markets, we are in the process, as you know of divesting our industry standard server business, and that's going to have an impact on our revenue growth and that's a profound impact in the emerging markets as well. So when we sell that content, its going to be a pretty big headwind to growth for the emerging markets, notwithstanding the sequential improvements that we see in the business.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Steve. Let's go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Just wanted to ask about the GBS portion of services. I saw revenue accelerated, and margins contracted a bit. Curious, how much of this is cyclical versus secular? I heard pricing pressure and package limitation weakness. Did you adjust your workforce last quarter to address these things? Just trying to sketch out what the second half might look like given this trend?","Martin Schroeter","So a couple of things on GBS. So there are secular shifts going on this space. And we've been talking about our, how we're shifting towards, we refer to it as the Digital Front Office. So to talk about it as our cloud and analytics and our mobile, that was that while we see that flow in our clients and we're obviously shifting both their resources, our skills, our training after that and we see very solid double-digit growth, we saw that in the second quarter.","And in fact, we look at our pipeline going forward and over half of it is that kind of content. So there is absolutely a secular shift going on in that GBS space. And we are in the middle of it. And we are very competitive in that space.","On the ERP implementations, and some of the custom development work, I guess what we are seeing is kind of a fewer of those large rollouts and that combined with the large rollouts that do occur, we're seeing them being broken up into small pieces. So they're not as large as they used to be.","So I don't know, if I would consider that secular or cyclical, within that our clients where those back office workloads are stable, our clients are still looking for additional productivity. And so obviously, we are in a bit of a battle to win there, but they are looking for productivity. And so we are still competitive. But other than the absolute secular shift towards cloud and analytics and mobile, which we're playing in and which we have very solid double-digit growth in, we'll have to wait and see if the rest is secular or cyclical.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Tien-Tsin. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","I wanted to dig a little bit into what you're hearing in terms of global demand and thinking about the second half of the year. Are you hearing that businesses are starting to get a little more confident? I think you made some comments about the developed markets being a bit better. And then thinking about that in terms of how it translates, since the second half of the year, do you think you could start to see some flat or potentially some growth in revenue?","Martin Schroeter","Sure. So if we look at our major, we'll start with our major markets performance. And so I've talked a bit about the growth markets. Already, in major markets, we were flat year-to-year when we exclude our customer care business, which was an improvement sequentially in North America.","And we also did quite well in North America in our mainframe business and we saw sequential improvements in some of our other platforms as well including power and storage and X. So there is a sequential improvement story, if you will, in North America business that we certainly benefited from in the second.","In Europe, we saw a decline at constant currency, but we did see within that growth in our Services business. And so I would expect Europe to see sequential improvement going forward, but it is a challenged environment from our experience.","And then in Japan, we had a very solid performance again in Japan. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of growth in Japan, as we noted in the remarks that our Japan team does quite well. And I think it's more than just macro. I think our Japan team is doing quite well.","And then as I mentioned in the growth markets, we do expect to see sequential improvement going forward. And then again, all of this is in context from our own headwinds here in IBM. We have closed on our customer care divestiture, which is a headwind for the rest of us, for the year, for a bit over 1 point. And then, as I noted earlier in my growth markets commentary, if we're able to close our industry standard server, our X series divestiture that will also have a pretty substantial headwind for us as well.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Sherri. Can we please take one last question?","Operator","The last question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Martin, when we think about the Systems & Technology business, the profitability has swung from, looks like $1.6 billion in 2011 to negative $300 million in 2013. Could you just delve into what was the biggest driver of that decline? And I also just want some clarity, do you think this business will be profitable in 2014?","Martin Schroeter","We are still focused, as we talked about in the beginning of the year, we are still focused on stabilizing the STG profit base for the year, right, the Systems & Technology Group profit base for the year. And I believe, we are absolutely on track to do that to stabilize that profit base. The impacts against that profit base, when we look last year and what we're trying to stabilize, there are, one, some cyclical issues.","We have certainly seen this downturn in the emerging markets, which has an impact on hardware. And we've talked about that on prior calls that the mix of our STG business in the growth markets is higher than other places. And therefore, that emerging market slowdown had a more pronounced effect on STG. And so there is some cyclical issues there.","And then we have talked about the mainframe cycle, already a number of times. But in addition to that, we've had this secular issue around Power and trying to reposition that. And we've taken action pretty aggressively to make that platform the most viable for the future, including we just released POWER8, as an example, which is a Power platform built for the world of big data and analytics, and quite frankly, built for the world of cloud.","And then we've also had a lot of success with our OpenPOWER initiative, which we've been able to expand again the alliance, being able to expand the alliance of those who will use and build on top of that. So a mix of cyclical and secular within that STG performance, but as I said, as we said at the beginning of the year, and we are confident with the actions we've taken, both address the secular, and also we've taken a fair bit of cost out of that business to better suit the demand profile, we still see that business stabilizing in profit on a full year basis.","So I'm going to wrap up the call. And I guess, first I'll start with what we saw in the first half. We had very strong performance in the strategic imperatives, a lot of software content within that. And as we talked about it at Investor Day, that's very important for our business model. The core franchises were relatively stable, that's also as we said at Investor Day, important for our business model. And we made some progress in addressing some of those secular issues in POWER8. I talked a little bit about that in answer to a question.","In the second half, we see, as I noted on an earlier question, we see our Software revenue growth accelerating to mid-single digit. And we see our Services profit growth of mid-single digit, driven by productivity in the base. And then on STG, as I just noted, we see that profit stabilization still. So when I think about the second half and how that plays out, as we did 90 days ago, I said that I think EPS in the second half will be a little bit faster in the fourth than in the third.","So kind of a double-digit fourth quarter EPS and a single-digit third quarter EPS. And bear in mind, that that single-digit EPS growth even in the third because of seasonality kind of translates to no more absolute EPS than what we get in the second. So we still see that same mix skewed toward the fourth quarter, when we have the benefit of very strong Software performance, when the productivity hits and helps our margins and services and we get that transactional benefit from STG.","Well, thanks very much, everyone. Thanks for joining us. And have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended.

What we will do over the next hour or so is take you through our fourth quarter results, a wrap up of the year and our view of 2014 earnings per share and then we will take your questions.","A month or so ago, before I assumed the CFO job I met with a number of investors and analysts, and one things I took away is that it's important for me to be clear on IBM's 2015 roadmap objective and our ability to achieve the earnings per share, so I want to start out by saying that we continue to expect to deliver at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015. We will talk about 2014 a little later and you will see that our view of 2014 keeps us on track to that objective.","As we get into the fourth quarter results, you will see that our Software, Services and Financing businesses are all on solid ground, but in hardware, as you know, we went to the backend of the mainframe product cycle and we are dealing with some challenges in other areas.","Together, these are impacting our overall results. IBM does have a resilient model based on continuous transformation and we are investing substantially in key opportunity areas. You have seen evidence of that in announcements we have made in the last two weeks and we are rightsizing and repositioning businesses where the market is shifting.","This enables us to move to higher value and lead an enterprise IT. As always, we are positioning our business for the future, and as I noted, we continue to expect to achieve at least $20 in 2015 along the way, so now let me get into the results.","In the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $27.7 billion and operating EPS $6.13, which is up 14% year-to-year. We had a good quarter in software. The performance was broad-based, with constant currency growth in all brands. We had strength in several of the areas where we have targeting our investments like analytics, cloud and security.","Our software revenue was up 4% at constant currency and profit was up 6%. Services' year-to-year revenue performance was consistent with third quarter. GBS again had strong performance, driven by our offerings that address the digitization of the front office and we had continued improvements in the year-to-year performance of strategic outsourcing and GBS. Services revenue was up 1% at constant currency and profit up 2% and we entered the new year with a solid backlog.","Hardware continued to impact our overall performance. We are dealing with some challenges in our hardware business model specific to power, storage and X86. As expected, in System z, we are impacted by the product cycle as we wrap on very strong performance a year ago. Together, these dynamics significantly impacted our revenue growth and profit. In fact, our hardware segment profit was down over $750 million in the quarter and $1.7 billion for the year.","From a geographic perspective, performance in growth markets was mixed though disappointing overall. Looking at our two largest regions, Asia-Pacific was down primarily driven by China, while again we had good performance in Latin America. All together, we posted EPS growth of 14% which we achieved through the combination of continued momentum in key growth areas which drove the mix to higher value software in GBS, yield from productivity initiatives, a modest improvement in our ongoing tax rate along with substantial benefits from tax audit settlements and the effective use of cash to repurchase shares.","The full year had similar dynamics and similar drivers. So for 2013, we delivered $99.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross and net margins and increased our operating EPS 7% to $16.20. Software services and financing, all expanded margins and grew profit while hardware declined. Across our businesses, we had strong performance in Big Data analytics, cloud, mobile, social and security.","Looking at our financial metrics for the quarter, IBM's revenue was down 5% or 3% at constant currency. We had constant currency growth in software, services and financing which was more than offset by a decline in systems and technology. The currency impact to revenue was two points and currency also impacted our profit performance. As we have discussed in the past, a weakening Yen drops largely to the bottom line.","This quarter we improved gross and net margins. Our operating gross margin expanded by 30 basis points driven by services and an improving mix. Our pretax income of $7.4 billion was down 8% and pretax margin to 80 basis points with the declines driven entirely by our hardware business. Net margin expanded, reflecting a lower tax rate. The fourth quarter rate was significantly lower than our normal operating tax rate and includes the settlement of our U.S. tax audit for the three-year period from 2008 to 2010.","We accrued taxes for uncertain tax matters in our normal operating rate. This particular tax audit commenced in late 2011, and concluded with the receipt of the revenue agent report in late November 2013. The conclusion of the audit resulted in a reduction of tax expense, which was previously recorded in our operational tax rate. While the audit closure had the most significant impact, there were additional discrete items impacting the rate in the quarter. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $6.13, again up 14% year-to-year.","Looking at the cash metrics. We generated free cash flow of $8.4 billion in the quarter and returned substantial value to shareholders. For the year, we generated $15 billion in free cash flow which was down $3 billion year-to-year. The decline was driven by our operational performance, higher cash tax payments and changes in working capital. I will talk more about cash flow later in the call. We ended the year with a cash balance of over $11 billion, consistent with year-end 2012.","So now, I will get into the details of the quarter, starting with revenue by geography and on a constant currency basis. America's revenue was down 2% year-to-year. We had strong growth in software. The deceleration in year-to-year performance from last quarter was driven by the impact from the mainframe product cycle, predominantly in the U.S. We grew in Canada and once again we had good performance in Latin America, led by Brazil. Our EMEA revenue was down 2%, consistent with last quarter. Western Europe performed in line with the market and here too we had software performance. In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down 6%. Within that, we had another good quarter in Japan where revenue was up 4%. Japan is a great example of how we have shifted our investment and redirected your go to market focus significantly improve our performance. This is now our fifth consecutive quarter revenue growth in Japan. Asia-Pacific, outside of Japan, declined.","In total, major markets were down 2%, while the growth markets were down 6%. Within the growth markets, we continued to gain share and deliver growth in Latin America and in the Middle East and Africa region. Our performance in LA and MEA has been consistently strong in particular Latin America had a difficult compare up 18% last year. In Eastern Europe, the declines moderated while revenue from the Asia-Pacific countries declined at a double-digit rate, primarily driven by China. Our revenue in China was down 23%. So very similar to last quarter. The largest declines in China were in our hardware business. We continue to be impacted by the process surrounding the implementation of a broad-based economic reform plan. While there is more clarity on the overall plan, we continue to believe that it will take some time for our business in China to improve.","To wrap up the discussion of the growth markets, we had good performance in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. And while we are disappointed with our performance in certain regions of the growth markets, we continue to see good opportunity in all regions over the long-term and we are continuing to invest in these key markets.","Turning to the segment perspective, I have already commented on the revenue drivers. Looking at the gross profit, in total, our operating gross margin improved three-tenth of a point. We expanded margins in both Services segments and the relative strength in our software business drove an improving mix.","The improvements are mitigated by a five-and-a-half point decline in Systems and Technology. System z margin is up as you would expect at this point of the product cycle. The other hardware brands were down reflecting business model challenges. I will get into this in the STG section.","Our total operating expense and other income was better by 1% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove two points of expense growth. For the last two-and-a-half years, acquisitions contributed between one and three points of expense growth each quarter. Currency contributed two points of decline, driven almost entirely by translation, so our base expense was better by a point.","Within our base expense, we are continuing to shift our spending. We are driving productivity across the business, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives. Much of the savings is reinvested into the business to drive our growth areas, so what you see here is the net effect of these actions.","Turning to the categories of expense that had year-to-year impacts, there is just one area point out. Our accounts receivable provision was up nearly $16 million year-to-year. Our reserve coverage is up less than 20 basis points, or flat versus September.","Finally, I want to comment on the impact of currency this quarter. In the fourth quarter, the hedge activity across cost and expense was neutral in the period. There was little year-to-year change in the impact from our hedges.","For the last few quarters, we have been significantly impacted by the depreciation of the yen, because our business in Japan is dominated by local services. Without cross-border cash flow to hedge, the impact falls largely to the bottom line. This was the case again in the fourth quarter and at current spot rates would continue through next year, so unfortunately we will be dealing with another your current impacts to the bottom line.","Now let's turn to the segments and we will start with Services. This quarter, the combined Services segments generated $15 billion in revenue, which was down 2% as reported and up 1% at constant currency. Pre-tax profit was up 2% and pre-tax margin expanded by nine-tenth of a point. Total backlog was $143 billion, up 2% at spot rates and up 5% at constant currency. Backlog grew in both, the Transactional and Outsourcing businesses.","Turning to the two segments, Global Technology Services revenue was $9.9 billion, down 4% or down 1% at constant currency, in line with last quarter's year-to-year performance. Major markets were returned to growth at constant currency for the first time since the first half of 2012, led by Europe while our growth markets performance lagged.","With revenue down 1% at constant currency, our GTS outsourcing performance improved from the third quarter. We are starting to benefit from several of the large transformational contracts we signed earlier in 2013. At the same time, we continue to see a decline in revenue from sales into existing base accounts. This activity tends to be more transactional in nature and can be economically sensitive.","Our GS revenue was flat year-to-year at constant currency. We continue to shift the business toward higher value managed services such as business continuity, security and cloud.","Within our cloud offerings, software contributed one point of revenue growth to total GTS software provides unmatched performance, flexibility and breadth for public and hybrid cloud workloads and we have just made a commitment to significantly expand our global cloud capacity.","Turning to GTS profit, pre-tax profit declined 2% in the quarter. Our growth markets performance contributed to the profit decline. In addition, we are continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as cloud, mobility and security. While these initiatives are starting to contribute to the top line, we will get better profit results as they get to scale. GTS pre-tax margin expanded by four-tenths of a point, the margin improvement was driven by tough-minded spend actions and benefits from the second quarter workforce rebalancing activity.","Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, up 1% as reported and up 4% at constant currency. This was a good quarter for GBS, and again gained share this quarter. From a geographic perspective, we had growth in each region at constant currency, led by North America and the growth market countries. Japan continued solid performance and Europe grew for the second consecutive quarter.","Looking at the GBS business by offering, growth was driven by the practices, but addressed the digital front office. We delivered double-digit growth in each of our strategic growth initiatives, business analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud. We have been investing to build capabilities and now have nearly 20,000 resources in GBS focused on the growing digital front-office opportunity. For example, in the area of Big Data, our capabilities span from BAO strategy to front-office analytics to fraud and regulatory compliance and risk management. Within our back office solutions that address the globally integrated enterprise, we again grew in implementation services that support the traditional packaged applications.","Looking at GBS profit. Pretax profit was up 12% year-to-year and PTI margin expanded by two points. The main year-to-year profit drivers were continued benefits from our enterprise productivity initiatives and the second quarter workforce rebalancing. The savings from these actions fueled the investment in our key initiatives.","Now let me take the discussion back up to the total services level. We entered 2014 with a services backlog of $143 billion and as we have said in the past, approximately 70% of revenue in any year is driven by the opening backlog. Looking to 2014, the projected revenue from the backlog is up 1%. The divestiture of our customer care business is expected to close in the first quarter. That will reduce our backlog and impact revenue growth from the backlog by about three points. So overall, we expect revenue from backlog to be down 2%.","Now the balance of the revenue, the other 30% or so comes from yield from current year signings as well as sales and volumes in our existing client base. It also includes software and some of our cloud services which generate in-period revenue that isn't reflected in the backlog. So to wrap up services, in the fourth quarter, we grew revenue, pretax profit and expanded margins. We continued to see the strength in the areas of cloud, business analytics and Smarter Planet and we are investing to extend our capabilities. Our software revenue was $8.1 billion. It was up 3% or 4% at constant currency. Our software revenue continues to mix toward our key branded middleware. With 6% constant currency growth in branded middleware, we gained share.","Looking at the results by brand. We had great performance in WebSphere. Revenue was up 15% at constant currency and we gained share. We had good growth in both our on-premise application server business and newer cloud based offerings. We continued strong growth in MobileFirst as our comprehensive portfolio of mobile software and services extending value to our clients to reach new markets and gain competitive advantage and our core WebSphere offerings of business integration and commerce delivered strong growth. We are continuing to add capabilities in this space. Last week, we closed the acquisition of Aspera, which provides best in class transfer speeds for movement of Big Data.","Information management software grew 5% at constant currency and gained share. We had our strongest growth of the year in our business analytics software offerings, led by business intelligence and Netezza appliances. Distributed database was up double-digits again this quarter.","Tivoli, our security business, once again delivered another great quarter with double-digit growth. The transformation, driven by mobile and cloud computing is raising the importance of security for enterprise customers everywhere. We have been building our capabilities and across software and services, we now have 6,000 security experts worldwide, we have 3,000 patents in security and we have 25 security labs worldwide.","Our software value proposition remains strong for enterprise clients. Our customers continue to increase deployment for middleware products and we are investing and gaining share in social, mobile, analytics, cloud and security. Some of this has delivered in a SaaS model and we now have over 100 SaaS offerings in our software portfolio. In 2013, software revenue grew 3% at constant currency with key branded middleware up 6% year-to-year. Our software pretax income of over $11 billion was up 3% and we expanded pretax margins.","Systems and technology revenue of $4.3 billion, was down 26% year-to-year. System z was down 37% against a very strong quarter a year ago when revenue was up 56%. This quarter we entered the backend of the mainframe cycle and as expected we delivered a higher gross margin on a lower base of revenue. MIPS declined 26% following the largest MIPS shipment in mainframe history a year ago.","Let me put the performance of the current mainframe cycle into perspective. In the current cycle, we have shipped 28% more MIPS, a measure of capacity, compared to the same period in the prior cycle. The revenue and gross profit in the current cycle are each about 99% of the previous cycle, net of currency. Mainframe provides the highest levels of availability, reliability, efficiency and security which positions it as the ideal platform for high-volume, mission-critical workloads. This additional capacity that I mentioned is a reflection of the ongoing relevance of the mainframes to our clients and provides IBM with financial returns consistent with the past cycles.","In our Power business revenue declined 31%. We continue to shift significant capacity into the UNIX market, however this has been more than offset by significant price performance resulting in lower revenue.","As we have said in the past, we have been very successful in the UNIX market and we are talking two actions to improve our business model here. First, we are making the platform more relevant to clients. To achieve this, in the fourth quarter, we introduced a new integrated facility for Linux offerings, which enables our clients to run Linux workloads in their existing servers. This near-to-successful strategy we executed our System z platform will expand our Linux relevancy even further with POWER8 later this year, which will provide additional Big Data and cloud capabilities.","Through our OpenPOWER Consortium, we are making Power technology available to open development alliance building ecosystem around our technologies. Just yesterday, the Suzhou PowerCore Technology Company announced their intention to use IBM's power architecture to provide customized chip design solutions for the China server market. These effects will take some time.","Secondly, even with these additional capabilities, we recognize that the power platform will not return to prior revenue levels. We will take action in this business to reflect the new business model.","System x 15% at constant currency, within that PureSystems continues to gain momentum. Across our hardware products Pure revenue was up more than 30%, sequentially. Globally, we shipped over 2,500 systems in the fourth quarter and over 10,000 systems to-date.","Storage hardware revenue was down 12% at constant currency. Our Flash solutions continue to gain momentum and contributed a few points of growth this quarter. Our store-wise products again delivered double-digit growth, which was offset by declines in our legacy OEM midrange offerings. We also had declines in the high-end, driven by significant pricing pressure.","Profit in Systems and Technology segment was down over $750 million in the quarter and over $1.7 billion for the year. About half of the fourth quarter decline was driven by System z, due to the product cycle though the platform is secularly strong with a solid business model. Our other harbor businesses are dealing with business model issues, due to market shifts. We will make these products more relevant while rightsizing these businesses to meet the new value proposition.","Turning to cash flow, we generated $8.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up $6.2 billion quarter-to-quarter, but down $1.1 billion year-to-year. This was a similar quarter-to-quarter increased to what we saw on the third to fourth quarter of 2012, despite the fact that this year we did not have the benefit of the z cycle.","Historically, over half of our annual cash flow was generated in the fourth quarter. In 2013, we generated 56% of the full year in the fourth quarter and this is the highest percentage in several years.","On a full-year basis, we generated $15 billion of free cash flow, which was down $3.2 billion year-to-year. There were three key drivers of the year-to-year decline. Our operational performance, higher cash taxes and changes in sales cycle working capital. This was mitigated by lower capital expenditures and the fact that we prepared certain retiree medical payments in 2012.","As for the uses of cash for the year, we spent $3.1 billion to acquire 10 companies, including three in the fourth quarter Now Factory, Xtify, and Fiberlink. We also returned almost $18 billion to shareholders in 2013, including over $4 billion in dividends and we bought back 73 million shares for approximately $14 billion. On a net basis, our cash outflow for share repurchases was $12.8 billion, and at the end of the year we had $14.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of $11.1 billion. Total debt was $39.7 billion of which $27.5 billion was in support of our financing business which is leveraged at roughly seven-to-one. Our non-financing debt was $12.2 billion and our non-financing debt to cap was 39%.","We had good performance in our pension plans in 2013. The interest rate environment resulted in higher discount rates at year end, particularly in the U.S. and the pension liability re-measurement resulted in an increase to our equity.","Our defined benefit qualified plans had solid asset returns and continue to be well-funded and importantly, our cash requirements remain stable. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long-term.","Let me start to wrap up with a discussion of the full year from a few perspectives,","starting with performance in some key growth areas. We have been continuing to shift our investments to address the key trends in IT, like social, mobile, big data analytics and cloud. A few years ago, we identified and established objectives for three growth initiatives, Smarter Planet, business analytics and cloud that capture much of these trends. I have talked about how these growth areas have contributed to our performance within the segments and I want to report on how they have done at an IBM level for the year.","Smarter Planet grew about 20% year-to-year with strength across all areas, including smarter commerce, industry solutions, smarter cities and social business. We believe that data as a natural resource will drive demand going forward and Big Data analytics to provide the basis for competitive differentiation. In 2013, we grew business analytics revenue 9%, led by GBS and by software. This is now nearly $16 billion business for us which you will recall was our original target for 2015. We have already taken our 2015 objective for business analytics revenue up to $20 billion.","Now cloud solutions address the full scope of customer requirements, private clouds, public clouds and hybrid clouds as well as platform and SaaS based solutions. For the year we delivered $4.4 billion of revenue for cloud solutions. That's up 69% year-to-year and within that $1.7 billion was delivered as a service. As we have said in the past, there is overlap between these initiatives. In total, software makes up about half of that combined content. This improves our business mix and contributes to our margin expansion.","Now looking at 2013 from a segment perspective. Our software business continued to grow fueled by these key areas. We returned to revenue growth in GBS, leveraging the investments we have made in the digital front office and our GTS revenue trajectory improved and is stabilizing. In software, services and financing, we grew profit and expanded margin.","Clearly, we do have some underperforming areas. First, we have a business model issue in parts of our hardware business, which we will address through targeted investments in areas like Flash and PowerLinux and by rightsizing for the demand characteristics we expect. Second, we had recent declines in some of the growth markets where we will continue to invest to capture the longer-term opportunity. Keep in mind, we are dealing with a currency headwind and at current spot rates, this will continue into 2014.","In 2013, we continued the transformation of the portfolio shifting to higher value. We maintained high levels of investment including $6 billion in R&D, $4 billion in capital and $3 billion in acquisitions, adding significant capabilities to support key areas of growth. At the same time, we announced the divestiture of our customer care business, which we expect to close in early 2014.","We are continuing to add to our capabilities and improve our position for the future. Let me give you a couple of examples. Last week we announced the significant investment to expand our global cloud footprint. We have committed $1.2 billion to double our software centers. On the 40 cloud data centers in 15 countries, IBM will have cloud centers in every major geography and key financial center. Earlier this month, we announced a $1 billion investment in Watson and established a new Watson group. This new unit is dedicated to the development and commercialization of cloud delivered cognitive innovations.","Completing the wrap up of the year, we also improved our ongoing effective tax rate, we benefited from discrete tax items and we returned a significant amount to shareholders. Altogether we continue to position our business for the long term while dealing with some significant business model issues in hardware.","As we look forward to 2014, we will continue our transformation shifting our investments to the growth areas and mixing the higher value. We will acquire key capabilities, we will divest businesses and we will rebalance our workforce as we continue to return value to shareholders.","Our current view all of this is included in our expectation of at least $18 of operating EPS in 2014. That's up 10.5% from $16.28 in 2013. Some of the actions will be early in the year. For example, in the first quarter, we expect the initial closing of the sale of our customer care business and to take the bulk of our workforce rebalancing actions which we are currently working on. We will see the benefits of the first quarter rebalancing action later in the year. As a result, we expect our first quarter EPS to be about 14% of the full year, reflecting the modest gain, workforce rebalancing charge and continued impact from currency.","For these reasons our first quarter skew in 2014 should be lower than our historical skew which has been about 18% of the full year over the last few years. Importantly we expect to grow our free cash flow in 2014 by about $1 billion, that's faster than net income, even after absorbing another significant cash tax headwind and growing capital expenditures. All of this keeps us on track toward 2015 objective of at least $20 of operating EPS. Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I would like to mention a couple of items. First we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information. Second, I would ask you to refrain from multipart questions.","Chris, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","Thanks a lot. Martin, I really appreciate you talking about the first quarter which looks like it equates to $2.50 versus the consensus of $3.27. I was just hoping if you could confirm that. I think I got the math right, but my question is with regard to a bridge from 2013 to 2014. If I look at 2013, you had about $1.50 or so benefit due to tax rate year-over-year and my calculations are $1.10 in a hit maybe 2014, so considering that it seems like you have to have a significant gain maybe $1 to $2 of gain to get to dollars.","Again, my question is, can you just confirm the $2.50 or so number for the first quarter? Then do you mind bridging us from '13 to '14 and tell me what's missing, because there is a big chunk missing and I think it's the gains from the sale. Thanks a lot.","Martin Schroeter","Okay. Sure. Thanks, Ben, and thanks for the question. I guess, a few things I would say. I think your SKU math is consistent with how we would see it as well, so we will put that aside for now. On the full year, there are I think a number of issues that we should render explicit when we look at going from 2013 to 2014, so first in our 2014 guidance we do assume a gain from the sale of our customer care business which was announced last year we expect that the close. That will close in stages, some in the first, some in the second quarters and that will be in total about $150 million of pretax gain, so that that is in our guidance.","There is not however another substantial gain or gain assumed in our guidance of at least $18 for 2014, but let me talk a little bit about how we see 2014 relative to what we faced in 2013. First, as you saw in our full year results and obviously really clearly in the fourth quarter, we had a substantial year-to-year profit headwind in STG. The STG business on a year-to-year basis for 2013 was down $1.7 billion worth of profit. Of that $750 million was in the fourth quarter, so the fourth, obviously, some of it was mainframe, the cycle and were not at all worried about the cycle as we talked about in the prepared remarks. We are very confident in the secular strength of the mainframe and the cycle, but we do have these small issues and in our p business, our x and our storage business, so on a year-to-year basis $1.7 billion of impact in STG.","Now, within our guidance, we are going to get that profit impact neutralized back towards zero on a year-to-year basis so, we would hold the year-to-year profit that we saw in STG neutral in the year on a comeback to that point at the end again, because there is another important point to be made.","In 2013, we had a pretty substantial currency headwind and we think this could have been as much as $600 million on a pre-tax basis. Now, we have talked in the past some of these things get offset through sourcing decisions and an overall by the flows that we experience within the business, but it could have been as much as $600 million and we still see as we noted in the prepared content we still see a headwind in profit from currency, but it is not at that same level at the current spot rates we don't expect it to be the same level.","Then finally on a year-to-year basis, I think we have one other unique item, which is last year as you know we had a substantial workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter and that is paying back now, right? We didn't get all of it out, all of the payback in 2013, so there will be some additional benefits from 2014 in that as well. As we noted the call, because we are going to be taking our workforce rebalancing charges earlier than we did last year, it will be in the first quarter, so on a on a full year basis, there won't be any year-to-year impact. We do expect that will be about $1 billion again same as last year, plus or minus $100 million. We are still doing the work, but on a year-to-year basis we would suggest that that's about the same and therefore no year-to-year impact.","Then, obviously, we get the payback within the year. So not only do we get a tailwind from last years but we get everything this year payback. Then in addition to that which benefits the whole business we still have our ongoing workforce productivity initiatives, which are driving productivity across the business, we have our software business going pretty well. We have our GBS business going pretty well, we see GTS profit base in that segment improving. I already talked a little bit about STG getting back to no profit impact on a year-to-year base and then we have our share repurchase program, which will also deliver some EPS on a year-to-year base. So the first answer to your question is, we think your math is where we would put it and then on a year-to-year basis, we feel like we have a pretty good game plan for 2014.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","Thanks, Martin.","Martin Schroeter","Sorry, Ben, just one more thing. Before we get off STG, our game plan for STG is flat profit year-to-year. That is not our ongoing model for STG. So we will improve and we do expect that we will improve that model position of STG over time. 2015 will see another z cycle, so there will obviously be a little bit of tailwind there but I don't want to leave you with the impression that when we get this to your profit impact, that that's where we are stopping, we are going to get that business back to grow profit. Thanks, Ben.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Ben. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein","Yes, thank you, and good afternoon, Martin. I just wanted to follow-up on that last question. I really appreciate color. As was mentioned before, tax rate has been a huge, huge benefit for IBM in 2013. I think that your normalized tax rate of 23% earnings would have been up only about 2% year-over-year at about $15.60. Obviously you reported much higher than that. So if I think about your earnings on a normalized tax rate in 2014, they need to go from normalized $15.60 to $18 which is a 15% increase. So I understand that hardware is going to be flat. That made no money this year. But that implies that software and services are going to have grow EPS at 15% year-over-year, which neither did this year. So again if I look at it through that reality check lens, I guess the question is, particularly with a very difficult quarter, at the beginning of the year, how is it realistic that you get to 15% plus EPS growth off a normalized tax rate and can you be explicit about what you expect your actual accrued tax rate to be in 2014? You said normalized is 23%, but it has been dramatically lower than that in three of the last four quarters. So what's your operating assumption for tax rate in 2014?","Martin Schroeter","Sure. Thanks, Toni, and good afternoon to you as well. So I guess I would say a few things. Our view of the tax rate is 23%. That's our operating assumption. That's our practical assumption. That's what we think the tax rate is for 2014. Now that does not have discrete items but we don't have a plan, if you will, for discrete items. We have an operating tax rate assumption of 23%, and as you point out therefore we do expect that we will have to refill it, if you will, the net income required to get there. I went through a little bit of the bridge with you, as you pointed out on STG for instance. I guess I would say a few other things.","One, in terms of how we see the year rolling out. As you noted, first quarter, with the charge, we will obviously be down pretty dramatically with the charge in it and that will pay for itself, as I mentioned, through the year. Second quarter, without the charge now, will be up dramatically. So when we finish the first half, with those two elements in, we would see about low double-digit growth in EPS, when we exit the first half.","Now we get to the second half and the second half also has some interesting dynamics. Third quarter, one that we have got, quite frankly, an easier compare and we don't have a lot of noise, if you will, from the tax rate in the third. Certainly not as much as we have in the fourth. So we would see third quarter growth and fourth quarter growth to be combined a high single-digit to get us to be at least $18, but on top of that we know that in the fourth we do have this that we have to get through this discrete tax benefit, if you will, that we got in the fourth. As we get through the fourth, again, we have the rest of last year's actions that that we see continuing to help us. Obviously, the benefit of the actions we will take in March.","Then on a segment-by-segment basis, we do see our way to be guidance of at least $18 even with Software performing at its historic level, so we feel very good about the investments we have made in the Software and its profit growth trajectory as we enter 2014 and we see and feel very good about both, the book of business we have and the backlog run out we have in GBS and they have been delivering double-digit profit growth and we think they are on track.","Now, GTS, we think we get some improved margin as we get through the year and our productivity has a bigger impact on their margin content, and then as you pointed out, STG, we hope to hold neutral. I guess we are planning to hold neutral within this 2014 timeframe.","Again, we do have the share repurchase, so with a very weak first, very, very strong second, we finished the first half about little bit ahead of the run rate we need for the year and then we have to obviously offset these discrete items in the second half and we feel like we have got a good operational plan to do that.","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein","Just to clarify, Martin, for the restructuring expenses that you are expecting in Q1 and any others throughout the year. You don't expect any offsetting gains either concurrent in that quarter or at any other part of the year?","Martin Schroeter","Well, again, just to clarify. In the first quarter, we do have the gain from the sale of our Customer Care business that will be in the first and some in the second as well, but that's all that's assumed in our guidance of at least 18.","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you.","Patricia Murphy","Okay. Thanks. Could we please go to the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steven Milunovich - UBS","Martin, you talked about financial flexibility, could you expand on that a little bit? You have obviously got some cash on the balance sheet, but you do have a 39% debt-to-cap excluding the financing business, which looks to me it seem like there is not a lot of room to go there and you got certainly commitments to investors on dividends and share repurchase.","Some are talking about the need for you to do more M&A given all the technology changes, but whenever I talk to IBM, it seems like you are still very much looking at doing smaller deals that you can really leverage through your global sales force. Do you anticipate any change with M&A and what's the financial flexibility that you refer to?","Martin Schroeter","Sure. I guess, I would say a few things. First, as we have talked about for quite a while on our M&A, our strategy and our approach. We find that the financial returns and the economics of smaller deals, once we have put sort of that core competency, that core capability in place, we find that attaching smaller capabilities to those do drive exactly as you said, we are able to take advantage of those through our global distribution network, our global sales force and we get very good returns on those and we are very pleased with the way we run and the disciplined approach we have around acquisitions and we are going to continue to do exactly that.","It's worked out quite well for us and we will continue to run a disciplined process and we will continue to run a process that looks to acquire content that fits around a set of capabilities that we have and that we want to expand and drive that through our global sales and distribution network to earn returns. That's been the model that's worked quite well for us and we will continue on that.","Now, sometimes those deals are larger, sometimes are smaller. Large deal, we still think that a few billion dollar deal is still a pretty big deal. You still have to get these integrated into the business and that means teams and skills on the ground. We do have capacity to integrate any number of those deals at a single time.","That's really one of the beauties of the skills we have built as we are able to do this five or six or seven or eight times simultaneously, so we are not constrained in our acquisitions by the number of teams we can put on the ground. We can do a series of small deals that will have a terrific set of financials and we have the skills to integrate them and get those to work for us, so that is not at all an issue and we, again, feel really good about our acquisition policy process approach discipline and the results we get out of it.","Now from a financial flexibility standpoint, I think one way to look at it is our debt-to-cap and we are in the range that we are not uncomfortable in at all. Now this even may, and when we look forward, we can operate even a higher debt-to-cap, quite frankly, but the other way that we think about our financial flexibility particularly as we think about it with regard to acquisitions is our EBITDA multiple and how close we can push our uses of cash, if you will, and our debt levels against our EBITDA multiple. Remember, when we are acquiring something we have, with our disciplined process and our ability to get that integrated, we are assuming and we have been right, most of the time we are assuming we are going to get our cash back pretty quickly. Sometimes it takes a little longer. Sometimes it's very fast but those are all contributing to the operational performance. So that debt-to-cap while it's a way to think about our financial flexibility is only one way and quite frankly, I think given the cash generating natures of our acquisition activity, I think that you EBITDA multiple maybe slightly more appropriate because it is a better reflection of how hard you can push your balance sheet and still integrate the content that you know is going to pay off.","So I don't feel as though, at this debt-to-cap or at this EBITDA ratio that we have relative to our debt levels that we feel constrained in any way from doing just about any reasonable size deal and like I said, we do have disciplined process.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Keith. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Misek with Jefferies. You may ask your question.","Peter Misek - Jefferies","Thank you. Just a question on Watson and some of your other Smarter Planet and analytics offerings. There has been a high-profile or at least the Journal reported recommitment or reinvestment. How should we think of that in the context of the $20 EPS bridge? What percentage of that EPS should we be banking on from these higher growth initiatives? Just to get a sense for what kind of growth rate we should be backing into.","Martin Schroeter","Yes, okay. So, I guess I would make a few points. What we announced last week was the creation of a Watson Group and the Watson Group will have investment of a bit more than $1 billion focused on the development and the research around bringing these cloud delivered cognitive applications and services to the market. Now this is all delivered as a service, right? So it's not like you can't call it and say I want to buy a Watson. This is a service delivered through the cloud. We also announced that we would invest up to $100 million in venture investments to help support that ecosystem as the developers around the IBM Watson developers cloud build out their capabilities.","So we announced those two things. It's a couple of thousand people. It's not a small effort,. It's pretty substantial effort. Now with regard to the 2015 roadmap, I think it's important to note that like a lot of things in IBM, these are long-term investments. We do manage the business for the long-term and while we have been clear that we believe we will achieve at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015 along the way, a lot of what we are doing is paying off down the road past that and I would put Watson into that category.","So the Watson Group is part of, if you will, if you wanted to stick it into the roadmap, the Watson Group is within that overall business analytics content. Now, business analytics, for us, it hit nearly $16 billion. It hit $15.7 billion of revenue in 2013. Now the original time when we first started talking about our 2015 roadmap, we said that would be a $16 billion business. So we have since taken that up. We got there about two years early. We have since taken that up to $20 billion and the Watson Group will certainly be part of that $20 billion of revenue in the 2015 roadmap, but it is not going to be the thing that drives business analytics in that short time period.","This is a much longer term investment and it's consistent with the way we manage the business. We see trends over the longer term. We have to obviously invest in those trends and this is a good example. So the Watson Group will deliver in the new field of cognitive computing. It does it through the cloud because it's going to be as a service kind of offering and we think building out this ecosystem with the right amount of investment is the right thing to do now, even though it's not going to be a big part of the 2015 roadmap.","Peter Misek - Jefferies","The Business Analytics bridge remains the same? $20 billion is what we expect by 2015. I guess that was the more specific question as it's related to 2015?","Martin Schroeter","Yes. That's correct.","Peter Misek - Jefferies","Thank you.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Peter. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. You may ask your question.","Jim Suva - Citi","Thank you very much. Martin, The signing that you had 17.5 this quarter. When we look at the full year rolls up to about 11% year-over-year which is very impressive. Can you just help us understand little bit about the last few quarters have been down year-over-year, so the first half of the year is very strong on your signings then they were soft in second half of the year.","As that 11% rolls forward next year, should we look to start to see some healthy growth or is there a little bit of margin headwind from it, or how should we think about especially how the first half being so positive year-over-year and second half is slowing. I assume a lot of it has to do with the BRIC or growth countries, but maybe you can shed some light? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. Jim. Thanks for the question. I think there are a couple of points to made here. First, signings, as you know and you could hear it within the data you are quoting, signings can be volatile in any given quarter and backlog is another element that we have been sharing because that signings content all goes into a backlog and then it drives, obviously, the future revenue opportunity and I am going to come back to that in a second because your question, I think, about the future is more going to be around the backlog we see as opposed to maybe the signings in any given quarter.","Now, backlog we finished up 5% year-to-year and full year Services signings were pretty strong growth on a constant currency basis, in fact, it's about the best growth we have seen in the past five years.","Now in the fourth quarter, the signings were up 1% at constant currency versus the third and maybe this is to your point of how volatile they are. The third was down four, so we went from down four to up one. The dynamic we saw in going from third to fourth was interesting in that in the third our long-term signings were down double-digit, while in the fourth they swapped to up double digits, so very good performance in the longer-term, more transformational kind of content in the fourth and then in the shorter-term contracts they were up single-digit in the third and they moved to down double-digit in the fourth.","Some of that is because we are mixing our signings. We are mixing our delivery to higher value managed services like business continuity and security and cloud, so you are exactly right, signings is obviously volatile. There is a bit of a shift that we see in our bookings in third going to fourth, again, driven by very good acceptance and pretty strong growth in our longer term, more transformative kind of content outsourcing and those tend to be bigger deals, in fact our larger, deals say greater than $100 million.","For the full year, we are up 40% versus the prior year, so we are seeing very good growth in those bigger deals. Now, when we talk about backlog, again backlog we finished the year up 5% at constant currency. There are a couple of things to note about, I think, that are worth note about backlog.","First, we are going to close on the sale of our customer care business and that's going to have an impact to the backlog. Though while the revenue from the backlog that we see coming out of the total would drive us to a positive growth rate the losses, the backlog and the loss of the revenue out of that customer care business is going to drive it to a small negative and we are obviously prepared for that. We know. We have that covered in our guidance for the year, but we are going to see an impact from the sale of that business within that specific element that you mentioned which is revenue coming out of the backlog.","Now the whole year isn't driven out of the backlog. 70% of our revenue in any given year might be out of the backlog, but the other 30% is coming from our in-year or in-quarter shorter term signings and we have seen volatility there as well. Our base business outside of the backlog struggled a bit in the fourth, we saw a single-digit decline out of that, so we will see growth out of the backlog on an adjusted basis, if you will, without the customer care business and then the rest of the growth will have to come from our base business.","Now, within that base business, we do have things like our cloud offering, and cloud grew very, very well. While it doesn't show up in the backlog necessarily, it does provide growth within that other 30%.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Jim. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Scott Craig - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. If I can get one clarification in there. The workforce rebalancing in the first quarter, is that included as an expense in the $18?","Then my second question is around the cash flow. You did a great job of providing the bridge to kind of get to the $18 in 2014. Can you maybe go into a little more detail on some of the free cash flow pushes and pulls for 2014? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, absolutely. So first, just for clarification, our at least $18 of guidance is all-in. So it has workforce rebalancing charges in it. It has the small gain that we expect. It's all-in, of at least $18, all-in basis and like the roadmap, it's an all-in roadmap of at least $20. So if we were to just hit the bottom end of our current guidance of at least $18, we would have another $2 to go, to finish out that roadmap. So yes, it's on an all-in basis.","On cash flow. So we had a difficult cash flow year in 2013. As you heard in the prepared remarks, we were down year-to-year, a bit over $3 billion. If we were to kind of split up the attribution for that, as we did on the call, operational performance, as I mentioned we lost $1.7 billion of profit year-to-year just in the STG business which had a profound impact on our cash. So operational challenges; we had a cash tax headwind in 2013 and then we had a slightly less efficient balance sheet working capital, if you will, in 2013 as well which drove the year-to-year decline in 2013.","Now as we go to 2014, we said we will grow free cash flow by about $1 billion, a little bit faster than net income, but by about $1 billion. Within that $1 billion, we still have a cash tax headwind of about $2 billion this year. So a larger cash tax headwind but I want to talk about cash, and the bridge, by the way, comes from improved operational performance within the business and we will improve our working capital position, if you will. That will drive the year-to-year improvement in 2013 to 2014.","But I would like to also spend a minute on free cash flow from a model perspective. From a model perspective we finished last year, if I were to look at free cash flow on a ratio basis, say, to net income on a free cash flow realization basis, we finished the year in the low-90s on a realization basis. As I mentioned, this $1 billion would, and a little bit faster than net income, so obviously the math says we will improve that a little bit in 2014. But we would still be, we think, in the low-90s, even in 2014. Then in 2015 we would see another improvement when cash tax isn't as big a headwind and we would see an improvement back to the mid-90 level.","Now, that mid-90 level, relative to what we have seen in the past on a realization basis, is below where we have been when it was north of 100%, right? We ran the free cash flow realization north of 100% for many years and a big chunk of this is the difference between the cash tax and the book tax. Now when we go forward on a model basis, we are very comfortable that in the mid-90s, our model holds over the long-term and by model, I mean, our model of being able to continue to invest to either build or acquire capabilities that we need to continue to pay the dividend, if I oversimplify all this in terms of uses of cash; invest to grow; pay the dividend; and then return excess cash, if you will, to shareholders.","Now in the past, when we were north of 100% on a realization basis, that share repurchase element could drive five, six, seven points of EPS growth year-to-year. That's not what our model would say we need and on a model basis if we were to be in that mid-90s, we would still deliver three to four points of EPS growth, just from the share repurchase. So on free cash flow, again, I know you asked a 2014 question, but 2014 we will grow again and we will improve that realization but even when we look out longer term on a model basis, we are comfortable that in the mid-90s, which we will get back to by 2015 in the mid-90s, the model and a simplified view, the model, from a uses perspective the model will hold.","Scott Craig - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Patricia Murphy","Good. Can we take the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good afternoon. Coming into the fourth quarter, you expected better sales execution in China, which doesn't appear to have come through. Can you just talk about what you have learned over the past three months around the drivers of weakness in China and what you now think it takes and what the right timeline is to return to growth?","Martin Schroeter","Sure. Thanks, Katie, and good afternoon. I will just go through a couple of data points here. As you saw, we did degrade to minus 3 on a constant currency basis in the fourth, from minus 2 in the third on a global basis. That one point degradation, when you look at the majors was really centered in the z cycle and centered in the U.S., so, I will leave that off to the side because, again, we are comfortable with the z cycle and where we are.","When we look in GMU, which was the nature of your question, we did see that same one point degradation and it is not what we wanted to get done. Now, we continue to struggle in Hardware, we were still down double-digits in hardware, a little better sequentially from third to fourth, but still down double-digits.","Services across the growth market areas went from a small positive to a small negative in GTS. GBS went from low single-digit growth to high single-digit growth, so they actually did quite well, but it's a smaller part of the business so it doesn't have as profound an impact on the overall, so when we looked at third quarter to fourth quarter, China is still an issue.","Now, let's recognize that China is going through a very significant economic set of reform, so in March 2013, history that everyone knows, but on March of 2013 a new leadership team in November that they announced, some pretty significant structural changes and we referred to those in the last call and we are waiting to see what they were and they looked, in our opinion, they looked quite significant. Now, many of those changes will affect the state-owned enterprises and those state-owned enterprises are quite frankly some of our largest accounts.","To go from that view of the world down to what did we learn, well, we actually always knew this, but we have to continue to make progress. We are centered pretty heavily in state-owned enterprises, so it has a pretty profound impact on our business when they slow their purchasing.","From an execution standpoint, we know we have to spread more into other elements of the buying patterns that we see in China and we will get that done, but it's not surprising I guess to us given our concentration in state-owned enterprises that it's having an impact on us.","In many ways, yes, we are in state-owned enterprises, but it's exactly where we want to be. When you think about building an infrastructure for a country, if you will, the IBM platform is critical to do that, so of course we want heavy reliance or to be in those accounts. When they slow down then we also see an impact, so from an execution standpoint, we recognize that we have to widen, if you will, our client.","On the state-owned enterprises and others, while they have slowed, we don't think that this opportunity is gone away if you will. There is still opportunity. In fact, our interpretation of some of the structural changes they announced suggests that we will have expanded opportunities, particularly in regional banking and some privately owned enterprises.","As we expand our footprint in China, we do still see good long-term opportunity. In fact, we continue to invest in China to try to capture that opportunity, but it will take some time to come back. It's not going to rebound immediately. Now, the other thing, just math, we do get easier compares in the first and the second and the third quarter obviously, so that provides a bit of a tailwind.","Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Could you grow in China by the fourth quarter of this year? Will it take longer than that?","Martin Schroeter","It's hard to tell. China is hard to tell, because I don't have a good sense of how those reforms work their way through the system and the decision-making that goes all around it. This is a, as I am sure you will appreciate it, pretty complex environment and it's difficult to gauge exactly what's going to happen on a roll-out basis.","Now, if we look at the growth markets in total, we are comfortable that we are on a trajectory to growth. We will be on a trajectory to growth as we exit 2014 and we are comfortable that we get back to mid-single digits across the growth market regions by the end of the year but again, second half statement more than an immediate statement.","Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much.","Patricia Murphy","Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, Martin. I appreciate the color today. I just want to come back to the tax rate, though. If we kind of adjust 2013 and 2014 for the tax rate, it really implies your business has to improve substantially moving through 2014. With China still kind of in this holding pattern, and your hardware still struggling, the high-end support seems to be a bit more of a secular challenge or technology challenge. What should investors think about as the top three pivot points that you are really looking to, to really have this confidence that you can reiterate both the $18 EPS target as well as the $20 target for 2015 notwithstanding the tax rate?","Martin Schroeter","Right, so I guess, we did obviously get a substantial tax benefit in the fourth, but it's not that tax rate, I think it's really the underlying business that is what we are, obviously, focused on improving and again, as I said earlier, that hardware impact has been dramatic in all of 2013. The currency impact has been dramatic in 2013. So when we look at the other elements of our business, including in software, we will grow software very consistently with what we grew in prior years and that assumption is obviously within the at least $18, but it also is an assumption that we feel very comfortable with to get to the guidance for 2014.","On services, we do see good momentum in GBS. We finished the second half of the year with double-digit profit growth in GBS. In GTS, based on the contracts we have and the time that those contracts have been in place and the productivity therefore that we believe we can drive out of services, we see services back at a model level of growth. Again, share repurchase and the overall enterprise productivity initiatives we expect that at least $18 is right in line with what we should be able to deliver.","The other element of this is, we don't have a year-to-year impact from our restructuring in 2014. It was $1 billion last year. It will be about $1 billion again this year. So we eliminate that year-to-year and without the year-to-year impact from hardware that allows that software and that services profit growth to show up in the bottom line. So without the hardware profit growth impact, less of an impact from currency as we stated, services performing at model, if you will, and software at its historical growth rate along with EPS, we will refill that tax impact and get back to $23, but importantly we are comfortable with the at least $18.","Patricia Murphy","Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Yes. Hi, Martin. Just a clarification. In the March quarter, you expect $1 billion restructuring charge from rebalancing activities and $150 gain from the sale of assets. Is that correct?","Patricia Murphy","Yes. I think the $150 is--","Martin Schroeter","The $150, it will close over the first half.","Patricia Murphy","Right.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay.","Martin Schroeter","The $150 closes. It's not all in the first quarter.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Because I think when you are saying 14% of the year's EPS, that the $18 is in the first quarter, this is really a number that includes a massive restructuring charge that is normally allocated over a years' time. So my question is why don't we back out when we restructure restructuring charge, which is non-operating and back out gains when we have gains, which are not operating. I think investors would like that because it gives them a view in the operating performance of IBM?","Martin Schroeter","Well, I guess I would say a few things. So first, just to make sure you are clear. The first quarter we would expect a substantial charge, right, about same as last year, plus or minus $100 million, and we have the gain, but not all 150s some of it.","The roadmap we have laid out, the roadmap is a way for us to allocate capital and it's a way for us to describe to investor how we shift the portfolio that shift of the portfolio includes acquisitions includes divestitures, it includes our rebalancing the workforce and all of that translates to an EPS at the end. That EPS is reflective of all those activities. It's got the workforce rebalancing, it's got the gains if there are any, it has got the shift of investment, the roadmap is in an all-in basis, if you will, and our guidance is also on an all-in basis.","I think, the right way to look at our business is to keep it on the basis in which we have described our longer term performance, not only two years away from the end of the roadmap now, but our longer term performance is one where as we shift the value, we acquire, we divest and it is important I think to look at the totality of that earnings power and that's the way and again that why we built our roadmap the way we built the guidance.","Patricia Murphy","Okay.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. If there was a gain later in the year, that would be incremental to the 18, but it is not currently in your guidance, outside of the 150?","Martin Schroeter","As I said the only gain we have is this first half, it is $150 million gain. That's what we have in our guidance.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Right. Thank you.","Patricia Murphy","Can we please take one more question?","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","Thank you. Hi, Martin. I was wondering if we could just go back to the Services numbers just for a minute, and my recollection from the third quarter call was that there was an expectation is that sequentially the year-over-year growth rates would improve for both, GBS and GTS.","Can you help us understand what items maybe impacting the Services growth other than the GMUs and how we should think about the trajectory of that business in 2014, particularly given the headwind to backlog from the sale of the customer care business?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, David. You know, GBS grew 4% which was in line with its prior quarter, and we think even within that we took share, within that GBS content, we continue to move capability toward our Digital Front Office offerings and those have been very successful and so what's driving the growth in GBS, it's both, our success in the Digital Front Office and the momentum coming from business we have booked into the backlog in prior quarters and we see that continuing on the GBS side into 2014.","In GTS, the growth markets were an impact in GTS in the fourth. Now, we think when we look at that business and its trajectory changed from two-fourth from the third, we do see a continued investment required in some of our growth market clients, which is driving some of that content and we have signed some big contracts during the year. We see us in a stage of early stage of some contracts where the productivity quite frankly as you would expect, is not as high, so as we get into 2014, and those contracts specifically mature, and the investments we have made in some of those GMU clients payoff, we do see a bit of a tailwind.","Now, on the revenue side in GTS, as you pointed out, we do see growth in the backlog, but we are going to lose the impact of the customer care business, which we think, again, knocks the revenue side of that down to a small negative.","Patricia Murphy","Okay. Thanks, David. I want to thank you all for your questions and now I am going to turn it back to the operator.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended.

This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM. I\u2019m here with Mark Loughridge, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO, Finance and Enterprise Transformation. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings presentation. The prepared remarks will be available in roughly an hour, and a replay of this webcast will be posted to our Investor Relations website by this time tomorrow.","Our presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors.

Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from us in Investor Relations.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark Loughridge.","","Mark Loughridge","Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter we reported $25.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross, pre-tax, and net operating margins, and delivered operating earnings per share of $3.51, up 14% year to year, and generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion, up 9%.","So when you look at it, our results demonstrate the strength of IBM\u2019s business model, which is designed to deliver profiting cash on a sustainable basis. Consistent with this performance, we're increasing our full-year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10. This is up $0.10 from our previous view of at least $15.","I will comment on a couple of the second quarter highlights by segment. In software, we had mid-single digits constant currency growth in Europe and Japan, double-digit growth in the growth markets, while the U.S. growth was lower due to very stronger performance a year ago.","Services growth of constant currency was consistent with last quarter, with our annuity content providing a solid base of revenue on profit. Our backlog was flat year to year at constant currency, and we again expanded margins and grew our combined services segment profit by 18%.","Our hardware business declined as you would expect at this point in our product cycles though we continue to extend our share leadership in our two high-end server brands. In total IBM\u2019s revenue growth at constant currency was fairly consistent with the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a currency headwind, but it got even tougher over the last 90 days, when you look at the reported revenue, currency impacted our revenue growth by almost 4 points or a $1 billion of revenue. But despite of this headwind we generated strong operating profit performance, with pretax and net income each of 8%.","Now an important element of our long-term model is to expand margin through a combination of productivity and mix to higher margin businesses. This quarter, we expanded operating gross margin by 1.5 with two-thirds due to improvement in segment margins and the other third from mix. We improved operating PTI margins by more than 2 points and operating net margin by 1.6 points, so this quarter again we demonstrated the flexibility in our model. Bottom-line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.51, which was up 14% year-to-year.","Turning to cash, we generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, that's up 9% slightly faster than net income, when you consider the last 12 months we\u2019ve generated a record $18 billion of free cash flow. With this strong cash performance, we delivered significant returns to shareholders with $4 billion in share repurchases and dividends this quarter, and nearly $17 billion over the last 12 months.","Now I'll get into the second quarter details, starting with revenue by geography, where I\u2019ll discuss the results on a constant currency basis. In the Americas, Canada was up, while the U.S. again was flat year-to-year. EMEA was also flat year-to-year slowing just a point from last quarter\u2019s growth rate, but in total still relatively stable as in the past there is a good bit of variability by country. We had growth again in the U.K. and Spain, Germany was flat, while France and Italy declined.","Overall revenue on our major market countries was down 1% year-to-year. With 8% growth, our growth markets rate outpaced the major markets by 9 points. Even with the tough compare the BRICs had another good quarter combined they were up 12%. We had particular strength in Russia and China. In fact China was up over 20% this quarter again gaining share.","We\u2019re continuing to build our capabilities here. We\u2019ve expanded the number of branch offices and now have 68 phase to phase and over 100 virtual branch offices open across all of China. Across the growth markets this quarter more than 30 countries grew at a double-digit growth rate.","So our strength is broad based. We\u2019re capturing the opportunity from these faster growing economies and importantly we\u2019re taking share due in part to the acceleration of our market expansion initiatives. In fact this is our eighth consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets. So now let me add a little color to our revenue on gross margin by segment.","For total services both outsourcing and transactional revenues were up 1% of constant currency and we're continuing to deliver strong growth in our growth market countries. In software this quarter, we had good growth in our business analytics and storage management offerings.","Our systems and technology revenue decline was roughly inline with our first quarter rate. This quarter we again put share on power driven by competitive displacements.","Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 1.5 points driven by a combination of solid margin expansion in both services segment and an improving segment mix due to the relative growth of software.","Now let\u2019s take a look below the gross profit line to our expense in spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 6% this is driven by currency for both translation and hedging dynamics.","Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove two points of expense growth. And our base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was down one point. I will comment on a couple of expense items.","First, it wasn't a significant driver year-to-year; we had about $150 million of workforce were balancing in the quarter primarily in Europe. Second, we had the year-to-year benefit from our hedging programs, which as you know cannot be looked at in isolation, as it mitigates the translation impacts across the P&L. We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in our global cash planning. Last year, hedging programs generated fairly significant losses and impact or expense of $195 million, while this year the programs generated gains about $85 million in expense. This represents over three quarters of our hedging activity, the balance is in cost. This is the dynamic you would expect given the year-to-year change in currencies, but again this hedge activity mitigates translation impacts throughout the P&L.","So now let me go into the segments. The two services segments delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pre-tax profit by 18% and expanded pre-tax margin by three points. Backlog was $136 billion, down 6% year-to-year at actual rates and flat at constant currency.","Overall, services revenue performance at constant currency was fairly consistent with last quarter. The growth markets were up 10% at constant currency with good backlog growth and the major markets were down 1% at constant currency. Within the major markets looking at revenue North America was stable, Japan was still down that we did see some improvement over the last quarter and Europe decelerated compared to last quarter. And we continued the strong performance in our business analytics, Cloud and Smarter Planet offerings.","Overall profit performance was very strong, with 24% growth in Global Technology Services pre-tax profit, and 7% growth in Global Business Services profit.","Moving on to the two segments, in Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, down 2% as reported, and up 2% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% at constant currency. Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 4% at constant currency, with the growth markets up nearly 16% at constant currency.","Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin, with pre-tax income up 24%, and pre-tax margin up 3.6 points. Last quarter, I commented on the tremendous amount of work that GTS has done to manage their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Specifically, by taking a disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts. This work continues to yield benefits in both profit and margin, and accounted for about one third of the gross margin expansion in GTS this quarter. Although there will be some modest impact to revenue from this work going forward, we should see ongoing benefits to the portfolio.","Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, down 4% as reported, and down 1% at constant currency. Consulting and Systems Integration revenues were flat year-to-year at constant currency and Application Outsourcing revenues declined 1% at constant currency. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to perform well, with their fifth consecutive quarter of 10% growth or better.","North America was relatively stable, while Japan was down. This quarter revenue in Europe decreased 3% at constant currency after being flat last quarter. Now looking at the growth initiatives, within GBS, we have been remixing and shifting more resources to these higher value growth initiatives. This quarter, GBS revenue included strong growth in Business Analytics, which was up 28%, and Smarter Planet, up 15%. But GBS\u2019 value extends beyond what is reported in the GBS segment. They play a key role in driving the growth initiatives across IBM, where we are seeing continued strong performance. And finally, GBS returned to a more typical level of profitability, as we indicated on our last call. So this quarter, pre-tax income grew 7%, and pre-tax margin improved by 1.8 points.","Software revenue of $6.2 billion was flat as reported, and up 4% at constant currency. Key Branded Middleware, which accounted for 64% of total software revenue in the second quarter, increased 4% at constant currency, in line with the market. Software performed well in the growth markets where revenue was up double digits, and Europe and Japan both grew at mid single digits, all in constant currency. Growth in the U.S. was impacted by a very tough compare. We see great opportunity in our global software business and are hiring 200 to 300 sales representatives each month through year end.","Now, let me take you through the drivers for a few of the brands. WebSphere","grew 7% at constant currency, and gained share for the 15th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had good growth in our Commerce and Portals offerings. This quarter we acquired Tealeaf, a provider of customer experience management software, which enables our clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile devices.","Information Management was up 3% at constant currency and held share. Netezza continued to expand its global footprint, with very strong growth in Europe, Japan and growth markets, and added nearly 70 new clients worldwide. This quarter we closed two more acquisitions expanding our business analytics and optimization software capabilities: Varicent, an analytics software company that helps optimize sales performance management; and Vivisimo, which enhances IBM\u2019s Big Data initiative by helping clients analyze volume, variety and velocity of Big Data for strategic advantage.","Tivoli software was up 6% at constant currency and gained share, driven by storage software growth of 13% at constant currency. Tivoli Storage Management continues to perform exceptionally well, growing double digits at constant currency for the sixth consecutive quarter.","Within our security offerings, we are utilizing recent acquisitions such as Q1Labs to provide end-to-end risk management solutions to protect our clients against the latest threats, while reducing the costs and complexity of security.","Turning to profit, Software pre-tax income grew 8% to $2.5 billion, and pre-tax margins increased 2.7 points to 35.9%. Systems & Technology revenue of $4.3 billion was down 9%, or 7% at constant currency, following very strong growth across the portfolio a year ago.","System z revenue declined 9% at constant currency, and MIPS declined 8% with a mix toward specialty engines. System z profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the upgrade cycle. Power revenue was down 4% at constant currency this quarter. We had continued strength this quarter in Power high performance computing solutions. In June, IBM achieved the top speed rating in the world, and we earned three of the top four spots on the TOP500 project, which ranks the world\u2019s most powerful computers. We continued our success in competitive displacements in the second quarter, with over 320 displacements that drive over $265 million of business. As you would expect, these came from a combination of HP and Oracle\/Sun. This initiative has helped drive our seventeenth consecutive quarter of share gains in Power. System x revenue was down 5% at constant currency. Our high-end segment grew double digits. Storage hardware revenue was flat at constant currency, with the value continuing to shift to software, as you saw with the ongoing success we\u2019re having in our Tivoli storage software offerings.","In the second quarter, we introduced and began shipping PureFlex, the first offering from our new PureSystems family of expert integrated systems. PureFlex optimizes workloads and drives hardware efficiencies. In the third quarter, the PureApplication system will become available and we expect volume shipments in the fourth quarter. PureApplication will do for software, what PureFlex does for hardware, by driving application efficiency and rapid deployment, to enable faster time to value.","Turning to cash flow, we generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up $300 million year to year. Over the last 12 months, we generated a record $18 billion in free cash flow. Through the first half, our free cash flow of $5.5 billion was up $1.4 billion year-to-year. The growth was driven by net income. As I\u2019ve mentioned previously, in the first quarter of last year our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments driven by audit settlement activity. But even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow.","Looking at the uses of our cash in the first half, we spent almost $2 billion to acquire eight companies, including Vivisimo, Varicent and Tealeaf which closed in the second quarter. We returned almost $8 billion to the shareholders in the first half. We spent $6 billion in share repurchase to buyback almost 31 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, we had $9.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. We took our dividend up 13% in April, and through June we paid out $1.8 billion. This is the 17th consecutive year that we raised our dividend, and the ninth year in a row of double-digit increases.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.2 billion. Total debt was $32.4 billion of which $22.6 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $9.8 billion, and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 36%. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.","So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Once again, margin expansion was the largest contributor to growth, as our continued focus on productivity and mix to higher value drove improvements in gross, pre-tax, and net margins year to year. And our ongoing share repurchase program contributed the balance, at a level fairly consistent with last quarter.","This quarter, we delivered 14% EPS growth and $3.7 billion in free cash flow, despite facing a couple of headwinds. First, we had a strong second quarter last year, with 12% revenue growth, so we had a challenging compare. And second, we are dealing with pretty significant currency dynamics, which impacted our revenue line by about $1 billion. But in spite of these, IBM\u2019s business model enabled our strong profit performance in the current environment.","Now let me comment on a few of the key elements of our model. First, we have been investing to capture opportunities and deliver client value in high growth markets: emerging countries, as well as our key growth initiatives. In the first half, our growth markets countries delivered 9% growth at constant currency. Our business analytics portfolio of services and offerings were up 13% in the first half, led by our GBS consulting practice. In Cloud, we doubled last year\u2019s revenue, with contribution from all areas, private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions. And in the first half, we had revenue growth of more than 20% in the Smarter Planet portfolio, driven by industry specific solutions and our Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities offerings. So we\u2019re getting real performance from the investments we\u2019re making in our growth initiatives.","Another important and unique aspect of our model is the balance between annuity businesses and transaction businesses. Our annuity businesses, which make up the majority of services and software, and reflect our long-term relationships with our clients, provide a solid base of revenue, profit and cash.","Third, we have had underway for some time a series of initiatives to drive productivity. These are real structural changes that improve our business and margins over time, on a sustained, durable basis. This quarter we again expanded our margins, and this year we\u2019ll make further progress towards delivering the productivity savings included in our roadmap.","Finally, we continue to grow our free cash flow and have a solid balance sheet, which allows us to invest in the business while returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. So a combination of our strategy and our business model enabled us to generate strong profit growth in the current environment. And now looking at our first half performance, we\u2019re increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10, on track to at least $20 in 2015.","Now Patricia and I will take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Mark for final comments.","Operator, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we would like to begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Toni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Yes, thank you. Mark, you commented on a couple of headwinds namely the top comparison in currency dynamics. Absent from that was any commentary on the macroeconomic environment. And I\u2019m wondering if you can comment on that, particularly in light of services performance because I think when we entered 2012 you said, 70% of services revenue in 2012 will come from backlog and that 70% will be up 3%, with your total services business in the first half is tracking well below that. So perhaps you can address the macroeconomic question in the context to the fact that the services revenue that you are generating this year appears to be very weak?","Mark Loughridge","Okay, Toni very good question. Let me start from a macro perspective for the second quarter. First of all, if you look at the kind of geographic breakdown going first quarter to second quarter, Americas was up 2% in the first one to 1% of the second quarter, really that differential was due to the software compare that we had in the second quarter of last year. And if you look at the third quarter just based on a compare basis, we\u2019ll pick up another 2.5 points, so I feel pretty confident about that content, as it going to the third.","Europe was up 1% in the first quarter, relatively flat in the second quarter; we will talk about that a little more. In Asia, it went from plus 1% in the first quarter to up 4%, so real strength in Asia.","If you look at the distribution of that performance across the month, that was relatively linear; in other words, it didn\u2019t have big fluctuations across the month, but if anything, it relatively strengthened as we went through the quarter, so June was little stronger than the rest of the quarter. In some of our transactional businesses like our hardware base of business, in fact, we noticed that against typical ways of performance had a pretty [down good] last week of the quarter, indicating momentum as we are going at the third. So that\u2019s why I\u2019d give kind of an overview.","Now from a markets perspective, let\u2019s talk about the growth markets. They continue to perform well across the board; BRIC countries were up 12%, they represent about a third of our overall growth market business; within that China was up the very impressive 24%, and I\u2019d remind you, we now have opened our 68th face-to-face branch in China, we have over 100 virtual branches. Total growth markets outpace the majors again by 9 points, this quarter up 8% on a constant currency basis and within that, we have 32 countries up double digits, every sector grew, every brand grew, software and services were up 10% our z business in the growth markets was up 11%, so I think this reflects really kind of broad based strong performance in those markets.","Major markets as you would expect little more mix, I just going to spend a little time on Europe; within Europe, we did see growth than the U.K. and Spain, U.K. for their 11th quarter in the row, Spain, the seventh quarter, Germany was flat and now this is the third quarter of either flat to modest growth at Germany, but again, Italy and France were down, so kind of mixed performance within the European geography.","Third, I kind of look at brand performance, so on a software base, we had strong performance in Europe and Asia. And in North America was really, as I said earlier, kind of an issue of compares which we can talk about a little later.","Hardware at this point in the cycle, no real surprises, and I said early, if anything z did a little better job as it went through the quarter. Again, real strength in z, up a 11% in growth markets. In services, I would say, really pretty consistent with last quarter.","Now to your services point, if you do the math, we had said, that opening backlog drives about 70% of revenue. So 70% of the 3% backlog run out would be about 2%. So if you look at GTS, certainly that a conformed with that kind of a relationship. In GBS, we are down 1%, we did see in GBS, some improvements in Japan in public sector but they were still down.","Now within the GBS business, what I\u2019d point out within the organizational structure, as we move resource some kind of historical big rollout complex product structures, that are often times custom into our growth initiatives, you\u2019ll see some impact in that translation, but what we see in those growth initiatives within GTS, really strong growth performance, up double-digit across the board within GBS, and likewise, then IBM, up strong double-digit across the board, pulling with it about 50% software mix. Within that GBS content alone, the margins within those growth initiatives are about three points richer than the balance of the business and that help, contribute to return to proper growth in the GBS in the second quarter, up 7%.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Toni. Let\u2019s go to the next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","","Okay, thank you. Looking at the guidance, can you help us understand your thoughts on both the earnings and revenue trajectory to the third and the fourth quarter? And regarding the sale of the point-of-sale business that you talked about last quarter, how should we think about the timing of that gain now and the timing of the work force for balancing charges that will periodically counter that gain?","Mark Loughridge","Sure. Great question, Bill. So if you look at the full year we\u2019ve taken our guidance up to at least $15.10 and that would imply for the second half about 10% EPS growth. Now within that EPS growth, it\u2019s reasonably distributed across both the third and the fourth quarter if anything a little skewed to the fourth quarter of the new product announcements. Currency in the second half is going to be a headwind, about four to five points in the third quarter, two to three points in the fourth and that spot rates that would be a headwind for us, about $2 billion in the second half compared to the $1 billion that we just had in the second quarter.","On a third quarter basis, I would say that our constant currency revenue growth should be approximately equal to what we saw in the dynamics in the first half of the year with the fourth quarter really presenting opportunity with our new announcements for additional growth. So back to your second half of your question, we regard this really as an all in forecast. We realized that we do have some tax headwind as we entered the third and the fourth quarter. The divestiture of our retail store systems business should generate a gain of about $450 million to $550 million in the second half. We do expect to close that shortly with the major countries really closing first. So the gain will be recognized as we close those counties and get the cash. And I would expect that both of that to happen in third quarter, but based on country closing some may extend in to the fourth.","Now, as we\u2019ve discussed a number of times in the past, when we get that cash inflow from a divestiture, we put that to good work to improve the productivity of our business and that\u2019s why these divestitures are accretive to IBM. So constantly, we will also have workforce rebalancing in the second half, I expect slightly greater than the first half of 2012. Now that workforce rebalancing will be focused on our non-U.S. operations, very little, but really in the U.S. So all in all, we feel optimistic about our hand for the second half in spite of the headwinds that we see.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Bill. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thank a lot. Mark, when I look at your earnings year-over-year, you improved about $0.42 and I can get about $0.17 from share repo, but I get like $0.23 from GTS margin expansion considering revenue was down a little. That was a really good margin performance in GTS. I guess the question is how sustainable is this 3.6 percentage point improvement year-over-year, can you just \u2013 you went over it already in the call little bit, can you reiterate what you\u2019re doing to make that sustainable in GTS and maybe how those rebalancings are working into the equation as well? Thanks.","Mark Loughridge","Sure, sure, absolutely, Ben. So first of all in the context, as we go into the second half of the year for our services business, we see strong profit growth across services from both the GTS and GBS organizations. So I think we have a very good hand as we go into. Now you know we run this business for profit and cash contribution, a couple of key dynamics within that, within GMU, we had very good margin performance in our business there, our revenue in GMU, our growth markets unit is up 10%, that\u2019s 10 points faster than we see in the major markets. In fact, over time that\u2019s driven our backlog to also be up 10% in our growth markets unit.","Our transactional business, if you look at the growth initiatives, cloud is more than double, so consequently we see our backlog up to 6%. We have growth in really 14 straight quarters in our transactional business. And I want to return again to the work that we\u2019re doing on ongoing basis in productivity because I think a lot of this is really leadership work on the part of our services organization, especially the GTS content that we saw this quarter driving that 24% increase year-to-year.","A lot of that is driven by automation and the partnering that they\u2019ve done with research that gives us unique capability that I don\u2019t think you\u2019d see in our competitors. As well as utilizing the global scale, but once again I want to turn to the work that we\u2019ve done on the distribution of profitability in our contract. So once again, if you imagine this as a normal curve distribution of the profitability within the services contracts, they did a very discrete piece of work on how to improve the value contribution in the context of those \u2013 contracts in that weaker end of the distribution.","And that contributed about a third of that 24%, we should see that ongoing to some degree as we go through the year, and I think as we continue to work on that weaker side of the distribution and move actually the average to the right, we continue to contribute. Again, if you wanted to put in a context of backlog, to generate that same level of profitability in our outsourcing business, our opening backlog this year would have needed to have been richer by about $5 billion to $10 billion. So once again you can see how the impact of that work, how it is relative to the backlog and I think it\u2019s very consistent with our overall objective to manage these business for profit and cash generation.","Patricia Murphy","","Thank you, Ben. Operator, can we take the next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Scott Craig with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Scott D. Craig \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Hey thanks. Good afternoon. Hi Mark can you go through a little bit with regards to the systematic disciplined approach being taken with some of the lower margin businesses in the services side. So where are we in that process and how much of that been helping the margins and should we expect that to continue here for six months or 12 months, how do you think about that whole dynamic? Thank you.","Mark Loughridge","Well, first of all I want to point out that that work really driving that impact really is something that the GTS organization has been implementing relatively over the past six to nine months starting out. So, and the objective was, we do so much work in driving our competitive position on the engagement, what can we do to really help drive our level of productivity in a ongoing basis as well. And so to start that, it seemed very logical, let\u2019s pick the contracts that really in that left tail of the distribution of contracts.","So that was the first starting point that they took. And then they applied kind of leadership delivery content, real value ad content and these are elements that when you apply them to the left hand tail of the distribution, if you can move that average it has tremendous impacts. So I think that that approach, that approach of really on an ongoing basis working hard to apply better value contribution to drive that margin is something that we can continue to apply both in our GTS and GBS businesses and they really had substantial impact that contribute to that operational performance that we saw in GTS.","Patricia Murphy","","Thanks, Scott. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners. You may ask your question.","Robert Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","","Hi. Thank you very much. I was wondering if I could, I guess, dig into the hardware a little deeper, and I guess there\u2019s two things really, the mainframe although is down, was certainly down less than what I\u2019ve thought. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give some color there. And then, with System x, I guess that would be, it was weaker even with the new [runway] cycle and it looks like you\u2019ve lost a little share. Is there anything positioning-wise going on there or do you think it\u2019s just the product cycling or any change within IBM? Do you think that the high-end was strong? Thanks.","Mark Loughridge","","Sure. Well, if you look at the high-end performance, I quite agree with your observation. For this position in the product cycle we do really have stronger z performance than you would have statistically kind of expected to have. A lot of that, in my opening remarks, we saw downward growth in our z content in the growth markets. And so, the growth market z content was up 11%. Well, you can drive 11% growth in the substantial part of your business in those growth markets that have new opportunities for us that obviously has substantial leverage in our business.","So the z performance did improve. Some of that was backend loaded in the quarter and we did see, as I pointed out earlier, that last week of the quarter we saw an uptick in our SCV business as we left the second entry and the third. On an x basis, they really did face a very tough competitor last year. If you remember they were up 15% in 2011. So that really did contribute to a lot of it.","The high-end, we did have a double-digit growth and we\u2019ve had double-digit growth on the high-end for eight of the last nine quarters including the second quarter. So as we go into the second half, we do have some very good content the x series business will take advantage of their content within peer systems. And they will be part of the move as we go into our second half announcements of volume roll out.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Rob. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Marshall with ISI Group. You may ask your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks. This is Stephen calling for Brian. We\u2019ve been hearing a lot lately about the new public cloud offerings, and I was wondering if you could talk a bit more...","Patricia Murphy","Brian, it\u2019s kind of hard to hear you. Can you start again?","Unidentified Analyst","Can you hear me better now?","Patricia Murphy","Much better. Thank you.","Unidentified Analyst","We\u2019ve been hearing a lot lately about new public cloud offerings and I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about your progress with smart cloud, what kind of adoption are you seeing and are there any particular services that are driving your growth in public cloud?","Mark Loughridge","Well, if you look at our cloud offerings and we\u2019ve been pretty pleased with the overall growth rates. So if you look at that first half, we had very strong performance with our roll out doubling, as we went through the first half. And that\u2019s been a big part of the overall momentum we see across our growth initiatives business analytics, Smarter Planet or growth markets and our cloud performance. Now, within cloud, we do drive public cloud, but we also drive the enterprise attention for cloud and the mechanisms for our customers to set up their cloud operations within their business, and in sometimes are more responsive to their requirements for real security and which we can provide as well, but overall we think that the cloud business both in 2011 and first half of 2012 has been spot on for us.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Brian. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steven Milunovich \u2013 UBS","Thank you. I was going to say that things actually have held up surprisingly well, you mentioned the constant currency growth by geography, Mark. In the back, you gave your industry numbers and constant currency I think finance is up 1, public is up 4, they are actually among your better performing sectors. So perhaps you can explain that and is there a risk that you have to see the cliff in a sense?","Mark Loughridge","Well, that\u2019s a great \u2013 that\u2019s really a great point, Steve. I think as you look across the sectors, it really gives an interesting perspective on our business. So if you look at general business GB, I mean that was up 5%. Frankly, within GB we have really 60% of our Smarter Planet references, so it\u2019s a pretty strong sector in its own right, but it\u2019s also a good vehicle for many of our growth initiatives. And that plus 5% is \u2013 representative of 10 consecutive quarters of growth.","Secondly in public, public was up 4%. And if you look underneath public sector government was up 4%, education was up 16% and our health and life sciences business was up 3% for the 21st quarter of growth in that area. Within our public sector and education, we installed the fastest computer in the world in the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. So very good performance in public and an indication of the kind of roll out our initiatives have had. In industrial, we were up 3% that was highly driven by automotive that was up 11%. And as you said, when you open financial services was inline with IBM; interestingly, within financial services, our growth markets unit was up 12%. So really, really strong performance in the financial service in our growth markets business.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Steve. Let\u2019s go to the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan","Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon, Mark. I had a question regarding the software business, I think you said earlier that IBM expects to hire 200 to 300 new sales reps each month for the rest of the year, and you also talked about middleware \u2013 key brand of middleware growing inline with the market, what should we take from that, does that mean the run rate of above market growth is starting to peter out here, is there anything competitively speaking here going on, can you just kind of give us a little more color that is really appreciative.","Mark Loughridge","Yeah. No, I think, I think that\u2019s a very important question. So if you look at the software business, let\u2019s first look at the performance we had in the non-U.S. business, so for software outside of U.S., we had 4% growth in Europe, now that\u2019s a very, very good performance in my book in Europe in the current conditions; in Japan, we had 6% growth in software; in growth markets, we had 10% growth in software. So all of those constant currency references all strong performance from my perspective all were meeting the objectives that we had set.","The U.S. organization really faced just the difficult compare in last year, I mean that\u2019s kind of function of their achievement in the prior year, they\u2019re up 17%. So that 17% historical achievement drove the performance last year for the total software business is 10.5% growth. So as we look at the compare for the third quarter that\u2019s about 8% growth. So we\u2019re going to pick up about 2.5 points just on a compare, as the software business moves into the third quarter.","Now the other point I wanted to make is, we are continuing to invest in the software business in a very big way, acquisitions to drive and integrate with those solutions, continuing the higher 1 to 200 software reps every month, so we think of anything we have a very strong hand as we go into the second half. I think the first half performance was very, very good; and in the third quarter, we should see growth rates so we are consistent with the first quarter performance.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Mark. Let\u2019s go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Christopher Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the competitive environment in services and maybe ask the margin question in a different way. We heard from some of your competitors their pricing for new deals has gotten more aggressive and you are not growing your bookings and your backlog much on an organic basis. Is IBM making the decision to you to be less aggressive on competing for new deals in order to reap the gains from your productivity initiatives or is something else going on?","Mark Loughridge","Well, first of all, when you look at the overall performance in the business, our transactional backlog is up 6%, and we had growth in our transactional backlog now for 14 straight quarters. So I think that\u2019s pretty good performance on that transactional side of the house. And if you look at the operating base for the \u2013 outsource inside of the house, we do have very strong growth, in our overall services business, in our growth markets. So I think we are driving aggressively around the world. I think we are driving leadership costs, I will say that consistent with the IBM business point of equation we are driving for real profit and cash generation and return on our investments, but I think we\u2019ve got a good play with some areas of very strong performance.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Chris. Can we take one last question, please, operator?","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from David Grossman from Stifel Nicolas. You may ask your question. Sir, your line is open. Please check your mute button.","David Grossman \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. ","Sure, thank you. So Mark the emerging markets have been very resilient. Can you help us better understand the composition of the mix in that geographic segment, and the visibility over the next several months relative to the other geographies that you serve?","Mark Loughridge","","Yeah, one way to look at that relative mix is to look at it both from kind of a sector stand \u2013 let\u2019s look it from a sector standpoint, then let\u2019s look it from a brand standpoint and then we\u2019ll look at the distributed across the growth within country. So, first of all, if you look at the performance in the growth markets, I mean, I think for them they\u2019re once again be stronger than we had seen in the major markets by nine points and that\u2019s a trend line that we\u2019ve seen in 2008, 2009, 2010. We\u2019ve seen that for a long time, 2011, first half of this year that has been a very, very consistent phenomena for us. And if you look at the individual quarter it\u2019s been pretty strong by individual quarters.","Now if you look at the BRICS, the BRICS were up 12%. Within that, as I have said, China was up a very strong 24%. Russia was up very, very strong. Within that mix of business we had real power within the z side of the house in China, but if you look at across the sector dimension, and the brand dimension, I mean we had really strong growth in our sectors, every single sectors had growth, strong growth in the growth markets. We had very strong growth across every single brand, our software business grew double-digit, our services businesses grew double-digit within our STG content, with z growing a 11%.","And I\u2019d remind you that it\u2019s not just constructed within the BRICs, that\u2019s about a third of our business. So two thirds of our business was also going very, very well and we had this double-digit growth phenomena across 32 countries.","So I think the composition of their growth this quarter was balanced across the sectors, was balanced across the brands and indicative of both the BRIC countries and the broader view of the growth market. So with that let me ramp up the call.","I think our results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of IBMs business model delivering profit and cash on a sustained basis. And despite currency headwinds and a tough type line compare, we delivered strong performance, 8% growth in profit, 14% growth in operating EPS both in the quarter and for the first half. But I don\u2019t want you to miss, what I consider to be the most important metric this quarter, and that\u2019s our cash performance.","I mean, we generated $18 billion of free cash flow over the last 12 months, and that\u2019s a milestone for IBM. Let me put that in perspective. We generated $16.6 billion last year. 10 years ago, we generated just under $6 billion, so in the last decade, we\u2019ve increased the level of free cash flow generation by three times and I think that\u2019s a real achievement because it\u2019s left free cash flow that\u2019s in fact the fuel that we use to power this engine. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15.10 of operating EPS. That\u2019s up 12% from last year and on track to at least $20 in 2015.","So thanks for joining us and now, as always, back to work.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today\u2019s call.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM. I'm here today with Martin Schroeter, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'd like to welcome you to our First Quarter Earnings Presentation. The prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I'll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from us, in Investor Relations.","Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You will find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","Now I will turn the call over to Martin Schroeter.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks, Patricia. In the first quarter, we delivered $19.6 billion of revenue, $2.9 billion of operating net income, and operating EPS of $2.91; that's up 9% from last year. It's quite a good start to the year, and obviously better than the mid-single-digit growth we discussed 90 days ago.","Our revenue was flat year-to-year, excluding the impact of currency and the divested businesses. There's been a lot of focus on the implications of a stronger dollar, especially to companies like IBM, where, as you know, two-thirds of our revenue are outside the U.S. So let me address this right up front.","In the first quarter, we had an eight point impact from currency translation. This impact is even greater than 90 days ago, and also from the update we provided at the end of February. As always, we put a chart in the back-up that shows the impact of currency translation to revenue for the first quarter and the full year.","And as we shift our portfolio to higher value and divest businesses that no longer fit our strategic profile, this also results in an impact to our reported revenue growth. In the first quarter, it was over four points. So together, the impact of currency and the divested businesses reduced the reported revenue growth by 12 points.","Now, for the balance of the presentation, I'll focus on our revenue performance at constant currency, and excluding the impact of the divested businesses. This is the way we look at our business, and again, on that view of our business, our revenue was flat year-to-year.","At our investor briefing at the end of February, we spent a lot of time on how we are transforming our business to where we see long-term value in enterprise IT. We have a core portfolio that's high value to our clients and high value to us. Quite frankly, it's essential. While the market for these capabilities isn't necessarily growing, we continue to reinvent and innovate to deliver that value.","We've also been investing in our strategic imperatives, our solutions that address the opportunities in data, cloud, social, mobile, and security. These are high-value solutions and we're able to grow at a rate significantly faster than the market because our offerings are highly differentiated and because our core businesses provide the industry perspective and deep insight into how our clients operate.","In February, we showed you the revenue across our strategic imperatives has been up 19% to 20% in each of the last five years. And now in the first quarter, revenue in our strategic imperatives grew more than 30%, so a good start toward another strong double-digit year.","Analytics was up more than 20%; Social, more than 40%; and Mobile, more than 4x. Our cloud revenue was up over 75% year-to-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, our cloud revenue was $7.7 billion. This is a demonstration of high growth in the higher value cloud opportunities across public, private, and hybrid.","We had a terrific performance in our cloud foundational and as a service offerings and we exited the quarter with an annual as-a-Service run rate of $3.8 billion; that's up $1.5 billion in the last year. The bulk of that growth was organic, the result of our deep insights into how our clients run their business.","We've applied that insight to develop a strong point of view on cloud, that the value in cloud is hybrid. In February, we announced a program to make hybrid cloud a reality for the enterprise, extending our clients' control, visibility, security, and governance in a hybrid cloud environment, similar to what they have in their private cloud and existing IT systems. And to deal with the data sprawl, we're providing increased data portability across environments.","Now while we're investing and driving growth in our strategic imperatives, we're continuing to reinvent and bring innovation to our core portfolio. For example, in our hardware business, we've continue to invest and innovate. That's how we've been able to introduce the z13 mainframe that is built for the mobile economy and roll out Power 8, optimized for data and cloud. We've also made some visible divestitures and we're now starting to see the results of those actions.","In March, we shipped the first z13 system and our mainframe revenue more than doubled on MIPS shipments that were up 95%. Power returned to growth, leveraging strong performance in our scale out systems. All of this is driving our shift to higher value, resulting in a higher margin and supporting targeted investments.","In fact, in 2015, we're shifting billions of dollars of spending to data, cloud, and engagement to extend our differentiation in the market. And in the last few weeks, we've announced two initiatives, Internet of Things and Watson Health, that will further strengthen our position as a high-value innovation company providing solutions at the intersection of business and IT.","So, to sum it up, our results this quarter at the IBM level and the segment level reflect the transformation in our business. We had continued momentum in our strategic imperatives and strong growth in hardware, resulting from the innovation we continue to deliver.","The declines in the core portfolio were consistent with the second half of last year, and our shift to higher value drove margin expansion and we're continuing to shift investments and rebalance resources to address the best long-term opportunities in the market.","So, now I'll get into the details of the quarter. Our revenue was flat year-to-year, a two point improvement from our year-to-year performance in the third and the fourth quarters.","At the risk of oversimplifying this quarter's revenue dynamics, our strategic imperatives were up over 30%, which is 10 points faster than last year. And bear in mind, we have a pretty substantial business in cloud and analytics alone, so it's on a big base. And our core businesses had a similar trajectory to what we delivered in the second half of last year, so our substantial strategic imperatives growing 10 points faster drove two points of sequential improvement.","Looking at our margins, we had an 80 basis point improvement in gross margin, driven by both portfolio actions and strong growth in System z. To put that 80 basis points into historical context, gross margin of 49.3% is up about 1,400 basis points in the last 15 years. And you'll get that same trend from a margin perspective whether you back three, five, or 10 years.","In terms of gross profit dollars, we generated $9.5 billion in the quarter, and that's up $2.7 billion from 15 years ago. So, this is clearly the result of our long-term relentless shift to higher value. Our pretax and net margins benefited from the shift, as well, but they also reflect a smaller charge for workforce rebalancing this year.","On the bottom-line, we reported operating EPS of $2.91, up 9%. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up from last year, and as you know, there's a lot of seasonality in the timing of our cash flows, much more so than in our net income. We return $1.2 billion through share repurchase and nearly the same amount in dividends, and we ended the quarter with $8.8 billion of cash on hand, up from year-end.","Now turning to the revenue by geography, we had sequential improvement in our year-to-year performance in both the major markets and the growth markets, led by the U.S., Japan, and Latin America.","Revenue in the major markets was flat year-to-year. We grew in the U.S., with strong growth across our hardware portfolio and some large software deals, so we had a good transactional performance in the U.S. Japan growth accelerated on the strength of services and hardware.","We continued to the mixed performance in Europe, with growth in the U.K. and declines in Germany and France. From a brand perspective, we had good growth in mainframe and power, and continued momentum in outsourcing signings, as clients look to integrate cloud and mobile capabilities into larger scale IT environments. Overall, while our performance in Europe decelerated, it was in line with the market.","In the growth markets, Latin America returned to double-digit growth, with broad-based growth in the region, and we had growth in the Middle East and Africa. The Asia-Pacific growth markets again declined, though we had sequential improvement in some key countries.","Our year-to-year performance in the BRIC countries improved sequentially, though the total BRIC number is not reflective of the individual country's performance; we had growth in Brazil and India, and declines in Russia and China.","In China, we again had very strong growth in mainframe, but our services revenue declined as we shift our focus away from some of the lower margin offerings. Bear in mind, we do have a profitable business in China.","Turning to the segment perspective, our total revenue was flat and gross margin improved 80 basis points. As always, I'll go into the revenue drivers in the segment discussions, but I want to spend a minute on margin dynamics. When you look at the drivers of margin improvement we've talked about in the past, a shift to higher value has been a big contributor. This quarter, we saw the shift coming from portfolio actions and strong System z performance.","Over long periods of time, investment levels can improve margins, but given the market shifts and transformation we're driving, investments are currently reducing margins. Similarly, currency is typically neutral over an extended period, though our margin this quarter had a translational impact of the stronger dollar. With all of that, we drove margin improvement of 80 basis points.","The reported operating expense and other income is down 17%. The reported decline is driven by currency, a lower level of workforce rebalancing, and the fact that we no longer have the expense of the System x business in our run rate. I'll comment on each.","Eight points of decline was driven by currency, between the translation of non-dollar spending and the hedging gains that are reported in expense. Two points of the decline are due to the divestiture of System x. And we're continuing to rebalance our workforce, and this quarter, we took a charge of $280 million, but that's down $580 million year-to-year, so with a lower level of workforce rebalancing charges, drove another seven points of decline.","As we continue the transformation of our business, I'd expect a similar level of workforce rebalancing next quarter, which will impact our year-to-year profit performance. I should also mention that last year, we had nearly a $100 million gain from the sale of our customer care business and other income, which obviously wasn't replicated this year.","Within our base expense, we're continuing to shift resources and spending to areas where we see the most opportunity. In February, we talked about shifting $4 billion in spending in 2015, that's across expense, cost, and capital, and in the first quarter, we've been executing to that plan. We've increased expense in areas like SoftLayer, Watson, and Bluemix, just to name a few and we'll see the benefits over the longer term.","Now, let's turn to segments, and we'll start with Services. Combined Services revenue was $12.2 billion, which is down 2% year-to-year. This quarter, we closed 15 deals greater than $100 million, with about half of that for new clients or new scope with existing clients.","This reflects the strength of our offerings and our clients' confidence in our ability to manage the most critical assets in their business. We ended the quarter with total Services backlog of $121 billion, which was flat at constant currency and adjusting for the divestiture.","Global Technology Services delivered $7.9 billion of revenue. GTS Outsourcing reflects the mix and timing of contracts from the backlog. As expected, many of the larger contracts signed last year did not contribute to revenue in the first quarter.","We're continuing to see clients sign large infrastructure outsourcing deals with embedded cloud and mobile initiatives, creating large-scale hybrid IT environments. IBM is the trusted partner for these core business transformations because of our global capabilities and portfolio breadth. And in fact, the Forrester Research Wave evaluation cited IBM as far and away the leading supplier in the global infrastructure outsourcing segment.","Within ITS, we had good growth in cloud, security, and business resiliency, but overall performance was impacted by a shift away from lower-value services, such as data center build-outs and OEM hardware deployments.","Software grew solid double-digits this quarter, improving sequentially and building on the expanded data center capacity. We continued our steady progress with the opening of a few new footprints in Montreal, Sydney, and Amsterdam.","Clients like ShopDirect are choosing SoftLayer as the platform to integrate cloud initiatives with their core systems into a unified hybrid IT model. This architecture provides them with on-demand burst capability, as well as the ability to plan for and deliver consumer apparel and home goods, based on real-time demand. This kind of value is only unlocked when the emerging technologies like cloud and analytics are integrated with the large sets of customer data enterprises already have.","Maintenance was up 2%, with the growth driven by our multi-vendor support services, which is our third-party hardware maintenance offering. The continued growth of maintenance is another demonstration of the strength of our global reach and capabilities. As organizations expand, they want a partner who has scale and can provide global parts and support capabilities.","GTS pretax margin was driven by a few elements. Currency was the biggest impact to profit year-to-year and our maintenance profit was down due to the System x divestiture. Profit margin performance also reflects the continued investments in the business to expand our operational capabilities; the SoftLayer data center expansion I just mentioned is one example. This gives us a highly differentiated offering in hybrid cloud, especially as it relates to data residency requirements.","We're also increasing our sales hiring in our mobile and security practices, and making investments in our resiliency business. And we're accelerating our transition to a more significant global delivery model, which requires hiring and training costs ahead of the expected savings. Finally, we had a year-to-year benefit from a smaller workforce rebalancing charge in the quarter, but we haven\u2019t yet realized the bulk of savings from our recent actions.","Global Business Services revenue was $4.3 billion. We\u2019ve had solid performance in many markets and solution areas. In Japan we\u2019ve been consistently growing revenue and expanding margins, with solid growth in consulting and application outsourcing. And in Europe this quarter we returned to revenue growth.","Across all our geographies, we continue to drive strong growth in the offerings that address our strategic imperatives. Our cloud solutions more than tripled year to year, analytics grew double digits, and we had very good growth in mobile and social. We\u2019re helping clients create new business models and opportunities for client engagement.","The challenge for Global Business Services is North America. While we have solid growth in our strategic imperatives, we\u2019re dealing with a slowdown in some of the more traditional areas. Because the U.S. is our largest geography, its performance has a significant impact on the overall segment.","But again, the U.S. has some very positive elements in GBS. Let me give you one example of the kind of work we\u2019re doing to help clients create opportunities for client engagement. In February, we announced our strategic partnership with AMB Sports & Entertainment to transform the fan experience at the new Atlanta stadium.","When complete, when you go to the stadium, you\u2019ll be able to see in real-time which parking lots are available and which are filled, where the shortest concession lines are during the game, and have access to statistics and information from the bleachers.","All because we can combine GTS outsourcing and technology capabilities with our GBS process and application expertise to provide a complete solution, creating new markets that didn\u2019t exist even a few years ago.","Before wrapping up revenue, let me just remind you that we\u2019ve integrated Global Process Services, our BPO business into GBS to create a seamless end-to-end business transformation capability for our clients and to better leverage our industry knowledge.","Looking at GBS profit, the pre-tax margin had a mix of drivers. We got some year-to-year benefit from the lower workforce rebalancing charge, and some savings yield from last year\u2019s action. We were impacted by the Customer Care divestiture, both by the loss of operational profit and by not having a gain in this year\u2019s results.","The balance of the margin decline was driven by our cost structure in those geographies where we\u2019re not growing revenue. We\u2019re making investments and taking actions to make our cost structure more competitive, including rebalancing to more global delivery, use of alternate labor models, and shifting resources toward higher-value Strategic Imperative offerings.","Our Software revenue of $5.2 billion was down 2%, a modest sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter. Key branded middleware grew one percent driven by growth in our Software-as-a-Service offerings, which were up nearly 50%. Total software growth reflects a one-point headwind from operating systems.","We had growth across many solution areas. Our analytics software was up, and our mobile software grew at a strong double-digit rate, led by our MobileFirst offerings. We had solid growth in our commerce solutions, where a large proportion of the business is Software-as-a-Service. And our Social solutions grew double-digits driven by strong performance in both Kenexa and advanced collaboration offerings. ","Across software, we\u2019re continuing to drive innovation and capture growth areas importantly building our software into broader solution capabilities. Just this month, we have made two major announcements, IoT and Watson Health. These are a continuation of what we started last year with Watson, then earlier this year with analytics, commerce and security.","There are some common threads throughout. They are all based on a unique point of view around cloud and the value of hybrid. They all use analytics to leverage data. And they all have an industry dimension.","Let me comment briefly on the two announcements. At the end of March we announced the creation of an Internet of Things unit, committing $3 billion of spend over the next four years.","As part of this, we are establishing a cloud-based open platform to help clients and partners build and deliver vertical industry IoT solutions. We have also created an IoT zone within Bluemix, our platform-as-a-service and we are expanding an IoT ecosystem to leverage a growing developer and entrepreneur community.","This is similar to what we\u2019ve done successfully around Watson, where we not only have large partners like Softbank in Japan, but we have hundreds of ecosystem partners you may not have heard of yet like Wayblazer, Fluid, Redant, MD Buyline, Elance, Sellpoint, SparkCognition, and LifeLearn, all of whom are building commercial applications on Watson.","And then last week we announced Watson Health, which we believe will transform healthcare, by bringing together the advanced cognitive capabilities of Watson with a vast ecosystem of partners, practitioners and researchers. There are several aspects to the Watson Health announcement, from the creation of a Watson Health Cloud, to partnerships with leading companies, to the acquisition of two companies that extend our healthcare analytics capabilities. ","These are the two most recent examples where we are partnering in new ways to drive innovation and build an ecosystem to transform industries.","Turning to our Systems Hardware segment, revenue of $1.7 billion was up 30%, as we continue to deliver innovation across our high end systems. This quarter System z MIPS were up 95% year to year, resulting in revenue more than doubling.","We started to ship our new z13 in the second week of March and this was the fastest start in terms of number of systems we shipped in over a decade. We also booked the highest revenue growth in any quarter in more than a decade. The capabilities of the z13 mainframe around mobile, cloud and real-time insights and fraud detection are resonating well with our customers.","Let me give you a real example of what we\u2019re talking about. If you are UPS, one of the largest logistics companies in the world, you have to manage nearly 5 billion deliveries a year with highly seasonal changes in demand. Your customers expect their packages to arrive on time, and they expect to schedule, manage and track shipments anywhere, anytime, and increasingly through their mobile devices.","These mobile transactions can lead to dramatic increases in overall traffic as customers complete transactions at will. This requires a system that can handle the growth and scale seamlessly when activity spikes, maintaining a secure system that\u2019s always available. That\u2019s why UPS chose to upgrade to the IBM z13 mainframe because it could meet the expanding demands of the mobile economy.","Now moving on to Power, revenue returned to growth. We not only took share in the declining Unix market, but we are also expanding beyond Unix, with Linux on Power and our OpenPOWER IP opportunity.","We are expanding our customer base in the entry-level Linux systems as well as with large cloud-based players. The likes of OVH, the largest internet hosting company in Europe, Rackspace, and very recently Zuchetti, a leading IT provider in Italy, have all selected Power-based Linux systems to deliver their cloud offerings.","In addition, just over a year ago we launched the OpenPOWER Foundation, to open up the Power technology and build an ecosystem to share intellectual property. The ecosystem of partners includes large established players such as Google, Nvidia, Mellanox, Samsung, Tyan and Inspur. But the consortium includes other smaller and emerging players, such as SK Hynix from Korea, Teamsun from China and Nallatech from Scotland, adding tremendous breadth and reach.","Last month, the foundation unveiled more than ten new hardware innovations that continue to make Power technology relevant beyond the Unix market. And in the first quarter, we closed our first substantial intellectual property deal, a confirmation of our strategy on Power as an open chip processor.","This is an important step for the first OpenPOWER-based system for China. As an example, Zoom Netcom, a data communication and equipment supplier, will launch a system in the market later this year, which is based on the first derivative of a POWER chip unveiled by Suzhou PowerCore. This clearly shows that our Power strategy is working and we see momentum in the business.","Our Storage hardware revenue was down 2%, a modest sequential improvement. We again saw strong growth in our Flash Systems. This growth was offset by the wind down of our OEM business and continued price weakness in high-end disk.","We see value in the storage market shifting to software and in the first quarter we unveiled IBM Spectrum Storage, new storage software in support of hybrid cloud environments. The portfolio provides greater access to data, accelerates speed to insights and improves data economics.","Our Systems Hardware segment growth is a clear result of the actions we have taken to position our Systems business for the future. With good adoption in z13 and Power systems, and launch of the remaining P8 based systems later this quarter, we continue to see good growth in this business.","Moving on to cash flow in the quarter, we generated $2 billion of cash from operations, excluding our Global Financing receivables. We spent just under a $1 billion in CapEx which is flat year to year, but includes a shift in spend as we build out our SoftLayer cloud centers. And so we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow, which is up $400 million year-to-year.","The primary driver was lower tax payments. This was partially offset by the working capital impact associated with the sale of our System x business, and higher payments for performance based comp which was accrued last year. I mentioned earlier that our free cash flow generation is skewed to the back end of the year, and we continue to expect to deliver on our full year objectives.","Looking at the uses of cash in the quarter, we returned over $2 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion in dividends and a $1.2 billion to buy back almost 8 million shares. At the end of March, we had 985 million shares outstanding and $5 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","With the flow through from last year\u2019s share reduction, our first quarter spend, and the remaining","authorization, we can achieve the level of share reduction we\u2019ve assumed in our model for the year.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.8 billion, which is up from December, but down from a year ago. Total debt was $38.8 billion, with over $26 billion in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7 to 1.","Our non-financing debt was $12.6 billion, which is down $3 billion from a year ago. Our non-financing debt-to-cap was essentially flat vs. December and four points higher than last year. Remember our equity was impacted in the latter half of last year by pension, currency and the semiconductor manufacturing divestiture.","The changes in book equity and the resulting impact on our debt-to-cap ratio do not adequately reflect the financial flexibility we have to support our business over the long term. In fact on the basis of a core debt to EBITDA metric, we are well positioned to support our long term growth objectives.","Finally, I want to mention that as a result of several court rulings in Spain, including one in March, we booked a $230 million pre-tax charge related to litigation involving IBM Spain retirement plans.","The court ruling reverses a voluntary employee program to join a defined contribution plan that was offered more than 20 years ago. This non-operating charge impacted GAAP earnings and pension liability in the first quarter. ","So now let me summarize the quarter, and talk about our full year expectations. We\u2019ve been very clear that we\u2019re transforming our business, and we continue to see signs that the transformation is working. In the first quarter you see it at the IBM level, and in our segments.","Our revenue trajectory improved, driven by an acceleration in our strategic imperatives. We had strength in high-end systems, as our new products address the most contemporary workloads of data, cloud and mobile.","This strength, together with our overall shift to higher value drove margin expansion for IBM. All together our revenue was flat year to year, excluding currency and the impact of divested businesses. And we had mid-single digit operating net income growth, and high single digit EPS growth as reported.","At the same time, we\u2019ve made a number of bold moves that build on the momentum we started in 2014. These include our hybrid cloud announcement in February, a set of initiatives around Internet of Things in March, and just two weeks ago the launch of Watson Health. It was a good start to the year.","Looking forward, we\u2019ll continue to deliver strong growth in our strategic imperatives, while the transitions in some of our businesses continue. We\u2019ll continue to expand our margin as we shift to higher value, and we\u2019ll continue a high level of investment, shifting to areas where we see the best opportunity.","We\u2019re deploying capital through different models, organic R&D, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. And we\u2019re building partnerships and ecosystems, not only with the big household names, but with hundreds of smaller firms. This leverages our mutual strengths and expands our reach, all at a high level of return. And of course we\u2019ll continue to return value to shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends. ","For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver Operating EPS of $15.75 to $16.50. And at that level of profit, we continue to expect free cash flow to be flat for the year. With these dynamics and level of performance, we\u2019ll exit 2015 a higher-value business.","Now Patricia and I will take your questions","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.","Operator, can you please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes. Thank you. Martin, I was wondering if could comment more broadly about progress in the transformation. Because if I kind of look at this very narrow-mindedly, hardware grew enormously. And if I take out hardware, the rest of the company grew at minus 2 which is what you've been doing the last couple of quarters.","And you commented that your strategic imperatives had actually accelerated in growth. So if we takeout hardware and the strategic imperatives are actually growing faster than before, doesn\u2019t that suggest the core businesses outside of hardware and the strategic initiatives are actually getting worse.","And when we look at the gross margin profile of services and software which are 90% plus of your business, they actually got notably worse year-over-year even adjusting for the restructuring. So I would like to just maybe push back a little bit on -- beyond what we saw in hardware which I think is probably cyclical, what is the progress in the transformation.","And should we be thinking more like 30% growth rate in the strategic initiatives and that's sustainable on what drives it or perhaps you can just help us think through that.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. Sure, Toni. Thanks for the question. Well, there is lot in that question. So, I will -- I will try to address it at a high level. First, in terms of the strategic imperatives continuing 30%, we are not thinking that this is a 30% strategic imperative growth every quarter now for the rest of the year as you know. ","And as we've talked about in Investor Day, they\u2019ve been on a very steady 19%-20% growth rate year-to-year. Now they are a pretty substantial part of our business now and we view that 30% growth -- part of its driven obviously by the mainframe and power cycle. And we are thinking now when we look at the rest of the year that we are kind of accounting on a continued 19% to 20% growth.","So our guidance is not requiring 30% growth. In fact, we expect it to kind of return to what we've seen, still very strong growth, still ahead of the marketplace and still contributing a fair bit of growth to IBM. But think of it as more of a 20% growth. ","With the quarter, as we talked about on the call -- on the prepared remarks, outside the strategic imperatives we've been talking about that business in kind of a high single digit decline similar to the market that it sits in and we kind of saw that again in the first quarter. So the revenue dynamics in the first quarter were really a reflective of that acceleration, not a change in the core underneath that.","Couple of other points, I think that you are ready to. One, progress in the transformation, I think the transformation that is underway in the marketplace and is underway in our investment levels, is underway in our focus, continues at not only a very rapid pace, but a pace necessary for us to continue to lead in enterprise IT. So by this time last year we had created the Watson unit. We had identified a pretty substantial SoftLayer expansion plan that we rolled out throughout the year.","As a couple of examples, by this time this year, as you saw early in January we reformulated some of our business units to more directly engaged with clients the way they consume. So we have IBM Analytics, we have IBM Commerce. We have IBM security as examples. And so we got that done.","You saw earlier and I noted this in my prepared remarks we created an Internet of Things group which will build off of what we've done in Smarter Planet and Smarter Cities. Just recently we've created now the IBM Healthcare unit which will build off a couple of acquisitions as well as partnerships with some leading names in that space.","So the transformation continues at a very rapid pace. It continues a pace, again, necessary for us to maintaining our leadership in enterprise IT. But we are not building guidance around, again, that strategic imperative revenue continuing to growth at 30%. We are still thinking and kind of relying on that 20% growth rate that we've been able to deliver the last five years. ","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Toni. Let\u2019s go to the next question please Dory. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Hey, thanks. Just want to ask on the services side, how that came in both in revenue and margin versus plan. Seem like with mostly done with the heavy workforce rebalancing, heard little bit about China make shifting way from the lower margins from GTS being little bit weak. But seems like we could assume certainly better performance starting in 2Q, can you maybe expand on that Martin?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Tien-Tsin. Thanks. So a couple of things. One, we did see a deceleration in GTS in the first quarter in Global Technology Services. But keep in mind that when we had these pretty substantial transactions and new relationships that we signed last year. Those will only move into the run phase over the next few quarters, primarily in the second half. So we would expect those to contribute bit more or something in fact, they didn\u2019t contribute anything in the first quarter. But they will start to contribute in the Global Technology Services.","Margins within Global Technology Services will continue to reflect the currency environment we\u2019re in as well as the investments we are making in order to grow out our SoftLayer platform and to shift the business to these new higher areas. ","As you noted on our prepared remarks we talked about shifting away from lower margin offering in some of our site facilities business and redeploying that and that will continue. So from a Global Technology Services perspective between the currency environment that we are in and the shift we are making, and the investments we are making, we are not relying on dramatic growth or margin improvement in GTS in our guidance. ","On GBS, we've got some very strong results, continued strong results in Japan and in Europe. And we continue to shift that business as well into these new areas where we are comfortable that the margin profile there will be consistent with our guidance also, so two different stories between GTS and GBS within our guidance. We are not relying on dramatic growth here. But we will see some improved performance coming out of the backlog because of the big deals we signed last year.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Tien-Tsin. Can we go to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. ","David Grossman","Thank you. Martin, I wondered if we could just look in little more detail for software business. The compares get much easier in the back half of the year. And based somewhat you are seeing in the business today and if there is no material shifts in the economic backdrop.","Would these comps be enough to stabilize the software segment on its own or is it possible that growth could remain negative given all those different things you talked about in the back half of the year even against the negative comps that we see versus last year in the back half of the year?","Martin Schroeter","Sure David. Thanks. So software, as we talked about when we provided guidance initially back in January, we said we still feel this way. The difference in our low end of our guidance and our high end of our guidance really depends on the trajectory of software. What we saw in the first quarter was a one point improvement in the trajectory, not back yet to growth, but a one point improvement in our trajectory.","Now that's not all year. We haven\u2019t seen it yet all years. But again, the difference high and low guidance is that trajectory improvement. Assuming we were at the same level, same trajectory we had last year, we said that's kind of the low end of our guidance.","We do see an environment where that's kind of the trajectory performance that we can rely on, if you will. We continue to sign ELAs with clients. We signed 200 ELAs again in the first quarter. We continue to have an impact in our growth from the operating system component of software.","But we saw pretty good uptake in our as a service offerings which are driving growth of more than 50%. And at the same time our clients with their reduced visibility continue to look for flexibility in our offerings for those who have deployed the most. ","So software again represents for us the difference between the low end and the high end of our guidance. We saw that one quarter sequential improvement in the first and we see how we go for the rest of the year. ","Patricia Murphy","Thanks David. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you. Martin, would you be able to share with us the EPS impact on currency. You gave us revenue, but could you tell us cents per share? And then I was curious on the free cash flow you gave us flat for the year, could you talk a bit about the plus and minus factors that you've got there, CapEx, cash taxes and so forth and how those are going to play out?","Martin Schroeter","Of course. And since currency and free cash flow are so related we will count that as a one part question, Steve.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","So, first on currency. We did talk -- as we mentioned in the call, currency was an impact of about eight points on the revenue line. So a bit over a $1.7 billion in terms of translating the first quarter revenue back to dollars and we saw some significant movements not only since January, but also even since we provided an impact on the day of our Investor Day, so a pretty big impact on the revenue line.","From a profit perspective, now, this is somewhat of an imprecise calculation, right? It is not knowable. It is unknowable number. We can estimate it. But we think their profit growth was impacted year-to-year by somewhere between $0.15 and $0.20 in the quarter. That's a pretty big impact. So, obviously, that shows up in margin. And that first quarter impact then given where the dollar is now, you could adjust. We are working to try to -- we will obviously have to manage our way through this. But if you just took that $0.15 to $0.20 impact at the high end assuming the rates stay here, you could see an $0.80 year-to-year impact full year on earnings from this, again, without us having done anything. So, obviously, it\u2019s something we are thinking about and working on pretty hard. ","In terms of free cash flow, we said relatively flat year-to-year in full year. The bridge items are not dissimilar or not going to surprise you. First, we do see cash taxes this year being better year-to-year than they were last year. So that's probably about $2 billion better year-to-year, so that will certainly help. ","Reducing that on a full year basis though, will be increased CapEx investments which we'll be making. We've talked about that already in January and we mentioned again in Investor Day. We also have while we expect a lower level of workforce rebalancing charges, the timing of those, the cash impact of those is likely to lead to an increase this year relative to last year of about $0.5 billion. ","And then our performance related cash payments this year for prior year accruals will probably be up $700 million to $800 million as well. So outside of that, our cash performance will look a lot like our income performance which is kind of what you would expect I think.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Steve. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Yes. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.","Bill Shope","Okay. Thanks. I have a question on the mainframe site. If you are only shipping the new mainframes in the last few weeks of the quarter and you were able to double revenue. Should we assume that we still have some potential for growth to accelerate from here?","And then I guess just looking at the cycle overall, can you talk about whether there are any unique financial dynamics for this cycle that we should consider relative to last few cycles. I guess, I'm particularly focused on the dynamics around pricing where it looks like you actually had an ASP tailwind relative to MIPS growth this quarter and also the pull through for as-a-service on this platform. Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Bill. Few things on the mainframe. So first, we had a terrific first quarter in the mainframe. But I think it\u2019s important to understand two elements of this, first, this is what we expected our mainframe performance to be. This was not a surprise to us. And so I don\u2019t think that you should take away from either our prepared remarks or even the questions that we think we did better than we would have. We think this was the mainframe performance we expected very clearly.","I think that the element for the mainframe, though, that are most widely misunderstood by many who follow us are twofold. One -- and this has to do with the timing of what you\u2019re seeing in the quarter. One, I don\u2019t that mainframe is fully appreciated for the essential nature of the work it does for the impact that our clients feel from an upgraded mainframe and for the kinds of enterprise class saleable workloads that it drives.","So we used the example of UPS in the call, 5 billion packages they have to deliver on time and again they can't be down. So, one, I think there is an under appreciation for the mainframe and its value to our clients.","Two, I think there is a huge difference, obviously between how consumer technology works and how enterprise technology works. And so when you read that we were shipping the mainframe since March, remember, we've been having the discussions with about 60 of our clients for months and months and months, because they help us build and design this for their needs in those enterprise spaces.","But the January announcement is when we start building the value propositions for our clients, and so the work for the sales teams begin in January. The fact that it was only shipped in March really only means that our supply chain, our fulfillment teams did a phenomenal job in a relatively short period of time to get fulfill the demand that we saw within the quarter. ","But from an enterprise buying cycle, I think, you really do have to understand that these are built our clients. These are -- we discuss the value prop with our clients before that March date, that\u2019s not as critical a date as you might think if -- again, if you are thinking about it from a consumer side. ","From a first quarter perspective, as I mentioned, we are very pleased with how it did. But it didn\u2019t surprise us. And as we've talked about in the past, the second quarter tends to be the largest quarter for mainframe and we still see that in this quarter as well. So we had very good quarter in the first. We would expect that the mainframe will be the larger in the second than it was in the first. But keep in mind now you will get into compare issues. Right?","So from a dollar perspective it will be larger. But we also had a great mainframe quarter second quarter last year. So the growth year-to-year will look a lot different than the first quarter, but the absolute number in the second will be higher.","We would expect that in the first half, we'll probably finish at solid 50% growth in the mainframe between the first two quarters, which is very typical, very traditional, in terms of the mainframe.","From a margin perspective, as you noted, with MIPS only going up 95%, I say only with a smirk -- with MIPS going of 95% and revenue up 130% on a constant currency basis, yeah, there's obviously a lot of value that our clients see here and a lot of value for the IBM Corporation. So, we are delighted with how well the mainframe did, but it wasn't as apprised was. It's a powerful, powerful platform for the world's business.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Bill. Can go to the next question, please?","Operator","Yes, thank you. Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Brian White","Yeah Martin, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how customers are feeling in the broad IT spending environment. It seems like financials and first quarter were actually very strong and a huge FX impact. So, I'm just curious how customers are feeling and how we should think about general seasonality throughout the year?","Martin Schroeter","For us, Brian, I think couple of things. One, we have not seen a dramatic shift in trajectory across lot of our sectors. Financial services sector is obviously one where the mainframe plays a pretty vital role in how the world banks run and when you get a new mainframe, particularly when so relevant to them shifting their business into mobile, particularly one where counter fraud is such an important part of what they have to think about every day.","And again you need scalability, you need reliability. You have to run all the time. That, as a particular, that new mainframe as an emphasis within financial services sec are, and therefore we did see an improvement in the trajectory in financial services.","But across the rest, I would say not a dramatic shift in what we saw in the first quarter. Again, the common thread that we're seeing is not a sector-by-sector other than what I pointed out in the financial services. The common thread here is the relevance of our offering in the strategic imperatives where the need for mobility, the need for social ways of engaging either your employee base, your client base and the need for really powerful scalable systems kind of drove the day in the first quarter with 30% growth year-to-year relative to what had been a 20% kind of growing business.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Brian. Dory can we take the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.","Keith Bachman","Hi, Martin, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to cash flow, if I could. In your past comments, you talked about this year being flat, but previously called out a number of one-time items including pensions. And I was just wondering if you could comment directionally how we should be envisioning cash flow in 2016 relative to 2015. It seems like some of the items should be one-time in nature, but the tax payments, restructuring, et cetera, been both directionally and relative to the percent that you normally provide versus net income.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. A few things, Keith. One, as we said a number of times, cash flow, we expect to be flat in 2015, relative to 2014. And relative to 2014, what we showed in Investor Day were the drivers of our realization and 2014, were really two-fold.","One, we had a very high cash tax rate last year relative to net income and as I mentioned in the prior answer, we don't see that same level of headwinds this year. So, on a realization basis, taxes -- cash taxes will not be an impact to 2015. I'll come back to 2016 in a moment.","And then all so last year, we had a pretty substantial gain, which obviously showed up as cash in the IBM Corporation, but showed up in the investing line not in the free cash flow line so that drove realization down about 20 points from the -- say if we set ourselves high 90s.","So, this year, as I mentioned, we don't the cash taxes as a primary headwind and we do expect to improve realization this year pretty dramatically. I did talk about, a little bit, on a full-year basis about some of the differences in cash flows this year including performance related payments and workforce rebalancing payments and increased CapEx within 2015, but still an improvement in our realization rate in 2015.","Now, when we get to 2016, I think a few things happen. One, we again will have, I think, the cash tax headwind. Now this is at a planning level and we're nine months away from the start of the year, which means we're 21 months away from figuring out the settlement of audits and things. So, we've got a long way to go, but right now, we would envision a cash tax headwind again in 2016 that we can see.","From a pension perspective, we're kind of -- we're in our pensions by the way. We've been -- we have a closed pension and we've been moving our asset side of our portfolio to more mimics the liability side, which is we've been moving to more debt instruments within that and allocating to more interest rate securities.","So, we don't have as much risk in the portfolio and our U.S. pension remains very well-funded and our global pensions are in a pretty good funding position, so we don't see a lot of -- at this point, we don't see a lot of impact from pensions.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Keith. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner","Hi. Thanks. Martin, I was hoping you could walk through your expectations for profitability as we move through the year? It looks like from a profitability perspective on a year-over-year basis, services and software declined a bit but hardware was more profitable. Hoping you could walk us through the rest of the year. Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. Let's -- I'll talk about how we see the rest of the year playing out, first in -- from a full-year perspective and then I'll bring it to the near-term and what we see coming in the second quarter.","So, first, as I mentioned earlier, our low end of guidance assumes, essentially, that software doesn't improve for the rest of the year and as we already saw that first quarter was just a bit of head of that, so the high end of guidance assumes \u2013 as we see a slight trajectory improvement in our software business right back to essentially flat.","In the near-term -- so that's the difference between high and low -- the near-term, from a profitability perspective, we have a fairly typical skew in our pretax profit from first to second quarter. It's fairly typical.","Now, as we transform our business, as we continue to make investments, as we continue to see growth in our strategic imperatives business, we will get, as I mentioned another good quarter out of the mainframe. But as we transform that business, I would expect to see a fairly typical skew from first to second quarter on a pretax profit basis.","Now, on a year-to-year basis we have dynamics within our workforce rebalancing charges from prior years that drive the growth rates to look at odd. So, with essentially roughly the same level of workforce rebalancing from first quarter to second quarter this year, we take that out of the equation, therefore, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but the transformation of our business and the cycle we are in the mainframe, I think, probably gets us to a typical -- a more typical, if you will, sequential improvement of about $1 billion of pretax profit quarter-to-quarter. And again, on a full-year basis, we see the difference in the high end and the low end of being that software trajectory.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Sherri. Let's go to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Martin, could you talk about any changes in IT spending demand trends, especially in regions where there were significant effects, double the factor at all in terms of any deferrals?","And can you help us think through how the expense levels will change with FX relative to the revenue levels as we go through the year. This quarter they were in pretty good alignment, but you also saw a pretty strong America's revenue. So, just wondering what the puts and takes there could be.","Martin Schroeter","Yes, I mean I'd say a few things. So, we did not see dramatic -- we didn't see any improvement in, for instance, in Asia-Pacific. So, we continue to see a slow spending environment in AP and I think our performance there mimics what we're seeing in the marketplace in general.","Japan, spending continues to go quite well and we continue to perform. But it's more than just the environment in Japan. The team has done a terrific job of maintaining growth now well into their third year and so it\u2019s the strength of our offerings that are underpinned by a reasonable spending environment within Japan.","In other places, as we noted on the call, North America, U.S. did quite well and we see a spending environment there that is supportive of the investments we're making in the way we are shifting the business.","So, in total, with some exceptions where we see weak spending environment in AP, we see a reasonable environment. Now, from an expense perspective, our focus is obviously on continuing to drive that in those investment levels and as we talked about in the prepared remarks, outside of the translation impact of currency and outside of the divested content, our spending was essentially flat year-to-year.","And so on an EDR basis, that was about the same and we will continue to shift within that our spending toward the strategic imperatives. And so, when you look at 30% growth and again, we don't expect it to stay at 30 -- but when you look at 30% growth that supported by a pretty dramatic shift of spending within IBM and at the same time, that funding, that spending is coming from those core businesses. So, some of what you're seeing in that core business decline is that engineered shift toward the strategic imperatives.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Wamsi. Dory, let's take one last question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. And if you can focus a little bit on the Services segment. Help us understand kind of what's going on there. It looks like both GBS and GTS profitability is down year-over-year and the signings have a lot of volatility around them.","But kind of the rate of $10 billion seems to be a multi-year low. How should we kind of think about what's going on in services, mostly the shift to the strategic imperatives and how should we kind of think about that. Could it be the shift we would expect profitability to actually be up year-over-year, or maybe it's FX? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, so a few things. And you're right; FX is obviously playing a role here in how some of those services profits translate back to U.S. dollars. But on a broader context, signings growth in the first quarter, which is there plenty of opportunity out there? There certainly is.","We see a lot of opportunity for continued growth in our outsourcing business, double-digit growth, in fact, across all our outsourcing businesses and signings. And the backlog, in total, was essentially flat year-to-year. Obviously, there is a currency impact here on the divestiture impact, but backlog in total was essentially flat.","What we see and services is really a couple of things. One, within Global Technology Services, we continue to invest pretty heavily, as I noted earlier, in order to drive that SoftLayer platform, for instance. We continue to invest to build out that infrastructure as-a-Service capability where we're seeing very good growth in our SoftLayer platform and very good growth across cloud.","In the GBS business, we're seeing very good performance in Japan. We got a return to growth in Europe, which was quite encouraging and there are some areas of strength in other parts of those emerging market. Latin America did quite well, doing well in the Middle East and Africa. What we are seeing is the slowdown that's driving the revenue line in the U.S.","Now, some of that's driven by consulting. But quite frankly, now, we did grow our signings again in the U.S. So, we have -- we're building, if you will, a backlog that will turn into revenue in the future. But right now, we're dealing with the slowdown in our U.S. consulting business.","The mix of our business in GBS is pretty consistent around the world. They have a very high mix of the strategic imperatives. And within that mix, the growth is very high. So, we're comfortable that we're making the shift in GBS. We obviously have, as I noted, some work to do in our U.S. business. But we do see good -- some pretty good growth and pretty good performance in other parts of the world in GBS.","Martin Schroeter","So, I wanted to wrap up the call just with a few points. And again, to thank you for joining this afternoon. Our first quarter performance, we view as another proof point that the strategy is right, the actions we're taking to reinvent our businesses, the innovation we're delivering in our hardware business and our software business and in our services businesses, is starting to pay off and the investments and the focus on those solution areas are all contributing to the very strong growth we saw in the strategic imperatives.","So, as we move through the year, we'll continue the transformation. We'll continue to make these investments and to build those ecosystems that we talked about. It certainly takes some time. But, certainly this was a very good start to the year. So, thanks for joining.","Patricia Murphy","Dory, can I turn it back to you to close out the call for us?","Operator","Thank you. Thank you for participating on today's conference. The call has now ended. You may disconnect at this time."],"11738":["International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 16, 2012  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Patricia Murphy - VP, IR","Mark Loughridge - SVP and CFO","Analysts","Toni Sacconagh - Sanford Bernstein","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","Steve Milunovich - UBS","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Jim Suva - Citigroup","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank","Operator","Welcome and thank you for standing by. (Operator Instructions). Now, I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM. I'm here with Mark Loughridge, IBM's Senior Vice President and CFO, Finance and Enterprise Transformation. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings presentation. The prepared remarks will be available in roughly an hour and a replay of this webcast will be posted to our Investor Relations website by this time tomorrow.","Our presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to their related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You will find reconciliation charts at the end, and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","Let me remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from us in Investor Relations.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark Loughridge.","Mark Loughridge","In the third quarter, we reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and increased operating earnings per share by 10% to $3.62. For the year, we're maintaining our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at least $15.10, that's up 12% over last year.","Looking at our third quarter revenue by geography, Europe was fairly consistent with last quarter, Japan's revenues stabilized, the BRIC countries in total performed well again, but North America declined. When I look at our skew of business in the quarter, through the first two months, our revenue was fairly consistent with our second quarter performance. The third month of the quarter was more challenging. This quarter we delivered double digit operating earnings per share growth driven by our strength in our solutions offerings, a solid annuity base and our ongoing work on productivity.","First, we continue to drive very good results in our solutions offerings across software and services that address key demand areas like Smarter Planet, business analytics and cloud. Second, our annuity businesses which represent about half of our annual revenue and 60% of our profit provided a solid base of revenue and profit.","And third, we're continuing to execute on our productivity initiatives on track to deliver $8 billion of productivity over the 2015 roadmap. The benefit from these initiatives together with our mix to more profitable businesses helped to drive our margin expansion. Now before I get into the financial metrics, I want to remind you that this quarter we closed the sale of our Retail Store Solutions point-of-sales business to Toshiba TEC in most countries. The transaction results in a loss of revenue in profit for the divested operations, a gain on the sale and an impact to our tax rate. As we go through the presentation, I will clarify the impact of each of these.","In the quarter IBM's revenue was down 5% including a currency headwind of nearly 4 points. At constant currency we were down 2% or down 1% if you normalize for the RSS divestitures. But in spite of this revenue decline we had solid operating profit growth with pretax income up 7% and net income up 5%. Our margin expansion was driven by our productivity initiatives, improving business mix and the overall currency dynamics.","This quarter we expanded operating gross margin by 1.2 points with about 60% due to improvements in margins and the balance from mix. With good expense management we improved operating PTI margin by 2.5 points. This quarter our tax rate was up over 1 point year-to-year. The increase was driven by a higher tax rate on the gain from the sale of our RSS business. We now expect an operating effective tax rate excluding one-time items in the range of 24.5% for the year.","Bottom-line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.62 which was up 10% year-to-year. When you look at the year-to-year drivers of our operating EPS performance the 5% decline in revenue at constant margin impacted profit growth by $0.17 per share. Margin expansion was the largest contributor to our growth. Within that, the gain on the RSS divestiture contributed $0.23, gross margin expansion added $0.19 and our expense productivity another $0.16. On the other hand, we did have an increase in our workforce rebalancing activity for an impact of $0.24.","Our ongoing share repurchase program contributed the balance at a level fairly consistent with the first two quarters of the year. As you can see the dynamics are very similar to first half performance. Now I will get into the third quarter details starting with revenue by geography where I'll discuss the results on a constant currency basis.","America's revenue was down 3% with declines in both the U.S. and Canada. In North America, software was up 4%, services was down and we had a double digit decline in hardware. With revenue performance relatively consistent with last quarter, EMEA was stable. Looking at the performance by country, Germany and Spain grew; the U.K. was flat, while France and Italy declined.","Turning to Asia Pacific last quarter, I said that I expected our business in Japan to stabilize. This quarter our revenue in Japan was flat year-to-year, so certainly an improvement over the last several quarters. We had good performance in both Europe and Japan given the environment, and our growth market countries, which we refer to as GMU, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%.","We had double digit growth in Russia, which was up 11%, India up 13% and China up 19%. Brazil, however, was down 3%. Looking beyond the BRICs, Australia and Mexico were down double digits this quarter, while most of the other countries continued to do well. In fact, this quarter 35 of the growth market countries grew at a double digit rate, reflecting ongoing broad-based strength. Looking at IBM revenue and gross margin by segment, our total services revenue was flat as modest revenue growth from our backlog was offset by impacts from shorter-term and volume related activity.","Software performance is driven by double digit growth across our solutions area like business analytics, commerce and social business. Our Systems and Technology revenue declined each month though performance in September improved as we introduced our Next Generation System Z.","Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margins improved 1.2 points, driven by a combination of margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative performance of software.","Now, let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 10%. The primary driver was currency which drove 8 points from both translation and hedging dynamics. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 3 points of expense growth, so consequently our base expense was better by 5 points.","Now I'll comment on a few expense items. SG&A includes a pretax charge of over $400 million for workforce rebalancing activity which at IBM's average tax rate impacted net income by about $310 million. Other income and expense had two drivers; first, of pretax gain for the sale of a Retail Store Solutions business, and second, we had a year-to-year impact from our hedging activity. The pretax gain for the RSS sale is almost $450 million with a discrete tax rate on that gain based on the countries closed the transaction contributed about $280 million of net income.","Turning to the hedging activity, we hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in our global cash planning. Last year hedging programs generated losses resulting in an impact to expense of about $175 million, while this year the programs generated gains of about $100 million in expense. Roughly 90% of our hedging activity this quarter was in expense, the balance is in cost. As you know, this hedging activity can't be looked at in isolation, as it mitigates translation impacts throughout the P&L.","Looking at how all of this translates into pretax margins by segment, we've provided here a normalized view of the profit and margin dynamics by removing the workforce rebalancing charges in both years to give you a better view of the underlying operational performance of the segments. On this basis, you can see good profit growth and margin expansion in Global Technology Services, Global Business Services and Software.","Now let's turn to the segments starting with services. The two services segments delivered $14.5 billion in revenue and excluding workforce rebalancing charges grew pretax profit 9% and expanded pretax margins by just over 2 points. Backlog was $138 billion up 1% year-to-year. We continue to see strong performance in the growth markets with backlog up 15% at constant currency and globally transactional backlog was up 7% at constant currency.","Turning to the two segments, in Global Technology Services revenue was $9.9 billion down 4% as reported and up 1% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was flat at constant currency. As we have previously discussed there are three primary sources of revenue in outsourcing. First, revenue from backlog, which makes up the majority of the revenue in the year. Second, revenue from new client signings within the year; and finally, revenue from base growth, which comes from new business sold into the existing accounts and from volumes generated within the quarter.","This quarter we continue to get revenue growth from our backlog. However, we did see a decline in revenue from base growth after growing through the first half. Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 3% at constant currency with the growth markets up 13% at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered flat pretax profit growth in the quarter though excluding workforce rebalancing charges pretax profit was up 9% with 2 points of margin expansion.","This quarter there are a number of drivers of margin expansion. First, increased contribution from the growth markets, which continue to drive higher gross margins than our major markets; second, lift from our continued focus on automation and process primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives and finally, we continue to benefit from the work GTS has done to improve performance in a select set of lower margin contracts within strategic outsourcing.","Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.5 billion, down 6% as reported or down 3% at constant currency. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to drive the strongest performance. Japan returned to growth this quarter with revenue up 2% at constant currency while North America and Europe are both down 6% at constant currency.","Looking at the GBS business by offering, the growth initiatives continued to drive strong growth. We had solid double digit growth in business analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud. Together these initiatives represent about a third of total GBS revenue. So, we continue to get great traction in these growth initiatives and we're seeing the benefits across IBM. The overall growth rate of GBS is being impacted by declines in some of the more traditional package application projects.","Turning to profit, GBS pretax income declined 5% year-to-year. However, when adjusting for workforce rebalancing, pretax income grew 9% and pretax margin expanded 2.5 points. Margin expansion benefited from prior year quarters workforce rebalancing, yield from enterprise productivity initiatives and a help from currency.","Software revenue of $5.8 billion is down 1% and up 3% at constant currency. Through August, revenue was up 5% at constant currency. However, performance in September was weak particularly in North America and the growth markets. Our portfolio of solutions offerings was up double digits year-to-year while the complementary infrastructure portfolio was essentially flat.","Now, let me take you through the drivers for the brands. WebSphere grew 5% at constant currency and continue to extend its market-leading position. We had good growth from our commerce offerings which target not only the CIO, but also the CMO, so we're reaching new buyers. This performance was bolstered our recent acquisitions of Tealeaf which enables clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile devices.","Information management was up 3% at constant currency. Performance was driven by strong growth in our business analytics offerings, led by Algorithmics which together with our deep analytics expertise helps our clients manage risk and better enable faster decision-making. Just last week Software announced new members of PureSystems family, the IBM PureData Systems. These expert integrated systems are optimized to deliver high-performance data services for transactional and analytics applications.","Tivoli software was up 9% at constant currency and gained share. Revenue from our storage portfolio was up 14% at constant currency reflecting the value of stored software. Tivoli Security was up 9% at constant currency driven by Q1 Labs which provides next-generation security intelligence. Lotus declined 7% at constant currency in the quarter although Notes declined we had strong performance in our social business offerings.","In the third quarter we announced the acquisition of Kenexa which further expand our solution portfolio for social business. We expect Kenexa to close late in the fourth quarter. Software pretax income was $2.4 billion, up 6% from last year. Normalized for the high level of workforce rebalancing, software pretax income was up 10% and pretax margin expanded 3.5 points. Systems and Technology delivered revenue of $3.9 billion down 13%. Adjusting for the divestiture of Retail Store Solutions, revenue was down 11% or 9% at constant currency.","System Z revenue declined 19% at constant currency and MIPS declined 2%. Late in the third quarter we started shipping the zEnterprise EC12 server which delivers up to 25% improved application performance and up to 50% enhanced capacity making it the fastest and most capable enterprise system to-date. This new mainframe will be ramping through the fourth quarter.","Power revenue was down 1% at constant currency. We had strength again this quarter in Power high-performance computing solutions. We continued our success in competitive take outs. This quarter we had over 260 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $200 million of business which came almost equally from HP and Oracle Sun. This initiative helped drive our 18th consecutive quarter of share gains in Power.","Early in October we announced a new POWER7 plus based servers. These new systems offer performance boosts of 30% to 40% compared to prior versions and new capabilities for cloud and security. System x revenue was down 3% at constant currency. Our storage hardware revenue was down 8% at constant currency, while storage software which is reported in Tivoli was up 14% at constant currency. We continue to see value shifting to software. Earlier this month, we announced the new high-end DS8070, which enables clients to take full advantage of the increased performance, in our new high-end enterprise servers. We are expanding our storage software capabilities as well. Last week we announced the Virtual Storage Center, which integrates multiple software solutions that deliver fast backup and restore in a virtualized storage environment.","As you look to the fourth quarter we have significantly enhanced our systems portfolio with our new zEnterprise EC12 mainframe, Power systems based on the new POWER7 plus architecture and new storage systems including the high-end DS8870.","Across all of our segments, we're continuing the strong performance in our key growth initiatives. In the growth markets, we're expanding into new markets, building out IT infrastructures and focusing on targeted industries. For the year, revenue was up 7% at constant currency and we have gained share. Our Business Analytics Solutions help our clients to identify, manage and predict outcomes by leveraging huge amounts of data. Our broad portfolio of Analytics Solutions was up 14% in the third quarter, led by our GBS consulting practice.","Our SmartCloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements with strong growth across the offerings from private cloud to public cloud to our industry-based solutions. Cloud revenue so far this year has already exceeded our full year revenue for 2011. All of this comes together in our Smarter Planet Solutions. Through the third quarter, we had revenue growth of more than 20% in the Smarter Planet portfolio, with traction and our smarter commerce and industry solutions. When you look at our offerings in our Business Analytics, Cloud and Smarter Planet about half of the revenue was software. So, the success we're having in these areas is improving our business mix and our margin.","Turning to cash flow, we generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. Now, let me walk through the year-to-year drivers. Our operating net income was up $200 million year-to-year and GAAP income is flat. One of the non-operating items this quarter is a charge for U.K. pension. On October 12th, the U.K. Court issued a ruling regarding an IBM U.K. pension plan. We took a pretax charge of approximately $160 million or $125 million after tax, though the charge impacted GAAP net income, it did not impact operating income and since it's a non-cash item, it's reversed in a free cash flow analysis.","Looking at the items that impacted cash year-to-year, our cash tax payments increased $300 million. We had an increase of almost $100 million for our workforce rebalancing payments and our capital expenditures were also up year-to-year. So, though operating profit was up $200 million, free cash flow was down almost $350 million based on increased tax capital and restructuring payments. Through the first three quarters of the year our free cash flow was up $1 billion year-to-year to $8.7 billion. Our growth in net income was partially offset with increased capital investments. As I mentioned previously, in the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments driven by audit settlement activity.","Looking at the uses of our cash through September, we spent $2.3 billion to acquire 10 companies including Texas Memory Systems which closed in the third quarter. We returned almost $12 billion to shareholders this year. We paid out over $2.8 billion in dividends and spent $9 billion in share repurchase to buyback almost 46 million shares. At end of the third quarter, we had $6.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.3 million. Total debt was $33.7 billion of which $23.3 billion was in support of our financing business which is leveraged at just over 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $10.3 billion and our non-financing debt to cap was 36% consistent with June.","We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long-term. Wrapping up our discussion on the quarter, we delivered 10% operating EPS growth and $3.1 billion in free cash flow. Within our operations, we had solid contribution from our annuity businesses and strong performance in our growth initiatives, Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and Cloud. Our productivity initiatives helped to drive margin expansion and our solid balance sheet and cash generation supported shareholder returns.","As we move into the fourth quarter we have new product introductions in our Systems portfolio not just in System Z but also in Power and storage. We have just announced PureSystems offerings that leverage our software capabilities and late in the quarter we expect to close the acquisition of Kenexa. Taking all of this into account we are maintaining our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at least $15.10. This keeps us on track to at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015.","Now Patricia and I will take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I ask you to refrain from multipart questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. Operator, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Toni Sacconagh with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Toni Sacconagh - Sanford Bernstein","I was wondering, if you could provide some color, commentary around the quarter. Relative to your expectations revenues were short, your tone I think sounded a bit more cautious and you made several references to the U.S. being weaker and the third month of the quarter being more challenging. So specifically on those latter two points, can you help us understand what you think happened? Is this being driven by macroeconomic issues? Are these IBM execution issues and if we look forward, are you expecting either the execution of the macro issues to reverse or improve in the fourth quarter?","Mark Loughridge","So, if you look at the third quarter performance, we did start off the first two months to the quarter on a stronger trajectory than we saw for the full quarter as we saw a fall-off in our growth rates in the third month of the quarter. Now, within that, third month phenomena, I would point to look at it from a brand perspective that was really a fall-off that we saw in our GBS business, number one, and our software business, number two, and from a geographic perspective, it was really a fall-off that we saw in North America and our growth markets unit which we refer to as GMU.","Now, elementally, as you walk down those, the software content, I would attribute to a handful of deals that fell out of the quarter. Frankly, we thought we had those, right through the end of the quarter. They rolled to the fourth quarter. They would have accounted for about 2 points improved performance, which would have been more consistent with what we saw in the first two months of the quarter and those software deals were also part of the GMU performance.","So, just as a software business would have performed better in the quarter, with the rollover of that handful of deals so would our GMU performance. Now, as you look at our growth market performance, in addition, they were impacted really by a couple of very large countries that had disappointing performance on a year-to-year basis. So, that would be Mexico and Australia. They are both down double digit. Our BRIC countries as a whole were up 11% and within that plus 11% positive performance very consistent what we've seen historically. Brazil was in fact down 3% but on the other countries Russia was up 11%, India was up 13% and China was up very strong 19%.","Now let's look at the countries in GMU, outside of the BRIC countries. Again if we exclude Australia and Mexico, where we had the double digit decline, the balance of the countries outside of BRIC grew double digit, in fact we had 35 countries with double digit performance. So, I would not attribute some broader trend to either of those perspectives. In our GBS business, GBS once again produced very strong results on a solutions base, but we did have a more challenging environment for the more traditional packet solutions. The other solution content is linked to our key growth initiatives, so it's very important that we do well there. So, now if you take that data forward in the fourth quarter, I think on the software business and the hardware business outside of the impact of the Retail Store Systems divestiture, we should be seeing mid-single digit performance from both of them and driving double digit profitability. I think our services business will have a revenue base similar to what we saw in the third quarter, but let me add you know the services profitability that they each drove at 9% growth was right in midpoint of their model performance, and with that as well as the new announcement content that we're getting out of our hardware business, we have new z. We have a new POWER7 plus entry in our high end of our P Series. We have got new storage content. We feel quite confidence in the at least $0.15 for the year.","Patricia Murphy","","Thanks Toni can we go to the next question please.","","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","Mark you talked a bit about what could get better in the fourth quarter in terms of revenue. I believe you said the hardware and software revenue growth rates. Can talk about what could get better in the fourth quarter and even next year in costs? You had a very larger well put in perspective, your workforce rebalancing for us and what costs levers you have going into the fourth quarter and beyond please?","Mark Loughridge","Sure. I think the overall opportunity we have in costs really goes back fundamentally to the business model and how we drive that business model over longer periods of time. The workforce rebalancing that we have done this year in total that was about $800 million predominantly outside the U.S. and should have a payback of about 15 months.","Now we are constantly driving workforce rebalancing to tune our population to the best growth opportunities that we have. If you look at the overall cost and spending improvement that we saw in the third quarter, the first point I would make is that, in a period of currency headwind that impact that that has in the overall translational effect of currency that's mitigated and partially offset obviously by the hedge.","You could kind of see that in the margin performance in our business. Our gross profit margins were up 1.2 points while our PTI was up 2.5 points and that differential a large part of that is the offset of the hedge helping to offset the impact that we saw on the revenue line and this flow through to gross profit margin. The 1.2 points we add in gross profit that had a very solid mix component, about 0.4 points from mix and a very solid spend component, and I think both of those are strong ongoing plays that we should leverage as we go into the fourth quarter and 2013. ","That mix component is predominantly the mix that we see in the software that we've been driving for a decade and the spend efficiencies are part of that overall $8 billion plan that we have for 2015 roadmap. Obviously, to break that down by year, its $1.6 billion by quarter is about $400 million if we get 30% to 40% to the bottom line, that's an advantage about $150 million. The balance, I'd remind you, that really goes to making our offerings and our products more competitive. On a price basis, it gives the ability to move spend to more aggressive growth opportunities.","Patricia Murphy ","","Thank you Ben can we please go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steve Milunovich - UBS","Given that the number of month weakness, could you talk a bit more about what customers are telling you in terms of the fourth quarter, I have seen some CIOs. There is some concern about not just the election, but fiscal cliff and questioning whether we're going to see the normal budget flush. Maybe you could tie into that, what you're seeing in verticals. It looks like finance in public slowed a bit, but it actually held in relatively well, so do you think there is much downside risk going forward?","Mark Loughridge","I got to admit this was cutting out a little bit, but I heard the substance to your question. So, let me answer that. I think as I'm not going to kind of comment on the environment as if I were an economist but I can you tell the facts that we saw in the substance of the business will take time to describe so far.","When you look at the overall issue of a fiscal cliff and a budget flush, I got to be honest, Steve, I kind of react to the position because I don't think it will be responsible kind of a performance for either public or private sector. I mean if we have spending requirements, I don't think people would rollout and maximize their spend rate this budget period to the expense of the overall spend requirements. I know if it was in my business and one of my controllers, the CFO was 'driving a budget flush' I'd be driving them out of the business. So, certainly the controllers that I have met in government, they are very responsible, they are driving to do exactly the right thing and if they see spending pressure, they are doing their work to help respond to that. To me, on a global basis, we look around the world, governments are under pressure.","The spending is under pressure. I don't think this is news to anybody, but I think Steve from my perspective when you look at this proposition that there will be a budget flush to me as I had said earlier, I kind of react to that because it implies I think that they wouldn't be responding to the base economic challenges they have and I don't think that's the case.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Steve. Can we take the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","Mark, I'm wondering, I'm not sure if I heard you right, but I though you said that the outsourcing and the transactional backlog were up this quarter on a constant currency basis. Can you help us reconcile that with the continued loss of revenue momentum within the services unit?","Mark Loughridge","Sure. If you look at the overall backlog, our total backlog for the quarter was up 1% within that our outsourcing backlog was relatively flat. Our transactional backlog if you just do the math was up 7% now. There are some dynamics that are pretty compelling within that. So, when you look at that outsourcing backlog and you break that down by unit you see much more momentum in our growth markets. So, if you take the total backlog for the business and break that down between major markets and growth markets the backlog in our growth markets is up 15% and that's kind of an ongoing momentum that we have seen in our services business in the growth markets.","If you break this then down by unit, on the GTS base of business, I think they had a pretty good quarter there and actually the GTS business is up more than 1% as we enter the fourth quarter. I would also analyze the revenue performance in the quarter and remind you that we did take this very specific set of actions on the weak tail of the profitability distribution of our contracts and as we took that action on the weak tail that enhances and improves overall profitability. You saw it in the first nine months of the year of this year with the strong performance that we got out of the GTS business but it does have an impact on the other side to revenue. We knew that and we made that trade-off because our objective is to drive real gross profit and real profitability in those contracts in the backlog. It's not that hard to go through the services business and drive big signings but you have to live with that decision for a number of years in relationship with your customer. Our objective is to establish a strong relationship right up front with a profitable set of contracts that we know we can deliver over the longer term. So, I think I would caution you from looking at that GTS business, you got to recognize there was some revenue impact as we optimized to profitability.","Patricia Murphy ","Thanks Mark. Let\u2019s go to the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","I have a question on the services segment as well. We're obviously seeing a pretty big dislocation in restructuring effort at one of your largest services competitors and more than we've certainly seen in a while in this sector. Is that having any noticeable impact on the competitive landscape, in outsourcing in particular, are you expecting to see any competitive tailwind as we go into 2013?","Mark Loughridge","Well, I do think as we look at the capability that we're able to put on the field, we've got a pretty strong hand of very disciplined and experienced managers and executives, employees in the services business and I got to say the services business is not like the software business. It's not like the hardware business. It is a specific skillset. So, to the point that there is an impact on one of our competitor's profile that certainly should provide us opportunity, but when you look at the kind of broader trends that I think are more significant. I think you got to look at the opportunity we're seeing in the growth markets. Again, when we look at an opportunity set in growth markets, where we have about 20% of our backlog to be up 15% that's a pretty strong statement at very strong levels of profitability where we want to see where we can really put talent on the field, differentiated from our competition, there are lot of examples in the growth markets.","Patricia Murphy ","Thanks Bill. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan ","When I come to Software business for a second here if we could, I know IBM has been pretty active hiring a lot more sales force individuals that capacity, does that have any impact on business in terms of visibility or some of these deal push-outs related to the piece on the sales force?","Mark Loughridge","No, I mean, as we hire, we're going to continue hiring as we go through the fourth quarter. We take that resource and we train it and make it more productive and drive it into your overall sales organization, now that period of bringing that sales resource up to speed takes some time, but underneath that if you look at our Software business, the solutions contents underneath it had a very strong quarter, up double digit once again and the solutions contents is both organically generated as well as the implementation of the integration with our acquisition profile and that's been very strong across the portfolio of offerings. It was a little more challenging and new to performance on the infrastructure side, but as we look at the fourth quarter. I think we have opportunities across both and so again adjusting for that handful of deals in Software that fell out of a quarter, we were seeing performance more consistent with what we saw in the first two months of the quarter and I think we have the opportunity to close those deals and get back on a stronger trajectory as we go into the fourth quarter. So I think we have got a good software play here and I would look for them to generate mid-single-digit revenue growth in Q4.","Patricia Murphy ","Thank you Mark. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","I wanted to ask you about GBS in particular and how you think growth can proceed as we look out and the context of the question is GBS on a constant currency basis has been down 1% each of the first two quarters, was down 3% this quarter on frankly an easier compare. You mentioned that Japan had stabilized, which is usually a positive impact on GBS. So it continues to disappoint. How does growth improve? What causes improve? Or is this the right kind of run rate for GBS as we look out over the next few quarters?","Mark Loughridge","I don't disagree with your comments. I can provide more of a background. Do think we certainly do have the opportunity to improve. I think the business did what we said we're going to drive in Japan. We did stabilize our business in Japan. I think the team in Japan did a nice job. What we really wrestled with a little here was the challenge that we had in those more traditional packet solutions and they were generally kind of third-party offerings and HR supply chain or ERP. On the flipside of the coin though we did a great job in GBS on those key growth initiatives and the solutions attached to those. So on one hand I would have liked to have seen, I know the team would have liked to seen, better performance in those traditional packet areas and we're going to be rebuilding capability as we go in the fourth quarter and 2013. But I thought they did a very nice job on the solutions business, which is so important because its cuts across our business profile into hardware, software and services business. Let me remind you as you all know, those solutions drive about 50% mix in overall software business. So, we can do better as we work on that, traditional packet solutions. But I think they deserve a lot of credit for the work they have done on the solutions business.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Keith. Can we go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley ","Can you talk a little bit more about what you expect out of the recently announced server and storage product, specifically are you looking for growth across all the server products in the fourth quarter? Do you think growth can carry into next year and is there a structural shift towards better margins just given that your innovation seems to focus on the higher margin categories within there?","Mark Loughridge","Sure. I would break the new announcements into kind of three categories, the first two we are introducing the new high end POWER7 plus and I think that has a lot of key technology offerings. It's only part of the product line, however, but it is the high-end. So, we look at that as real margin opportunity within the mix of their product line. Likewise, in the storage business, we're announcing the new high-end content introducing POWER7 to our architecture and we think that likely has real opportunity in the high-end for not just revenue, but margin contribution within their product line.","But clearly the big announcement for the quarter is the new z Series and as we look at the new z Series, now we have a full quarter of opportunity. In the third quarter, we're really only shipping the new z for about 11 days in the very backend of the quarter and in front of that, ship date, we only had about three weeks of selling time, so now is the opportunity for full quarters work, and as I look at it, I think they have a very strong case on a Hardware basis for the new z platform to generate 20% to 30% growth.","So, within all that, that gives us confidence within our objectives that the hardware base of business are to be generating about 5% revenue growth, our of the impact of divestiture of the Retail Store Systems content. Now that divestment has about a 4 point impact to the hardware base of business and about 1 point impact to IBM. But I think we do have good hand on that content and will see it improve the overall hardware performance not just in North America but as we go through the global rollout as well.","Patricia Murphy ","Thanks Katy. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Jim Suva - Citigroup","The question I have is on your bookings, they were up very meaningfully here at 8% year-over-year, the constant current up 11%. As you look into that, just curious if there is anything in that number that was one-off that was something it maybe slipped in from Q2 last quarter or pulled in from Q4, any special big one-time special booking and any changes of durations, just that we should be aware of?","Mark Loughridge","No I think that was capitalizing on the opportunities with the advantages that we can bring to the marketplace again. If you look at the backlog contents and I think that's the best metric to use here while backlog was up 1% overall it was up 15% in our growth markets. If you look at the components of total backlog between outsourcing and transactional, outsourcing is relatively flat while transactional is up 7%. I would not say there were some kind of very neat contracts that were inconsistent with our overall rollout contributed to that. I think one of the very powerful trends that we do see is how well our content and our capability plays in new opportunities as we look at growth markets. I think that's the more substantial trend line we see here.","Patricia Murphy ","Operator let\u2019s take one more question please.","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank ","I wanted to come back to services margins one more time if I could. What I'm really trying to understand here is the dynamic between the pruning of some unprofitable contracts, is that nearing completion? Is there more room to the deal on the pruning side? Then secondarily most of the workforce rebalancing efforts targeted at driving services margins and if so can you frame a medium-term margin target for the services business there in 2013? Do you expect margins to improve further from these levels?","Mark Loughridge","Yes. So let's look at the overall margin dynamics for the Corporation. When you look at it we are driving that very focused piece of work that Linda Sanford took you through at the Analyst Meeting to generate about $8 billion of spend take-out across the business and as I'd said earlier if you just kind of mathematically break it down to about $1.6 billion a year or $400 million a quarter that content is in some respects outside of the business unit purview and it gets applied to those business units based on their kind of metrics in participation. So in other words if we take big spend rate out of the back office support organizations. The business units are the beneficiary of that spend take-out but they didn't have to drive a lot of the content since we manage on a globally integrated enterprise.","That's a very structured play that we are driving not only across our back-office content but now into systematic areas that span across our processes and also spend rates within business units that collectively have more opportunities. So, we intend to continue that overall spend dynamic and as I had said earlier our services business will certainly be a beneficiary there. Now in your question about the overall workforce rebalancing that we do just given the fact that the services business have the largest share of our overall population of course they are going to be the beneficiary of that as well. But to me on the longer-term basis, I think that the model base that we provided as part of the 2015 roadmap is the best criteria, the best content that you can see as you look at that long-term run rate. So if you look at how we would attempt to implement those as we go into 2013.","I mean believe me, this team is going to look at the actuals that we drive in 2012, we are going to draw a plum line to that 2015 objective and then we are going to base our profitability, our free cash flow all of those content in our budgets to support it as well as our compensation. So that's how we will be driving that.","So let me just take a moment now to wrap up the call. Despite facing challenges we did deliver a 7% growth in profit, 10% growth in our operating EPS and I think consistent with the last conversation that performance reflects our disciplined approach to delivering profit growth. For the quarter we had 10% growth in our software profit, 9% from our services businesses, both of which benefit from a large annuity base. We are continuing to move up the value chain shifting our portfolio to more strategic areas. Now we had continued momentum in our growth initiatives both Smarter Planet, Business Analytics as well as our Cloud, were all up strong double digits and this quarter we completed the divestiture of our retail store solutions business.","The benefits from our ongoing work on productivity showed through to our margin and we are returning value to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. So looking forward as we enter the fourth quarter, as always we need to execute and we need the growth market for the software to close those rollover deals that we discussed and then drive an improved trajectory in the fourth quarter. We need GBS to drive more of that traditional packet transactions content while maintaining the good momentum they have shown in our growth initiatives.","I think North America needs to capitalize on the great hardware product lineup we have for the fourth quarter with the new z, the new p and storage to drive transactional sales performance in the fourth quarter. So based on this we are confident in our plans to achieve at least $15.10 of operating EPS for the year. That's up 12% from last year and on track to at least $20 in 2015. So once again thanks for joining us and now as always it's back to work.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's call. The conference has now ended.

This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM, and I\u2019d like to welcome you to our First Quarter Earnings Presentation. I\u2019m here today with Jim Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

As we wrapped up 2017 and in our Investor Briefing webcast in early March, we talked about the work we\u2019ve done to reposition our business to lead in the high value segments of IT, our differentiated value proposition, and how our financial strategy and model is built to deliver value to our clients and our shareholders over the long term.","We made progress in our financial performance in the second half of last year, and now our first quarter results demonstrate further progress toward our model. So, we\u2019re clearly moving in the right direction. In the quarter, we delivered $19.1 billion of revenue, $2.3 billion of operating net income, and $2.45 of operating earnings per share. And with this start to the year, we continue to expect at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share in 2018.","Our revenue in the quarter was up 5% year-to-year. Without the currency tailwind, our revenue was up modestly, though you\u2019ll see on the chart constant currency rounds to flat. Now turning to profit, our operating gross profit was up 3%, with broad-based improvement in our year-to-year gross margin performance versus last quarter. Our operating net income was up 2% and earnings per share was up 4%. Those are inclusive of a year-to-year headwind from the actions we took in the first quarter to continue better positioning our business for the long-term. I\u2019ll expand on this in a minute, but what you\u2019ll see in the underlying operating dynamics is that we improved our gross margin trajectory, expanded our PTI margin and had solid growth in earnings per share.","Looking at the year-to-year dynamics let me start with revenue. As I said, we\u2019re up 5% at actual rates, with 6% growth in Cognitive Solutions, 4% in Global Business Services, 5% in Technology Services and Cloud Platforms and 8% in Systems.","Let me add some color by segment, and from here on I\u2019ll focus primarily on constant currency performance. Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 2% year-to-year, with continued strength in security software and industry platforms, and a return to growth in our analytics revenue. These Cognitive results contributed to growth in our total software revenue for this quarter, with strong transactional performance and continued growth in SaaS. In our services businesses, we had an improvement in our revenue trajectory from last quarter, driven by revenue from the run-out of our backlog. In addition, both segments grew signings this quarter, contributing to double-digit growth in total services signings, driven by cloud content. Our Systems revenue was up 4%, with very strong revenue growth again in IBM Z, and a second consecutive quarter of growth in Power. Our storage hardware revenue declined this quarter. We were disappointed in our storage performance and it contributed to a modest shortfall to our own expectations of IBM\u2019s revenue growth in the quarter.","Our first quarter results reflect much of the work we\u2019ve done to reposition our portfolio and our skills to address the secular trends in the market, led by the phenomenon of data. We\u2019ve been building new platforms and solutions, while modernizing existing ones, embedding cloud and AI into more of what we offer. And so, IBM is now a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company, focused on the high-value areas of IT.","Our strategic imperatives revenue is an indication of our success in addressing these secular trends. Over the last twelve months, our strategic imperatives revenue of $37.7 billion represents 47% of revenue. Our strategic imperatives revenue in the first quarter was up 15% at actual rates, or 10% at constant currency, led by security which was up 60%, and cloud.","Our cloud revenue is now $17.7 billion over the last year, which is up 22% as reported. Cloud growth in the quarter was driven by our as-a-Service offerings and we\u2019re exiting the first quarter with an annual run rate of $10.7 billion, which is up 20% at constant currency. Our cloud success reflects our ability to help our clients run hybrid environments, with our one cloud architecture across public, private and multi-clouds.","The continued scaling of our strategic imperatives, together with focus on efficiency and productivity is contributing to our improved margin trajectory. So bringing it all together, we grew revenue, operating net income and operating earnings per share and improved our year-to-year gross margin trajectory as compared to the fourth quarter.","Before moving to our key financial metrics, we have a few significant items in our results this quarter, so I want to take a minute to walk through these. And I\u2019ll start by reminding you of what we said 90 days ago in our discussion of our 2018 expectations. We said we expected to deliver between 17% and 18% of the full year earnings per share expectation in the first quarter. Our first quarter operating earnings per share of $2.45 is 17.8% of $13.80, so consistent with the range we provided. We said we expected an ongoing tax rate of 16% for the year, plus or minus two points, and that\u2019s excluding discrete items. We also said that just like in each of the last two years, we anticipated discrete tax benefits in the first quarter, and we\u2019d likely take actions that would offset some portion of the benefit.","In the quarter, we took actions to continue the transformation of our business. These actions drove pre-tax charges of about $610 million, with the majority of this in SG&A, and some in cost. First, with the repositioning of our portfolio, we have emerged as a leader in the high value segments of the enterprise IT industry. This requires revitalization of our skills base and this quarter we took actions to further align our skills to these high value areas. And then second, we took actions that will better position our systems cost structure over the long term. In addition, we settled a number of US and foreign tax audits, which drove discrete non-cash, tax benefits of $810 million in the quarter. Let me remind you that this benefit reverses charges that were reflected in prior years.","As always, we\u2019ve included these charges and benefits in our operating results. Today we\u2019ve laid out a year-to-year bridge of our operating earnings per share, isolating what I\u2019ll call these significant items, so that you can better see the underlying dynamics of our business.","Looking at the drivers of our $2.45 of operating earnings per share on a year-to-year basis, we had contribution from revenue growth at constant margin, as well as from operating leverage. The operating leverage was driven by pre-tax margin expansion, mitigated by a higher underlying tax rate year-to-year. A lower share count contributed to growth and then you can see the year-to-year impact of the significant actions, which was a headwind to our earnings per share growth. So this is a good start to the year, and as I said earlier, our underlying operating dynamics show an improved gross margin trajectory, expansion of our pre-tax margin and solid growth in our operating earnings per share.","I want to mention one other item that we discussed in the context of our 2018 expectations. In January, we implemented two new accounting standards, revenue recognition and the presentation of pension costs. The net effect of the two was a modest reduction in our operating earnings per share in the first quarter, with effectively no impact year-to-year. Regarding the implications to revenue, adoption of the new revenue standard had a de minimis benefit to our revenue in the first quarter, and we expect any full-year contribution to be immaterial.","So now let me talk about the key financial metrics for our operating performance, and show you the impact these significant items have on our results.","As I said, our revenue was $19.1 billion, and the year-to-year performance is essentially all organic. From a geography perspective, revenue in the Americas was flat year-to-year. A decline in the US was offset by solid growth in Canada and Latin America, which was led by Brazil. Asia Pacific was also flat. This is a two-point improvement over the year-to-year performance in the fourth quarter. Our Europe revenue trajectory also improved and in fact, returned to growth. We had strong in France and Spain, and while Germany and the UK declined, they had marked improvement in their year-to-year trajectory.","Looking at our margin performance globally, our operating gross margin was down 70 basis points, though that includes a 40-basis point impact associated with the significant item I just mentioned to improve our long-term Systems cost structure. This is good improvement in our year-to-year margin dynamics, driven by mix and productivity, led by services.","Our operating expense was up 9%, driven by currency, and the actions to continue repositioning of our business. Without these, our expense was better by 1%, reflecting a high level of investment, and our continued focus on productivity. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, when currency helps the top line, it also hurts the expense line due to both translation and the impact of hedging losses. And so, in the first quarter, currency drove five of the nine points of expense growth. And then, a high level of workforce transformation activity drove another six points of expense growth. I\u2019ll also mention that we had a lower level of IP income, which drove two points of expense growth.","Our operating tax rate for the quarter reflects an underlying rate of 16%, as well as the discrete tax benefits of $810 million. The 16% is in line with the range we discussed in January and is up over a point year-to-year. The operating net income was up 2%, and operating earnings per share of $2.45 was better by 4% and those include the year-to-year impact of the significant items.","Looking at the cash metrics, we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $13.3 billion over the last twelve months. That\u2019s nearly 120% of GAAP net income. I\u2019ll come back to the drivers of our cash performance after I walk through each of the segments.","Now turning to our segments, Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 2%, as we continue to scale our new platforms and solutions and grow our SaaS offerings. Solutions Software revenue also grew 2% led by offerings in analytics and security. Within analytics, growth this quarter was driven by strong transactional performance. We saw broad-based growth across both our on-prem analytics platforms and our SaaS offerings, as clients look to use their data for competitive advantage. And so from a portfolio perspective, we had continued growth in offerings that allow our clients to better manage their data in hybrid environments like our Integrated Analytics Systems. We also had strong growth in our data science offerings, where we introduced new capabilities that allow data developers to leverage open-source tools in a secure, collaborative environment.","You\u2019ll remember last quarter we talked about the weakness in the data integration space due to new offerings introduced very late in the quarter. These new offerings are resonating with our clients and contributed to growth this quarter.","Also within analytics, we continue to scale our industry platforms. Let me focus this quarter on Financial Services. Watson Financial Services had another strong quarter, led by Promontory\u2019s Risk and Regulatory business, as well as our Financial Crimes portfolio. We\u2019re seeing a real synergy opportunity in combining Promontory\u2019s industry expertise with our AI technologies. Watson remains the AI platform for business, with continued strong demand for our offerings, particularly around virtual assistants, where conversation service usage increased triple digits year-to-year.","In the first quarter, we introduced several new offerings to accelerate client journeys to AI, such as the enhanced Watson Assistant, with conversational offerings tailored to specific industries like automotive and hospitality. Orange Bank and AutoDesk are two examples of early adopters of our latest technology. And just last week, Forrester recognized IBM Watson Assistant as the only leader in its New Wave report on Conversational Computing Platforms.","Security had great growth this quarter and we continued to gain share. We are well positioned in this market with our extensive security portfolio, which is enhanced with AI to address the needs of our clients. There is obviously a lot of demand here given the important of cyber security risks and data privacy concerns, especially in an environment where security talent is at a premium. We had good performance in areas like data security, with GDPR as a driver, endpoint management and orchestration. And we had strong revenue growth in our SaaS offerings in security, as we continue to increase our AI capabilities across the portfolio.","We also continue to make progress in emerging areas like blockchain. We\u2019ve grown to over 50 active blockchain networks since the release of our IBM Blockchain Platform in the third quarter last year. And last month, we announced a beta version of our IBM Blockchain Platform Starter Plan, designed for startups, developers and companies of any size that want to quickly stand up a blockchain network. In the first two weeks, we had over 750 networks provisioned.","Turning to Transaction Processing Software, revenue was up 1%, so another good quarter. Growth was driven by Z middleware, as our clients continue to invest and growth their high value, mission-critical workloads on the Z platform.","Looking at profit this quarter, pre-tax income for the segment grew 5% and pre-tax margin was roughly flat year-to-year, even with a nearly two-point impact from the workforce actions. Margins were driven by strong transactional performance in high-value areas, offset by ongoing investments into strategic areas and business mix.","Moving on to Services, Global Business Services revenue was down 1% at constant currency, which is a modest improvement in trajectory from the fourth quarter and we again grew signings. Our strategic imperatives revenue reflects the on-going shifts to areas of higher client value, with growth across multiple areas like cloud and analytics.","Turning to the lines of businesses, Consulting revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter and our backlog was up year-to-year. Revenue growth was led by strong double-digit growth in our Digital strategy and ix business, which implements end-to-end digital transformation strategies for our clients. GBS is uniquely positioned to bring together IBM\u2019s first-mover advantage in the most promising, emerging technologies, like blockchain, with their industry expertise, to develop solutions which help clients unlock value.","Looking at Application Management, our revenue was down 2% this quarter, a one-point sequential improvement from fourth quarter. Application Management signings grew at a double-digit rate, as we leverage our incumbency to help clients modernize their critical applications and migrate to the cloud.","Turning to profit, GBS gross margin stabilized this quarter, a two-point improvement in trajectory from the fourth quarter. This includes about a half-a-point impact from currency. The improvement was driven by productivity, revenue mix and pricing improvements. Pre-tax margin was down three-and-a-half points year-to-year, including an impact of nearly two points from the workforce rebalancing charges. This reflects our ongoing investments in the next generation of offerings, skills and enablement, and the reshaping of our pyramids for each of our core service lines, which will drive operating leverage in the long-term.","Turning to Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, we had good execution this quarter, with trajectory improvement in revenue and profit and strong double-digit growth in signings. Revenue of $8.6 billion this quarter was down 1%, representing a three-point improvement in year-to-year performance compared to last quarter.","Signings grew double digits, as clients continue to recognize the long-term value of our offerings and capabilities. At this level of signings growth, the TS&CP backlog trajectory improved two points, with approximately 40% of that backlog now in key strategic workloads. Across the segment, the strategic imperatives revenue grew double digits, and the as-a-service exit run rate for the segment is now $7.4 billion. We\u2019ve got a lot of momentum in our enterprise cloud value prop, and this quarter our cloud signings in Infrastructure Services grew over 40% year-to-year.","Infrastructure Services revenue was flat, which is nearly a five-point improvement from the fourth quarter rate. This was driven by improved revenue from backlog realization, as expected. We are helping clients drive efficiencies and gain agility in their IT environments through hybrid cloud. Our clients entrust us with their mission-critical foundational systems and rely on us to navigate the complexities of disparate IT environments along with data and regulatory frameworks as they move to the cloud.","Technical Support Services revenue declined 4%, due, in part, to the dynamics of our hardware product cycle. Within TSS, our core multi-vendor support offerings continued to grow. Integration Software grew 1%, with continued growth in SaaS across the portfolio, and the adoption of the new IBM Cloud Private offering, where we now have over 200 clients using the platform. The Integration Software portfolio remains essential to clients as they connect multiple environments through a single architecture.","Turning to profit, gross profit margin for the segment was down 60 basis points year-to-year, a 140-basis point sequential improvement from fourth quarter driven by services where we had productivity and scale improvements, and a better mix within Integration Software. Pre-tax income margin was down three points year-to-year, where, similar to GBS, workforce rebalancing charges had a two-points impact. Adjusting for this, the pre-tax income margin dynamics were consistent with our gross margin dynamics.","In Systems, revenue grew again this quarter as we modernized our systems for the most contemporary workloads. Performance was driven by both strong z14 momentum and growth in Power, mitigated by the decline in Storage. This quarter, IBM Z grew 54% year-to-year on more than 100% growth in shipped MIPS and margins expanded. The z14 adoption was again broad-based. We added new clients to the platform across several countries this quarter, including a services provider in Thailand who chose our LinuxONE for its blockchain solutions.","So, we\u2019re continuing to address the emerging workloads across the z platform like blockchain, but also machine learning, dev ops and payments. With new workload MIPS growing four times as fast as our traditional MIPS. And last week, we announced a new z14 designed specifically for cloud environments. Its industry standard, single-frame design allows for easy placement into public cloud data centers and private cloud deployments. These latest systems bring the power of IBM Z to an even broader set of clients. Overall, the mainframe continues to deliver a high value, secure and scalable platform that is critical in managing our clients\u2019 complex environments.","Power grew for the second consecutive quarter, with revenue up 3%, driven by our entry level portfolio and our cloud-enabled offerings. Power remains vital to many workloads, including artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, UNIX, and Linux, and we grew in all four this quarter. We started transitioning to POWER9 in the fourth quarter with the first installment of our supercomputers at US Department of Energy, and late this quarter, we started shipping our POWER9 entry systems designed for AIX, IBM I and Linux workloads. These cloud-ready systems provide leadership capabilities in advanced analytics, cloud environments and data intensive AI workloads.","Storage hardware was down after four consecutive quarters of growth, driven by increasingly competitive environment and continued pricing pressures, though we expanded margins. We also had some sales execution challenges which impacted performance. Remember what we are talking about here is just the hardware element of storage. Clearly, we\u2019ve seen some of the value shift to software. In this quarter, we had strong growth in Software Defined Storage and Cloud Object Storage, which are reported in Transaction Processing Software.","Looking at profit for Systems, gross margin was down about four points year-to-year, including nearly a five-point impact for the charge I referenced earlier in Systems cost. Without that, gross margin expanded due to the relative strength in our higher margin business and cost efficiency actions. Pre-tax margin was roughly flat year-to-year, even with the impact associated with the significant items in cost and expense. So, in our underlying performance we expanded margins, while successfully delivering innovation in support of our clients evolving workload needs.","Turning to cash flow and balance sheet, we had another strong quarter. We generated $2.2 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables and after investing another $900 million in capital expenditures, we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, which is up year-to-year. Our cash realization remains very strong at nearly 120% over the last 12 months. This performance puts us on track to achieve our full year expectation of free cash flow of approximately $12 billion.","Our results in the quarter were driven by performance in working capital, partially mitigated by higher cash taxes and higher CapEx. Both headwinds, we talked about back in January. Looking at uses of cash in the quarter, we returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders, including $1.4 billion in dividends. We bought back almost 5 million shares and had $3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization at the end of the quarter.","On the balance sheet highlights, you can see we ended the quarter with $13.2 billion in cash and total debt was $46.4 billion. About two-thirds of our total debt was in support of our financing business. Our financing leverage remains at 9 to 1, and the credit quality of our financing receivables is strong at 53% investment grade, that\u2019s consistent with December and a point better than a year ago.","So our balance sheet is strong, we\u2019ve got flexibility we need and with a strong quarter in cash flow, we\u2019re on track for the year. So let me make a few summary comments on the quarter and the year before we go to Q&A.","We\u2019ve been building and transforming our portfolio, our skills, our operating model, to address what our enterprise clients need and what they value. Our results over the few quarters reinforce that our clients value the integration of our innovative technologies together with our industry expertise to help them in their journey to AI, their journey to cloud. And they value our approach to the protection of their data and their privacy.","In the first quarter we built on the progress we made in the second half of last year. We improved our year-to-year revenue trajectory in Cognitive Solutions in GBS, in Technology Services and Cloud Platforms. And we continued to grow our Systems revenue. We improved our year-to-year trajectory in operating gross margin, it\u2019s better by 70 basis points compared to the fourth quarter performance and better by 110 basis points when you adjust for the actions we took. The margin trajectory improvement was broad-based with operating leverage coming from mix and from improved productivity. We continued our investments, in our one cloud architecture, in emerging areas like blockchain, and more broadly in skills and talent development. All together, we grew our revenue, operating net income, operating earnings per share and free cash flow.","With this performance we continue to expect to delever at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share, with about 40% of that in the first half. To put that in perspective, that\u2019s about a point ahead of our first half skew in 2017. And so, this was a good start to the year, and going forward, we\u2019re focused on delivering consistent operational performance.","And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia to kick off the Q&A.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, as always, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So operator, let\u2019s please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Katy Huberty","Jim as you noted Storage was the disappointment in the quarter, can you just talk a bit more about what drove the change in the pricing environment, your execution and some of the actions that you had to take to reposition that business. And then just more broadly can you talk about the expected pay back on the actions that you took in the quarter both in terms of the amount and timing of the return on the workforce rebalancing. Thank you.","Jim Kavanaugh","Katy, thank you for the question. So we\u2019ll go in two parts, let me address storage first. As I stated in the prepared remarks we were disappointed in our storage performance especially after four quarters of growth, our 1Q fell below our own expectations but I\u2019ll tell you we have a great team with a proven track record. This is the same team that has proven that they\u2019ve revitalized the portfolio in the past, took market share for four consecutive quarters and now we had an impact in the first quarter predominantly just due to execution of transactions at the end of the quarter. This market in storage is continued to be very competitive and very aggressive. It is a battle right now on market share, but we feel comfortable that we\u2019ve got new portfolio offerings that are coming out later in the year, as we get through the latter half of second quarter and then to third quarter and fourth quarter and we\u2019ve already taken significant actions on how our routes to market and our economic equation will all of our channel partners are put in place and with that great team that has executed in the past. We have all the confidence in the world that we can get our storage business back to where it needs to be as we move forward in the second half of 2018.","Now let me talk about your second question because as you stated, there are lot of dynamics that have played out this quarter. Many of which we talked about 90 days ago, so let me spend a couple minutes to unpack this because I think we should spend our time on fundamental underlying business performance when you take a look at our significant items that I talked about. So in January during our guidance, we talked about we would have a tax discrete and in this quarter and as I stated, it was $810 million. As I stated, the largest driver of this was the conclusion of the 2013 and 2014 US IRS audit. And I\u2019ll remind you this reverses provisions previously taking in our tax rate in prior years and it\u2019s non-cash. So in addition to that, we took actions around continuing to reposition our business to revitalize our skill base, the higher value [indiscernible], our systems cost structure over the long-term and as we continue to look for ways to make a more variabilized [ph] model versus fixed cost model. So as always we included the charges and the benefits in our operating results. But in order to understand the underlying dynamics and some of you have given me very good advice, we put in place a year-to-year bridge of our operating\u2019s earnings per share to show you the implication of the net effect of those two events on a year-to-year basis.","And as you saw in the chart, it was a headwind to us of $0.05 that we owe, had overcome. So without those impacts we improved the trajectory of our gross margin, our gross margin was down 30 basis points in my books that\u2019s stabilization, we expanded our pre-tax margin, we had solid earnings per share growth and free cash flow growth and we delivered what we said in the quarter. Now in turns of savings, just wrapping it up, as you see we took about $610 million action to continue repositioning our business, we expect that to deliver 2x the investment and maybe a little bit more, on an annualized basis and we expect about half of that to be driven in second half of 2013. So I\u2019ll tell you when you cut through it and you look at that operating earnings per share bridge year-to-year, we are focused on delivering consistent, operational performance in this business to deliver value to our clients and our shareholders as we move forward.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Katy. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.","Toni Sacconaghi","So Jim, you had talked about growing revenues in the first quarter and you fell short of that this quarter with flat revenue growth. You highlighted storage was that really the only area of disappointment in where you thought you were 90 days ago and if we kind of look forward, I suppose critics could say, the IT spending environment is very robust, you\u2019re benefiting from a mainframe cycle, comparisons are relatively easy, isn\u2019t this about as good as it gets and when we look forward, should we be thinking about the high water mark for revenue growth being this quarter or what might change that?","Jim Kavanaugh","Yes, Toni. Thanks for the question. Pretty long question I\u2019ll try to make sure I can answer each component. First of all as you stated, we did post revenue growth $19.1 billion up 5% at actual rates up modestly at constant currency which is you saw in the chart rounds to flat. And as I stated upfront, being transparent we fell short to our own expectations and I talked about storage already and I\u2019m not going to repeat that. We have confidence in the team, we have confidence in the portfolio and we know we\u2019re going to get back on the field and turn that business back to growth as we get into second half, but let just play out a little of the dynamics of our first quarter in the profile of our revenue. We had strong growth and let\u2019s start with the strategic imperatives which are the signpost, of us capturing the value in the secular shift so we can lead in the high value IT segments moving forward which are instrumental to our overall financial model. Our strategic imperatives were up 15% at actual rates and up 10% at constant currency and on a trailing 12 months we\u2019re at $37.7 billion, 47% of IBM. That trajectory if you just play that out, says we\u2019ll deliver our $40 billion signpost before the end of 2018.","Now unpacking that strategic imperative let\u2019s talk about the fundamental drivers of that. One, our Cloud business. Our Enterprise Cloud continues to resonate from a strategy value prop and we\u2019re continuing to gain momentum. Over the last 12 months $17.7 billion of revenue up 22% at actual rates or as a service component underneath that, $10.7 billion that\u2019s up $400 million on an annualized exit run rate just from three months ago and it\u2019s up 20% overall. And security we have a leadership market share position, we\u2019re taking share, we\u2019re up 66%, $3.4 billion. So I would tell you the underlying dynamics of how we changed our portfolio, we\u2019re capitalizing on those secular shifts and we\u2019re gaining market share overall.","Now with regards to IBM\u2019s model as we talked about a month ago, when I spent time with you in Las Vegas at our Investor webcast. Our model is 1% to 3% low single-digit. We have a composition of our portfolio that delivers revenue contribution, operating leverage to deliver that investment thesis of being a high-value base company delivering profit at mid-single-digit and high single-digit earnings per share and delivering free cash flow to deliver 70% to 80% back to our shareholders. So we feel confident that we\u2019ve got the right portfolio lineup, we\u2019re well on pace to deliver that $40 billion earlier than 2018 and we\u2019ve got the right team in place to go execute.","And now, just concluding you asked about disappointments, obviously when you look at our performance we said what we were going to do, we returned cognitive solutions back to growth coming off of fourth quarter flat, it grew 2% at constant currency and we had a great software quarter, return in analytics back to growth, after last quarter we talked about 90 days ago we were disappointed. So great work on that team and we continue to add momentum with regards to our security business and our industry verticals.","Our services business, we talked about 90 days and improved backlog trajectory run out and you could see in our first quarter that has played out. Great improvement TS & CP [indiscernible] constant currency to down 80 points at constant currency and we\u2019re making very good progress, we delivered double-digit signings growth and our backlog improved in TS & CP. GBS, we made modest improvement and that would be the second area that we got to pick up the rate and pace in addition to storage, we did improve the trajectory from down two to down one, we improved our backlog by growing signings again, but our backlog is still down 5%, but our backlog trajectory run out still points to improve in trajectory throughout the year and it should enable us to get to revenue growth in the second half of the year, if we continue to drive the quoted signings, to fuel the backlog, to fuel the revenue, so there\u2019s a lot packed in there but I appreciate the question, Toni. Thank you.","Patricia Murphy","Okay, operator. Can we please go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan","Jim, you obviously had very strong revenue growth here in the quarter, but the PTI margins are really massed by the impact of these significant items you called out. Can you give us some color on \u2013 in the underlying businesses where you saw the most underlying improvement in PTI trends, if you exiled these significant items, some color and the confidence that you expect that this should improve materially from 2Q through the end of the year? And if I could just ask a clarifying question as well, what specifically were the significant items that impacted Cognitive PTI margins. It seemed that you called out the skill base trends for high value areas and Systems cost structure but not quite sure what specifically impacted Cognitive. Thank you.","Jim Kavanaugh","Sure, thank you Wamsi and thank you for the complement. We\u2019re pleased with our performance here in the first quarter and it\u2019s first substantiation as we may continue progress in delivering consistency of operational performance I talked about in 2018, so let me first talk about the clarification question with regards to the significant items. As we talked about, we have repositioned our portfolio over the last couple of years, you know quite well we continue to create new offerings to address new value in the market from a client perspective and we\u2019ll continue to adapt that overall and to compete in that light of business, we got to continuously revitalize our skill base and within parts of our cognitive solution portfolio in particular around areas of talent, collaboration and commerce we\u2019re monitorizing [ph] our set of offerings to address shifts in client value and address shifts in consumption models. And we need to revitalize our skills to compete in that area, so in Cognitive Solutions that was predominantly a workforce remixing, we vitalizing charge that was taking to SG&A.","Now let\u2019s go to your overarching question and talk about what we see with regards to the fundamental trajectory of our business. And yes the question in terms of our pre-tax margins and how it\u2019s distorted and that\u2019s why I\u2019m glad Katy asked that question upfront because I think we got to get clarity on the underlying dynamics and the fundamentals of our business existing first quarter, so let me just take a minute by each segment because I think each segment should be looked at little differently, from a gross profit margin perspective, it is very appropriate to look at your services based to businesses just given the overarching cost structure and how you drive utilization and return on investment in a cost of service delivery model. So in services I\u2019ll talk gross margin, but I\u2019ll start with Cognitive Solutions.","Cognitive Solutions, our model is a model that looks at PTI margin expansion because our model is to deliver single-digit or mid single-digit revenue growth and mid single-digit pre-tax growth i.e. no operating leverage. And when you take a look at our first quarter performance all in printed charges we delivered revenue growth at actual rates at 6%, 2% in constant currency and we deliver pre-tax income at 5%. So we\u2019re generated on that constant currency operating leverage and at actual rates, we delivered our model. Now that\u2019s with all the charges in, excluding the charges we delivered 12% pre-tax income growth. So 2X the revenue growth, as we continue to generate significant value out of our high value base offerings and making great progress from where we were 90 days ago.","Now let\u2019s look at our services business, one in GBS. GBS, we improved the trajectory of our gross margin quarter-to-quarter by 200 basis points and that is all the great work that GBS teams are doing all around the world, around driving mix and value out of whole new set of offerings. Our SI business has greater margins than our core business and you know almost two-thirds of our GBS business is now in SI as we continue to generate momentum with double-digit growth. But also we\u2019re seeing price margins in our signings every quarter going up two to three points.","Now we got a lot of work to do and we\u2019re driving that work around workforce optimization productivity. Mark talked about refining our skill pyramid and getting the utilization and infusing AI and automation to improve delivery to go realize those margins and we\u2019re starting to see some improvement and we fully expect that trajectory to continue as we move into second half. Now TS & CP, TS & CP improved their gross margins which is the right way of looking at that business as we invest in our cloud to build out our leadership capability and we continue to drive the effective utilization of our GTS business, we improved our margins almost 150 basis points from fourth quarter. We printed down 60 basis points. So we made substantial trajectory improvement that is being driven based on continued scale efficiencies with our cloud momentum and as a service business, but it\u2019s also being driven by the tough work in redesigning our delivery models, infusing automation, the IBM service platform with the Watson now covers over 1,250 clients and we\u2019re scaling that every single day and we\u2019re driving actions around our workforce optimization and structure. So great trajectory improvement in our GBS and our GTS and we fully expect that continue to move forward in second half and we expect our services margins to be accretive in the second half, not just talking about trajectory improvements.","And then finally in Systems, our systems we repositioned our portfolio through continuous reinvention of our platforms and capitalizing on secular shifts and new workloads. We had good growth in the quarter, our margins were down but that was driven based on the charge we took to better position the long-term structure of our systems business ex-that charge our margins were up and they were up in almost every segment of that business, so thanks Wamsi for the question.","Patricia Murphy","Okay, let\u2019s go to next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Your line is now open.","Steve Milunovich","I just wanted you to indicate whether you expect to see and the 16% tax rate reported the balance of the year or rather you think there will be further discretes. And similarly are we done with workforce balancing charges for the year.","Jim Kavanaugh","Thanks Steve for the question. As we discussed 90 days ago, we said that we would expect into 2018 that our ongoing underlying operating tax rate will be in the range of 16% plus or minus two points before discrete. I would tell you that still remains today, we executed on what we disclosed 90 days ago but expected tax discrete in the first quarter. But as you know these tax discretes by definition they\u2019re unknown in timing and in scope. And we\u2019re continuing to drive the tax optimization as you would expect of us because it\u2019s a critical element of our underlying operating leverage in our company and our financial strategy, but right now I would fully expect 16% plus or minus 2% and as we move forward. And one last thing consistent to what I said 90 days ago is that on a full year basis, all in, we still expect tax to be a headwind.","Patricia Murphy","Okay, good. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Just wanted to dig into the Services a bit, with the signings that was encouraging. It sounds like signings were double-digit in some key areas including app [ph] and maintenance. It sounds like you mentioned price margin was also [indiscernible]. So I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the signings commentary with the actions to reposition, the workforce rebalancing which I presume will include services headcounts. So are you going to see any negative revenue impact from the actions on the services side, again just trying to reconcile the actions and the potential revenue loss with the strong signings and what it means for the outlook? It got to make sense.","Jim Kavanaugh","Tien-tsin, thank you very much. Yes we were definitely pleased with our signings performance in the quarter as I indicated, we delivered over $9 billion of signings up double-digits and up across each of our businesses and that has positioned our backlog now at $120 billion and that\u2019s up 4% and I would argue 4% at actual rates is right way looking at backlog because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to play out as time goes on at current spot rates. So we\u2019re pleased with that overall, but the underpinnings when you get underneath signings and backlog. In GTS, we grew signings 20% year-over-year with over 40% in cloud and in our infrastructure services our outsourcing business backlog is now about a point better than where it was a quarter ago and we improved our overarching GTS backlog quarter-to-quarter and as I talked about March 8 at the Investor Day webcast. Remember we\u2019ve kind of held our outsourcing backlog pretty consistent over a decade and now we change and capitalize on the secular shifts and about 40% of that underlying backlog now sits in strategic imperative areas of which cloud makes up the biggest piece and the other important point around signings I will talk about is, when you look at the good growth in signings we had in the first quarter, over 40% of that was driven by cloud based signings. So we\u2019re capitalizing or winning and we\u2019re improving the trajectory of our business.","Now let me talk a little bit about margin because I spent on the last answer. The substantial trajectory improvement we saw quarter-over-quarter 200 basis points in GBS and 150 basis points in TS & CP. The way I like to look at these margins as we spent the last two earnings calls, I look at the fundamental drivers of how you operate that business both from a human capital base perspective you got to drive scale efficiency, you got to drive mix through value and price, you got to drive productivity, your fundamental human capital and then as you get operating leverage, you should be able to get, growth through operating leverage. So [technical difficultly] work to do going forward but based on the trajectory and the actions we took to reposition our business that makes me comfortable stating that in the second half our services margins will be accretive.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Tien-tsin. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","I guess Jim if I get maths right, adjusted [indiscernible] one time items gross margin were down 30 basis points in the March quarter. could you just walk me through what do you think are the top [indiscernible] things levers that can help you grow from gross margins declining in Q1 to essentially achieving a stabilization for calendar 2018 that should have implied margins [indiscernible] go up for the next three quarters including Q3 where I think it compared to get [indiscernible]. So what are the [technical difficulty] that give you confidence margins can improve for the remainder of the year?","Jim Kavanaugh","So let\u2019s talk about this. So again guidance of maintaining at least the $13.80 and as we talked about, there is always many scenarios \u2013 team, we drive them like crazy here in a very sharp period of time to get ready for this call, but we look at the trajectory of our business, we look at all of your operational indices and that positions how we can triangulate around the guidance that we give externally across our financial model strategy we talked about in Investor Day. Revenue contribution that is growth mix scale and around operating leverage that is productivity and that is as we get that growth what\u2019s that operating leverage we\u2019re going to get on human capital. So it positions both top line and around margin, so let me just give you a perspective of what we see underpinning the $13.80 in terms of gross margin. 1Q as you talked about we printed all in down 70 basis points. If you exclude the significant items so that you can understand the underlying trajectory of our business going forward our margins were down 30 basis points, that\u2019s coming off fourth quarter being 140, in my book that\u2019s stabilization that\u2019s what we guided to in first quarter and that\u2019s what we delivered.","Now with that trajectory improvement that we saw being base of a cost continuing to get scale, continue to get improvements and productivity which we miss by the way, if you remember our discussions 90 days ago and around mix, we do see that trajectory improvement to move forward, but our full year guidance only requires stabilization of margin. And the actions we took in the first quarter I will tell you positions us better than what I said here 90 days ago. On how we can deliver the fundamental dynamics across multiple scenarios of delivering at least at $13.80 and if you play out those drivers since you asked. First, we\u2019re going to continue to invest capital to build out our enterprise cloud and build on that momentum and as a service and we\u2019re going to continue getting scale efficiencies. We made significant investments historically that is been a headwind to us and we are minimizing that headwind every single quarter as we get scale efficiencies and I expect that to continue. Second as I just talked about the increased yield and services productivity, we expect that to play out. Workforce optimization, mix of higher value and capturing price, infusing AI and automation on our deliver platforms. We expect that to play out and deliver significantly in the second half.","Now both of these pieces, the efficiency and the productivity and scale out are required because we all know as we enter the second half we have a significant headwind on mix because we\u2019re not counting on more than a typical mainframe cycle. Our mainframe, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance so far program the date, were above our prior program, we\u2019re capitalizing on secular shifts with the value of our pervasive encryption and blockchain, but it would not be prudent right now to predict or to predicate our $13.80 guidance on breaking a mainframe cycle so that mixed headwind is facing us in the latter half of 3Q and 4Q and we need to overcome it with the scale out efficiencies and with the increased productivity and based on the actions we took in the first quarter, to better reposition our business for the long-term. I feel more confident than I did 90 days ago.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Amit. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mark Moskowitz","Just continuing that thread in terms of trying to understand how the revenue component would help drive that margin expansion of the overall equation. Is there any \u2013 you can give us in terms of how we should think about the legacy outsourcing business that IBM almost three and five and seven-year outsourcing deals that were consummated before IBM became a bigger and better cloud vendor in the last couple of years. Is there any sort of cycle forthcoming whereas those deals unwind we could see conversion or transition to more like cloud like workloads for those customer and therefore you achieve better scale at your 58 data centers, is that since like it happened this year or it\u2019s something more 2019 or 2020?","Jim Kavanaugh","Thank you, Mark. I appreciate the question. I would tell you we\u2019re seeing that already. I mean the secular shifts that have happened in the market place and are happening and will continue to happen are right in front of us and that\u2019s why I thought it was very interesting and why we shared some of the signpost data about our outsourcing composition and our backlog and how we\u2019ve been able to maintain it over a decade long period while continuing to capture those secular shifts in cloud. Today as we exit first quarter total backlog of $120 billion, our outsourcing backlog is somewhere around that $80 billion number and within that our shift to cloud is somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% to 30% already that is providing us tremendous scale efficiency as we leverage in the 58 and actually I think now we\u2019re north of 60 cloud data centers around the world and we\u2019ll continue to differentiate ourselves as we move forward. So we have been focused, I think it\u2019s in attestation to the value of incumbency, the value of trust and we talked about the differentiators about our innovated technology, about our deep industry expertise and about the trust and security of our clients, our GTS business are managing the critical workflows and critical business processes of our clients and as they looked for efficiency in delivering a new model around cloud, we\u2019re actually capitalizing on that as we move forward. So not only it would help our revenue, it will help at the end of the day our margin and our scale efficiencies as we go forward.","Patricia Murphy","Okay, we\u2019ve covered a lot of topics today and we\u2019re going a little long, so I\u2019m going to take one last question, please.","Operator","Our last question comes from David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is now open.","David Grossman","So Jim, I\u2019m wondering if you could just follow-up few of the earlier questions, you did a good job of explaining the dynamics by business unit that said, we have this issue of comping [ph] the mainframe cycle later this year and you just stated, we probably should count on it elongated cycle. So are the improving service metrics that you shared sufficient to give you more confidence that these businesses will be sufficiently position to offset those headwinds that will be created by the anniversary cycle whenever it may happen and then just secondly, a point of clarification. Should we expect the margin benefits from the significant items to benefit both the second half of this year and the first half of next year on a year-over-year basis?","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay, David. Thank you very much for your question. So let me address the second one first because I think that\u2019s a short answer. As I stated both in the prepared remarks and the Q&A we expect the annualized savings to be 2X the investment we\u2019d get about half in the second half so obviously yes that also strategically positions us for the first half plus going forward into 2019 because remember we took these actions to better reposition our business for the long-term and what\u2019s required to continue to generate and create client value and shareholder value as we move forward, so that\u2019s the first question. The second, that\u2019s why I specifically with regards to your wrap around fourth quarter mainframe etc. that\u2019s why I specifically walked through the margin dynamics of what we see playing out throughout the year. We realize and I think it\u2019s prudent based on what we\u2019ve done with our guidance of at least $13.80 we know we got a mixed headwind. Now believe we got in entire mainframe team in 170 countries around the world that are driving like crazy to deliver the value to our clients to make this a secular shift versus cyclical, we\u2019ll put that aside for right now that\u2019s for tomorrow, as we go drive the operational execution being 17 days already into the second quarter. But we do see scaled efficiencies based on the momentum trajectory of our cloud business and as the service, we see productivity played out very nicely for us in the first quarter and with the actions we took in the first quarter, it positions us for the second half as we move forward to get our services business to accretive margins to help us overall and lastly, when you take a look at it, we return our cognitive solutions back to revenue growth to our top line that carries high profit, high value based activity, we expect that trajectory to continue and again that backlog run out is playing out and we got to just continue to drive the signings, to few of that backlog to get revenue on the second half and we feel comfortable with that.","Now with that, let me wrap up the call. By again saying, we\u2019re very pleased with the start of the year. We gave you guidance 90 days ago. We said we\u2019d deliver at least $13.80, 17% to 18% we delivered at the high end of that earnings per share guidance of 17% to 18%. We made substantial progress across many parts of our business. We took significant actions to reposition the long-term position of our company and we are on track to deliver our full year objectives of at least $13.80 and deliver revenue growth at current spot rates, stable margins which is all we need to deliver that $13.80 and free cash flow of at least $12 billion. The first quarter was in [indiscernible] of that, we delivered revenue growth, we delivered operating profit growth, we delivered free cash flow growth, we delivered earnings per share growth, all in. and that positions us now as we\u2019re focused, as I\u2019ve started this call on delivering consistent operational execution in this business as we move forward. So thank you all for joining the call.","Patricia Murphy","Operator, let me turn it back to you to wrap it up.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.","End"],"11972":["International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 18, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Patricia Murphy - VP, IR","James Kavanaugh - Senior VP & CFO ","Martin Schroeter - Senior VP of Global Markets","Analysts","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C.

I'm here today with Jim Kavanaugh, who was announced last week as IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as Martin Schroeter, who is now Senior Vice President, Global Markets. Prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours, and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I'll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

As a quick introduction, I've been with IBM for 21 years. I was the IBM Controller from 2008 through January of 2015 when I became the Senior Vice President of Transformation and Operations where I've been focused on driving IBM's operating model transformation. In October of last year, I came back to be Senior Vice President of Finance and Operations. I participated in IBM's annual investor briefings for the last 10 years and have met many of you. I'm now looking forward to working more closely with the investment community as IBM's CFO.","Given I'm a week into the new role, Martin is going to cover the fourth quarter, and then I'll put into context our 2017 performance and how that positions us for 2018. We'll then take the Q&A together.","So for now, I'll turn it over to Martin.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks, Jim. Back in July, we planted the flag for our businesses, and we pointed to an improved trajectory in the second half. Now as we look back on the year, we did, in fact, significantly improve the trajectory in our revenue and our gross margin performance. We did this by ramping our cloud and as-a-service offerings by continuing to reinvent our systems brands, by driving a higher level of software transactional revenue and by improving consulting performance.","In the fourth quarter, we returned to revenue growth. Our revenue of $22.5 billion is up about 3.5% and up 1% without the currency tailwind. We also grew our operating net income and our operating earnings per share. As you saw in our press release, our operating net income and EPS exclude a one-time charge associated with the enactment of tax reform because of the unique nature and to provide comparability to the operating expectations we've been providing for 2017. For the year, we delivered $79 billion of revenue, $13.80 of operating earnings per share and free cash flow of $13 billion, which is up over $1 billion year-to-year.","Looking at some of the revenue dynamics of the fourth quarter. Our systems results were terrific across IBM Z, Power and storage. This was our first full quarter with the z14. And with pervasive encryption and the ability to address new technologies like blockchain, we're adding new clients and new workloads to the platform. in Cognitive Solutions, we had good growth in several areas, including security, IoT and our industry-based solutions like Watson Health and Watson Financial Services, though we were disappointed by the performance in a few of our more traditional analytics offerings. And in Services, we had our second consecutive growth in consulting, led by digital offerings. Performance in our outsourcing businesses across GTS and GBS was pretty consistent with the last few quarters.","From a geographic perspective, we had growth in many countries, including our 2 largest, the U.S. and Japan. Across all of our businesses, our strategic imperatives revenue was up 17% or 14% at constant currency as we embed cognitive and cloud into more of what we offer. For all of 2017, Strategic Imperatives revenue was up 11% to $36.5 billion, which is 46% of our revenue. I should mention that we'll continue to focus on constant currency revenue growth rates throughout, but any way you look at it, this was a strong finish to the year.","We introduced the Strategic Imperatives framework back in 2015 as a way to show how we're moving our clients to the future. As you know, these aren't separate businesses but the revenue from our offerings that address opportunities in analytics, cloud, security and mobile. This quarter, the 14% growth in Strategic Imperatives revenue was led by cloud and by security. Let me give you a little more on each.","Our cloud revenue was up 27% as we help our clients to implement hybrid environments, integrating public and private and traditional IT. For the year, our cloud revenue was $17 billion, and we're exiting 2017 with a run rate in our as-a-service offerings of over $10 billion. To put that $17 billion in perspective, it's up from $7 billion just 3 years ago. As you know, we play an important role in running our clients' most critical processes. And now with the IBM Cloud, which is built for the enterprise, each of the 10 largest global banks, 9 of the top 10 retailers and 8 of the top 10 airlines are cloud-as-a-service clients. We can help clients with their hybrid environments as well. With introduction of IBM Cloud Private, we provide clients with the attributes of a cloud behind their own firewall and give them increased portability of workloads across any cloud environment. This is really important for enterprise work.","And then in security, revenue across our security offerings more than doubled. This reflects the strong demand for our pervasive encryption in IBM Z as we reinvent that platform for the most contemporary workloads. We also had good performance in managed security services within our GTS business and in our security software. Over the last several years, we've been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into more of what we offer and building new solutions and modernizing existing ones. These investments not only drive our Strategic Imperatives revenue performance today but will also extend our innovation leadership into the future. I'll give you a few examples.","In the third quarter, we formed a partnership with MIT to create the MIT-Watson AI Lab. Through this partnership, we're mobilizing the talent of more than 100 AI scientists, professors and students to carry out fundamental AI research and drive scientific breakthroughs that unlock the potential of AI. In Quantum, we now have a 20-cubit IBM Q system available for all to use, and we have the first working 50-cubit processor, and we launched the Q Network, which is a collaboration of leading Fortune 500 companies, academic institutions and national research labs that can access IBM Q systems through the IBM Cloud as they explore the practical applications to advance quantum computing. And you saw just last week, we announced that IBM led the U.S. in patents in 2017, marking our 25th consecutive year at #1. Nearly half of the more than 9,000 patents in 2017 are for advancements in AI, cloud computing, cyber security, blockchain and quantum computing.","So now let me move on to our financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue was $22.5 billion, which, as I said, is up year-to-year. Like last quarter, our performance is pretty much all organic. I'll go into the highlights by brand in the segment discussions, so let me comment here on the geographic performance.","Revenue from the Americas was up 4%, with growth across the U.S., Canada and Brazil. This is a significant sequential improvement in the year-to-year performance, 6 points compared to the third quarter, driven by systems and infrastructure services. Our EMEA revenue was down about 1.5%, which is consistent with last quarter's performance. As always, the performance varied within the geography. This quarter, we had growth in France, Spain and the Middle East and Africa region, offset by weakness in the U.K., Germany and Italy. You'll remember that the U.K. and Germany were impacted by the contract dynamics at the end of 2016, and we've now wrapped on those. In Asia Pacific, we had strong growth again in Japan, which was up 4%. Impacting overall Asia Pacific performance was China where you'll remember we had double-digit growth last year from some large rollouts in China banks.","Looking at our margin performance. Our operating gross margin was down a little over a point year-to-year and up nearly 2 points sequentially. This is about 0.5 point behind what we talked about last quarter, with some of the differences due to mix and the rest due to a delay in the yield from some of our productivity actions in our Services business.","Our operating expense was up 6%. And with revenue up 4%, our E to R increased nearly 70 basis points year-to-year. Now keep in mind, when currency helps the top line, it also hurts the expense line, not just because of translation but because that's where the majority of the hedges are reported. We mentioned this back in October. And so in the fourth quarter, currency, between translation and the year-to-year impact from hedges, drove 4 of the 6 points of expense growth. We also had a lower level of IP income in the fourth quarter, about $175 million year-to-year, and it was down for the full year about the same amount. At the beginning of the year, we said we weren't counting on IP income being flat year-to-year, though we had the opportunity pool to do so. And as we went through the year, we're delighted with the new IP partnerships we signed. You can see they contributed to the $300 million of IP income in each of the last 3 quarters, and we weren't going to do anything unnatural to drive flat performance year-to-year in this line item.","Without the effect of currency and IP, our E to R improved modestly, reflecting the continued efficiency we're driving in our underlying spend base while maintaining a high level of investment, together with the benefit of growing revenue.","Looking at operating taxes. Again, this excludes the one-time charge. We provided a range for our ongoing tax rate at the beginning of the year, and we finished at the bottom end of the range. And so our tax rate for the quarter reflects an underlying effective tax rate of 12% for the year. You'll recall, we had some discrete items in both the first and the second quarter, which took our full year operating tax rate down to 7%. We generated $4.8 billion of operating net income in the quarter, which is up 1%. And with share reduction of about 2.5%, our operating EPS of $5.18 was better by 3.5%. We generated $6.8 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $13 billion for the year. Now when you look at our realization of GAAP net income, that's over 200%. But when you normalize for the one-time tax charge, it's about 115% for the year. For your awareness, as we show realization of GAAP net income going forward, we'll be using that adjusted view on our charts. Our free cash flow supports both a high level of investment and shareholder returns. And in 2017, we returned 3\/4 of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","So now let me move on to the segments. Our Cognitive Solutions revenue was flat. Within solutions software, our annuity content, which represents 80% of revenue on an annual basis, was up 3% year-to-year, which is over a point better than last quarter's growth. We had double-digit growth in our SaaS offerings again this quarter as we continue to invest to build scale in our as-a-service businesses. The transactional revenue within solutions was down, driven by weakness this quarter in a few of our more traditional analytics offerings like data integration and content management. As you know, because of the larger mix of transactional content in the fourth quarter, it has an outsized impact on the overall software performance.","Within our solutions software portfolio, we continue to focus on building out our industry verticals, and we had strong performance in those areas, including Watson Health, Watson Financial Services and Watson IoT offerings. In Watson Health, we continue to deliver strong growth, driven by state and local government agencies as well as life sciences and oncology. Watson Health is scaling. We've reached 115,000 people with our cognitive offerings, and oncology is now in over 150 hospitals and health organizations and trained on 13 cancers compared to 4 cancers just over a year ago. Watson Financial Services had another strong quarter as clients look to evolve their financial systems. Growth here was led by our RegTech and commercial payments offerings.","Also, within analytics this quarter, we had good growth in areas that provide data management in hybrid environments like our new unified data system, which leverages DB2 technology built on IBM Power, and in our software-as-a-service business intelligence offerings, including cognitive analytics. As I said earlier, security contribute to growth again this quarter. We had good performance, particularly in the areas of data security, with GDPR as a key driver as well as fraud detection. We saw increased interest in uptake and our software-as-a-service offerings, particularly with QRadar on cloud and Resilient on cloud. We also continue to make progress in emerging areas like blockchain. Remember that for us, blockchain is a set of technologies that allow our clients to simplify complex, end-to-end processes in a way that couldn't have been done before. It requires the attributes of immutability, permissioning and scalability, and we're already performing thousands of transactions per second. And we offer some of the most advanced cryptography available to verify transactions. So by running on z, we provide industry-leading technology to help improve security and performance for our clients' blockchain networks.","We have engaged in blockchain projects with hundreds of clients, and since the release of our IBM Blockchain platform in the third quarter, we've collaborated on 35 active networks with clients such as CLS, Everledger, KBank, London Stock Exchange and Mizuho. These reflect a wide variety of use cases like cross-border payments and financial services, supply chains in retail, valuable goods authentication in industrials and digital identification for governments. This quarter, we extended our food safety initiative with Walmart into China. And just this week, we announced the creation of a joint venture with Maersk to provide more efficient, secure global trade using blockchain technology.","Turning to transaction processing software. We had another good quarter with revenue up 3%, reflecting our clients' long-term commitment and the value our platform provides to them. Growth was driven by middleware as our clients continue to invest and grow their high-value, mission-critical workloads on the z platform.","Turning to profit for Cognitive Solutions. PTI margin declined year-to-year, driven by ongoing investment into strategic areas and mix of business into lower-margin offerings, including the shift towards SaaS. Our SaaS margins continue to expand, though were still not at scale.","Moving on to Services. Global Business Services generated $4.2 billion of revenue this quarter, up 1% at actual rates and down 1.5% at constant currency. We had modest growth in GBS signings, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of signings growth. And our GBS revenue was up in several regions, including Asia Pacific and Latin America. We have good momentum in Consulting but continue to see declines in Application Management, particularly in North America and Europe.","Consulting revenue grew 1% again this quarter. We've said for some time that the path to revenue growth starts with signings, which then translates to backlog growth. Our Consulting backlog was essentially flat in the second quarter and was up starting in the third. And we've now driven 2 consecutive quarters of Consulting revenue growth. ","Revenue in our Digital Strategy and iX business grew about 40%. And we're also seeing good growth in the new practices we've built around our innovative technologies like AI and Blockchain. The reason we're able to lead in these emerging areas is because of the technology as well as our ability to implement these platforms into our clients' workflows. So GBS plays a critical role on our leadership in these areas. This doesn't apply just to our own technology. We're also building ecosystems and partnerships around other platforms. We've talked in the past about Salesforce and Workday. And now in December, we announced a partnership with Blue Prism that will combine their robotics processing automation software with IBM services to deliver digital workforce solutions that increase productivity and enable automation at scale. Application Management was down 3% this quarter, driven by declines in traditional ERP managed services and the successful completion of some large contracts. Within Application Management, we grew in our offerings that help clients modernize their critical application suites by implementing cloud-centric architectures and microservices.","Turning to profit. GBS gross margin was down about 2 points year-to-year. Half of this was due to currency dynamics this quarter, and it impact margin by about a point. We're also continuing to invest in our skills and transform our GBS business. As Mark Foster talked about at our investor briefing, our strategy is focused around digital, cognitive and cloud growth platforms, and we've streamlined their practice model to ensure the right skills enablement for practitioners. We're investing to further develop our long-term client relationships with the leading organizations around the world, both with more dedicated senior account leadership and the reinforcement of delivery excellence through methods, automation and widespread rescaling of our practitioners. We're also bringing in new skills through acquisitions. We closed on the acquisition of Vivant this quarter in Australia, which is the seventh acquisition we've done in GBS over the last 2 years. And in some of the more traditional areas in Application Management, we continue to see some price and profit pressure.","Technology Services & Cloud Platforms generated $9.2 billion of revenue this quarter. Our Strategic Imperatives grew at a double-digit rate, and the as-a-service exit run rate for this segment was nearly $7 billion. The IBM Cloud is optimized for cognitive workloads and provides clients with the ability to integrate public, private and managed environments through a single architecture. Infrastructure services was down 4%, which is similar to the trajectory we've seen in recent quarters. As we've talked about, this quarter, we had a more difficult year-to-year compare because of some of the large contract items a year ago. We've now wrapped on those dynamics. Clients are looking to cloud to drive efficiency and agility in their infrastructure and help them create new business models, but they need help getting there and they need someone to manage it for them, given the complexity of their data, environments and industry.","When you look at the composition of our infrastructure services signings this year, about 45% was cloud content, which is ahead of the market mix.","Integration software was down 5%. Our SaaS revenue was again up at a strong double-digit rate across the portfolio, and we continue to have momentum in our hybrid integration tools that are important to enterprise cloud deployments, but it was not enough to offset the decline in our on-premise tools as more of that portfolio shifts to the cloud.","I mentioned earlier this quarter, we announced IBM Cloud Private, a platform to help clients unlock their significant IT investment in core data and applications and extend cloud native tools across public and private clouds. The new platform was built on an open-source container architecture and supports both Docker containers and Cloud Foundry. This facilitates integration and portability of workloads as they evolve to any cloud environment. IBM Cloud Private was developed in response to our clients who want more control of their data and processes while leveraging cloud capabilities. The need is obvious in regulated industries, but every client has data residency requirements and is concerned with the security and performance of pure public clouds. This platform will help everyone to better implement cloud infrastructure that aligns with whatever business model they have. Since the announcement of IBM Cloud Private, we've already brought 120 enterprise clients onto the platform.","Technical Support Services was up 1% at actual rates and down 2% at constant currency. We grew in our multivendor support offerings, where we drive productivity and scale for our clients with integrated and wall-to-wall support solutions across any platform.","Turning to profit. Gross margin for the segment was down about 2 points year-to-year. Some of the large contract dynamics that we've talked about are impacting margins. There were also new large contracts that came into the portfolio at lower margins as we invest ahead to optimize our clients' environments. We continue to invest to scale our cloud platforms and more of the software content in this segment shifts to as-a-service. We're scaling the IBM Services Platform with Watson, where we've already added over 1,000 clients to the platform in 2017. Additionally, we've wrapped on the benefit from our workforce transformation actions that we took in 2016. We did improve our spending here, but as I mentioned, the yield from some of our productivity actions is delayed.","In Systems, we had another strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth. All 3 brands, IBM Z, Power and Storage, grew. We continue to deliver innovation in our systems to enable them to run the most contemporary workloads. Now roughly half of our Systems revenue in 2017 address workloads in the areas of our strategic imperatives.","This quarter, IBM Z revenue was up 71% year-to-year with the highest shipped MIPS in history. The results reflect our first full quarter of z14 and demonstrate the strong client demand for this platform. Our mainframe is an enduring franchise. In fact, it's an enduring and growing franchise. Our MIPS installed base is up 2.5x over the last 10 years. And as long as we continue to innovate and modernize, this platform will continue to be the leading enterprise platform in the world. More than 10 years ago, it was Linux. 5 years ago, it was mobile. And now, it's pervasive encryption.","The z14 adoption was again broad-based across many countries and industries. We added 14 new clients to the platform across 10 countries this quarter, and we saw especially strong performance in North America where clients continue to leverage traditional IT infrastructure together with the cloud. We're continuing to address emerging workloads across the Z platform like blockchain, machine learning, DevOps and payments. We closed 10 instant payments deals this quarter across several markets. And in the emerging blockchain space, the Beijing Institute of Technology selected the IBM LinuxONE platform to run their blockchain solution. Overall, the mainframe continues to deliver high-value, secure and scalable platform that's critical in managing our clients' complex environments.","Our revenue grew 15%, driven by double-digit growth in our high- and low-end portfolio, with our cloud-enabled offerings serving new clients in deep learning and the HANA markets. We continue to shift into the growing Linux market. And our Linux on Power revenue grew again and gained share. For 2017, this now represents 1\/4 of our Power portfolio. We also delivered the first installment of our supercomputers at U.S. Department of Energy, with more to come later in 2018. There are 3 labs of this type, and we won 2 of the 3, which is the most any provider is allowed to win. In this quarter, in our low-end Linux portfolio, we released our next-gen Power system with our new POWER9 processor. These POWER9 systems bring unprecedented speed to AI workloads and enable our clients to compete and win in the data-intensive AI era.","Storage hardware was up 8%. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of growth so, obviously, we've got some momentum here. We gained share in a very competitive market while holding margins stable. We had double-digit growth in our high-end hardware products for the quarter, which reflects the demand for flash as well as the capacity increase linked to mainframe demand.","Our all-flash array offerings once again grew at a strong double-digit rate and faster than the high-growth all-flash market. In our storage software, which is reported in Cognitive Solutions and a major contributing to our storage business, had strong revenue from our cloud object storage offerings.","Looking at profit for Systems. Our margin was down slightly year-to-year and up sequentially, consistent with product cycle dynamics.","And so now I'll go quickly through cash on the balance sheet, and Jim will wrap up with the segments in the context of 2018. We generated $7.8 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, excluding our financing receivables. We invested nearly $1 billion in capital expenditures and generated $6.8 billion of free cash flow. For the full year, we generated $16.3 billion of cash from operations, excluding financing receivables. We invested $3.3 billion in CapEx this year, mainly in cloud, in support of our services business. And so we generated free cash flow of $13 billion. And as I mentioned, our cash realization was strong at 116%. That's up 17 points from last year.","You'll recall that we expected our free cash flow to be roughly flat for the year. At $13 billion, we're up $1.3 billion year-to-year so, obviously, we delivered a much stronger number. Relative to what we expected, we were more efficient in the deployment of capital expenditures, which was down about $400 million year-to-year. Additionally, because of the mix of business and the strong working capital performance at the end of the year across collections and our factory program, we drove better cash performance. With that free cash flow performance, we've returned almost $10 billion shareholders, including dividends of $5.5 billion and $4.3 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back over 27 million shares, reducing our average share count by just over 2%. At the end of the year, we had $3.8 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Now looking at the balance sheet. We clearly have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long term. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.6 billion, higher than a year ago as the bulk of our 2018 debt maturities will occur earlier in the year. Total debt was $46.8 billion, of which 2\/3 was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business is 9 to 1, and the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 53% investment-grade, a point better than both September and last December. Given that this is the year-end call, I wanted to give you a quick update on our pension plans.","Our U.S. plan has been frozen for some time, and we've been remixing our asset base toward a lower-risk, lower-return profile. At the end of 2017, in aggregate, our worldwide tax qualified plans are funded at 100%, up a couple of points from a year ago, so our plans are in really good shape. We provided information on the performance of our retirement-related plans and year-end 2017 assumptions in the supplemental charts.","So now let me turn it back to Jim.","James Kavanaugh","Thanks, Martin. Let me take a couple of minutes to wrap up. We've been doing a lot of work to reposition our business, to help move our clients to the future, investing, shifting skills and reallocating capital. In short, a lot of heavy lifting. And our results for 2017 reflect that, with an improvement in revenue and our gross profit trajectory in the second half.","Let me make a few comments on 2017 by business and how it positions us for 2018. In Cognitive Solutions, we're driving good results across most of our solutions portfolio, including our Watson and security offerings. Most of these new areas have a software-as-a-service delivery model. And so for 2018, we'll continue to build scale in these as-a-service businesses.","In our Services segments, we've got some momentum in Consulting, driven by our digital offerings and strong growth in our cloud content as we help our clients to build out hybrid environments. As you know, the majority of Services revenue in any given year comes out of the opening backlog. as we enter 2018, the projected revenue from the current backlog points to an improved revenue trajectory in 2018 versus 2017, and that's in both GTS and GBS.","In Systems, we had a great year. Looking to 2018, we have a strong start to our new z14 and are introducing POWER9 systems and have the most competitive storage offerings in some time.","And then across our businesses, our Strategic Imperatives revenue was up at a double-digit rate to $36.5 billion for the year, which is now 46% of our revenue.","So when you take all of this together, we're entering 2018 with a stronger revenue profile than a year ago. In 2018, we'll maintain a high level of investment. This is important as we continue to build out capabilities in AI, in cloud, in security and in blockchain, just to name a few. As always, we'll look for more productivity in our spend base, especially in our Services business, where we'll continue to remix our skills to new opportunities.","And then let me comment on tax. Tax reform provides additional flexibility over the longer term. Our 2018 rate will reflect the implementation of tax reform, which includes a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, offset by the broader tax base and reduced foreign tax credit utilization. This translates to an ongoing operating rate for 2018 of 16%, plus or minus 2 points, which is a 4-point headwind year-to-year. This, as always, excludes any discrete items we will have. Putting it all together, we expect to deliver operating earnings per share of at least $13.80.","I want to briefly comment on 2 other items with respect to our earnings per share expectations. First, regarding the skew of our business. We expect to deliver between 17% and 18% of the full year expectation of at least $13.80 in the first quarter, which is consistent with the average over the last 5 years. You'll recall, the last couple of years, we've had a benefit from a discrete item in the first quarter. We anticipate a potential benefit again this year. And as in the past, we will likely take actions that will offset some portion of the benefit. This is reflected in the first quarter skew. And then second, there are 2 accounting changes that will be effective in 2018 that will affect our results and are included in our expectations. One helps operating earnings per share, and the other hurts. And they essentially offset each other within the $13.80 of operating earnings per share in 2018.","Now looking at cash flow. We had a very strong end to 2017. Martin mentioned a couple of the drivers, which provide some context to our 2018 expectations. We were more efficient last year in the deployment of capital and, in 2018, we're allowing for some growth in CapEx. In addition, we had a strong finish in receivables performance in the fourth quarter, primarily because of the mix of business that creates a year-to-year headwind in 2018. And we also expect a headwind from cash tax payments in 2018. At this point, it looks to be about $600 million year-to-year. Put all of that together, and we expect free cash flow of about $12 billion in 2018, which results in free cash flow realization well over 100%.","So we're building momentum across our business but, as always, more work to do. And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia for the Q&A.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a few items. First, as Jim said upfront, he and Martin will take your questions together. Second, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and the full year. [Operator Instructions]. So operator, let's please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wamsi Mohan","Jim and Martin, congrats to both of you on your new roles. Jim, your guidance calls for some revenue growth and margin stability here in 2018. And I was hoping you can share some color on the key puts and takes here as it pertains to your EPS guide. Looks like tax is going to be a big headwind, and if you could quantify sort of that in relation to the operational improvement. And if I could, Martin, could you just comment on what drove the decline in Strategic Imperatives and the Cognitive Solutions segment in 4Q, that would be helpful as well.","James Kavanaugh","Okay, thank you, Wamsi. I appreciate the opening question, and thanks for the comment on the job movement. As you can imagine, when we enter any year, there are multiple scenarios around how we position the full year guidance. And in this year, especially given the improvement that we've seen in the second half of 2017, and taking into account that trajectory of our business and all other operational indices, all of this supports our guidance of at least $13.80. Now as I stated in my prepared remarks, let me first start with tax. Our 2018 operating tax rate of 16%, plus or minus 2 points, incorporates the new tax law. This is a 4-point headwind year-to-year compared to our 2017 operating tax rate of 12%. Both of these are before any discretes.","In terms of discretes, like we've had in recent history, we do anticipate some potential benefits from tax discretes. And as in the past, we will likely take action to offset some of those benefits as we always look to position our business for the long term. Taking all of this into account, tax will be a headwind in 2018 year-to-year. Now in terms of the other drivers as you asked. Given our trajectory exiting 2017 and the confidence we have in our portfolio and how we've repositioned it, we do expect revenue growth at current spot rates for 2018. We see stabilization of our margins on a year-to-year basis, driven by the continued scale-out of our cloud business as we drive efficiency, and we're also going to get yield from our services productivity improvements. And this will start in first quarter. And looking at expense, there are many different dynamics here. And I want to make sure we get this right.","We're going to continue to invest at a high level to drive the strategic growth areas while we will continue to deliver our base productivity. And as you saw in fourth quarter, we'll continue to see an expense headwind due to currency hedges. And in terms of IP, we're not planning on any year-to-year profit contribution. We continue to have a strong opportunity pipeline. We believe in this model, and we'll continue to be opportunistic in leveraging the monetization of our IP over the long term. Now let me just conclude on a little bit of color on first quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Martin. In first quarter, as I said, we expect our earnings per share skew to be between 17% and 18%. That is on average of the last 5 years, and it's above the last 2 years. We're maintaining our momentum, as I talked about, but we do see revenue growth, both at actual rate and constant currency, and constant currency similar to fourth quarter. And the annual effective tax rate, as we talked about, we anticipate a potential tax discrete benefit in our first quarter. And similar to last couple of years, we are evaluating potential actions that will offset some of these, and both of these are included in our guidance overall. So hopefully, that gives you a little color, and I'll turn it over to Martin.","Martin Schroeter","Yes, thanks, Jim. So let me give you a little color on Cognitive Solutions for last year. So keep in mind that the majority of our business in Cognitive is annuity-based. And that includes, by the way, the SaaS offerings, which are growing quite well. Where we saw weakness, as we noted in the prepared remarks, was in a couple of traditional analytics offerings like data integration and content management where we either have to go spend some more time getting those offerings better developed, and we did come out with some new wins at the end of the year, but it wasn't soon enough to have an effect in the year, or we're shifting some of those license models to as-a-service. So we don't see a difference in the secular trends, we still believe Cognitive Solutions is going to be driven by the shift to analytics, the shift to cloud, the shift to security. We see that continuing. We just have a couple of offerings here that either we're shifting aggressively or we have to see how the new offerings perform in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.","Toni Sacconaghi","I'd like to just clarify the guidance, please. You keep talking about a tax rate in 2017 of 12% but, with discretes, it was actually under 7%. And so are you saying you believe that your actual reported tax rate can go from 7% to 16% in 2018 and you can deliver $13.80 in earnings? Or do you know now that you have significant discretes and that your real tax rate that will be reported will be dramatically lower? Because it's very difficult to get the bridge, I think, with the tax rate that's really, in effect, almost 1,000 basis point steeper. And then separately, I'm wondering if you can just comment on the erosion in operating profit margins in both GBS and in Technology Services & Cloud Platforms. The margin erosion there was actually the worst we've seen in history on a pretax basis. That did not appear to be an improvement as you expected. I think, if you back out the tax rate, you actually missed your guided EPS by $0.40 relative to a 15% tax rate. And it all seemed to come from the margin erosion in those businesses. Perhaps, you could address that a little more directly, please.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Toni. It's Martin. I'll give you a couple of points. One, when we gave guidance at the beginning already of last year, we said our tax rate on an annual effective basis would be 12% to 18%, and we came in at the bottom on an annual effective rate. And as you point out, we had a couple of discretes already in the first half, nothing additional in the second, so the printed rate was lower than that, but I don't think that's news. We're trying to be clear, by the way, on tax for next year, so I'm glad you said we're -- you're not quite there yet, so we should spend some more time on it. The annual effective rate going from 12% to 16% is what the headwind that Jim noted. And we do see discretes as we always do. I don't think we've ever had a year where we don't have a discrete in the year. So I would expect there to be discretes. And Jim noted already that we'll have one in the first, which will largely be offset.","So the math that we're talking about from a modeling perspective is 12 to 16. In any case, by the way, the year-to-year headwind in tax is real. We see a headwind in tax. We don't expect at this point at the $13.80 that we'll print a number that we did this year. And again, the 12 to 16 is a good way to do it. The erosion in operating profit, I guess, my view, one, we were looking for a sequential improvement in gross profit. We said both in July, when we said first half to second half, we'd get better; and also, when we talked about it back in January, we said sequentially we'll continue to improve margins. When we got to the fourth, we were up about 2 points. And quite frankly, we thought we could have probably gone to about 2.5 points. And the shortfall there was really driven by 2 things. One is mix. We had a terrific, terrific Systems quarter. And our Systems business is high-margin, but it's not as high a margin as our Software business, so that had an impact on mix.","And then some of the productivity we were looking for out of Services got pushed out. Now that wasn't a huge, huge surprise that the revenue performance in TS & CP to us because we talked about the contracts already. And GBS, we said, as we get consistent, signings growth will get to backlog growth, will get to revenue growth, and we saw a nominal improvement in the revenue trajectory but not enough yet to drive overall revenue growth. But as Jim noted, as we go into 2018, we have a much better backlog.","James Kavanaugh","And we also expect the margin trajectory in both of those businesses to start off and improve as we move forward to the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn Huberty","I appreciate the commentary around the first quarter skew and expecting revenue growth at constant currency in the first quarter. I wonder if you can provide some clarity as well on margin stabilization for 2018. Is that stabilization for the full year? And how would you think the first half versus second half looks like as it relates to year-on-year margin trends?","James Kavanaugh","Yes. Thank you, Katy. This is Jim. So I'll take that. As I stated in my prepared remarks, the skew is 17%, 18% of the full year on EPS, which is on the average over the last 5 years, but it's also above the last couple of years. Embedded in that, we do see the stabilization of margin on a year-to-year basis starting immediately in the first quarter. We entered the first quarter with some good strength, and we feel very good about our portfolio lineup, strength in our transactional businesses coming out of mainframe where we're ahead of the product cycle in the first 2 quarters, we have enclosed the highest fourth quarter shipped MIPS in history, and it's evident that the market has capacity demands and continues to see the value of that platform. So we see very good performance in our Systems lineup. By the way, Power grew, storage grew.","So we had pervasive growth in the fourth quarter, and we feel very strong coming into first quarter. Second, we do see software having growth in the first quarter, and that's just due to the mix between annuity and transactional. As Martin indicated during the prepared remarks, we continue to drive high renewal rates, and we continue to drive the annuity content of our business. And just given the dynamics there, that will give us growth in the first quarter, and it's going to give us mix and margin benefit in the first quarter overall. And then finally, Services, as I stated, we do see revenue from opening backlog, which, in the first quarter, given it's right in front of us, is almost about 90% of the first quarter revenue needed. And it does show improved trajectory throughout 2018. And I'll remind you, throughout '17, we talked about the headwinds we faced in our TS & CP business around some large contract conclusions that was delayed in 2017. We didn't realize it until the very end. We are going to start off 2018 in a much better position on margin, and we see overall stabilization beginning immediately.","Operator","Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","I guess, maybe I just want to focus more explicitly on gross margins and how you guys think gross margins will stack up in 2018. I know you've talked about margin stabilization, but it would be helpful if you just talk about how do you see gross margins in 2018. And then what are the levers that you think can enable a gross margin expansion environment in '18 for you guys, given the fact you are talking about revenue growth?","James Kavanaugh","Well, if you take a look at 2018 overall -- thanks, Amit -- we expect margins to stabilize, as I said. And we continue to drive -- that's going to come from a couple of areas, one, continued scale of our cloud business; two, improvement in yield of our services productivity as we wrap around some of those completed contracts I talked about; and three, just getting operating leverage from returning this business and portfolio back to growth. So we're going to continue making the strategic investments that are required to position us to win in key growth areas and position this company for the long term. And we're going to drive the base productivity, and we're going to get scale out of our as-a-service business as we move forward. And we saw great instantiation and proof points in the second half of last year overall. ","So if you play that out across our portfolio, I would tell you we'll get mix contribution from our Cognitive Solutions business segment, just driven based on the product lineup and the strength we have in our Watson offerings, in security and in our industry verticals. We're going to get margin and productivity benefit out of our services businesses, GBS and GTS. And we're going to get scale efficiencies out of our as-a-service and cloud-based businesses in our TS & CP overall segment. Martin, if you want to add a few comments.","Martin Schroeter","Yes. The other thing I'd add, kind of the way I think about it, in addition to what Jim went through, one, the margins in our Strategic Imperatives remain higher than the margins in the rest of our business. And remember, the whole business, by the way, has high margins, right? We're a high-margin -- we're a high-value model with high margins, we're 49% -- between 49% and 50% margin. So we're building the businesses. The places we're moving to -- and you saw a great performance out of Strategic Imperatives, the places we're going to offer higher margins than the places we're coming from, and the reweighting alone gets us some content. And as Jim pointed out, in any scale business, the worst is behind us because we're building scale every day.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz from Barclays.","Mark Moskowitz","Just one clarification and a question. Did you guys say that the revenue growth for '18 can grow for full year, both reported and constant currency? And then also wanted to understand more on this topic of scale, which has become the common thread throughout the call today. What are kind of the key metrics that you're looking to that your algorithms internally state in terms of the cloud as a percentage of revenue and also Strategic Imperatives as a percentage of total revenue? What do those need to glide to, to get to greater scale, so you can start talking about incremental operating leverage returning to the story, i.e. 50% gross margin and 20% plus operating margin?","James Kavanaugh","Yes. So thank you, Mark, for the question. So yes, a couple of questions. Let me start with the first one around revenue growth. We did state that based on the trajectory in the second half and how we made significant improvement, and the confidence we have in our portfolio and the strength in winning in key market segments, that we see revenue growth for the full year at current spot rates. I also said that starting in the first quarter, we see revenue growth both at actual rates and current spot rates. Now I will tell you, one, we've got a lot of momentum that we built up through the second half. But 2018, there's a lot of work to get done. We have best visibility of what the quarter we're in right now with the 90 days and all of the operational indices around what the profile of our business looks like, and we're very confident that we will grow at both constant currency and at actual rates. And we got a lot of work to do the rest of the year, and we fully expect that we're going to continue that momentum, and we'll update you as we go through the year on that.","Martin Schroeter","I guess, Mark, it's Martin. In terms of scale, I guess, one way to think about it, because of the backlog of business we have, which it's north of $120 billion of Services business, that business is moving on to the IBM Cloud. That's the process we're going through now. So not only are we building and moving new SaaS properties into the cloud, which have great margins, not only are we building the Platform-as-a-Service and building ecosystems around that, we have 120 -- north of $120 billion backlog in our services business that we're in the process of moving to the cloud. We've got some progress, but we are not through the majority of this yet. We got a long way to go. So when we talk scale, we're moving our whole services platform on to the IBM Cloud, and that's going to give us the scale we need, not just for that infrastructure layer but it's going to give us the scale we need to manage applications, it's going to give us to scale we need to deliver SaaS as effectively as possible and efficiently as possible, so we got a lot of scale coming our way.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. Steven Milunovich from UBS.","Steven Milunovich","I know you're always excited to hear my suggestions. One would be to provide a bridge, an earnings bridge, which some companies do, and we're obviously all trying to get at that. But it'd be helpful if, at some point, maybe you guys would put one together for us. But a couple of points I wanted to touch on. One would be currency in terms of a bridge, I assume that's positive to EPS. Another is investments. It's very hard to understand. Are your investments increasing year-over-year at a slower rate than they've been? Are they actually declining year-over-year? And then charges. So you're kind of suggesting there's going to be charges that maybe offset some of the discretes on tax. Can you give us a sense of what charges for the year might be like? And there's obviously a lot of speculation about GTS. You're talking about moving things to the cloud, I'm assuming it'd be related to that in part.","James Kavanaugh","Thanks, Steve. I appreciate it. And believe me, as we get to know each other, I'm always looking for suggestions.","Martin Schroeter","Yes, I was going to say, Steve, we only have a thing about multipart questions, not multipart suggestions. We're happy to get those.","James Kavanaugh","You took what I was just going to say.","Martin Schroeter","Sorry. All right, back to you.","James Kavanaugh","Let's start with currency overall. So as you saw in the fourth quarter, currency, finally after -- Martin, how many years?","Martin Schroeter","Too many.","James Kavanaugh","Five years we've been living with this? And it's been a dramatic drain on our portfolio overall just given the dynamics of how much business we do outside U.S. dollar-denominated. But currency is finally a tailwind to the IBM company of a 2.7 points here in the fourth quarter, which was about a $600 million help on the top line. And that's driven from a variety of FX rates across different countries. But as you know quite well, we constantly build a financial discipline in our model, and we hedge those currencies to protect the volatility of our business from the bottom line. And so I would tell you, bottom line currency overall in the period, was de minimis. It was a couple of pennies at most. But what happens is, over the long run, it allows you flexibility to change your pricing, change your sourcing, change your business dynamics. And we've been dealing with that, as I stated upfront, for quite a period of time. And we're glad that it's finally going our way, and we're going to capitalize on that as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","I guess, just a couple of quick ones, if you guys don't mind. I know you got a lot of questions around the stable margin outlook. How much of that is coming from expected productivity versus mix and changes in investments? And the second one, just to better understand the tax point here. Just is your capital allocation going to change at all? I heard a little bit about the CapEx, which makes sense, but just wanted to make sure, any change in assumption around capital deployment posttax?","James Kavanaugh","Okay, thank you, Tien-tsin. This is Jim. Let me address the margin piece. As we've been talking throughout the call, obviously, we've got a lot of focus on, one, returning this business back to revenue growth; and two, stabilizing these margins year-over-year. And we firmly believe and are confident that we got the plans in place overall. But when you look at it, I tend to look at margin in a couple of different buckets, as I stated earlier. Number one, we will continue to drive base productivity out of this business. It's instrumental to our financial model, and it's what our clients require as we continue to help our clients move and apply technology and expertise to help enable their businesses to move from one era to the other. And that will be probably about 0.5 point improvement in our margins overall.","On the flip side, we're going to continue to invest in our business to position us strategically, to win in key growth segments. I talked about AI, I talked about cloud, I talked about security in new eras -- areas, excuse me, like blockchain, which you saw a couple of days ago our latest announcement with Maersk around global trade distribution and how we're building and scaling that platform overall. So we're going to continue making investments. And then the third part of the equation is the mix equation. And that's going to come off of driving revenue growth in high profitable areas around our Cognitive Solutions area, and that will drive operating leverage to the IBM company overall. So Martin, you want to address the tax side?","Martin Schroeter","Sure. So a couple of things, Tien-tsin. First, we've been supporters of, proponents of and pushing for fundamental tax reform for a long, long time. We think it's the right thing to go. So we're delighted, absolutely delighted, that we got tax reform. Now in the short term, we took a charge, this toll charge, right, to recognize a shift from one system to the territorial that we've all been supportive of. So we'll pay the toll charge. And as Jim noted, within our cash flow guidance, we have a cash headwind, which is all captured -- cash tax headwind, all of which is captured in the guidance. But for us, it's a long-term benefit because we now have freedom of capital movement. It's not really a near-term capital allocation issue for us. So we have -- well, as you know, we have $12 billion of cash around the world. We don't have big cash pile stock -- cash stockpiled outside the U.S. We've always had a really good access to our cash. And we got tax reform done, or they got tax reform done in a period where it wasn't an issue for us, so no capital allocation changes for us.","The reason we're able to grow the dividend over time, the reason we're able to reduce the share count is because we've always had good cash flow, we've had enough to reinvest in the business. But tax reform by itself -- well, again, not -- we are huge supporters, we're glad it happened, not a near-term capital event for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia from Pivotal Research Group.","Louis Miscioscia","Okay, great. I'll ask a question just on Systems, but maybe, as everybody else, a multipart. I just want to look at Systems. Obviously, nice that you have the mainframe cycle. Could you give us an idea how long that could last, in that usually, you get at least 2 nice quarters of it, maybe even 3? And then also on the storage front, obviously, you've been doing very well there. Is your mix more over -- well over 50% or 60% all-flash, so we could expect a good year from that? And then finally, you came out with an AI chip, POWER9. Does that fall into the systems sector? And do you have any traction with that yet, given there's obviously a lot of discussion about AI?","James Kavanaugh","Thank you, Lou. I appreciate the question. And believe me, we are very pleased with our overall Systems performance here in the fourth quarter, and that goes well beyond mainframe. But let me start with mainframe. Very pleased, as I said, with the performance as it instantiates how we continually modernize and build an enduring platform. Strong value proposition, it's definitely resonating in the marketplace, and we continue to handle mission-critical workloads and also, very, very important, open up new profit pools with our pervasive encryption capabilities, getting strong resonation in the market, our new workloads around Linux and HANA and also emerging workloads like Blockchain. So mainframe, with the second quarter, and we had a couple of weeks here in September, we delivered 71% revenue growth at constant currency, and we had the largest shipped MIPS in any quarter in its history.","And now our MIPS installed base has grown double digits year-to-year, and it's 2.5x the last 10 years. So this performance is, right now, above the prior cycle and consistent with z12 a few years ago. And while we've got many scenarios -- as I said earlier, we gave a guidance of at least $13.80, we got many scenarios and many people working tirelessly to continue to drive innovation into this platform so we can do much better than just the typical cycle. Our guidance is not counting on any material change to that. Now I'm glad you brought up Power and storage because we were very pleased in the fourth quarter. Power grew 15%. We started shipping the first POWER9 architecture with the Cora win. I think we won two of the three. We're only able to win two of the three, by the way.","So a strong start to POWER9 architecture, and we'll roll the rest of that out, our low-end, starting later in the first half and early in the second half. So we look for continued momentum in our Power portfolio overall. And then finally, on storage, this is the first year in a long time, for 4 quarters in a row, we've grown storage. And that's been based on the great work our storage team has done about repositioning their portfolio, leveraging and growing share in flash, but it's also about software-defined and also, more importantly, as we move forward, object storage that will continue to look for growth. So we're very pleased with our system portfolio, and we look for that to continue. Martin, do you want to say a few words?","Martin Schroeter","I guess, Lou, it's an interesting question. I guess, since it's only about Systems, it doesn't count as multipart. But we get questions, as I'm sure you do, this idea, what's cyclical, what's secular. And when we go back to why we started talking about the Strategic Imperatives, those are the secular changes in the enterprise IT world. They're all about cloud, they're all about security, they're all about analytics, they're all about mobile. And while what you asked about was a product view, remember that the secular trend that these are tied into continues. And so the demand for mainframe is driven by the secular trend for security. It is not so much about, like, there's a new mainframe, so I have to buy one. It's not so much in POWER9 that, Oh, there's a new POWER9. I have to buy it. All of these machines -- and we kind of shorthand it to say they're built for the most contemporary workloads. But we introduced those shifts and those secular ideas through the Strategic Imperatives, and all of these offerings are riding that secular trend. Mainframe and security is a good example. Power and analytics -- POWER9 and analytics is a good example. And quite frankly, and Jim mentioned this, storage, as it moves to the cloud, needs object store. And our object store offerings in storage are doing terrifically well. So the cyclical versus secular is not as simple as some want to portray it, it really is, are these offerings tied into those long-term secular trends, and our Systems business is absolutely tied to those.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider","Welcome, Jim, and congratulations, Martin. I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit of color on a constant currency basis for the revenue outlook, and which of the segments' constant currency you would expect to be up versus any that you expect to be down?","James Kavanaugh","Okay, thank you, Jim, for the question. As I stated before, our full year guidance of at least $13.80 is predicated on us delivering revenue growth at current spot rates. I said that earlier because we got a lot of work to do. And while we've got great momentum that we built out in the second half, and we feel very confident about our portfolio across the board, the best line of sight that we have right now is first quarter. And in first quarter, we will deliver revenue growth, both at actual rates and at constant currency. And let me just give you a little color underneath that. If you start with Cognitive Solutions, as Martin said earlier in one of the Q&As, we have repositioned through strategic investments in many different areas that portfolio and have been generating tremendous penetration in our annuity content. Today, in Cognitive Solutions, annuity is about 80% of that portfolio. And underneath that, it's being driven by a strong acceleration in Software-as-a-Service in the mix.","Over the last 12 months, our Software-as-a-Service is up 30% overall. So we see, just based on the annuity versus transactional seasonality of first quarter, we will grow Cognitive Solutions at a constant currency level. In both of our services areas, which, as we talked about earlier, pretty consistent performance throughout the second half, we are actually opening up our backlog with a runout that is showing improvement year-to-year from where we were opening last year. So while our total backlog at $121 billion is up 2% overall, down 3% at constant currency, that backlog and the composition of that backlog gives us much more better confidence and will make sequential improvement in our revenue growth trends as we move throughout the year. And then Systems, coming off of a phenomenal fourth quarter of 28% growth, growth across all 3 platforms, we expect growth to continue, albeit probably not at that rate, but it will continue as we continue to leverage the value of our mainframe proposition and start scaling our Power and the continuation of performance in our storage area.","Operator","Our last question is coming from David Grossman from Stifel Financial.","David Grossman","Actually, I think you may have just answered it. But just to be clear, obviously, the services is pretty important to your '18 outlook. And while both segments continue to face headwinds, the growth dynamic underlining the tech services and cloud is probably more opaque. So can you just talk about -- or you had talked about customer losses in the first half of '17, and you just mentioned the backlog and that opening up as we migrate into the first half of next year. So with that said, other than typical execution risk, is there any reason to believe that the growth rate of that business should not reaccelerate as the year progresses and maybe even get through some kind of slope dynamic as we anniversary the tough compares in the back half of the year?","James Kavanaugh","Yes, thanks, David. I appreciate the question. So as I -- as you indicated -- let me give you a little bit more color around our Services and, in particular, about our Services backlog runout. If you take our GBS business, our GBS business enters the year with a backlog that should yield in fiscal year of about 2\/3 of its revenue. Still has about 1\/3 of the revenue that we need to go do sell and bill and translate that backlog into revenue yield throughout the year, but that 2\/3 of that backlog shows a significant improvement versus where we were beginning 2017. And that shows sequential improvement as we move throughout the year.","Now the focus in GBS, we've already transformed our Consulting business. As Martin talked throughout the year, signings lead to backlog, lead to revenue growth. We've now gotten two quarters in a row of Consulting growth in revenue. And we finished the year, I'll remind you, growing GBS signings four quarters in a row. The area of focus that we need now is around our AMS business. And that is around an area where we're helping our clients migrate to the cloud and also how we need to capitalize on leveraging the incumbency value of AMS overall. So I definitely see GBS improving its trajectory as we move throughout the year. And if we execute on the pipelines we got in place, I definitely see that we can grow by the end of the year in our GBS business. In GTS, which has much longer durations, the GTS business, the opening backlog is somewhere around 75% to 80% or maybe a little bit higher as you enter the year. So again, similar, we still got about 20% of work to do in the year to go get that revenue yield, but that 80% backlog is actually in a much better shape than what it was at the beginning of 2017, as we spoke about all year long, with some ending -- contract conclusions.","So with that, let me wrap up the call in by saying again, we're very pleased with the work we have done over the last year to reposition our business. And I hope what you took away from today's call is that we're entering with a stronger revenue and margin profile. Now as always, there's more work to do, and I look forward to sharing our progress and continuing this dialogue as we move through 2018. Thank you all for joining the call.","Patricia Murphy","Lawrence, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today's call.

This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM, and I\u2019d like to welcome you to our third quarter earnings presentation. I\u2019m here today with Jim Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours, and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I\u2019ll also remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking, under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC.

All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You\u2019ll find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","So, with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Kavanaugh","Thanks, Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us.","In the third quarter, we delivered $18.8 billion of revenue, $3.6 billion of operating pretax income and $3.42 of operating earnings per share. And over the last 12 months, we generated $12.2 billion of free cash flow with realization over 100%. As compared to last year, our revenue was flat at constant currency though down 2% with the impact of the stronger dollar. Gross profit margin was flat, which is the best year-to-year performance in years. The improvement was led by services margin expansion. We expanded our overall operating pretax margin and we grew operating profit and earnings per share.","We continue to see strong client demand in the emerging, high-value segments of the IT industry. And our performance this quarter was driven by the offerings in hybrid cloud, in security, in digital, and in analytics and AI, a testament to our ability to deliver differentiated value to our clients through innovative technologies with the skills and expertise to implement these technologies. We see the results in our strategic imperatives revenue growth of 13% over the last 12 months. We also see this playing out in higher operating margin over the last few quarters, which supports both, our long-term investment and return to shareholders. With our success in these higher value areas and our focus on delivering consistent operational performance, we remain on track to our full-year expectations of earnings per share and free cash flow.","Coming into the second half, we said we expected to improve our services revenue trajectory and to expand total services margins for the half. We also said we face some headwinds as we wrap on the new mainframe launch and our strongest software performance in the third quarter of last year.","And so now this quarter, we delivered revenue growth and gross margin expansion in both services segments. In global business services, our revenue growth accelerated, driven by consulting as we help clients with their digital transformations. And we grew revenue again in Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, driven by hybrid cloud implementations. And I should mention that my revenue comments here and throughout will be based on constant currency.","In systems, our IBM Z revenue grew, despite a wrap on new mainframe launch, resulting in what is now the most successful Z program in our history. And then, looking at our software revenue, which spans our segments, we had growth in integration software, driven by offerings that help clients modernize applications and enable hybrid cloud adoption. In solution software, we had good performance in several areas including security, key offerings and analytics like data science, and our Watson health verticals, as we embed AI into more of our offerings. At the same time, we continue to deal with challenges in a few horizontal solution areas and a tougher compare in transaction processing software, both of which impacted overall software revenue growth.","Across our segments, our strategic imperatives revenue has grown to $39.5 billion over the last 12 months. Within that, our cloud revenue is $19 billion, and we exited the third quarter within as-a-service annual run rate of $11.4 billion, which again was up 24%. While that\u2019s already a significant revenue base in the emerging, high-value segments of the IT industry such as cloud and AI, it\u2019s still early in the adoption of these technologies.","For example, it\u2019s estimated that enterprises are only 10% to 20% into their cloud journey, with progress slow by the lack of interoperability across cloud environments and concerns about the ability to manage data privacy and security in multiple cloud environments. And so, clients need a cloud partner that can offer a hybrid cloud for workloads that cut across public, private and traditional, a secure cloud for mission-critical workloads and highly sensitive data and an open cloud to run complex, multi-cloud environments.","12 months ago, we launched IBM Cloud Private, which is a starting point for many companies as they embrace a hybrid, multi-cloud strategy. Already, more than 400 global companies have embraced this platform to manage mission-critical business processes in the cloud, and nearly all of these are competitive wins. Just yesterday, we announced a series of innovations that will help clients scale their cloud, AI and cyber security initiatives. These include IBM Multicloud Manager, which is the industry\u2019s first service to deploy and manage complete applications in any cloud environment. We also announced IBM\u2019s AI OpenScale technology, the first open, interoperable AI platform to manage the lifecycle of all forms of AI applications and models. This includes the management of bias, security and provenance of models and data which are the issues clients are facing with scaling AI in the enterprise.","These are just a few examples of how we\u2019re building our technology innovations and industry expertise with trust and security to help enterprises on their journey to cloud and to AI.","Before getting into the financial metrics, I\u2019ll lay out the drivers of our operating earnings per share growth. As I said, our revenue is flat at constant currency, but with the continued strengthening of the dollar, revenue was down 2%. And at constant margin, this was a headwind to profit and earnings per share growth. Our actions to reposition our cost base and drive operating efficiencies resulted in pretax margin expansion of 50 basis points, despite a headwind from mix. And so, we had modest growth in our pretax income. Our tax rate was down, driven by a discrete benefit in the quarter, and finally, a lower share count contributed to growth. Putting it all together, our operating EPS was up 5%. Year-to-date through September, our operating EPS is also up 5%. And you can see on this chart the contributors to earnings per share growth consistent with how we presented it over the last three quarters.","Looking at our underlying profit and cash metrics. As I said, our gross margin was flat compared to last year, which is an improvement in the year-to-year trajectory. We had solid gross margin improvement in the services segments, together up 160 basis points. And as I talked about last quarter, in services, which is a human capital based business, value is instantiated in gross margin. This was offset by the mix headwinds we discussed 90 days ago, in z14 mainframe and software.","Our operating expense was down 4% year-to-year with half due to currency and half due to the base operational performance. When currency hurts the top-line, it generally helps the expense line due to both translation and the benefit of hedging contracts. The base expense reduction of 2 points was driven by operating efficiencies, including acquisition synergies. We deliver productivity across our business by using automation, leveraging agile processes and changing the way we work. This provides flexibility to increase investment to deliver innovations in areas like hybrid cloud, AI, cyber security and blockchain, while also dropping some to the bottom line.","Within our expense decline, we also absorbed a lower level of IP income. We expanded both operating pretax and net income margins, and net income was up 3%. Our operating tax rate was down 2 points from last year, while our underline rate of 16% is up slightly. As I said the year-to-year dynamic is driven by discrete benefit in the quarter.","Looking at our cash metrics. We generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $5.4 billion through September, which is year-to-year. As expected, our year-to-date decline is driven by cash tax headwind and growth in CapEx. As always, trailing 12 months is the best way to look at our cash flow performance. And on that basis, we generated $12.2 billion, which a 108% free cash flow realization. We returned about 70% of that to shareholders while increasing our capital investment.","Turning to our segments. Cognitive solutions had $4.1 billion of revenue, which was down 5%. The segment is comprised of a broad set of offerings. So, let me take a minute to break it down. solutions software includes offerings and strategic verticals like health, domain-specific capabilities, like analytics and security, as well as our emerging technologies of AI and blockchain. We had good performance across these areas this quarter, and I\u2019ll come back to these in a minute.","Solutions also includes offerings that address horizontal domains. And over the last three quarters, I\u2019ve been talking about challenges in a few of these areas, specifically collaboration, commerce and talent where we\u2019re dealing with secular shifts in the market. We\u2019ve been taking actions including modernizing our offerings, infusing AI, and enhancing the digital experience. While these three areas continue to weigh on the segment\u2019s overall performance, we\u2019ve made some progress. For example, in commerce, where we infused AI into offerings like customer experience analytics, SaaS signings grew double digits this quarter. And in collaboration, we\u2019ve had very positive reaction to the recent introduction of Notes\/Domino Version 10, which is optimized for mobile and supports JavaScript and Node.js. So, we\u2019re starting to see some green shoots. But because the time to value is longer in SaaS, we will start seeing this play out as we get into 2019.","Cognitive Solutions also includes transaction processing software. This includes software that runs mission-critical workloads, leveraging our hardware platforms. While much of the revenue is annuity-based, in any quarter, the performance reflects the timing of larger transactions that are tied to client buying cycles. We have a good pipeline in transaction processing software as we enter the fourth quarter, which supports a return to growth.","So, now, let me turn back to a few of our high-value areas where we continue to scale new platforms and high-value solutions. This quarter, we had growth in industry verticals like health, key areas of analytics and security. In Watson health, where we\u2019ve been infusing AI the longest, we had broad-based growth including in payer, provider, imaging and life sciences. In the area of life sciences, we\u2019ve been working with Medtronic to leverage data and apply intelligence into their glucose monitors. In June, the Sugar.IQ with Medtronic went live, and initial demand and patient results are very strong.","In our underlying analytics platform, we had growth in our data science and IBM Cloud Private for data offerings. We continue to invest in advancing data and AI. We announced bias detection services and introduced new Watson services on the IBM Cloud Private platform as clients seek the benefits of AI and the cloud behind their firewall.","Security growth in the quarter was led by offerings in orchestration, data security and endpoint management. Our momentum is driven by our unique market position, comprehensive integrated portfolio and differentiation with AI. In the emerging area of blockchain, this quarter our IBM Food Trust network for food safety went live, and Carrefour, one of the world\u2019s leading retailers joined the network. We also jointly announced TradeLens with Maersk. Together we will apply blockchain technologies to address inefficiencies in the global supply chain, and signed up over 50 ecosystem participants, and we now have over 75 active blockchain networks.","Looking at profit this quarter. We expanded pre-tax margin by over a point year-to-year. This was driven by operational efficiencies, including acquisition synergies, while continuing to invest at high levels in key strategic areas.","Looking at services. Our global business services revenue grew 3%, building on the progress from first half. Consulting revenue growth accelerated to 7%, led by strength in offerings within the Digital Strategy and iX, as well as Cognitive Process Transformation. And in application management, a decline in traditional enterprise application managed services is being mitigated by the continued strength in areas such as cloud migration factory and cloud application development.","Our consulting performance reflects the fact that enterprises are undergoing a digital transformation and reinvention, leveraging technology to transform the way they operate, to attract the best talent, and to improve engagements with their customers.","Customers are turning to GBS as we are uniquely positioned to infuse IBM\u2019s leading-edge technology and partnerships with our industry expertise to enable clients\u2019 digital transformation. For example, we are partnering with Sally Beauty to provide it innovative digital and in-store customer experience, influenced by deep understanding of the brand, consumer, and retail industry. We are creating virtual assistance for Lloyds Banking Group to enhance the way they communicate with and serve customers. And at the U.S. Open, GBS provided the digital fan experience, which included several innovative features. AI highlights enabled the tournament\u2019s digital team to view and find the most exciting shot of the day or match for distribution, and the AI powered virtual concierges answered fans\u2019 questions on a range of topics.","Turning to gross profit. GBS gross margin expanded 270 basis points year-to-year. We are shifting our revenue mix towards higher value offering such as digital and cognitive, and capturing that price for value. Additionally, we have aligned our resources to key skill areas and are seeing productivity and utilization benefits. Putting it all together, GBS delivered a solid quarter. They are executing well and delivering value to clients in key strategic areas.","In Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, we delivered $8.3 billion of revenue and grew for the second consecutive quarter. Growth was led by hybrid cloud implementations with cloud revenue up 22%. And we exited the quarter with a $7.5 billion as-a-service annual run rate. This reflects IBM\u2019s differentiated value proposition to address cloud for the enterprise. As I said earlier, clients are early in their cloud journey and their needs are evolving. Initial cloud projects focused on the productivity economics of renting IT infrastructure at scale.","More and more however, clients want to move beyond that model and start to shift mission-critical business processes and apps to the cloud. They recognize that cloud can help drive real business value in those processes, launch new applications rapidly and enter new markets. And this all needs to be optimized across public, private and on-prem where many of the workloads will remain. This is why IBM\u2019s approach to cloud is hybrid, secure and open.","I mentioned our announcements yesterday. It\u2019s important to note that we are bringing new, open and interoperable approaches to cloud. This is consistent with our heritage as a leader in open standards and governance. From the early days of Linux and Java to Kubernetes and Hyperledger for blockchain, we\u2019re bringing the same open approach to cloud and AI, which will also help clients overcome the complexity of proprietary technology and vendor lock-in. Within this segment, we see results of this shift in infrastructure services and integration software with strong cloud performance contributing to revenue growth in both of these areas.","I mentioned earlier the strong adoption of IBM Cloud Private, with 95 new companies alone this quarter around the globe. For example, Aflac in Japan is trusting IBM Cloud to help speed the development of new business products and services. Brazil\u2019s Fidelity National Information Services, a global leader in payment processing solutions has adopted IBM Cloud Private to help streamline credit card charge backs for its Brazilian operations. And CNH Industrial, a leader in the capital goods sector will use IBM Cloud Private and Watson Artificial Intelligence to transform its business processes across manufacturing, supply chain, sales and marketing, and financial services.","And now, turning to technical support services, revenue was down 3%, which is a modest sequential improvement from second quarter. Similar to last quarter, this area continued to be impacted by the dynamics of our hardware product cycle, moderated by continued growth in our core multi-vendor services offerings.","Moving on to gross profit for the segment. Margin expanded 120 basis points. This improvement was driven by scale efficiencies in our cloud business as well as a lift in our productivity initiatives. As we continue to drive value in Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, we are making investments to capitalize on the shifts to cloud by adding capacity and expanding our data center footprint around the world as well as expanding our go-to-market capabilities to capture the opportunity in hybrid. We\u2019re also investing in development to drive hybrid cloud innovation that means both private and public technologies. You see this in the introduction of IBM Multicloud Manager and AI OpenScale. And we\u2019re also adding functionality and enhancements to IBM Cloud Private and IBM Cloud.","Before moving on to Systems, let me give you some perspective on our combined services business. As we entered the year, we saw improved revenue from opening backlog, which pointed to an improving revenue trajectory. And the actions we\u2019ve been taking to remix our offerings to higher value, improve price realization and drive productivity and workforce optimization combined with scale efficiencies in the cloud are designed to improve gross profit performance, which in a human capital-based business is where the value is instantiated. In the third quarter for services, the revenue trajectory and gross margins continued to improve, with combined revenue up 1% and gross margins expanding 160 basis points.","In Systems, we grew revenue again this quarter, driven by a combination of a strong z14, a newly introduced POWER9 adoption. This quarter IBM Z revenue grew 6% year-to-year on 20% MIPs growth, and margins expanded. The z14 program continued to track ahead the prior cycle. And in fact, program to-date in terms of shipped capacity, it\u2019s the most successful in our platform\u2019s long history. The z14\u2019s pervasive encryption continues to be a key differentiator. For instance, governments are selecting z14 to protect the sensitive data, including a large U.S. government agency this quarter. The z14 adoption spans many industries and countries. And we added new clients to the platform again this quarter, including several new clients to our new single-frame z14 designed specifically for cloud environments.","Our Power revenue was up double digits, driven by strong growth in Linux, and traction across our new POWER9-based architecture. In the third quarter, we released our next-generation POWER9 processors for a mid-range and a high-end systems, and we\u2019ve seen strong adoption. These systems are designed for handling advanced analytics, cloud environments, and data intensive workloads in AI, HANA and UNIX markets. We also introduced new offerings optimizing both hardware and software for AI. Offering such as PowerAI Vision and PowerAI Enterprise will help to drive new customer adoption. And we continued to deploy our supercomputers at U.S. Department of Energy labs in the quarter.","Storage hardware was down this quarter with declines in mid-range and high-end, mitigated by strong growth in all-flash arrays. Storage is an increasingly competitive environment with continued pricing pressures. So, to differentiate in this environment requires additional investment in innovation. We\u2019ve been releasing new functionality like Safeguarded Copy for cybersecurity to protect critical client data from cyber attack. And we signed our first large deployment of this technology with a major bank this quarter. And our new FlashSystems with next generation NVMe technology was announced earlier this quarter. We will continue to roll out NVMe across the portfolio.","Turning to profit. Systems pretax margin was down over 6 points, reflecting a mixed headwind and lower level of IP income and ongoing investment to drive innovation across the brands.","Turning to cash flow and balance sheet in the quarter. We generated $3.1 billion of cash from operations excluding our financing receivables and $2.2 billion of free cash flow. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $5.4 billion, which is down $800 million year-to-year. The decline is driven by a combination of higher capital expenditures and cash taxes. You\u2019ll recall at the beginning of the year, we said we expected three headwinds to our free cash flow growth this year, higher CapEx, higher cash taxes, and our strong working capital performance at the end of last year, driven by the IBM Z introduction. The combined impact from cash taxes and capital investments is in line with what we expected at this point. So, we spent a little more in CapEx and a little less on cash taxes.","Looking at uses of cash over the last three quarters. We returned $6.6 billion to our shareholders, including $4.2 billion in dividends. And we bought back 16 million shares with $1.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization at the end of September.","Looking at the balance sheet highlights. We ended September with $14.7 billion in cash and non-financing debt of about $16.5 billion. We had just over $30 billion of debt in support of our financing business, which continues to be leveraged at 9 to 1. Our financing portfolio remained strong at 55% investment grade. That\u2019s a point better than December and two points better than a year ago. So, I\u2019m confident in the strength of our balance sheet. We\u2019ve got plenty of flexibility to continue to invest, while returning value to our shareholders as evidenced by 23 consecutive years of dividend increases.","So, let me wrap it up. Our performance through the first three quarters reflects the investments we\u2019ve been making over the last couple years and actions to reposition the business. We\u2019ve been rebuilding our innovation pipeline to address what our enterprise clients value in an IT industry that has been rapidly reordering, technologies like AI, blockchain, cyber security delivered in hybrid cloud environments. And we\u2019ve taken actions to further align our skill base to this opportunity and to drive operating efficiencies.","And so, now, on a year-to-date basis, our revenue is up, our gross margin trajectory has been improving, and then the third quarter was flat year-to-year. Our operating profit is up modestly and we returned a lot of value to shareholders. These all reinforce the fact that we\u2019re a high-value company.","As we look forward as always, there\u2019s more work to do. And the fourth quarter seasonally has a large transaction base. But with the performance in the first three quarters and our focus on consistent operational execution, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share. Regarding our free cash flow with the headwinds we expected in cash taxes and capital expenditures largely behind us, we are maintaining our view of about $12 billion of free cash flow for the year, which is over 100% realization.","And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia, so we can get started on Q&A.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I\u2019d ask you to refrain for multiple questions and multi-part questions, so that we can make the best use of the time we have today. So, operator, let\u2019s please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","Thank you. Jim, I guess, when I think about this quarter, there were multiple cross currents that IBM dealt with across the portfolio. So, I guess, it would be helpful just to hear how you would characterize IBM\u2019s performance in September quarter versus what you guys were expecting 90 days ago, and importantly the sustainability of some of the trends that you\u2019re seeing, especially on gross margins, which were flat on a very difficult compare I think versus last year. And then, on the other hand, you had Cognitive was down somewhat more than I thought. So, if you could maybe just characterize the performance and sustainability of some of these trends versus what you thought 90 days ago, that would be really helpful for us.","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay. Thanks, Amit. And it\u2019s a good place to start here talking about the characterization of our quarter, now that we\u2019re through three quarters of 2018. But, I guess from my perspective, I would say, first, we had a solid quarter. We delivered $18.8 billion of revenue, which was consistent with our guidance of a typical quarter-to-quarter seasonality, even in light of a strengthening U.S. dollar, which continues to go against us. But, the headline overall would be, we fundamentally have taken the actions to reposition our business entering 2018. And you see that play out as we enter the second half where we grew operating profit, we expanded operating pretax margins by 50 basis points, we grow EPS 5% consistent with the first half, and we continue to drive strong free cash flow realization to deliver value back to our shareholders.","Now, some of the underpinnings behind that. One, we still see strong demand in key high value segments and you see that play out in our third quarter performance, and we think that will continue moving forward. Areas like hybrid cloud where we\u2019re winning with our hybrid cloud value proposition to the marketplace, data and AI, security, digital, all of these are instantiated in our strategic imperatives, which now from a trailing 12-month perspective were at $39.5 billion, pretty close to that $40 billion target that we put in place well over three years ago, when the IBM company had less than 25% of its portfolio in strategic imperatives; today, we\u2019re roughly at 50%. That\u2019s a massive transformation over a period of time. And that\u2019s led to significant improvement in trajectory of our revenue growth overall, whereas quarter -- year-to-date, we\u2019re up 2%.","But underneath that you see some of the areas of growth around cloud, $19 billion, growing 20%. And within that, it\u2019s being driven by our high-value as-a-service content, driving our cloud component. That\u2019s up now to $11.4 billion on an annualized exit run rate, growing consistently at 24%. But, if you put all that together, yes, we\u2019re seeing the underlying fundamental shifts of our top line. We\u2019ve done the tough work to transform our portfolio. But really, what I would call as an inflection point as we enter the second half of the year is what\u2019s happening with our operating leverage. And you see that play out in our gross margin performance, which is the best we\u2019ve had year-to-year in over three years.","Now, let\u2019s talk a little bit about that, because each of you is analyst; and more importantly, as I go out and meet with many of our investors, it is a very critical signpost in a high-value-based business model. And they\u2019ve been talking about our gross margin performance and when are we going to stabilize and how are we going to get back to expansion towards our model. And we talked about as we entered the year, we knew we had headwinds coming into the second half, predominantly around mix, mix around our successful mainframe launch but also mix is starting to hurt us from a currency perspective as we talked at length 90 days ago on how currency and the strengthening of dollars is actually hurting our product-based businesses in hardware and software where you have a disconnect between your cost base, which is in U.S. dollars versus your actual revenue of local currency. So, we knew that headwind. And now, what we\u2019ve been able to do is we\u2019ve been able to reposition our services base of businesses, and you see not only that we return both units back to growth, we actually delivered 160 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year. That\u2019s the best year-over-year in our services business in over five years. And we see that continuing and we expect that to continue to accelerate as we move into fourth quarter.","So, you combine that margin with our continued enterprise productivity, and you see that we\u2019re able to deliver strong operating pretax margins, and you couple that with our strong free cash flow which on a trailing 12 months is still in excess of $12 billion and free cash flow realization over 100%. And that gives us confidence to reaffirm our expectation of at least $13.80.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Amit. Can we please go to the next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.","Katy Huberty","Good afternoon. Jim, I want to get your early thoughts as you think about planning for next year, in particular because you face a number of headwinds, services backlog is down, the mainframe comps get more difficult, the dollars is strong, question of what tariffs do to demand. And so, in the context of all those headwinds, can you talk about what some of the offsets are as you start to plan for 2019? Whether there is a potential to continue to grow PTI as you go into next year, even as some of these headwinds don\u2019t? Thank you. ","Jim Kavanaugh","Sure, Katy. Thank you very much for the question. Obviously, we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do. We\u2019re 16 days into a very important fourth quarter. We are focused on delivering consistent operational performance to deliver value for our clients in the marketplace and also for our shareholders. So, with that said, we\u2019ll give updates on guidance in January. But, let me give you -- and to your point, let me give you kind of what we see as the trajectory of our business in the connotation of a headwind, tailwind as we move forward. So, let me first start with services.","You see, as we entered 2018, we talked about we had a much better position on our backlog near-term runout, and you\u2019ve seen that play out throughout 2018. And I think that\u2019s a combination of us taking some very bold actions about repositioning our services business and capitalizing on a differentiated services model, services practices and services value propositions to capture the growth in digital, cognitive and cloud. And we see great momentum in our GBS base of business, both on top-line and on bottom-line as we move forward.","In our GTS business, again, we continue to make progress, see acceleration in revenue through the third quarter. We are leveraging our differentiated hybrid cloud value proposition. Our clients value our incumbency. They value it because we understand their infrastructure, their workloads, and they trust us to move them to the future. And we talked about in the beginning of the year, when you look at our outsourcing backlog, we were hovering around 25% of a $90 billion outsourcing backlog. But right now, exiting third quarter, that $90 billion backlog give or take, we are now in about 32%, 35% cloud content. So, we are winning in the marketplace and our clients are choosing us to move down to the future. So, I continue to see both of our services business.","Now, with that said, we got a big fourth quarter on signings. We fell short in third quarter on signings. And as you know, signings can vary. And really, all signings are not equal. The reality is, the duration, the mix of signings and also new logo versus just extensions, all can impact overall. But, when we look at our fourth quarter, we got the strongest line-up in greater than $100 million deals lined up that we\u2019ve got a chance to exit the year with a very strong position in our services base of business. And when I couple that with our margin leverage that we\u2019re getting out of that business, once you get the revenue growth, you see the fundamental operating leverage, I definitely see that playing out into \u201819.","Now, on Systems, Systems as you talked about, we\u2019re into our fifth quarter on mainframe. By the way, in terms of shipped MIPs as I said in prepared remarks, this is the most successful mainframe program that we\u2019ve ever had. And we still grew in the third quarter, albeit mid-single-digits. Now, we know we wrap on that in the fourth quarter coming off of a 72% growth last year. But, you see the underlying innovation playing out in our Systems portfolio as we rolled out our new POWER9 architecture and we grew nicely in the third quarter by -- excuse me, 17%, if I remember correctly. And we see that continuing to play out as we rolled out mid-range and high-end late in the third quarter, we see that playing out in fourth quarter and next year also. And we\u2019ve got also innovations coming out in our all-flash systems in storage, which is where we\u2019re gaining share and winning in the marketplace.","So, the innovation of continually modernizing those platforms and systems, power in storage, we should see some continued growth as we move into \u201819, but we will wrap on some very tough compares to mainframe, which leads me to Cognitive. And we focused on Cognitive throughout this year. One, in the third quarter, we dealt with some enterprise client buying seasonality. And as I said earlier, that will come back in the fourth quarter, just given where clients are at in their buying cycles about committing to the platform. But, we\u2019ve been dealing with some issues around our horizontal apps. And as I said, that\u2019s a function of a secular shift in client value and consumption models to as-a-service. And we\u2019ll see that play out as we get into \u201819 and throughout \u201819.","So, our focus has been on the key high-value emerging areas of Cognitive around our industry verticals and around our domains, like security, blockchain, which we see great opportunity, and we\u2019re very pleased with that portfolio overall. So, kind of a posture around headwinds, tailwinds but we\u2019ll give a lot more color as we get into January.","Patricia Murphy","Okay. Thanks, Katy. Can we please go to the next question?","Operator","Next question is from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk, Jim, a little bit about free cash flow for this year. You mentioned that it will be greater than 100% of GAAP net income this year, despite the fact that you have some headwinds in cash taxes and higher CapEx, and that number is higher than your longer term guidance of 90% to 100% realization. So, I\u2019m wondering if you can help us understand what are the positive tailwinds that you\u2019re seeing that are enabling free cash flow to be higher than 100% of GAAP net income? And can you explicitly comment on what your expected cash pension and retirement contributions are this year, and whether receivables factoring will benefit your free cash flow and to what extent?","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay. Toni, thank you very much. And as always, many very good questions that you bring up. But, I hope I can capture many of them. If not, Patricia can get to all of you after the call. But, first of all, let me start at the big picture. Free cash flow, as we entered 2018, we entered 2018 coming off of a very strong fourth quarter in 2017 where we drew -- we actually contributed significant working capital efficiency through the launch of our mainframe product cycle. And we said in our January call that we expected about $12 billion of free cash flow in 2018 and the drivers of that from 2017 were really going to be centered around, one, incremental cash taxes that would be a headwind to us in \u201818, and by the way, that is playing out, and all of that is behind us now as we exit the third quarter; number two, that we work on a plan on driving that strong working capital efficiency with the introduction of our mainframe as we exit the fourth quarter of 2018, and that would be a headwind; and then third, we said we were going to continue to invest in our business to capitalize on our innovation and differentiate value around our hybrid cloud. And we\u2019ve continued to invest, actually invested more this year, because we\u2019re seeing an accelerated growth in our proud overall. Our CapEx is up, I think year-to-date 21%. So when you put those three headwinds in play, that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing play out in our free cash flows through nine months.","And by the way, we still feel comfortable and expect about $12 billion for the full-year based on any metric I look at in payment wise and our trailing 12 months is at $12.2 billion et cetera.","Now, let\u2019s get to free cash flow realization. First of all, as you know appropriately so, we draw free cash flow realization compared to GAAP earnings and GAAP net income because we believe that\u2019s the best way of doing realization overall. And you know within that, you\u2019ve got not only our core operating profit but we got working capital efficiencies, you got CapEx, you got tax, you got pension, all of those can be variables in that free cash flow realization. But, if you look at the last couple of years, we\u2019ve seen positive impact to our stated goal of at least 90% free cash flow realization, driven by working capital efficiency, it\u2019s been driving that free cash flow above 100%; and then, also tax and pension, tax about 6 points, pension a couple of points year-over-year.","So, when you take a look at those pieces, we feel comfortable in 2018 looking at both our expectation for non-GAAP and our expectation for GAAP that we will be well north of our realization here in 2018. And I\u2019m factoring -- I would tell you, our factoring is no different from 2018. We use that appropriately as a risk mitigation strategy, to manage credit, to manage concentration and collection risk overall. And we\u2019ll continue to use that judiciously, but I wouldn\u2019t see any major change in that year-over-year. ","Patricia Murphy","Great. Could we please go to the next question?","Operator","Next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. I\u2019m sorry. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan from Merrill Lynch.","Wamsi Mohan","Thank you. Jim, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the strategic imperative performance within Cognitive including the cloud revenues and as-a-service, both of which declined versus overall strategic imperative growth. Can you maybe talk about some of the puts and takes there and some color on what do you think drove that client buying seasonality that you mentioned to a prior question? And if I could, how do you think that some of these new announcements around AI OpenScale and multi-cloud could change the trajectory for Cognitive and when? Thank you.","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay, Wamsi. Thank you very much for your questions. There is a lot there to compact into a one answer. But, let me talk about strategic imperatives first and then I\u2019ll get into Cognitive next. But let\u2019s put the strategic imperatives into perspective. So, as I stated on the call, trailing 12 months, $39.5 billion. We talked about three years ago, we put the signpost out there. They had $40 billion at that point in time, the IBM contribution was less than a quarter of IBM\u2019s revenue. Now, we\u2019re approaching 50%. We\u2019re growing in the mid-teens, 13% I think, if I remember correctly, over the trailing 12 months. And that has lifted IBM\u2019s overall revenue growth. As you\u2019ve seen, year-to-date, we\u2019re growing 2% at the IBM level. But within that strategic imperatives, our cloud business, to your point, is at $19 billion right now, up 20%. And the high-value as-a-service component underneath that is up 24%, consistent with where we\u2019ve been in the first half of the year. And I think that\u2019s an attestation to we are capturing the new and emerging workloads as the secular shift to as-a-service world is happening overall.","Now, when you take a look at our strategic imperatives, let\u2019s put this in perspective, where we were 90 days ago. We knew to hit that $40 billion that we needed to be at basically mid to high-single-digit growth in the second half. And we knew similar to how we laid out our expectation for guidance that we were going to wrap around the most successful mainframe product program that we\u2019ve had in history. So, as we entered the second half, we knew we had a focus on driving that underlying high-value as-a-service content and continue to accelerate that to offset the impacts on that mainframe wrap around on product cycle. And you see in the third quarter, our strategic imperatives basically accomplished that. We did what we expected.","So, as we look going forward then in the fourth quarter, we have to repeat what we just did in the third quarter. And the underlying acceleration in our base services businesses I talked about, the expectation as we have a great pipeline lined up for our software entering the fourth quarter based on those buying cycle seasonality that impact us in third quarter, we do expect to hit the $40 billion at the end of the year. And I\u2019ll remind you, when we set that $40 billion target in 2015, we lost over $2 billion of revenue due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. So, you\u2019ve seen what it\u2019s done to transform our portfolio. It\u2019s changed the mindset of how we run our Company, how we allocate capital and investment, and you see how that\u2019s playing up with regard to the improved trajectory.","Now, getting to Cognitive, and I\u2019ll just talk about Cognitive SI, because to be honest with you, it\u2019s a simple answer. We talked about last 90, 120 days about the challenges and headwinds we\u2019re facing with regards to our horizontal application areas of talent, collaboration, and around Watson -- excuse me, marketing and commerce. We\u2019ve been making progress and I\u2019ll talk a little bit about that. But those three areas are still depressing our revenue. And as you know, there are secular shift to SaaS and consumption models, they hurt our as-a-service run rate.","So, while we\u2019ve been maintaining rounding up and down $2 billion of an as-a-service for the last couple of quarters, you\u2019re seeing strength in areas like security in our industry verticals like healthcare and blockchain and Watson, but it\u2019s getting depressed by those three horizontal app areas, and that will not play out until that time to value throughout 2019.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Wamsi. Let\u2019s go to next question, please.","Operator","Next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Thanks. Can you guys hear me now?","Patricia Murphy","We can hear you now.","Tien-tsin Huang","Sorry about that. I don\u2019t know what happened. Good to hear from you guys. Just want to clarify, I guess on the on the 13.80, at least 13.80, trying of better assess the at least in that comment. And what\u2019s required or how much cushion there is on the transactional side to achieve the outlook? Because if we use 13.80, that suggests 4Q earnings looks like a little below consensus and below each of the last two fourth quarters. So, just trying to understand the at least piece at this stage. Thanks.","Jim Kavanaugh","Sure, Tien-tsin, and thank you very much for the question. I think a little bit below, when you\u2019re doing the math. I mean, we just beat third quarter by $0.02. But, let\u2019s put that aside right now. As always, when we take a look at our following quarter and most importantly for the year, and it\u2019s one of the same right now, we always have multiple scenarios taking into account, one, the trajectory of our business and also the fundamentals and the operational indices that we see. And all support our expectation of the at least -- excuse me, at least $13.80 of earnings per share.","So, if you put that in perspective, how are we entering fourth quarter? Well, if you look at the fundamentals of our business profile through third quarter we\u2019re growing revenue, we\u2019re growing operating profit, we\u2019re growing earnings per share consistently, and we\u2019re still driving that strong free cash flow realization. So, kind of -- let me walk down the I&E and give you a perspective. And again, there are multiple variables here. But the way we kind of see it triangulating each of these pieces.","First on revenue. On revenue, as you\u2019ve seen in our supplemental charts, the dollar continues to go against us and strengthen against foreign currencies. And right now on revenue, we see about a 2-point currency headwind here in the fourth quarter, pretty consistent by the way with the third quarter. But, we would expect a normal historical quarter-to-quarter seasonality probably in the range of somewhere around 3 to 5 years, I mean average seasonality of 3Q to 4Q. But putting that in perspective, year-to-date grown at 2%; and where we think fourth quarter can be, we continue to feel that we expect full year revenue at current spot rates that we will grow. And again, I\u2019ll make the statement, we\u2019ve been saying that throughout the year. And from the trough of the U.S. dollar to FX, we\u2019ve lost $1.5 billion of revenue since that period of time. But, we still feel based on the fundamentals and our underlying business that we will see growth moving forward, with regards to that content.","So, now, let\u2019s turn to margin. Margin though is where we made the most progress. It is how you instantiate value. And when you take a look at, again, 90 days ago, nothing\u2019s different. We expected a headwind on product mix, and now we\u2019re dealing with a headwind on currency with regards to our product based businesses. And we\u2019re more than offsetting that with services. We delivered our best year-to-year margin performance in the third quarter, led by services up 160 basis points year-over-year. The tough work we\u2019ve done around shifting to higher value, we\u2019re starting to see the realization in our margin on that. The momentum that we\u2019ve got on our hybrid cloud value proposition, we\u2019re starting to see the scale efficiencies. And the productivity benefits are playing out as we move forward.","So, when you take a look at margin, we see our margin continue to accelerate and approaching our model here in the fourth quarter. And then, you combine that with the work we have done about fundamentally changing the way we operate this Company and our enterprise productivity. I\u2019m talking about things like embedding agile into all of our methodologies, transforming the way we work, embedding automation, AI, becoming a cognitive enterprise. With that enterprise productivity, we see our fourth quarter operating pretax margins expanding significantly as we move forward.","So, the last thing I\u2019ll bring up is tax. And as you know, on tax, in our third quarter our underlying rate was still 16%. We did have a discrete in the third quarter. But, if you look at our fourth quarter, we continue to expect our underlying rate to be 16% plus or minus to 2 points. And I\u2019ll tell you when you take a look at fourth quarter, fourth quarter always has the biggest variability in tax. Go look at the fourth quarter over the last 5 to 10 years. Why is that the case? Because one, it\u2019s our largest transactional quarter. So, the product mix and geographic mix has a major implication on our underlying rate, but also tax events typically happen in the fourth quarter. Tax closures, audit closures, statute explorations, each tends to drive variability overall. But with that said, consistent with what I\u2019ve said all year along, we expect on a full-year basis that our tax rate all-in printed will be a headwind. So, you put all those elements together, we expect the full-year guidance of at least 13.80; and as I said earlier, about $12 billion of free cash flow.","Patricia Murphy","Excellent. Tien-tsin, thanks. Mark, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Next question is from John Roy from UBS. ","John Roy","Thanks so much. Jim, I know obviously the mainframe has done very well. Is there any chance you continue to see slower moderation as you go through or is, are we back to the regular mainframe cycles? Thank you.","Jim Kavanaugh","Thank you, John. I appreciate it, a very good question. And to be honest with you, I haven\u2019t talked enough about mainframe because we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with how we\u2019ve been able to leverage our high-value innovation technology, which really is instantiated, and I would argue one of the most enduring platforms that delivers tremendous value to our clients overall. But with that said, mainframe, we had a good quarter in mainframe. It is the 5th quarter we\u2019ve wrapped, we grew 6% on a successful z14 launch. And again, I\u2019ll remind you, that\u2019s of a 62% growth last year. We had double-digit growth in MIPs, 20%. And by the way, as you get to the back half of the mainframe cycle, we drive margin expansion, and that happened here in the quarter. So, again, best program ever. Against the prior cycle, we are still well in excess of that prior cycle. And I would expect us to continue to be well in excess of that prior cycle here in the fourth quarter. Although, I\u2019ll caution you in a GA [ph] plus 5 or 6 quarter in, we typically do not grow. And again, we\u2019re coming off of 71% growth last year on a strong launch. But, we are very pleased with the platform, the pervasive encryption, value proposition is really resonating. Now, as we get into the back half of the cycle, we drive margin expansion and now we start seeing the rest of the platform stack play out with regards to our maintenance base, our IGF base, our software base that\u2019s on top of it.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, John. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Next question is from David Grossman from Stifel Financials. ","David Grossman","Thank you. Jim, you touched on this briefly in one or two of the questions. But, is there anything you can share beyond the quarterly data points that will help us better understand the growth trajectory of the Cognitive segment going forward? I think, I understand the issues, but they seem somewhat open ended, and really having a hard time changing how to model growth of that segment going forward?","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay. David, thank you for the question. Cognitive, so, from a net perspective, then, I\u2019ll expand. We were impacted by enterprise client buying cycles, as I said in prepared remarks. And also challenges that we\u2019ve talked about last quarter around our horizontal apps, in particular, talent collaboration and marketing and commerce where we\u2019re seeing in some green shoots but again, time to value in that as you shift to SaaS, all you know quite well will play out as we get into 2019.","But, let\u2019s take a moment and really unpack this segment. To your point and part of this, I think is on us. But, there are many different pieces of this segment. So, we have a strong portfolio of high-value areas around domains like security, analytics, blockchain. We\u2019ve got industry verticals like healthcare, our FSS portfolio, and IoT. We\u2019ve got horizontal apps, as I talked about, like talent, collaboration and marketing in commerce. And then we have transaction processing software. So, let me unpack this. But, I\u2019ll remind you, this segment\u2019s high-value, high-margin. And we continue to expand even in third quarter and third quarter year-to-date, we\u2019re expanding our pre-tax margins overall. But let me give you the different dynamics and how they\u2019re playing out, I\u2019ll do it kind of headwind, tailwind.","First in terms of headwind, as you could see through the prepared remarks, we were impacted by TPS and by our horizontal apps. So, let\u2019s talk TPS.","TPS, high value business. Strategically important to our clients. By the way, it encompasses mission-critical systems that run many industries like banking, like airlines, like retail, and there is seasonality to this business. And what you saw play out in third quarter was tied to enterprise client buying cycles that really reflect the time of when they commit to choose to go to the platform. And what we see right now, when you look at the last couple years by the way, a 2-year CGR [ph] kind of within our long-term model expectations. We had a strong growth last year, down 8% this quarter, but when we look at our fourth quarter, we actually see a very strong pipeline because we\u2019re in the sweet spot of what that client buying cycle is here in the fourth quarter. And with that, we expect growth in this part of the portfolio here in the fourth quarter, and that will lead to much better software performance overall.","Around our horizontal apps, again, we talked 90 days ago. What did we say? We were going to strategically invest and we were going to take action, action around revitalizing our portfolio to be more digitally consumable, around investing, around high-value embedding AI and Watson to differentiate, and around actions we were going to take around portfolio simplification, and repositioning our platforms for further innovation. And we\u2019ve made progress, I\u2019ll tell you, in collaboration, as I said in the prepared remarks. We\u2019ve had our biggest release ever of Notes\/Domino Version 10 focused on mobile, supporting JavaScript, Node.js more open than ever, integrated with other platforms like Salesforce, ServiceNow, Watson, Weather, and we expect that to play out as we get into \u201819 with that innovative technology. And in commerce and talent, we\u2019ve been making innovation and investments on embedding AI so we can differentiate our value proposition in the marketplace to win. And I would tell you early signs -- we got some green shoots. Our SaaS signings are growing, and in particular in commerce and in talent, collectively they are growing significant double-digit in the third quarter. So, there\u2019s some good green shoots starting out, but again, that will play out as we get later into 2019 and we can ramp and scale.","And then, finally, I\u2019ll wrap up on our high-value industry verticals and domain areas. We had good growth in security. We have a differentiated value proposition. We\u2019re gaining market share. We\u2019re the industry leader. We expect that to continue. And in health, we had strong growth in health, pervasive across the platforms and we\u2019re scaling. We\u2019re scaling new emerging areas like blockchain, where again, we\u2019ve got 75 active blockchain networks in production, and we\u2019ve got engagements in over 500 clients around global trade, universal payments, around trade finance, around food safety, et cetera. So, we see that part of the portfolio continue to improve. So, when you bring it all together, we expect with a strong pipeline that we would return IBM software back to an expectation of modest growth in the fourth quarter. And we\u2019ll see as we get through fourth quarter, how that momentum will continue in \u201819, and we\u2019ll talk in January.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, David. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please.","Operator","Next question is from Keith Bachman from BMO.","Keith Bachman","Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about Technology Services and Cloud Platforms. A little less focused on Q4 but more focused on the outlook say for CY \u201819. And the simple question is, can it grow? The backdrop to the question is, your backlog is down a little bit, but I think your duration is also down. But, against that context, is Technology Services support declined meaningfully this quarter down 3%? With presumably being a harder mainframe cycle next year, can that grow and enable the whole business unit to grow? So, if you could just talk more broadly about the outlook for Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, with particular bias to CY \u201819? Thank you. ","Jim Kavanaugh","Sure. Thank you very much for the question. I appreciate it. Remember, within this segment, we got multiple components. And I think you want to get to the services aspect of Technology Services and Cloud Platform. But, let me start first with the integration software, which is essential part of our integrated value proposition around our hybrid cloud strategy, which differentiates us in the marketplace. You\u2019ve seen consistent growth over the last couple quarters. And we think given that differentiated value proposition that we\u2019ve got momentum in that space, and we\u2019ve always focused on being open, a secure platform in driving differentiation around multi cloud as we move forward. That integration software is going to be a critical component of that moving forward. So that\u2019s that.","Now, let\u2019s go to our Technology Services or GTS part of the business. Remember, that\u2019s made up of two primary offering segments, one TSS, which has been a drag on us throughout 2018, and that is entirely aligned to what our expectations would have been with a mainframe product launch cycle. Typically, we\u2019ll see that cycle hurt us in the first 5 to 6 quarters and then it comes back and accelerate, especially coupled with our extension into multi-vendor service where we\u2019ve been quite well as we move forward. And the margin dynamics by the way are very strong in that portfolio. So, as we start accelerating growth, we\u2019ll see better operating leverage in that segment as we go forward.","And then finally, you have your core infrastructure service offering, and that ties right back to our overall outsourcing backlog that you quoted and it ties back to our success in moving our enterprise clients to the cloud. And I talked earlier about over 30% of our backlog now sits in cloud in new SI content is approaching 45% overall. Durations, you\u2019re right, have been reduced as we continue to execute. And again, fourth quarter is huge. We expect a good quarter, and that will position 2019 as we execute to deliver the value for our clients.","Patricia Murphy","Okay. Thank you, Keith. Mark, let\u2019s take just one more question.","Operator","Our last question is coming from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. I think you\u2019ve given a mid-single-digit long-term growth target in Cognitive Solutions. Is that still a target and can you hit it in \u201819? And then, how do you feel about the portfolio at this point? Could you be divesting other pieces? Thanks.","Jim Kavanaugh","Yes. Thanks, Joe. I appreciate the question overall. Obviously, we\u2019ll get into 2019 in January. We got a lot of work to do ahead of us. Again, as I said, we\u2019re 16 days into arguably the most important quarter, given the amount of large transactional business that we\u2019ve got to get done. I talked about my answer on Cognitive. We see a good opportunity pipeline ahead of us right now. We believe in the portfolio, the strength of it, the offerings we have to deliver differentiated value to our enterprise clients overall. And we expect, as I stated, IBM software to return to modest growth here in the fourth quarter.","And as we play fourth quarter out, we\u2019ll see, as we get into January where we move forward. You\u2019re right, our model is mid-single-digit growth. We believe we\u2019ve got the right portfolio for that. But, as always, portfolio optimization has been a critical strategy to our overall business model and our financial model. And you\u2019ve seen that play out over time not only on where we invest our capital organically, but where we leverage M&A and how we create value for our clients and for IBM shareholders and also where we divest in areas that either didn\u2019t meet our strategic fit or our financial requirements on where we see growth and more importantly profit pools move forward. So we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that, and we\u2019ll update you in 2019 on where we\u2019re at.","So, with that, let me close up the call. And I like to thank all of you for joining us here today. So, our results through the third quarter reflect the work we\u2019ve been doing collectively across 366,000 IBMers around the world, around how we reallocated capital, how we\u2019ve taken bold actions around where we placed our investments, and how we\u2019ve repositioned our business. And then we\u2019ve done all the work on how we transform the way we operate in our operating model overall. And you see that play out in our margins, in our level of operating leverage and productivity here in the third quarter, which we expect going into fourth quarter and beyond. You see those results, profit margins are strong. You see it in the innovation and differentiation that we\u2019ll bring into the market, especially in areas like hybrid cloud, how we\u2019re winning in digital with our GBS business and around data and AI and security.","So with that said, we\u2019ll talk more about hybrid cloud in particular at the end of this month, when Arvind and Martin Jetter will host the next webcast in our investor webcast series. So, I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us today. And as always, it\u2019s back to work for all of us. Take care.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today\u2019s call.

The prepared remarks will be available in roughly an hour and a replay of this webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I will remind you that certain comments made in this presentation maybe characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC.

You will find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Martin Schroeter.","Martin Schroeter - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Finance and Enterprise Transformation","Thank you for joining us today. As we get into the first quarter results, you will see that our performance reflects the actions we talked about in our last call. We are transitioning to key growth areas and transforming parts of the business. In the quarter, we announced a $1.2 billion investment to globally expand our SoftLayer cloud hubs. We launched BlueMix, our new platform-as-a-service to speed deployment of hybrid clouds. We acquired both Aspera and Cloudant to extend our capabilities in big data and cloud. We are expanding our ecosystem around OpenPOWER. And we created an integrated business unit around Watson and announced $1 billion dollar investment to bring cognitive capabilities to the enterprise.","As we move to these growth areas, we are also taking portfolio actions to divest businesses that no longer fit our strategic profile. In January, we had the initial closing for the divestiture of our customer care BPO business and we announced the sale of our industry standard server business to our partner, Lenovo. This quarter, as expected, we took a substantial charge to align our resources and skills to the demand profile we see. This charge impacts our results this quarter, but it will pay back within the year. So, we got a lot done this quarter. Many of these actions impact our top and bottom line in the short-term, but have long-term benefits.","For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $22.5 billion and operating EPS of $2.54. Our software performance was driven by 5% constant currency growth in key branded middleware. We are continuing to see strong client demand and great results in areas like mobile, cloud and security, where we have been targeting our investments. Our services business was up 2% at constant currency, with growth in both services segments, adjusting for the sale of the customer care business. The growth reflects our expanded cloud offerings, the ramp in some of the large outsourcing contracts we signed last year, and good performance in both consulting and systems integration.","Looking at hardware, as expected, the combination of secular and cyclical challenges continued. Last quarter, I talked about business model challenges specific to power, storage and System x. Let me tell you about some of the actions we have taken. As I mentioned, we are selling our industry standard server business to Lenovo. We are repositioning power and building an ecosystem around OpenPOWER and we have taken actions across power and storage to right-size the business to the market dynamics. Our System z performance in both revenue growth and margin reflects that we are six quarters into the product cycle, though on solid ground secularly.","Looking at the financial metrics for our operating results this quarter IBM\u2019s revenue was down 4% or 1% at constant currency adjusting for the customer care divestiture. That\u2019s a 2 point sequential improvement from our fourth quarter rate. We had constant currency growth in software, services and financing, which was more than offset by a decline in systems and technology. The currency impact to revenue growth was about a point and a half. Currency was also a headwind to our profit performance, reflecting impacts from the yen and the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.","This quarter, we improved gross margin by 90 basis points, driven by services and our ongoing mix to software. The profit dynamics below the gross profit line are impacted by the charge of nearly $900 million for workforce rebalancing, as well as a gain of about $100 million for the sale of our customer care business and so are not representative of our future run-rate. Our pre-tax income was down 19% and net income down 22%. Within net income, our tax rate was worse by 2.7 points year-to-year. The 20% rate in the quarter reflects our view of the annual operating tax rate for 2014.","This quarter, we returned significant value to shareholders, including over $8 billion of gross share repurchases and $1 billion in dividends. We generated free cash flow of $600 million, which was down $1.1 billion year-to-year. In January, we highlighted a substantial cash tax headwind for 2014. This was skewed to first quarter and cash tax payments were up $1.4 billion year-to -year. So without the cash tax increase, our free cash flow was up $300 million.","So now, I will get into the details of the quarter, starting with revenue by geography on a constant currency basis. Americas\u2019 revenue was down 2% year-to-year, consistent with last quarter\u2019s performance. We had strong growth in software, but hardware performance, especially in the U.S. remains challenged. Once again, we had good performance in Latin America, led by Brazil. EMEA was up 1%. The improvement was driven by a return to growth in both Germany and Italy. In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down 6%. Within that, we had another good quarter in Japan. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Japan. Asia-Pacific outside of Japan declined. In total, major markets were down 1% with improvement from last quarter\u2019s performance driven by EMEA.","The growth markets were down 5%. And within the growth markets, we had high single-digit growth in Latin America. But revenue from the Asia-Pacific countries declined at a double-digit rate, with continued weakness in China. Our revenue in China was down 20%, so pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. We expect it will take some time for our business in China to improve, because we view the bulk of the challenges in the growth markets as cyclical, and we still see good opportunity over the long-term, we are continuing to invest in these key markets to capture that opportunity.","Turning to the segment perspective, I have already commented on the revenue drivers and will address those further in the services, software and hardware discussions. Looking at the gross profit, in total, our operating gross margin improved 90 basis points. We expanded margins in both services segments and the relative strength in our software business drove an improving mix. The improvements are mitigated by a 5 point decline in systems and technology. The systems decline is driven by a combination of margin degradation in power and storage and a mix away from higher margin z due to the product cycle. Consistent with these product cycle dynamics, our margin in System z is up year-to-year.","Our total operating expense and other income was up 8% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth, while currency was fairly neutral to expense performance. So, what we have labeled as base expense on the chart, which is total expense less the impact of acquisitions and currency, was up 7 points.","There are a couple of larger items that are impacting this base expense. First, SG&A includes a workforce rebalancing charge of about $870 million, nearly all of which is a year-to-year increase. We expect this to pay back within the year. The workforce rebalancing activity impacted the SG&A base performance by 16 points. So, without the charges in both years, our SG&A base expense would have been better 3 points year-to-year. And second, within other income and expense, you see the gain of nearly $100 million from the sale of our customer care business. We anticipate a gain of a similar amount in the second quarter as we complete the country closings. Adjusting for both of these items, our total base expense would have been better by 4 points rather than worse by 7 points. The 4 point improvement is more indicative of the productivity in the base expense we delivered in the quarter.","I want to comment on another dynamic in our base expense. Within the base, we are continuing to shift our spending. So, for example, the $1.5 billion of R&D spending this quarter reflects the shift of development priorities to where we see future growth. Our recent launch of BlueMix is a great example. We will be investing a $1 billion to deliver unique platform-as-a-service capabilities to connect enterprise data and applications to the cloud. We will talk more about how we are shifting investments in our Investor Briefing in May.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the segments and we\u2019ll start with Services. This quarter, the combined Services segments generated $14 billion in revenue, which was down 2% as reported and modest growth at constant currency. Adjusting for the customer care divestiture, total services were up 2% at constant currency, the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Services pre-tax profit was down 14% and margin declined by 1.9 points. Without the workforce rebalancing charges in both years, profit was up 7% and margin expanded by 1.5 points. Total backlog was $138 billion, which includes a reduction of $3.8 billion for the customer care divestiture. Backlog was up 1% at constant currency when adjusted for the divestiture.","Turning to the two segments, Global Technology Services revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% as reported and down 1% at constant currency, but up 2% at constant currency adjusting for the divestiture. Within GTS, our SoftLayer platform provides a highly differentiated solution for clients looking to deploy across public, private, or hybrid clouds, unified on one platform. The range and scope of production workloads has been expanding, we have good growth in enterprise transformation projects and the introduction of BlueMix has generated broad interest with application developers. This quarter, SoftLayer contributed about a point to GTS\u2019 revenue growth.","As I mentioned earlier, we are spending $1.2 billion to expand our global cloud footprint. We will double our SoftLayer centers, and with 40 cloud datacenters in 15 countries, IBM will have cloud centers in every major geography and key financial center. GTS Outsourcing returned to growth at 1% constant currency adjusted for the divestiture. Growth was driven by the substantial new contracts we brought on during 2013. GTS pretax profit declined 15% in the quarter. This includes a 20 point year-to-year impact from workforce rebalancing charges. GTS pretax profit also includes a gain of about $100 million for the divestiture. Keep in mind that GTS profit is impacted by the divestiture of those operations. In addition, we are continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as mobility, security, and cloud. And these initiatives are gaining traction, but are not yet at scale.","Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.5 billion, flat year-to-year as reported and up 2% at constant currency. Consulting and Systems Integration grew 5% at constant currency, driven by the practices that address the Digital Front Office. We delivered growth across cloud and business analytics and we had good success in projects for clients on systems of engagement and helping clients connect these new front end capabilities to their back end systems and processes. In fact we are ranked number one in Overall Business Consulting and Cloud Professional Services by IDC, and number one in Mobility Consulting Services by Forrester, a good indication of our success in front office transformations. We are continuing to invest strategically and in March we committed $100 million to expand our consulting services capability with 10 new IBM Interactive Labs and 1,000 employees to address client experience design and engagement.","Application Outsourcing was down 8% at constant currency. Our performance reflects increased pricing pressure and client contract renegotiations, as well as a reduction in elective projects. Turning to profit, GBS declined 11% year-to-year. Without the workforce rebalancing charges, profit would have been up double digits, reflecting improved productivity in the base.","Software revenue was up 2% to $5.7 billion. Key branded middleware grew 5% at constant currency. Our enterprise clients continue to rely on IBM\u2019s middleware solutions to transform their infrastructure, and handle their business-critical transactions. We deliver this through a combination of on-premise and SaaS solutions. Our SaaS offerings span our software brands, and this quarter our SaaS revenue grew more than 25% year-to-year.","Looking at our results by brand, WebSphere had another strong quarter, up 12% year-to-year, led by app server and mobile solutions. We continue to have strong growth in MobileFirst, our comprehensive portfolio of mobile software and services that enables our clients to manage, integrate and leverage mobile devices. We have been building capabilities to address this space and we now have over 3,000 mobile experts. Across software and services, IBM\u2019s mobile business doubled from the prior year. Our application server business delivered strong growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. This is an example of our clients utilizing on-premise software to manage the infrastructure workloads driven by mobile, big data and analytics. This is the 13th year in a row that Gartner named IBM the market share leader in application infrastructure and middleware software, and with 30 % market share, we are nearly double the size of our closest competitor.","Information Management software was up 2% at constant currency. Growth was led by distributed database and master data management, which are key elements of our big data and analytics solutions. This quarter we added DataBase-as-a-Service capability with the acquisition of Cloudant. Cloudant extends IBM\u2019s mobile and cloud platforms by enabling developers to easily and quickly create next generation mobile and web applications. Tivoli grew revenue 7%. This quarter we had growth in all three of Tivoli\u2019s product segments, systems management, storage, and security. Security grew double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our results are being driven, in part by incremental requirements for security as clients expand into cloud and mobile computing. Our portfolio of security offerings across IBM grew more than 20% this quarter.","Workforce Solutions declined 4% at constant currency. Strong growth in our SaaS offerings were more than offset by a decline in our on-premise Notes business. We are transforming our business and building up the recurring streams from SaaS. I mentioned earlier that in the first quarter we launched BlueMix, which will make all of our middleware accessible via the cloud. With BlueMix, developers can efficiently build cloud applications with reusable pieces of code tied to their enterprise systems. This enables businesses to leverage the flexibility that cloud applications provide.","Systems and Technology revenue of $2.4 billion was down 23%. This reflects both the product cycle of System z, and the secular challenges in Power, Storage and System x. In January, we entered into a definitive agreement with Lenovo to divest our System x business. And in the first quarter, we continued to reposition offerings in other parts of our hardware business to make them more relevant and we took actions to align our structure to the demand profile we see.","Looking at our results this quarter, System z revenue was down 40%, with MIPS down 19% year-to-year. We are in our sixth quarter of the product cycle, and gross profit margin was up year-to-year, consistent with this point in the cycle. System z is a core franchise which provides mission critical infrastructure for our customers and we continue to invest in the platform. It\u2019s worth noting that earlier this month we celebrated the mainframe\u2019s 50th year. Power revenue declined 21% at constant currency. We are aggressively repositioning this platform with a couple of key initiatives. First, the OpenPOWER consortium makes Power technology available to an open development alliance. This quarter we expanded our OpenPOWER ecosystem. And second, we are expanding our Linux capabilities through our POWER8 launch this year. POWER8 is the first processor built for big data and delivers better cloud economics.","Storage hardware revenue was down 23%. Our Flash solutions contributed growth again this quarter, however we saw substantial weakness in high-end storage. As we have discussed, our focus for STG in 2014 is to stabilize the profit base. The repositioning of the Power platform, the announcement of POWER8, new announcements in storage, and the right-sizing of the business will all contribute as we move through the rest of the year. This, together with the divestiture of System x, will result in a smaller and more profitable hardware business going forward. IBM will remain a leader in high-performance and high-end systems, in storage and in cognitive computing and we will continue to invest in R&D for advanced semiconductor technology.","Turning to cash flow, we generated $600 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which is down $1.1 billion year-to-year. As you can see, our CapEx was up nearly $200 million year-to-year, which includes investment in additional SoftLayer capacity. But the real driver of the year-to-year decline was $1.4 billion increase in tax payments, driven by audit settlement payments and other prior period discrete tax impacts that settled this quarter. Excluding the increased tax payments, free cash flow would have been up $300 million year-to-year.","Looking at the uses of our cash, we spent almost $300 million on acquisitions, acquiring Aspera and Cloudant. We returned $9.2 billion to shareholders, including a $1 billion in dividends and we bought back over 45 million shares for $8.2 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had $6.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. I want to remind you that our free cash flow generation is always skewed to the back end of the year. In fact, if you look over the last 10 years, the average free cash flow generated in the first quarter is less than 5% of our full year total.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.7 billion, which was down $1.4 billion from December. Total debt was $44 billion, which includes $28.3 billion to support our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at seven to one. Our non-financing debt was $15.7 billion and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 55%. Given the skew of free cash flow, we expect our debt-to-cap to be in the 50\u2019s for the next two quarters and roughly flat year-to-year at year end.","So now let me wrap up the discussion on the quarter. There are major shifts in our industry driven by data, cloud, and changes in the way individuals are engaging. This quarter we had good performance in our offerings that address these shifts. Our business analytics revenue was up 6% at constant currency on a large base. Our cloud revenue was up over 50%, with doubling of our cloud as a service business and we had strong growth in mobile and security.","Just as importantly, we continue to take significant actions to move to these growth areas. I talked about some of the targeted investments we are making, including SoftLayer capacity, BlueMix, and Watson. We are focused on allocating our capital efficiently and effectively, which means investing in the right places, as well as moving away from areas that don\u2019t support our shift to higher value. This is an important part of our model. In fact, over the last few years, including the recently announced sale of our industry standard server business, we have divested over $6 billion of revenue. The result is a stronger, more relevant business.","As we look to the balance of 2014, we continue to expect good performance in the key growth areas, though our overall revenue growth will be impacted by the challenges in our hardware business and the customer care divestiture. The currency impact to revenue moderates at current spot rates, but we do expect currency to continue to impact profit. Our margin will reflect the ongoing productivity initiatives and actions to improve our cost base, as well as the relative strength of software. And as always, we reinvest some of the productivity savings to drive our growth areas. I mentioned earlier that our annual effective tax rate for 2014 is 20%, and that\u2019s before any potential discrete tax items. And of course, we will continue to return value to our shareholders.","For the year, we expect to deliver at least $18 of operating earnings per share. This does not include any gain from the sale of our System x business to Lenovo, because of the uncertainty of the timing and the amount, but it will ultimately be included in our operating EPS results and we\u2019ll update you later in the year. Like always, we manage our business and allocate capital for the long-term, and along the way we still expect to deliver at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015.","Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.","Patricia Murphy - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information. And second, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Chris, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we would like to begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein","Yes, thank you Martin. I was hoping that you could confirm that you still expect to meet your free cash flow goal for this year of $16 billion? And secondly, in terms of goal setting, you now have a much lower tax rate for the full year than you anticipated three months ago? I think that\u2019s going to add about $0.70 to EPS that was not anticipated three months ago. You also mentioned there maybe discrete items. So I would like to understand on that a) why the tax rate changed so significantly in three months and secondly, do you have anticipated discrete items over the course of the year and can you share those with us?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Toni. I guess, first on free cash flow as we noted in the prepared remarks, our free cash flow was $600 million in the quarter and down about $1.1 billion year-to-year. Now, as we noted that\u2019s it represents \u2013 the first quarter always represents a fairly small amount. Now, to answer your question, I am going to go through some math in a second, but to answer your question, we still do expect to grow free cash flow year-to-year even though we do have a tax headwind this year.","So, the short answer to your question is yes, we still expect to grow free cash flow. When we adjust \u2013 when we look at our free cash flow on a year-to-year basis and we start to put in a more normal like a model tax rate if you will. So we had as you can see in our data big tax headwind, but in total, we paid about $2.6 billion of cash taxes in the year. So that\u2019s an 80% rate in the quarter. Obviously, that\u2019s not a rate driven by \u2013 our model is not driven by the way the business runs, but it just reflects really the tax audit that we finished in the fourth quarter and the related payments around that. So we had a very high rate in the quarter. Last year, we had a rate of about 30%. And so that $1.4 billion year-to-year, which we identified as driving \u2013 would have driven $300 million year-to-year. The factors on kind of a rate adjusted or model basis, we would have grown faster again. So, I am very comfortable with the free cash flow generation in the business.","I think we are on track to deliver the full year and the cash flow growth. Again, we do have a headwind this year or the bulk of it was in the first quarter. On the tax rate, we were able to improve our expected full year operating rate to 20% with a more favorable mix of geographic income. And our income in intercompany dividend plans resulted in higher usage of foreign tax credits for the year. So, that\u2019s our operating tax rate. The rate, however, as you noted and as we put in the prepared remarks excludes any potential discrete tax impacts, which may occur. And those are as you know generally for non-recurring items. So, two examples that could affect our rate from here: first, we did announce the sale of our x series business, now that hasn\u2019t closed, but that could affect the rate. So the rate could be the higher from the sale of the Lenovo business. At the same time, I am sure you are aware that there are bills being discussed in Washington, tax extender bills which lower the rate further. So, our operating rate of 20% is ultimately going to reflect not only our mix of geographic income and the intercompany dividend plan, which rolls into that operating tax rate, but it\u2019s ultimately going to reflect the discrete.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Toni. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thanks. I just wanted to get a clarification on Toni\u2019s question for the full year guidance. I mean, given the lower tax rate, as Toni mentioned, you are still offering the same EPS guidance. So, without the lower tax rate, it is a net guide down. So if so, could you comment on what exactly has changed above the tax line versus your prior expectations and the expectations you gave us in January?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, sure. So we got a lot done in the first quarter. I mentioned some of those in my prepared remarks, right. And roughly speaking if I were to net it down, we continue to move our investments and our resources to where we see the needs of our enterprise clients and we continue to \u2013 we divested a pretty substantial business in x series that didn\u2019t fit our high-value model. So though we did get a lot done in the quarter, now we also as you would expect look at the trajectory we see coming out of the quarter in order to get the right guidance for the year. And I guess I\u2019d go through it \u2013 I\u2019ll go through it by segment, but first I think it\u2019s important to note that we did not see much improvement in the trajectory in the GMU in the quarter. We were down 5% in the first quarter. We were down 6% in the fourth quarter. So, we are not seeing a trajectory improvement. GBS, as an example, just within the GMU went from high single-digit growth to low single-digit growth. So, we are not seeing the trajectory improve in the GMU as an example.","Now, looking at the segments at a higher level or the complete segment view, in services, when you adjust for the charge we took, because again, we will earn that charge back through the year. When you adjust for that charge, we did expand margin in the first quarter. And we would expect that to continue. So, in services, relative to last year when we grew profit in low single-digits, we are really only canning on kind of mid single-digit growth across those businesses. In software, we continue to see an improving growth rate in software and revenue, which obviously drives profitability. And then in hardware, hardware was down 23% constant currency. And we expect both the cyclical and the secular challenges that we see in that space to continue. So, as we said in the last call, our focus in hardware is really to stabilize that profit base on a year-to-year basis. So, we do see the ships we are making into the growth areas are absolutely the right things to do. We are being successful in growing that part of the business and our 1Q trajectory really reflects I think no real improvement in the GMU.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Bill. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore. You may ask your question.","Rob Cihra - Evercore","Hi, thank you very much. If you look at the hardware losses and with divesting the x86 business, I mean that will help margins, but it won\u2019t necessarily change your cost structure that much. I am wondering, I mean, is it that this business is now just subscale, particularly including the microelectronics business or do you think it\u2019s you are just unfortunately at the bottom of mainframe and power cycles? And when you include the POWER8 and you include the power on Linux, you think you can sort of grow your way out of it or do you think it\u2019s sort of an actual cost structure that\u2019s now just too high for the business? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Yes. I\u2019d say a few things, Rob. First, we \u2013 the mainframe revenue growth, absolutely reflects where we are in the cycle. There is not a secular challenge in mainframe at all. So the mainframe growth rates are absolutely cyclical and when we \u2013 when it\u2019s not a scale when we get to announce the new mainframe that will absolutely turn. In Power, as we have said last time we did have too much structure there was a secular issue in Power particularly at the low end. Now we have said we were going to address that with a few different actions. First, we have said OpenPOWER will be a tremendous benefit to opening up that technology and getting more users on that platform. And we think OpenPOWER over the long-term will have a pretty solid impact and improving that platform. Secondly, we said that we have POWER8 coming. We had this in the prepared remarks and POWER8 is highly relevant to big data workloads relevant to the cloud. And so the secular move from low end power on to industry based servers we will battle back with POWER8 in a much better offering in that space. And then thirdly, we did have too much structure on POWER8 \u2013 I am sorry in Power. And we did manage to get a fair bit of structure out of that business to set a cost base into the Power platform.","In total on STG, let\u2019s go back to the total for a second. There is obviously a GP margin impact in the first quarter, down year-to-year. Some of that is obviously driven by the mainframe cycle and its lack of contribution if you will, lack of mix to the high end. Some of its driven by the cost base, none of the improvements that we have made are really felt in the first quarter. And then it is relative to what\u2019s going to come next in second through fourth it is the lowest transaction volume quarter. So there is a \u2013 there is just a high fixed cost base relative to what we have coming forward in the rest of the year. So I think that the STG business is on a path that we will achieve what we set out to achieve at the beginning of the year which was to stabilize that cost base and the profit base.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Rob. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steve Milunovich - UBS","Yes, thank you. You talked about a couple of financial measures first your share repurchase was very large this quarter, could you talk what you anticipate going forward. I am assuming it was pretty front end loaded but kind of what do you see for the full year. And perhaps related to that you had roughly doubled your non-financed debt over the last year, did you say that you would take that ratio from 55% down to roughly 39% by the end of the year which is where you have ended last year?","Martin Schroeter","Sure Steve. So on share repurchase we did front end load this year\u2019s share repurchases. So we would expect on a full year basis to finish probably a little bit less than where we were last year. So we will continue to return capital to shareholders through the rest of the year, but it will be at a reduced rate relative to the first quarter. And then on a debt to capitalization ratio which you noted was 55%, we will probably run in the 50s in the next couple of quarters, but we will be back down to that where we started the year again by the end of the year.","Patricia Murphy","Okay, thanks Steve. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","Hi, I think investors are focused on this, so I am going to just try clarify it on the free cash flow side, what I am really confused about is that the charge was about $100 million lower than I thought then we have the tax rate impact and the accelerated buyback, which was probably more than I think you guys probably modeled in January. So with all that you could have almost $1 billion taken out of the net income the street had and still guide to $18. And I wanted to know on cash flow you said in the 10-K that you would grow cash flow by a $1 billion year-over-year and we just took out almost $1 billion of the net income versus where we were in January. So I actually don\u2019t understand how we get to the free cash flow numbers previously guided in that, taking it now light if you can just explain it that way that will be really great? Thanks a lot?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, so Ben just to clarify again we said at the beginning of the year we would grow free cash flow by $1 billion and we still feel that we will grow free cash flow by $1 billion given where we started the year. Again the year \u2013 the first quarter of the year is typically quite like in terms of free cash flow. So when we look at now when we look at the rest of the year in terms of free cash flow obviously we have a pretty substantial transactional business that picks up from first to second quarter and also sticks with us in the third and then the fourth is also a pretty substantial fourth quarter transactional flow which drives a lot of free cash flow for the year. So in the first quarter you are seeing a substantial impact for the in-quarter free cash flow numbers simply because of the size of the tax payments, the cash tax payments that we had to make in the first. Those do not replicate for the rest of the year.","In terms of the $18 we have said we would get to at least we said we get to at least $18. We said in the first quarter that we would do about 14% of that and that\u2019s really came in at 14%. Now, we said about $1 billion of restructuring plus or minus $100 million and that\u2019s kind of where we came in. Now, we had fewer shares, so on EPS base the EPS impact was I think right in the middle of where we would have put the original number. And we did get everything done that we wanted to get done in terms of setting the right cost base. So I think that\u2019s fairly constant.","And then when we look at how the rest of the at least $18 rolls out. We had a big charge in our results in the second quarter of last year. And obviously we are not going to recreate that this year, so you are going to see big growth in the second quarter now given that quarterly phenomenon a charge in the first of this year, but none in the second versus the prior we would think that the first half then given that quarterly phenomenon that first half is going to look a lot like last year. And we will probably get about 38% of our full year EPS done by the end of the first half. And then when we look at the second half we will see kind of consistent growth with what need on a full year basis at 10.5. And given the transactional nature and the momentum in some of our businesses, we would say it probably will be a little bit faster in the fourth and in the third.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Ben. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. You may ask your question.","Lou Miscioscia - CLSA","Okay, thank you. Switching over to the services business you talked about it a little bit it seems like GBS did slowed down somewhat maybe consulting system integration was okay with growth rates comparing last quarter and this quarter, but maybe you can go into more detail of that the GBS Outsourcing business?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Los a couple of things GBS 2% growth it is slower quarter-to-quarter. As I mentioned earlier we saw a trajectory in the GMU that was \u2013 that went from high single to low single digit growth as an example. The bulk of the slowdown that we noted in the prepared remarks was in the application outsourcing business which was down year-to-year. Now, we have seen pretty substantial price pressure in that space. And as I noted in my prepared remarks clients are absolutely focused on cost take out projects and less focused and have decreasing volumes, but I would consider to be more elective kind of projects. So we are seeing a shift in focus.","Now underneath that though that\u2019s the revenue side, underneath that we do have a robust delivery platform that allows us to manage even in that environment and so from a GP perspective, gross profit perspective we are comfortable that we can continue to deliver profit even in that environment. So you are right as you saw in the data our GBS did slow quarter-to-quarter. We are not expecting that the environment changes dramatically. We are not counting on it to change dramatically. And we do have a pretty robust as I mentioned a pretty robust delivery platform underneath that. And then in total as you saw even with slower revenue growth our profits still grew 12% when you take out the charge. I think it\u2019s important to take out the charge because we are going to earn it back during the year so that\u2019s more indicative of the kind of growth we can still deliver even on low kind of profit growth we can deliver even on a lower revenue trajectory.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Lou. Can we go to the next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. You may ask your question.","Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott","Hi, I was wondering the growth market seem to be continuing or continuing to be a little bit slow for you. I know that most of your projects there are larger projects and perhaps more profitable than some of your other businesses. How do you plan to make that up in your plans going forward? And any color you can give on a return to steady growth, any of the services business or the aggregate business would be great?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Joe. So, a couple of things, growth markets as you know they were down 5 now. We have been experienced a pretty tough environment in the growth markets for a few quarters now and down 5 as I said earlier is not the kind of trajectory movement we are looking for in that business. Now, when you look at it by region, however, it\u2019s not one that\u2019s not a homogenous answer here. So, in Latin America, we had another good quarter of growth. The Latin America business for us is going really, really well. We are up 8% at constant currency. In the Mideast and in Central Europe, we are about flat. Now, that\u2019s down from growth we have seen before, but about flat is at least hanging in. And our challenge areas have been in China, which was down double-digit and in Asia-Pacific, which was down in the mid single-digit. So, I think there are a blend here of issues. There are cyclical issues. There are secular issues. And they are not consistent between the regions. We have talked in the past about China needing time to return to growth.","We have talked about across the growth markets that we still believe there is a very attractive region for us to invest in. So, we are going to maintain our investments, but there is both a mix of secular and cyclical. Now, we do have very heavier concentration in the growth markets in our STG business than in other parts of the world. And so while the growth markets are certainly impacted by the mainframe cycle like we are in other parts of the world that is not the bulk of the challenge in the GMU even though again STG is a bigger proponent. So, the STG business does \u2013 sorry, the GMU business does get impacted by this secular shift in our power business as an example. There is a very difficult price environment in our industry-standard x series business. And I noted earlier that even our GBS business from quarter-to-quarter slowed down a bit. So, mix of secular and cyclical issues some related to our own hardware issues, others related to what the countries themselves see in terms of economic environments, but not a single answer across the region.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Joe. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Hi, thank you. In addition, the software revenue, the constant currency growth was a little bit weaker than we were thinking. I was wondering if you could talk about what were the forces that impacted that? And more broadly, as you look at exiting the year on a constant currency basis and excluding dispositions, assuming the x86 business goes, do you think IBM can get to a position whereby revenue growth is flat on a constant currency basis? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Keith. A couple of things. So, in software, we grow 2 points segment base as our key branded middleware was up 5. We would expect both of those to accelerate as we go through the year. We still see very good \u2013 we still see very good software opportunity for our solutions and we see very good software opportunity for the platforms that were building in fact within the key branded middleware you probably noted on our software chart that WebSphere grew 12%. That\u2019s pretty healthy double-digit growth with our core software business. So, we do expect that to \u2013 we do expect that to accelerate as we go through the year. Operating systems, particularly power do impact that overall software business. Power operating \u2013 the AIX operating system is sold on as a one-time charge. So, as those hardware sales declined for the reasons we talked about that does impact the overall software segment growth. Now, I don\u2019t think we are relying on. I am not relying on power to be coming back strongly, but one as it becomes a smaller part of the overall revenue stream, it has less of an impact. Then quite frankly, as I mentioned earlier, first quarter is our smallest transactional quarter. And so as we see improved transactional flow in the rest of the year, that impact to the overall software revenue growth will decline.","In terms of overall revenue growth for the year, so I\u2019d say a few things. One, we did have an impact from currency in the first quarter, which was about two points. And we do see that now being flat for the rest of the year. Now, interestingly at least I find it interesting, this is the first time since I think it\u2019s 11 quarters, where we have not had a currency headwind at current rates. So as currency moves at least to neutral for us, we won\u2019t be battling that headwind. And again at current rates, we see that through the rest of the year. Obviously, we don\u2019t know where we might be in 90 days. Customer care and I know you said without the dispositions, customer care was about 1 point in the first quarter, but it will be between 1 and 1.5 points for the rest of the year. So, we will be dealing with that. And then I cannot predict when the x series business, the x series divestiture may occur. And so I don\u2019t know what the overall impact will be to the top line.","Now, when we look though at the rest of the year on more of a segment basis, as I mentioned, software we would expect to improve the growth rate, the hardware declines though will continue. Now, we did center cost base at a rate that we can achieve our goal of stabilizing the profit on a year-to-year business, but we do not expect that and we are not counting on those hardware revenue declines to stop. And then GTS and GBS have services, we don\u2019t see dramatically different rates of growth than as we saw in 1Q, which is fine for our model.","Patricia Murphy","Okay, Keith. Thank you. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Yes. Martin, I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about the mainframe cycle and just remind us how often the mainframe at IBM is refreshed. You talked about it getting a little long in the tooth. It\u2019s a bit of a drag. So how should we think about a refresh? And also power systems, how should we think about that in terms of improving the performance, I mean, you talked about some things I think on the January call, but where are we in improving that performance? Will we see it this year?","Martin Schroeter","Okay. So a couple of things, Brian. I don\u2019t think I said the mainframe was long in the tooth, I cannot imagine those words coming out of my mouth. So I think is as where we would expect six quarters into cycle, this is a very powerful platform for our clients. This drives a lot of value. And I would say we are right in line with where we would expect it to be and there are two, I\u2019d say there are three metrics to look at when we look at where are we in the mainframe cycle. One, we do see \u2013 we do typically see this magnitude of a decline in revenue. So that is absolutely consistent. The other thing we see at this point of the cycle is an improving margin. And we saw that as well in the first quarter that margin continues to improve and should through the rest of the cycle.","And then the other thing we look at is program to program MIPS growth. And we see as we have in prior cycles at this point, we see MIPS growth up about 26% relative to the previous cycle, so very good usage, very good usage of that platform in customer environment. So, the mainframe is as I said exactly where we would expect to be in the cycle. On the power side, power is as we said before power is in a bit of a secular \u2013 as a secular challenger, particularly at the low end. And we said that it OpenPOWER will will certainly help and we have a few new members that we announced in OpenPOWER in the quarter. Now, that is not going to have a profound impact on our power business in the year. So, I don\u2019t think you should be looking at power. And I don\u2019t think we will be saying that power is going to get better in the year, because of OpenPOWER. We have also \u2013 have moved and made that power platform much more relevant in the Linux space, which we have talked about in the past has been a key driver of growth down the line, but again that takes time. You have to get the ISVs on to your platform and we are doing that. We have over 800 ISVs now in that space writing applications for Linux on power.","And then the third thing that\u2019s important from an ecosystem standpoint is to have the most competitive processor in play in the space that you are targeting. And for us, we think POWER8, which was going to target that low end certainly initially is a very powerful processor that is really well-suited to both big data applications and cloud environments. So, those three things will all help. Now, power is not going to turn around right away. In fact, I think 2014 is going to be a difficult year for power, if all you were to do is compare year-to-year revenue growth, but we are absolutely taking the right actions to make that power platform a sustainable and highly attractive economic model for us. We have taken cost out of that base and we are getting the right both technology and ecosystem around it to make sure that it has a long-term future.","Patricia Murphy","Okay. Chris, can we please take one last question?","Operator","The last question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. You may ask your question.","David Grossman - Stifel","Thank you. Martin, sorry to revisit the cash flow question, but I am still confused about the reconciliation of free cash flow growth and your net income growth, it seems that your EPS guide for the year, if my math is right, implies flattish, maybe even down net income this year? And last quarter, I believe you indicated that some combination of operational performance and working capital improvements would help drive that $1 billion increase year-over-year despite the $2 billion headwind from cash taxes. So, I understand the working capital comment. I understand what happened in the first quarter. However, could you elaborate on the contribution from operational improvement given what appears to be flat to down net income in 2014?","Martin Schroeter","Sure. Well, let\u2019s deal with \u2013 let\u2019s look at this I guess from a \u2013 I will try to do it from a pre-tax income flow and then we will talk obviously to that, then we would add the impact of taxes, which we know is a headwind later in the year and then our capital allocation policy and the EPS driven from share purchase. So, we did in the first quarter we had $3.3 billion of pre-tax income. That had a charge in it as we talked about $900 million. So \u2013 and I am going to use kind of big rounded numbers, it will be too hard to do this in million, so I will just billion. So, we have $3.3 billion, we had $900 million charge in that. So, on a base level, that gets us to about $4.2 billion of pre-tax income. Now, we have that for obviously as a starting point for three more quarters and I add back the billion in the charge we took, which we are going to earn back in savings and the $16 billion then goes to $17 billion. So let\u2019s use $17 billion as a base in terms of starting, but starting from the first quarter.","Now, I also noted that the first quarter is our lowest transactional skew. And that what we see as we go through the year is we had about $1 billion in profit growth from transactional business as well as overall volumes in the second through the fourth relative to what we did in the first. That was again was our starting point. So another $3 billion from that transactional growth as we go through the year. So, $17 billion as a base take the base of transactional growth that goes from first to second and carries through fourth, that gets you to 20. And then in the fourth quarter, which is our big transactional quarter, our biggest transactional quarter we see transactional growth and we see this in across the business as we see it in software, especially the heavily transactional business, we see it software and we see it hardware as well, but across the businesses from third to fourth, we had another typically about $3 billion of pre-tax income into the business.","Now, we have different dynamics this year than we did in the fourth quarter of last year. For instance, our hardware business was a much greater drag last year than we would expect it to be this year given the momentum that we expect out of parts of that business, i.e., momentum being described as you know less revenue declines , right. So \u2013 and we see pretty good momentum as I noted in our software business. So, that profit base that PTI profit base of about $23 billion with using 1Q as a starting point, again we have a tax rate headwind in the fourth quarter, but we also have a share repurchase benefit here. So, that $23 billion of profit growth drives our free cash flow for the year. And as I said, we still feel like we are going to grow free cash flow by about $1 billion for the year even with the tax headwind.","Martin Schroeter - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Finance and Enterprise Transformation","So, let me wrap up the call. As I said in the beginning, we did get a lot done this quarter. We did transition more of our business into big data and analytics. We continue to move into the cloud. Our cloud platform is very powerful in the marketplace. Good growth in mobile and security. And we have our Investor Day coming up on May 14 and we are looking forward to sharing with everyone more about the capabilities and the investments we are making to drive those businesses.

Thank you for joining our first quarter earnings presentation.","The prepared remarks will be available in roughly an hour, and a replay of this webcast will be posted to our Investor Relations website by this time tomorrow.","Our presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation charts at the end and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","Let me remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website or from us in Investor Relations.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Loughridge.","Mark Loughridge","Thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we have reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $2.78, which is up 15% year-to-year. And now, 90 days into the year, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15. This is up $0.15 from our previous view of at least $14.85. ","Looking at the results by segment. We continued our strong performance in software as we aggressively address opportunities in analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet. Our software profit was up 12%. ","In services, we expanded margins and increased Total Services profit by 11% as we leverage our productivity initiatives and mix to higher margin offerings in markets. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, which were up 10% at constant currency. And our backlog in growth markets was up 14% at constant currency. ","As expected, our hardware business declined as compared to a very strong growth of 19% in the first quarter of last year. This quarter, we extended our leadership in the UNIX market as we continued our competitive displacements in POWER. ","And just last week, we announced PureSystems, the first new class of computing in over 20 years. This solution leverages IBM's decades-long investment in innovation and radically simplifies enterprise computing. This should start to contribute to the systems performance in the second half of the year.","Turning to profit. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance. We expanded operating gross margin by over a point, led by services. And our operating net margin was up a similar amount, 1.1 points. Within net income, this quarter, we had a couple of unique items that impacted the dynamic between operating pretax income and our tax rate. ","You'll recall that in the first quarter of last year, our workforce rebalancing was essentially offset by one-time investment gains. This quarter, our workforce rebalancing was very similar to last year. But this year, the charge was offset by a one-time tax benefit associated with a tax restructuring in Latin America. Excluding this one-time benefit, we expect our full year annual effective tax rate to still be in the range of 25%.","So a very similar dynamic to last year: with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalance charges, though, this year, the offset is included below the PTI line in tax. So through margin expansion, together with effective use of cash, we delivered operating EPS of $2.78, which was up 15% year-to-year.","Turning to cash flow. We generated almost $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, really strong performance. In addition to returning value to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, our cash flow is enabling the ongoing transformation of the business, acquiring key capabilities and focusing our portfolio on the areas where we can add the most value. ","This quarter, we closed 5 acquisitions for a total of $1.3 billion. The acquisitions increased our capabilities in analytics and cloud and our Smarter Planet initiatives. Now we'll get into the first quarter details starting with revenue by geography, where, as always, I'll discuss the results on a local currency basis.","In the first quarter, revenue at constant currency was very consistent with the fourth quarter and in line with our expectations. Revenue in our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. Within the Americas, performance was led by Canada, which was up 9%. The U.S. was flat, off of last year's strong growth of 7%. Europe, again, grew at 1%, in line with the fourth quarter, so we're seeing some stability there. ","The most consistent performance has come from the U.K. and Spain. With 10% growth, the U.K. has delivered 10 consecutive quarters of growth. And Spain continues to leverage its global relationships, now growing in each of the last 6 quarters. Germany posted modest growth, while France declined.","Our growth markets outpaced the major markets by 10 points of revenue growth. Even with a tough compare, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. And with about 60% of our growth markets business outside the BRICs, altogether, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth markets countries. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets, and we're accelerating our market expansion initiative to continue that success.","Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment. Global Technology Services constant currency revenue growth rate was very consistent with the last few quarters. And Global Business Services growth rate continued to be impacted by weakness in Japan and public sector. Our software business had another great quarter, driven by our offerings in business analytics, Smarter Commerce and storage management. ","In Systems and Technology, last year, we had a very strong first quarter, driven by product cycles in mainframe and POWER. So our growth rate this quarter reflects that difficult compare, though we continued to take share in UNIX.","Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross profit margin improved 1.2 points, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength in software. Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.","Our total operating expense and other income was up 3%. Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed 2 points of the increase. Currency from both translation and hedging dynamics reduced expense growth by 2 points, and our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was up 3 points. I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. ","First, in last year's results, we had investment gains of over $200 million, primarily for the sale of Lenovo shares. This gain effectively funded the $220 million of workforce rebalancing charges in last year's first quarter. This year, we had a one-time tax benefit from a tax restructuring in Latin America, and the tax benefit offset the workforce rebalancing charges, which, again, were about $220 million. So the net effect to net income was negligible, both within the period and year-to-year.","Another expense item I'll comment on is a year-to-year help from our hedging programs. We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. Last year, hedging programs generated losses in the quarter. This year, our hedging was down $125 million year-to-year, as you would expect, given the year-to-year changes in currencies. Of this, about $85 million year-to-year is an expense, most of which is in other income and expense. Now keep in mind that you can't look at hedges in isolation. They mitigate the translation impacts across the P&L.","So now let me go into the segments. The 2 Services segments delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit by 11% and expanded pretax margin by 1.3 points. Backlog was $139 billion, down 2% at actual rates and up 1% at constant currency. We started 2012 with continued momentum in our growth initiatives, margin expansion and strong profit growth. ","Revenue in the growth markets was up double digits at constant currency again this quarter, driven by strong backlog growth. Total growth markets' backlog was up 14% year-to-year at constant currency, reflecting strong demand for both our outsourcing and transactional services in these markets. We also had strong performance in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet offerings.","Moving on to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, up 2% or 3% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% or 3% at constant currency, and we gained share again this quarter. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 3%. We had great performance in the growth markets, up 14% year-to-year at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter, with pretax income up 20% and pretax margin up 2.2 points. ","There were 3 primary drivers of this margin expansion. First, we continued to benefit from efforts to deliver productivity and efficiency within GTS and in conjunction with the enterprise productivity initiatives. Second, we continued to get higher margins in the faster growing growth markets. And finally, GTS has done a tremendous amount of work managing their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Within that portfolio, there's a mix of contracts with different profit characteristics. We have taken a systematic and disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts, and we're seeing the yield from these efforts in our margin.","Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue was $4.6 billion, down 2% or 1% at constant currency. We had modest declines in both Application Outsourcing and consulting and systems integration. I previously mentioned the strong results in business analytics and Smarter Planet, where GBS is leading many of the engagements across IBM. Within GBS, business analytics grew 16% and Smarter Planet grew 18%. These are very important initiatives for IBM. ","From a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to perform well, with double-digit growth again this quarter, while the major markets continued to be weighed down by Japan and by public sector, which declined more sharply this quarter. Japan and public sector, which represent over 1\/3 of total Global Business Services revenue, impacted the overall GBS constant currency growth rate by 6 points. GBS pretax income was also impacted by Japan this quarter. Two large contracts in Japan impacted our profit by almost $60 million. So Japan impacted both our profit growth and revenue growth in GBS this quarter. ","But as you know, we have a good track record of managing a broad portfolio of contracts. This quarter, our Total Services business delivered double-digit profit growth, and we feel confident that we can continue throughout the year.","Software had another strong quarter, with revenue of $5.6 billion, up 5% or 7% at constant currency. Key branded middleware gained share for the 18th straight quarter as our software revenue mixes to the faster-growing branded middleware. This quarter, branded middleware accounted for 62% of our total software, up a point from the same period last year. Gartner once again named IBM the worldwide market share leader in the application infrastructure and middleware segment, an announcement that marks the beginning of the second decade of software leadership for IBM.","Segment pretax income was $1.9 billion, up 12% from last year. Now let me take you through the drivers by brand. WebSphere had another excellent quarter, growing 16% and gaining share for the 14th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had a strong contribution from our application server products and continued momentum in Smarter Commerce. ","In the first quarter, we strengthened our Smarter Commerce integrated portfolio by completing the acquisition of DemandTec, a leader of pricing and promotion optimization solutions and our acquisition of Emptoris, which helps clients reduce procurement costs and risks. ","With 5% growth, Information Management continues to perform well and gain share. Business analytics had a very strong quarter, with double-digit growth in Cognos. Our acceleration in Cognos is driven by the successful integration of our predictive capabilities into recent product launches spanning both business intelligence and financial performance management. ","We continue to expand our global Netezza footprint, with about 2\/3 of our new clients outside of North America. For the quarter, Netezza had a win rate of nearly 80% and head-to-head proof of concepts engagements.","Tivoli software was up 5%, and we held share. Within Tivoli, our storage portfolio was up double digits once again. Security, including Q1 Labs, contributed to our Tivoli growth, as clients turned to IBM for intelligence, integration and expertise across our comprehensive framework of solutions. ","Rational grew 1%, and we gained share. Performance was driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Telelogic. Overall, software had another terrific quarter, with revenue up 7% at constant currency, pretax income up 12% and pretax margins up 1.9 points. With this performance, software was a strong contributor to our growth initiatives.","Systems and Technology revenue of $3.7 billion was down 7% following the very strong growth a year ago. System z revenue declined 25% versus last year's first quarter growth of over 40%. MIPS declined 5% this quarter, and we mixed towards specialty engines. System z gross profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the product cycle. ","POWER was flat and up 1% at constant currency. We had particular strength this quarter in POWER high-performance computing solutions. In POWER, we had over 250 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $200 million of business. Roughly 60% of this business came from HP, with most of the balance from Oracle Sun. This is the 16th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.","System x revenue was flat, and we held share. The System x revenue in the growth markets was up 17% at constant currency. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in these emerging markets. The storage hardware revenue was down 4%. The value continues to shift to software. And this quarter, storage software was up 18%.","Last week, we established a new category of computing with the introduction of PureSystems, a new family of expert integrated systems that leverages decades of IBM's innovation with market-leading software to help clients address the economics and complexity of deploying new IT infrastructure. These revolutionary systems will enable clients to implement and manage new IT capabilities quickly and efficiently. ","Currently, companies spend 70% or more of IT budgets on simple operations and maintenance. PureSystems has the potential to lower total IT costs by more than 50% over 3 years, allowing the business to reinvest these savings towards new projects and innovation. These new expert integrated systems demonstrate the breadth of our innovation and the value we bring to our customers. This will start to contribute to our performance in the second half.","Also, you may have seen we just announced the sale of our retail store solutions business to Toshiba TEC and the creation of a partnership to address the Smarter Commerce opportunity. The financial implications will be outlined on our investor website, including commentary on the expected gain and how we expect to offset it with additional workforce rebalancing activity, primarily outside the United States. But what's really important is the relationship going forward. We're partnering with the world leader in point-of-sale systems. At the same time, we'll continue to build out our Smarter Commerce capabilities and our sweet spot, managing transactions and data and applying analytics. Combined, we'll have the best platform in the market for commerce.","Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. In the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. Even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow. The growth was driven by net income and working capital efficiencies. ","Looking at the uses of our cash. We spent $1.3 billion to acquire 5 companies: Platform Computing, Green Hat, Emptoris, Worklight and DemandTec. These acquisitions add to our capabilities in analytics and cloud and Smarter Planet. ","We returned $3.9 billion to shareholders, including almost $900 million in dividends, and we bought back 15.5 million shares for $3 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had $5.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.3 billion, up $400 million from year-end. Total debt was $32.1 billion, of which $23.6 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $8.5 billion, up from $8 billion at year-end. At these debt levels, non-financing debt-to-cap was 33%, up 1 point from year-end. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility, and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.","So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance, with gross pretax and net margins all up year-to-year. And the lower share count contributed $0.15, fairly consistent with last quarter. ","In fact, when you look at this quarter, it's really very similar to the fourth quarter in terms of the revenue growth, margin expansion and contribution from share repurchase. Even at the segment in geography level, revenue growth was similar to the fourth. Once again, our growth initiatives led the performance. Our growth markets' initiatives is based on expanding into new markets, building out IT infrastructures and leading in targeted industries. We have consistently delivered powerful performance and share gains. This quarter, growth markets revenue was up 9%, with 40 countries delivering double-digit growth at constant currency. ","In business analytics, we have a broad portfolio of analytic solutions to help our clients deal with the massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. Our solutions are built on decades of organic investments, 30 acquisitions since 2005 and more than 9,000 consultants in GBS. This quarter, IBM's business analytics revenue was up 14%.","Cloud provides an efficient and flexible delivery platform that improves the economics of IT. Our smart cloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements. Total cloud revenue doubled over last year, with strong contribution from all areas: private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions. This all comes together in our Smarter Planet solutions. With over 25% growth this quarter, Smarter Planet continues to deliver strong growth driven by our new Smarter City solutions and continued strength in Smarter Commerce offerings. When you look at our offerings in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of the revenue is software, so the success we're having in our growth initiatives is improving our business mix and margin. ","At the same time, we're continuing to invest in R&D, capital and acquisitions in support of these key areas. This investment is enabling us not only to expand existing markets, but actually create new markets and new categories of computing. Last week's announcement of PureSystems was a great example of how we're leveraging our organic research and development to create a game-changing solution for our clients.","So looking at our first quarter performance and all of these factors, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating earnings per share to at least $15. ","Now Patricia and I will take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to remind you of a couple items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. Second, I'd ask you to refrain from multipart questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. ","Operator, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.","A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment on the services business. I look at GBS and on a reported basis, it was down 2%, and I realize its public and Japan contributing very negative growth overall. But do you actually see that getting any better going forward? And in fact, it seems like it's getting marginally worse. And when I look at the outsourcing side, your backlog is now down 5% relative to a year ago. And backlog is a good leading indicator, especially in the outsourcing business. So perhaps you can help us understand how things get better from here. And on an as-reported basis, can GBS grow this year? And with a minus 5% backlog in outsourcing, how does that grow from here for the remainder of the year?","Mark Loughridge","Okay, Toni, a very good question. Let's start from first principles. First of all, when we started the quarter, we told you that the backlog run out we expected would be up 3% year-to-year. So in other words, we're looking at one, at the backlog for total services that it should influence revenue this year. And that backlog should affect about 70% of the revenue, so 70% of that 3% will drive about 2% revenue. And we had indicated that we felt confident that at that level of revenue, we could drive double-digit profit growth for the year. So let's look at it now by the individual units. If you look at GTS, I would argue they're right on track. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 2.6% performance from our GTS team, and I think it's an indication that we do have that model specified correctly. And with that 2.6%, what did they do? They drove 20% profit growth and 2 points of margin improvement. So again, very consistent with our indication. When you look at GBS, actually the mechanics underneath that more on track, but we did get clipped by a couple of contracts that were more challenging for us. I gave you an example of a couple in Japan that impacted our profit by $60 million. Now outside of those 2 contracts, frankly, GBS would have grown their profit on a year-to-year basis. So if you consider those 2 contracts, I would tell you, number one, I think from a financial standpoint, we had the bulk of that behind us. And I don't expect and I don't see contracts in the distribution that will have that kind of impact going forward. Now I can't predict the future, but I do have a pretty good purview to the contracts that we're working on. Secondly, I'll tell you that GBS has, generally, over a longer period of time, been pretty good at managing these challenging contract elements. So I think from my perspective, this is a bit of an anomaly, and GBS should get these 2 contracts behind them in the first and improve their performance to more typical levels as we go into the second quarter. By the way, just as an aside I'd add, that if you look at IBM's revenue growth for services, up 1%, we were shy of 2% by $7 million. That's $7 million on a $15 billion base, so obviously, very close to the 2% level to begin with. I would also reiterate that even in the face of that, we had double-digit profit growth in services for the quarter, and we feel quite confident, given all of the elements that we see in the business equation for Services, we should be driving double-digit profit growth for the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have a question off of the profit comment you just made on services. How should we think about the drivers of pretax margin this year and frankly, beyond this year? You've had some pretty substantial improvements here. So how do we think about how much room you have left, a steady state on pretax services margins, which are certainly approaching record levels on an annualized basis? And frankly, where do you have room left to enact further savings?","Mark Loughridge","Sure. If you look at -- let's look of the drivers underneath the performance in our GTS business, again, profit up 20%, 2 points of margin. How did we achieve that and what do they have as far as sustainability going into the future? So number one, they -- GTS business, and frankly GBS as well, but GTS on a large part is a beneficiary of all the work that we're doing on productivity. Now you remember, at the Investor Day, Linda Sanford defined that and how we were  managing that across those elements. The objective is about $8 billion over the roadmap period. We felt that we did quite well on that base last year. And I'll tell you that our view is that we're right on track in the first quarter. GTS once again benefits from that work. And they are really part and parcel of all the elements that we drive for productivity and spend management. Number 2, with those advanced tools and intellectual property, we're also working on not only the margins in the overall distribution but also the margins in the products that I would call the tail of the distribution, so more challenging contracts. And this year, the GTS team did a great piece of work on those contracts in the low-margin tail in the distribution of thousands of contracts and generated a very meaningful improvement in profitability that we know analytically extends throughout the year. And then lastly, I'll tell you, as we look at the dynamics in that business, our backlog growth for Total Services was up 14% in the growth markets. And in the growth markets, what we're seeing is we have 2 points better margin actually in those deals as well. So those 3 are ongoing dynamics, in my mind, and give us confidence that we have a strong play going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, by guiding to $15-plus from $14.85-plus in effect with the $0.13 of upside versus the street, it would seem like you're backing where the street is for the rest of the year in EPS perhaps by quarter, at least for the 3 quarters of the year. And I was wondering if you agree with that comment. And then otherwise, what would be the upside drivers to those? Would there be cost-cutting? And\/or is there any potential for revenues to start beating expectations as you go throughout the year with this IT environment?","Mark Loughridge","Sure, Ben. Very good point. If you look at the performance in the quarter, EPS up 15%, a very strong performance in our overall net income. Our cash flow -- free cash flow in the business, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. Even if you take into consideration last year's tax payment, that was up $300 million or 16%. So to me, the characteristics of this first quarter are quite strong. And really, it was based on our confidence in characteristics of the quarter and the going-forward equation that encouraged us to take our view of the business up $0.15. Now remember, taking your view of the business, up $0.15 only 90 days into the quarter, I think is a real show of confidence. If you look at the next 3 quarters, we see them up about 10%. And that 10% is the underpinnings to what we view is an at least $15 for the year. Now that 10% across those quarters is reasonably uniform. I do think the third quarter is probably a little tighter for us, but reasonably uniform. And at 10%, given a $15 base of performance on  -- at the least basis for 2012, that's all the trajectory we need to get to $20 by 2015. So to me, I would say that to build base of the business looks like it's in pretty darn good shape and on track to achieve our longer-term objective in 2015. Now to your point, what do we see going forward? There's a couple of dynamics that I would remind you of. Number one -- and maybe a way to look at this is kind of headwinds, tailwinds. So as we look at it going forward for the second quarter or third quarter, we still will see the headwind from currency at about 3 points. We will still, as we go through the second quarter, have the compares challenged for us in the hardware base of business. As well, we will still be wrestling with the issues that we see in Japan in the second quarter. But I think, when we go to the second half, first of all, we have very strong software momentum. Second of all, we have a stable base of profitability and margin performance in our services business. But when you get to the hardware base of business, we have new announcement content that should drive that performance. We should regain revenue growth in the second half based on those new announcement, PureSystems being the first installment. And with that, we should see double-digit profitability in the second half from our hardware base as well. Rolling through all of that is the strength of our operating model and the strength of our growth initiatives. But I think stabilizing Japan in the second half and seeing the new announcement contribution from our hardware base of business, that's going to be a significant dynamic.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Mark, on the PureSystems, could you give us a little better sense about where you think the opportunities set is? And I'll rephrase the question a different way. IT departments have fixed budgets a year, so if they use or buy PureSystems, what are they not going to buy either of your portfolio and or competitor's portfolios?","Mark Loughridge","Yes, I think that's a very good question. When you look at -- let's look at our IT budget within IBM. If we were sitting here in the meeting with the RCIO and Linda Sanford working on it, what do we work on? We work on the percentage of our IT budget that we're able to move into new content and new opportunity, as opposed to just maintaining our existing base of business. That's how we run it, and we've been doing this year after year after year. Why is that relevant in PureSystems? Well, if you look at it, in a typical IT department, you could be spending about 70% of that budget on these kinds of simple operations and maintenance. We think with the PureSystems content, you'll have the opportunity to reduce that over a 3-year period by over 50%. That's an enormous contribution to your productivity. And as we would interpret that, if we were having that meeting today in my conference room, we would drive even more of our spend into new announcement content and new categories of IT spend. So I think it's a very powerful opportunity for us on a financial base. That doesn't even get to the unique capabilities and patterns of expertise that it has, built-in expertise, then the complex of business, integration by design. I mean, this can be up and running in as little as 4 hours. So to us, PureSystems is a first new system in 2 decades to hit this kind of an industry rollout, and we're very confident that it would go into the second half and as a big element of our game plan going into 2015.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I know you talked about Japan. I wonder if we could get the same type of color on what your expectations are for the public sector and Europe in the second half of 2012.","Mark Loughridge","Yes, sure. Let's talk about public sector first. As you could see, within public sector, we had 3% growth. In the quarter, if you break that down, the real strength in public sector was driven by 1, education. And frankly, within education, we have research laboratories as an example. We have a lot of very strong performance on our high-performance computing in our research centers. And secondly, we had real strength in health care and life sciences. They've had their 20th consecutive quarter of growth. So those 2 elements of overall public sector carried the business. On the government base of business, it's still pretty flat. And we see government spending, really globally, more challenged within that base of business. Your second question, really on Europe. Again, I would point out, as I think we've discussed before, Europe is not just a homogenous breakdown of countries. In the U.K., we had 10% growth, U.K. That's the 10th consecutive quarter of growth in the U.K. So it's not as if that's 10% on an easy compare. That's 10% on 2 years of real performance out of the U.K. business. So I think they've done a great job. Spain, we had growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Germany, we had growth for the second consecutive quarter. On the flip side, we're still down in France and down in Italy, but I think on balance, Europe to me, looks pretty stable. So if I would characterize it on a global basis going forward, I look at the major markets, we think they're relatively stable on a forward-looking basis. And the growth markets, I think, are showing some real strength.","Operator","The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mark, you mentioned gain on sale from the point-of-sale business. Can you just give a little more clarity on the potential size and timing of that gain flowing through the P&L? And more importantly since the sale of POS gives you more confidence and flexibility to step up acquisitions and prepare for better top line growth and more mix benefits going into 2013?","Mark Loughridge","Yes. So if you look at the point-of-sale transaction, first of all, let me describe that as really a partnership between IBM and Toshiba TEC. So our objective with this is on a combined basis, to have the best commerce offering on the planet, so this is a real partnership for us. The gain associated with this is in the range of $450 million to $550 million. And we would expect to complete the transaction either late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter. Within that, we're going to maintain, for a 3-year period, a 19.9% equity again as a partner, and we're very confident about this combined offering going forward. Now with that gain, Katy, it gives us the opportunity, 1, to continue the workforce transformation and productivity initiatives we have going. And to your questions on acquisitions, I mean, look at the base free cash flow performance in this business. I mean, $1.9 billion in a first quarter, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. Admittedly, even if you took the tax payment of $300 million, believe me, we have sufficient free cash flow in the evidence of the base business we have today to continue to drive our priorities in our own internal capital, our acquisitions, share repurchase and dividends.","Operator","The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Mark, I'm just going to back to the GBS gross margins. If we add back the $225 million of rebalancing back to the GBS number, and I don't know if that's right but just assume you do, and take the $60 million, I guess my math is coming out that the margins in GBS would be up modestly year-over-year. And I guess, number one, is that math right? And if so, what really drives the GBS numbers up beyond that in the second half of the year?","Mark Loughridge","Well, first of all, all of that does not apply just within GBS, when you look at the workforce rebalancing number, so that's implied across IBM. And so you can't really look at it that way. You can however -- if you look at those 2 contracts that I described that were more challenging in Japan, that $60 million, if you strip that out, it would have grown on a year-to-year basis and obviously, given the  revenue characteristics, that would have been expanding margin. Now on a go-forward basis, we expect them in the second quarter to get a lot of those large challenging contracts, that we had in Japan behind us from a financial perspective, get back to more normal operating conditions. But to your question on the robustness of our margin performance, I would look at the total services base of business. I mean, this was a very powerful aggregate margin performance from services. And again, as I went through those characteristics that were driving the workforce productivity initiatives with Linda Sanford, the systematic approach to deal with low margin content, the higher margins that we're seeing in Total Services, not just GTS but Total Services and our growth markets unit put all those together, we feel quite confident that we will see margin expansion for the year and generate double-digit profit growth for services.","Operator","The next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","You've referenced an 80% win rate on Netezza proof of concepts. Could you provide a bit more color on what you're seeing competitively elsewhere in the software division, as well as some of the dynamics around your contract renegotiations on the GTS side?","Mark Loughridge","Yes, well, software -- first of all, Netezza, since the acquisition, if you look at that combined effect over a longer period of time, what a success that's been, and that offering provides a more integrated approach to deal with our customer buying patterns. It's been a real win for us. In a way, I kind of look at it and say, what a good proof of concept that is not only its application in current deal pools, but as an indicator of the kind of opportunity we have with PureSystems going forward. So I think that's been very, very successful. On the software base of business, they had a great quarter. I mean, if you look at that performance, the profitability in the first quarter, $1.9 billion profit, up 12%; the base software content, up 7%; real double-digit strength in that WebSphere platform. I think we have a very, very competitive offering. So the software base of business is doing very, very well competitively. I think Netezza on that kind of integrated offering, really good proof point for us since the acquisition and again, gives us a lot of confidence on this integrated offering of PureSystems, which is not just hardware but hardware, software and services going forward into the second half.","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I was actually hoping if we could go back just to the acquisitions discussion. And just the  -- you spent sort of, whatever, $1.3 billion year-to-date, but you only spent $1.8 billion, I believe, last year. So as part of your 2015 roadmap, you had, I believe, earmarked, call it, around $20 billion for acquisitions. But you're sort of 25% of your way time-wise there and you only spent about 15% on acquisitions. Does that signal any change in your view? Or is it simply that the reality of the math is never that linear and we should be still thinking about similar acquisitions strategy in something around $20  billion?","Mark Loughridge","Well, my advice to you is that the best indicator to use now is $20 billion for acquisitions through 2015. Now let's just go back to the math and the way we've describe this in the investment meetings that we've had in the last couple of years. As you look at it, if you look at that kind of $4 billion a year run rate -- and by the way, this is not going to be linear because it's dependent on how frothy the market or attractive the market is and how it integrates with our initiatives. But if you look at that, we frankly exited 2010 in a very strong position. Remember, we did well over $6 billion in 2010. So when we went through the model at that time, we said, we frankly have a pretty substantial head start. And if you have considered that we don't expect this to be linear. If you look at those -- that 2-year period of 2010 and 2011, $6 billion and $2 billion . On average, we did about $4 billion. So I think that run rate, on average, is a good indicator. I don't think it's going to be $4 billion every year. This year, $1.3 billion just for the first quarter, I would say we're kind of a hit pace [ph] on a run-rate basis. The second point I would make is given that we did get ahead of the profile in 2010 with a very successful set of acquisitions, 17 in total, that, frankly, put us ahead of the game as we looked at our EPS objective for acquisitions as part of the 2015 roadmap. Remember, we're looking for about $0.90. And given that the head start that we had coming out of 2010, we had to be able to hit that $0.90 at a spend rate of between $10 billion and  $15 billion as opposed to $20 billion. So that provides, I think, opportunity for us. But from my perspective, I'd tell you from what I'm doing, I am viewing this as an opportunity for $20 billion in our treasury and our capital planning processes, believe me, we're reserving about $20 billion over the roadmap.","Operator","The last question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mark, you alluded to applying the funds from the point-of-sale to your workforce rebalancing. So that, combined with the $225 million you took this quarter implies $700 million, $750 million of workforce rebalancing charges. Can you talk about the payback on those efforts, the timing on the execution and when we should start to expect that to flow through?","Mark Loughridge","Yes, sure. If you look at the overall view, I would use the 2010 as kind of a guide here. Now this year, it could be a little richer than that, as you correctly pointed out. On a full year basis, the vast majority is going to be spent outside the U.S. So we'll have slightly longer payback periods. But in the dollars that we spent on workforce rebalancing at the first quarter, we expect that to payback in the year. So I think we have a good plan. We still have a lot of work to do. We just signed a deal. We've got a lot of work to do if you get to closing that deal. But I think I would use that as kind of a guide on the workforce rebalancing charges. ","So let me now just take a few moments to wrap up the call. From my perspective, the first quarter had a similar characteristic to the fourth and was a strong start to the year. We had great margin and profit and cash performance and continued the momentum in all of our growth initiatives. Remember, last quarter, I said that in 2012, we'll take a number of actions that position us to achieve our 2015 roadmap objective, including acquisitions and divestitures, investing in key growth initiatives and rebalancing our workforce to where we see the best opportunities. In the last 90 days, we've made great progress. We have a couple of strategic announcements that demonstrate our focus on higher value and ongoing transformation of our business. Our PureSystems announcement is a result of $2 billion of R&D and leverages decades of technology innovation and know-how. It's a new platform, and we believe it's a game-changing event for our clients. And we announced today a strategic partnership with Toshiba TEC that better positions us to address the important Smarter Commerce opportunity. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15 of operating EPS for the year. That's up almost 12% from last year and puts us on a good track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. So thanks for joining us. And now, as always, back to work."],"11975":["International Business Machines Corp.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.","Now, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM. I\u2019m here today with Martin Schroeter, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our First Quarter Earnings Presentation. The prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours, and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I\u2019ll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM Web site, or from us in Investor Relations. Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to their related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You will find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation, and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Martin Schroeter.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks, Patricia. In the first quarter, we delivered over $18 billion of revenue, operating pretax income of $2.1 billion and operating earnings per share of $2.38, which is up year to year. This is in line with the view we provided back in January and keeps us on track to our full year expectations for earnings per share and free cash flow.","In the first quarter, we continued to deliver strong performance in our strategic imperative with revenue up 13% at constant currency. As is typical, I'll focus on constant currency growth rates throughout. Our Cloud offerings were up 35% this quarter; led by cloud as a service, which was up over 60%; Analytic, the largest of our strategic areas, was up 7%; Mobile was up over 20%; and Security up 10%. We also continued to deliver core capabilities to our clients running mission critical systems and processes. Many of these products provide the foundation of hybrid environments, enabling our clients to get more value from there on premise data and applications. Some of these key franchises are growing like WebSphere, while others are declining as they are in declining markets. But all are high value.","We\u2019ve been very clear that to be successful with enterprise clients and to solve real problems, you need to bring together cognitive solutions on cloud platforms and create industry specific solutions. And so we\u2019ve been focused on building a cognitive and cloud platform, and massing the best industry skills and capabilities, all while maintaining our focus on delivering higher value solutions.","As part of the transformation, we\u2019ve made significant investments and shifted resources. This level of investment and a longer return profile of the cloud of the service businesses are reflected in our margins. Our foundation is now solidly in place. And while the investments will continue, our focus shifts to improving the returns on these investments by building scale and realizing operating efficiencies, keeping us on track to our full year objectives. And so our first quarter results once again reflect the success we\u2019re having in our strategic imperatives. We grew 13% in the quarter, which was compared to our strongest growth quarter last year. Over the last 12 months, our strategic imperatives together generated nearly $34 billion in revenue and now represent 42% of our total revenue.","With over $14.5 billion in cloud revenue over the last 12 months, we\u2019re the global leader in enterprise cloud. We play an important role in running the critical processes of the largest enterprises. And so it's not surprising that each of the 10 largest global banks, nine of the top 10 retailers and eight of the top 10 airlines, are now IBM cloud as-a-service customers.","At our investor briefing last month, we spent the day showing how we\u2019ve transformed IBM into a cognitive solutions and cloud platform Company, and the importance and value of delivering industry specific solution. We talked about the differentiation of our cognitive and cloud platform through specific Watson technologies, through our data first approach and our enterprise strength cloud. We bring all of this together in one-architecture and we\u2019re providing highly differentiated solutions by-industry and scaling these solutions. I am not going to recap all of that here, but what I want to focus on today is some of the progress we made specifically in the first quarter with our solutions, our clients and our partners.","In the quarter, we expanded the reach of Watson and the IBM Cloud through our partnership with Visa, where Watson IoT turns cars, appliances and other connected devices into potential points to sale. Through our alliance with Samsung, where the weather company will be the default weather app on new Samsung devices, powering the weather experience for tens of millions of devices by the end of the year. And through our engagement with H&R Block, where we're now embedded in 10,000 branches, enabling 9 million filers to benefit from the Watson enhanced expertise of H&R Block\u2019s tax professionals.","In the first quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with Salesforce to deliver joint solutions, design to leverage artificial intelligence and enable companies to make smarter, faster decision across sales, service and marketing. We also partnered with Wanda, one of the largest commercial and enterprise groups in Asia to bring public cloud services to China. We're building emerging technologies on the IBM Cloud like Blockchain and Quantum.","In Blockchain, we had over 40 new engagements in the quarter and are working on over 400 more. And as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, the opportunities spend multiple industries. This quarter, we announced we're working with Maerks to use Blockchain to transform the global shipping supply chain; partnered with Northern Trust to launch Blockchain for the private equity market; and are collaborating with the FDA to explore how a Blockchain can benefit public health.","In the first quarter, we also announced the first commercial Quantum system. IBM 2 systems are designed to tackle problems that are beyond the reach of today's computing system. These are just a few of the examples of the reach and scale we're building with cognitive and cloud, and I'll highlight a few more in the segment discussions. But first, I'll walk through our financial metrics for the quarter.","Our revenue for the quarter was $18.2 billion, which is down 2%. Currency was once again a headwind to growth, fairly consistent with the impact in the fourth quarter. At current spot rates that headwind will be more substantial over the next couple of quarters. On a geographic basis, last quarter I talked about the impact the macro and geo-political trends on some countries\u2019 performance. In Europe, much of this continued into the first quarter with the clients in the UK and Germany, in particular, putting pressure on our growth.","Our gross margin performance continues to reflect investments across our business and the mix to as service businesses. I'll talk about additional drivers in the segment discussions. Looking at our expense, pre-tax profit tax rate and cash flow metrics, a year-to-year dynamics, reflect some unique items in last year's first quarter result. A year ago, we had charges that impacted our expense and pre-tax income by nearly $1.5 billion, including a work force rebalancing charge of $1 billion.","In the first quarter of this year, our work force rebalancing charge was about $170 million, so the year-to-year impact of a lower level of workforce rebalancing accounts for 11 point of the 20% reduction in total expense. Our expense also includes a higher level of IP income, reflecting the success we've had in rebuilding our intellectual property income base through IP partnerships. I'll come back to this a little later. And so our operating pre-tax profit of $2.1 billion was up over 50% this quarter.","Our tax rate for the quarter reflect an ongoing operating effective tax rate of just under 15%, in line with the expectation we discussed at the beginning of the year of 15% plus or minus 3 points. We also said, we've had a discreet tax benefit in the first quarter of $400 million to $500 million, and in the quarter, the net benefit was just under $500 million. This is far less than in discreet benefit we had last year of $1.2 billion associated with the Japan tax refund. And so tax was the substantial headwind to our net income and EPS growth in the quarter.","We generated $2.3 billion of operating net income in the quarter and net income margin of 12.4%, which is up 30 basis points. On the bottom line, our operating EPS was up 1% to $2.38. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is down year-to-year by the amount of last year's Japan tax refund. As you know, there is a lot of seasonality in the timing of our cash flows, much more so than in our net income. That\u2019s why it makes sense to look at cash realization on a trailing 12-month basis. Over the last 12 month, our free cash flow was 90% of our GAAP net income.","Looking at our segments, Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 3% year-to-year and pre-tax income was up double digits. Our solution software revenue was up 5% while transaction processing software was down 1%. Within solution software, growth was again led by offerings in analytics, including our Watson related offerings and Security. We saw strong SaaS performance with strong double digit growth again this quarter.","I\u2019ll share more on our progress starting with Analytics. We saw good growth in on premise data basis and data warehousing, which includes DB2, Informix and Netezza. Content and integration offerings were also up this quarter as data ingestion as an important initial step in a cognitive journey. As part of that journey, our Watson platform continues to gain momentum in the marketplace.","The Watson platform, built on the IBM Cloud, underpins our AI strategy and is a fast and easy way to embed cognitive into our clients\u2019 work flows. Two great examples are Salesforce H&R Block. H&R Block went from an idea to fundamentally changing the client engagement experience with Watson, redesigning business processes and deploying a cognitive solution across 10,000 branches in just a matter of months.","Building on the platform, we\u2019ve differentiated with industry expertise across verticals. In Watson Health, we had strong growth, particularly in oncology, government and life sciences, as we move to scaling Watson and healthcare. Out of the top 25 life sciences companies, nearly half are either using or implementing our cognitive offerings. In an environment of increased regulatory pressure, Cognitive helps to expedite the time to bring drugs to market and to monitor them, once in the market.","This quarter, we also introduced new cognitive offerings, such as Watson Imagining Clinical Review and infuse Cognitive into existing offering. For example, in Watson Care Manager, we\u2019re bringing organic and acquired content together to build the cloud based offering that addresses integrated care; we\u2019re then adding cognitive capabilities to extract trends and provide actionable insights. This is the kind of work we can do with our industry specific development skills.","We also had good growth in Watson IoT where we added over 50 new clients to our IoT platform again this quarter. And we\u2019re incorporating new capabilities into the IoT platform, such as the visa payment services mentioned earlier. Clients are collocating for innovation at our Munich center, and the number of developers on our IoT platform had strong double digit growth.","Watson for Financial Services also contributed to growth this quarter. Here, we\u2019re leveraging the skills we acquired through the acquisition of Promontory, the world\u2019s leading regulatory compliance consulting firm, to develop cognitive offerings in areas like regulatory change management. It is a space ideally suited for cognitive because its expertise and domain driven; banks aren\u2019t going to automate core regulatory processes with publicly available data alone. By combining industry experts with cognitive capabilities and levering industry specific client data, we\u2019re building solutions that solve the problems in the industry. Remember, it matters who change your AI platform on what data and who owns the insights. By pulling all of this together, IBM will be well positioned as the leader in the reg tech marketplace.","Security also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven again by areas such as data security and security intelligence. We\u2019ve had strong traction in Watson for Cyber Security since launching in February, and deployed it in over 50 customers globally. And we embedded Cognitive into another offering, MaaS360 Advisor, using machine learning to analyze and protect devices. We complement our software offerings with security services to offer the broadest portfolio in the industry. Together with our security services, we outpace the market.","Turning to transaction processing software, performance improved sequentially driven by Z Systems Middleware and Storage Middleware. While the overall business is declining, we have some areas that are growing, like software-defined-storage; other parts are high value and running mission critical workloads for our clients but the growth profile is stable-to-declining.","Turning to profit, Cognitive Solutions\u2019 gross margin is down, driven by continued investment into strategic areas, including acquisitions and the mix toward SaaS. Roughly a quarter of the Cognitive Solutions business is now services and SaaS offerings, which currently have a different margin profile. Pre-tax income is up for the segment and improving year-to-year even when you adjust for the lower rebalancing charges. This segment has very high PTI margins, which expanded this quarter. So for the Cognitive Solutions segment, we grew revenue and profit in the quarter. We\u2019re embedding Cognitive into more offerings, scaling platforms and building high value vertical solutions.","Global Business Services was down 2%, which is a two point improvement in the trajectory from last quarter. Strategic Imperatives grew double-digits, led by our cloud and mobile practices. Overall, we had modest growth in signings this quarter, driven by our digital offerings. However, the GBS backlog is still declining. As we talked about last quarter, we need the growth from our new offerings to drive consistent signings growth to improve the trajectory of the GBS backlog.","Consulting revenue was down 2%, improving nearly 3 points from last quarter performance. We have good growth in IBM iX, our digital design practice that helps our clients build new customer and employee engagement models around digital. We've built a robust network of 35 design studios around the world where clients co-create with GBS consultants in digital strategy, design and mobile experience.","We\u2019re redesigning our clients\u2019 work flows through integrated solutions and a robust set of enterprise grade mobility applications. This quarter, we announced agreements with BP Castrol, Bell Canada and Santander to name a few. In Consulting, we continue to shift resources to our Cognitive Services, Advanced Analytics and Digital Platform, and away from the more traditional areas, including consulting for on premise enterprise applications and some migration and process reengineering services. Our consulting revenue reflects this shift. Application management was flat year-to-year and has been relatively stable over the last year. We're innovating our clients\u2019 platforms helping them migrate to new cloud architectures increasing their speed and agility, and ultimately, improving their competitiveness.","Turning to profit, we continue to invest in our strategic imperatives and build-out our practices around cognitive, cloud, mobile and digital design. Over the last year, we've added nearly 8,000 resources to these businesses. There also continue to be accounts where we are investing more to deliver on important client commitment. And in parallel, we're streamlining the practice infrastructure and driving efficiencies in our delivery model through new methods, solutions and project management approaches.","As we talked about at our investor briefing, GBS is aligned and focused its capabilities around three growth platforms. The first is digital strategy and iX, where we help clients to imagine what their businesses should look like in the digital world and then execute a roadmap to build and migrate their capabilities to get them there. The second is cognitive process transformation where we help clients adapt their core processes and integrate cognitive technology to gain insight, drive efficiencies and create new business model. The third is cloud application innovation where we modernize our systems by putting in place new cloud centric application architectures tailored to their business and their industry.","With deep industry capabilities we're executing a strategy that is client value led and powered by IBM assets and leading third party platforms. We're refocused our practice model to ensure we're building deep skills in the right areas and increasing our sales and delivery capacity. We're starting to see the benefit of this focus and are expecting improved performance over the course of the year.","Technology services and cloud platforms revenue was down 2%. We continue to have strong double digit growth in our strategic imperatives particularly in cloud which was up over 40% as we build out hybrid cloud environment for our client. As enterprises move to the cloud, they need help in managing the complexity of integrating multiple environments. We're able to move these enterprises to the cloud in a way that leverages their critical data and IT investment. Our cloud as a service revenue for the segment grew over 50% and our annual as-a-Service run rate was $5.7 billion.","Infrastructure services was down 2%, as you know this is a business model where we drive productivity for our clients. We orchestrate disparate systems and optimize IT operations. We help clients manage their hybrid cloud environment which can include multiple cloud platforms, on premise data centers and mobile environment.","When we deliver this productivity to our clients that's less revenue for us, but then we look to create new revenue streams by moving them to new areas, acquiring new scope and bringing on new clients. So our business model has always been to deliver productivity for our clients and then grow by expanding our scope of work and adding new clients to the platform.","While we had some substantial relationships lined up we did not get them closed by quarter end which impacted revenue in the period. The revenue trajectory also reflects that a couple of large clients brought their operations in house due to regulatory and other unique circumstances. These clients remain on IBM platforms and will continue to be a trusted partner.","Turning to technical support services revenue was down 2%. We continue to ship more to our multivendor support services which again grew this quarter. We provide end-to-end support both inside and outside the data center including for example IoT environment. Integration software was down 3%. We grew in our hybrid integration software that connects and integrates applications, data and processes across on premise and cloud environment.","In addition Webster application server grew for the third consecutive quarter, demonstrating the importance of middleware in public, private and hybrid environment. We declined in our on-prem dev ops tools and IP services management software. While some clients prefer to keep this work in house these kinds of workloads continue to shift to cloud, we're seeing this as Blumix, our cloud dev ops platform continues to expand.","Looking at profit, gross profit margin was down while PTI margin for the segment was up 5 points year-to-year. This quarter we had a lower level of work force rebalancing and we recognized savings from productivity actions including last year's transformation actions.","Much of this was reinvested in new and existing skills. We are investing as we move to a Watson based cognitive delivery model. Through this delivery model we're able to manage complex hybrid cloud environment and provide more insights into infrastructure that is always on, available everywhere and of course secure.","In infrastructure services we're constantly managing resources and investment across our portfolio and the combination of the winding down of some contracts, signings delays and some investment ahead of those signings impacted our profit in the quarter. Finally, in TSF, we're shifting more to multi-vendor services and in Integration Software we are mixing more to SaaS, which impacts margins in the near-term.","In summary, when you look at our performance in technology services and cloud platforms, our clients need help moving to the cloud and managing the complexity of their hybrid cloud environment and we continue to see strong growth in cloud and our as-a-Service revenue. Our middleware also continues to be important in this environment. Our business model is one were we're constantly delivering productivity for our clients, this is what make us the market leader. The profit cycle requires that we invest ahead to provide the scale and efficiency that our clients cannot achieved on their own. These dynamics impacted revenue and margin this quarter.","As we sign the contracts that didn\u2019t close in March and yields of operational efficiencies we\u2019re expecting better performance in this business in the second half. Our systems revenue reflects declines in z Systems and Power indicative of where we are in the product cycles, while storage grew after repositioning for flash across our portfolio. Systems gross margin was down year-to-year with declines across z Systems, Power and Storage as we address market shifts and product transition.","In z Systems, the mainframe continues to deliver a high value secure and scalable platform that is critical to our client's needs, addressing both existing and new workload. We added seven new clients in the quarter and 87 since the beginning of this cycle. We also had five major financial services sector win this quarter with existing clients, as well as several blockchain engagements. Our revenue and margin performance for the quarter reflects the fact we have nine quarters into the product cycle and we expect the new mainframe late in the year.","Power decline, which reflects our change over to a growing Linux market, while continuing to serve a high value, but decline in UNIX market. Linux workload again had double-digit growth, outpacing the market. We're the underdog here and we have a 3% share, so there is a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Our expanded Linux offerings, Power on Linux are going to pass the double revenue this year and HANA on Power continues to play an important role in that success, by contrast in UNIX, declines were driven by our midrange in low-end systems.","Power while critical for cloud and cognitive workloads continues to be impacted by shifting our platform from UNIX to Linux, both in revenue and margins. Storage hardware was up 7% this quarter, led by double-digit growth in our all-flash array offering. Flash contributed to our storage revenue growth in both midrange and high-end. In storage, we continue to see the shift in value towards software defined environment, where we continue to lead the market. We again had double-digit revenue growth and software defined storage, which is not reported in our system segment. Storage software now represents more than 40% of our total storage revenue. Storage gross margins are down as hardware continues to be impacted by pricing pressure.","To summarize Systems, our revenue and gross profit performance were driven by expected cycle declines in z Systems and Power mitigated by Storage revenue growth. We continue to expand our footprint and add new capabilities, which address changing workloads. What we\u2019re facing some shifting market dynamics and ongoing product transitions, our portfolio remained uniquely optimized for cognitive and cloud computing.","New systems product introductions later in the year, will drive improved second half performance as compared to the first. I want to spend a minute on our IP income and put our recent performance into context. Our investment and research and development generates a significant amount of intellectual property and we have a number of different ways we monetize it. Keep in mind that the vast majority of our IP is monetized to revenue stream, with only a small portion through IP income.","15 years ago or so much of our IP was associated with our semi-conductor manufacturing and design business. At the time, in addition to licensing some of the IP, we used joint development agreements to deal with the economics of our manufacturing scale. These partners essentially helped that scale issue.","Since then our strategy has changed which resulted in a different mix of business. We continue to have joint development and technology licensing agreements though fewer. Now clients see the value in our IP, but it requires continues innovation to stay in high value spaces. And so more recently we are forming IP partnerships to enable ongoing innovation in our IP while allocating our development resources to where we see the best opportunities for us.","In these partnerships, we license, not sell, our source go to a technology or services partner who assumes the development mission and invests to innovate and build new functionality, enhancing the value of the asset, which reinforces and support to our revenue stream. We retain the ownership of the IP and the revenue streams and pay a royalty to the partner for the development mission. And as the partner sells to their clients they pay a royalty back to IBM from the revenue they receive. The benefits of these IP partnerships to us include the prioritization of our development resources, the continued innovation for our clients based on our high value assets and the creation of additional channels which can expand the clients base.","So to sum it up, our ability to monetize IP, is driven by the amount of IP that we create, which is substantial, not whether a transaction occurs in a particular period. Because our IP is high value and relevant to our clients it is attractive to a broad range of technology and services partners who can build solutions around the core assets. We had three new IP partnership agreements in the first quarter and now 19 over the last two years.","To put that in perspective we have licensed, on a non-exclusive basis about 1% of our software code base and these agreements to date and we are generating more IP every year than we are licensing, so we have a lot of opportunity in this area alone. But as I said earlier, why and how we chose to monetize our IP, for example, whether it to address scale issues or resource optimization, reflects our business strategy and so the opportunities and the model will evolve.","We are now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we generated $1.9 billion of cash from operations excluding our financing receivables and we invested over $800 million in capital expenditures particularly in our Watson and cloud platform areas as well as in support of our services and systems businesses and so our free cash flow was $1.1 billion.","Over the last year our cash utilization rate is 90%. Excluding the benefit of last year's tax refund free cash flow is flat year-to-year, and within that working capital contributed to our cash flow performance driven by strong cash collections. Our first quarter of free cash flow generation is in line with historical trends and we remain on track to deliver a level of free cash flow consistent with last year. Looking at uses of cash in the quarter we returned over $2.6 billion to our shareholders about half through dividends and half through share re-purchases. We bought back over 7 million shares and at the end of the first quarter we had 3.8 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","On the balance sheet we ended the quarter with $10.7 billion in cash and total debt of $42.8 billion. Two thirds of our debt was in support of our financing business which now includes the increase in leverage related to our client and commercial financing business IBM credit. The leverage in this business is now 9:2, which as I described in January translates to an increase of just over 600 million in global financing debt. ","The credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 52% investment grade, which is flat versus December and a point better than year ago. More information on our financing business is provided in the supplemental charts in the back up. Our non-financing debt was 14.3 billion with a debt to cap ratio of 48%, which is a point lower than December. Debt to cap is down 14 points year-to-year as you will recall that we frontend loaded our debt issuances this last year. Our balance sheet continues to have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long-term.","Let me wrap up by talking about how we see the balance of the year, starting with the progression on the first half and then drivers of our second half performance. As you know we typically see a profit improvement from first to second quarter. Last year the sequential improvement was significant because of the charges in the first quarter. Adjusting for these outside charges, we increased our operating pretax profit by an average of 800 million from first to second over the last couple of years. We see a similar level of sequential improvement this year, which means we would finish the first half at about 37% of our full year at least operating EPS expectation.","Now every year is different and we when you look at that 37% attainment compared to history, you will see it's a few points below the last few years. So I'll spend a minute on why this year the first to second half dynamics will be different, and why we remained comfortable with our full year expectation. To do that I'll give you a couple of examples of things that we know and things that we expect. We know that will have new system product later in the year and this will drive a significant improvement in gross profit from first half to second half. Related to that in the second half we'll have the investment ramp behind us, so we'll also benefit from lower systems development spending in the second half relative to the first. ","We also know that we'll wrap on last year's larger acquisitions, there will be less dilutive to profit in the second half as we continue to ramp revenue and realize some operational synergies. Then there are a couple of things that we expect, particularly in our services businesses. We expect that global technology services will sign a few of the larger contracts that didn\u2019t close in the first quarter and that together with the cost savings and the yield on some of the investments we've been making will improve the first to second half profit dynamics. In global business services our trajectory is starting to improve and we expect this to continue throughout the year, we also expect currency to be a headwind and we put a view of that into the supplemental slides.","The translation of our pretax profit to net income will depend on the mix of business and the operational tax rate assumption continues to be 15% plus or minus 3 points. As always this is without discreet items. To put all that together, and we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for 2017 and free cash flow net consistent with last year. ","And with that we'll take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So let\u2019s please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed with your question.","Wamsi Mohan","Martin, as we look at this quarter on a year-on-year basis we saw PTI dollar improvement of close to about $700 million, should we expect any more PTI improvement over the course of this year, given that the discrete tax benefit was 500 million, you can pretty much guess your guidance from those two elements, not sure if there is more discreet items yet to come, but conceptually is there are more PTI benefit yet to come or have you seen the PTI benefit already flow through? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Yes, thanks Wamsi. The first thing I\u2019ll say is I apologies for my voice, so if I sound kind of crocking -- I got a bit of a cold here. But hopefully you can understand. So with regard to what we see from here out, as you noted we got about 700 in our guidance on a full year basis, we did about 700 in the first, the thing I would add is that we don\u2019t know what that mix is going to be, it's 15 plus or minus two points. So if you were to take that range, we either have another couple hundred to go if it comes in from a high tax area or we're already over solved by few hundred. So either way, you are in about that right range.","Now we have a lot of work underway to drive productivity in our services business, we talked a bit about that in the prepared remarks, we still expect to get the growth out of the acquisitions that we spend some money on. So there is a lot more obviously within the dynamics of our business from here to the end of the year. But if you just wanted to look at those two line items, then yes either we have a little bit left to go, if it comes in at a higher tax mix, so we've over solved already, but yes that\u2019s the -- what the guidance implied.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Katy Huberty","At the Analyst Day, you talked about as you scale the cloud business, as you scale the cognitive initiative that we should start to expect margin stability and even inflection. You also talked -- essentially guided to GBS margin improvement for the full year. And when you step back and look at gross margins which is more of the clean read on your profitability not into the insight work pressure [ph] balancing and IP income, those declines accelerated this quarter in all of those businesses. So the question is, do you still expect that we can start to see stability and even inflection in any of those businesses this year or is that further out?","Martin Schroeter","So couple of things, when we look at -- we pretty much look at every year, one quarter is the low point in GP margin that always true. And then we build sequentially from there, I think what I would expect this year in that build sequentially, I do expect as we said in prepared remarks, I do expect the services units to start to drive sequential improvement in that business.","Now some have longer to go, more progress to make if you will, as we noted GBS with the declining revenue and the impact of margins, we also -- we believe that a business that can grow, pass the growth is what we described, which is consistent signings growth, we will get the backlog growth which will drive revenue growth. So all of that we still think we have ahead of us, we did get signing growth in the first quarter, it's 2%, but we got signing growth and so we will continue to build that business back.","And then in GBS specifically, the margins in the new strategic imperative work, the margins in the areas that that business is moving to remain better than the margins in the places they're coming from. So yes, we have to realize the productivity at the overall model level, but we are seeing margin opportunities in those new areas in GBS and we would expect to continue to make progress, but again in total the margin picture on a sequential basis as we always do will grow from first to second, third and fourth as well, and depending on the mix of business that growth that we typically see from first to fourth, could be three, four points higher and it's been as high as 10 points in some years. We'll be within that range some place by the time we get out of the fourth, but the first quarter is always the low point in the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steve Milunovich","Martin, you talked about the investments that the company has been making the last few years and previously suggested a little more flexibility this year, could you talk about in dollars, are the investments that you're making into the strategic imperatives flattening out? Should we look for less growth year-over-year in those investments, are they actually becoming flat and is there a point in the next couple of years where we could even see them decline year-over-year to help your margins?","Martin Schroeter","So, couple of things, one, when we said we would expect -- when the tip of the bow of the ship gets through the wave, that was a year-to-year statement, and so now with those acquisitions for instance in our run rate, the dollar level is at an elevated amount and so the year-on-year impact is diminished if you will. Now, all of those businesses need continued investment and for IBM, what it's always been about for us is shift as much as it is adding to that pie. So I think the adding to the pie now is behind us, if you will, and the shift will continue. So we'll continue to invest heavily in the strategic imperative, but it won't represent the same growth that what we've -- as what we've seen in the past now that they're in our model.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Toni Sacconaghi","I just wanted to confirm and clarify how you're getting to your full year '13 AB [ph] target. So for Q2, I think given that you expect 37% of EPS in the first half that would point to EPS of about $2.73, I think consensus is $3.17. So well below Street expectations. Which means that you have to be well above Street expectation for the second half. I'm wondering if you can also clarify what you're assuming on IP licensing for the year. It was up dramatically in the first quarter, I think you said it would be about flat year-over-year. So that implies the rest of the year IP licensing is going to be declining and therefore a year-over-year headwind, is that the right way we should think about it, and if you're IP licensing or your discrete tax benefits are significantly higher than you think today, will you be adjusting your guidance accordingly?","Martin Schroeter","So, a couple of things Toni, one we're not adjusting our guidance, we've reaffirmed that we see an at least $13.80 number for the year, and we also see free cash flow flat, roughly flat as we said. So same guidance as we talked about in January and quite frankly from my perspective the quarter played out you know pretty much as we expected, other than we thought we had a couple of more signings relationships in services that we could have gotten done, but by and large the quarter played out as we expected and we maintained our guidance.","In the prepared remarks Tony, we started to put together some of the things that we know and some of the things that we expect and I think that framework is kind of how I think about it. Now as you know we have a lot of scenarios around guidance and what might happen, but let's go through a couple of the things that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. First, you know the systems product announcements have kind of a double impact.","One you have to ramp investment ahead of the revenue in order to get that system ready. That's the period we're in now and we'll be in it through the first half. Once we get the systems announced and out the door then we start getting revenue and you get the double benefit you get GP dollars and you get lower spending in order to because you don't have to ramp any more. So that has a pretty profound impact on the first to second half.","We also talked about getting the acquisitions further embedded. Now we do a lot of acquisitions, there's obviously opportunities to drive investment in those but we also have a lot of opportunity to realize efficiencies in how we run. So we see an improvement from first to second half -- continued improvement first to second half as we ramp those new solutions around those acquisitions as well as get some synergies from the way we run the play.","In our services business as we mentioned we see an improvement as we go through the year, both in the revenue trajectory and in the margin profile quite frankly. We got a lot of work to drive productivity in our services business both in GTS and GBS and it sits kind of across that delivery platform we think there is a lot of opportunity to drive improvement as we get into the second half and then IP income, similar to how we described it in January, we said we have a bunch of scenarios around IP income, we see enough opportunity to be flat year-to-year, but our guidance didn't rely on it year to year.","So to your point, if we're flat versus excuse me -- here's where my voice starts to go Tony, I apologize. If we're flat relative to -- for the full year and we're up a bit in the first quarter, does that imply down? Yes that's kind of how we expected the year to play out. And in fact we said that, based on what you describe, it could be a bigger headwind the what you described, because not a lot of our scenarios have flat, some of them -- we had a -- like I said quite a good year in the second half -- quite a good second half of last year in IP income and so that could be down a bit, but again we've got a lot of scenario.","So the year comes together I think because we do have dramatically different profile in the second versus the first. We included the framing, if you will, of where we finish the first half because not every year plays out the same way and I think it\u2019s important to understand the dynamics. But no change to our guidance and we still see the year playing out as we did in the first quarter.","Operator","Thank you, next question is from Ingin Wang with JPMorgan, your line is open.","Ingin Wang","Just one on the tech services side, it sounds like some delays in deals closing. Is that a macro-cyclical issue in terms of maybe a slow start to the year for some of your enterprise clients? What's the visibility into these deals closing in GPS and also the improvement in GBS that you just mentioned, is that also required improvement in macro environment, or is there something else that's driving that [Multiple Speakers]?","Martin Schroeter","Sure. So thanks, Ingin. These no macro, so I\u2019ll talk about GBS specifically. And quite well, the nature of the work we do with our clients, we are running the hearts and lungs of our client's businesses. And so obviously, when you run hearts and lungs, you\u2019re not running toward 90-day schedule. There is nobody by the way that\u2019s in the room with you other than the client, nobody has the breadth of the capability that we have.","So our clients move at a pace that reflect the important of the work we do. And at the same time add into that the steps required for instance regulatory approval, we\u2019ve got a lot of [technical difficulty] customers, there are a lot of customers in regulated industry. And so the signings delays were not at all macro driven, this is our -- these are deep, deep partnerships with our clients that require careful planning, careful execution and they\u2019re not going to move on a 90-day cycle.","In GBS, again, I don\u2019t think, we need an improved macro environment for GBS. In fact, one could argue that GBS will do better when clients are more focused on how to move to the future and more focused on or put under more pressure, if you will. The transformation that GBS is going through is driven by their ability to rescale in the new areas and we put -- we've poured a lot of people into GBS focused on these new practices that we have. The results that we see as the teams move into those new practices are very positive.","So no, this is not at all macro, on GBS it is again, because the relationships with these clients are so vital to how their organizations run and are never going to move on a 90-day calendar. And GBS I think is demonstrating now that as it moves into the future, it can do even better.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Jim Schneider","Just wanted to follow-up on the earlier services question and maybe ask about the commentary you made about couple of clients, order clients taking work in-house. Is that a commentary on the infrastructure and cloud piece of the business specifically, or is that a broader comment on the application services and like? And can we maybe just kind of talk about what you seeing terms of pricing pressure in the market, because you previously called that out several times, but didn\u2019t this time? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Yes, sure. So there is -- I wouldn\u2019t say there is anything macro. In the two instances that we mentioned about people bringing -- companies bringing this in-house, very unique circumstances. And I think when I describe it, which I will, I think you will agree that they are sort of unique. So for instance, we have a client in Germany, it was renewed -- it was a five-year deal renewed for another five years and there is a rule, there is a law in Germany that this particular type of client cannot renew the same contract twice, just can't. And so they had to bring it back in-house due to regulatory reason.","We will still -- they took the people, by the way, they were all in structure that allowed them to take the people back. They still run their IBM mainframes. So we\u2019re still partners with them on the infrastructure that they run. But that\u2019s a highly unique, I am not making on macro statement. And in the other case, again highly unique to the client situation, they had a plan in their industry to split two businesses and so they were heading down the path of having two businesses with two infrastructures. We have them by the way, both of them and then the market if you will, they made a judgment based on the market that they were just going to take one of those businesses and sort of wind it down. So they just had no need, if you will, to have a big infrastructure around that particular business. So very unique, not at all what I would call a macro.","And then on pricing pressure, the nature of these relationships, again, as I mentioned earlier, these are substantial relationships that are running very core of what these companies need. And if I had to -- I guess these are complex, but if I had to simplify it, they're asking us to move them into -- in the future to move into cloud, to give them the agility and the security and the mobility that they see their competitors have. So there is -- there are not -- there is nobody in the room with us when we go in for those calls. And if they want to purse that path and as I think there is -- that suits their business model, then they're talking to us and we'll make those deals happen, but it's not a macro statement, its very much about our ability to deliver the future to them and whether or not that suits the way they're thinking their business at that particular time.","Operator","Thank you, next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC. You may ask your question. ","Amit Daryanani","I guess Martin, I just want to go back to the gross margin discussion and perhaps more at the corporate level, I realize that these margins will improve from Q1 to Q4. At what point I guess do you see gross margin starting to stabilize, the year-over-year declines start to abate for the company? And if you were to think about the cost saving benefits, what cost saving benefits that you have expected for 2017?","Martin Schroeter","Sure Amit, a couple of things. One, we are seeing the savings if you will of what we were able to start to transform last year and the actions we took. Now remember at the time we talked about Q1 '16. So a year ago we talked about how there was some -- some measure of that was to reduce capacity and a lot of that, by the way, that capacity reduction was to get our teams back together into collocated offices, where they could operate in more agile environment and it was to reduce the number of sites, if you will, which we had people and couldn\u2019t collaborate properly.","So there were some measure with the reduced capacity, but the bulk of what we wanted to do is to revitalize skills, as we always do. We're always revitalizing our skills. So we see the benefit of that in the new skill mix that we have, we see the benefit of that for instance in GBS growing signings in the first quarter.","Now there is productivity that we see in the SG&A line, because while we are investing more for development our SG&A spending is down. And that was again not only the reduced capacity, but it's us being more efficient at how we operate. From a gross profit margin perspective, we are a high -- we have a high value model as you know. And so one of the things we are always looking at is, are the places we are going to still more valuable and higher margin than the places we are coming from and the strategic imperatives as we've talked about it in the past have a higher margin profile than the core if you will.","That shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, I think that\u2019s why our investors expect us to invest into those new areas, as opposed to just going to chase some lower margin content. And we still see that now, it's been true since we have been talking about the strategic imperatives and it remains true that the margins in those areas continue to be higher. So I think that I still view the opportunity for us and gross margin is going to look -- gets better because again the places we're moving to is better than what we're coming from.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. You may ask your question. ","David Grossman ","Martin, if you look over the next 12 to 24 months I think the strategic imperative were in the low 40, the percentage of revenue. What are the main variables that dictate whether the imperative grow to over 50% of revenue and again to more than compensate for the decline in the legacy core.","Martin Schroeter","Sure David, so few things first and we talked about this a little bit in the prepared remarks and I think it's important, the legacy core is a business that we're confidently reinventing, it's not something that we are under investing, it's not something that we don\u2019t like, we really like this business, it is very high value and some of that content sure fits in declining market. So it has declining opportunity, but that\u2019s high value. And then, as we talked about in that prepared remarks, some of those businesses like Webster application server is growing, it's in a growing market and we grow.","So the core is -- and I know you didn\u2019t say it this way, but the core is -- I just want to make sure everyone's clear, is made up of lot of different things. And included in that core, if you will, is -- we've got part of our power business, we got some of our mainframe business, we're just not in the time of the cycle for the core part -- for those parts of the core to grow. We will get to that part of the cycle when it grows. So then from the high-level math you did, we said that strategic imperatives would be 40%, we're obviously there, but 40 billion at least by 2018 and we're still on track to get there, in fact we're a little bit ahead of track.","Now when those two lines cross, I don\u2019t know, I think that the investment community has been keen for us to stay on that solid double digit growth path and the strategic imperatives, there have been concerns every quarter about whether or not we're flowing down, but we just grew 13% on our toughest compare of the year last year because we did '17 in the first. So I think that the cross over point, I think is a mathematical exercise, what I'm looking that is, are the strategic imperatives and the growth we're getting out of those continuing to put us and keep us on the track to that 40 billion.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Keith Bachman with BMO. Your line is open.","Keith Bachman","I wanted to ask you, is pruning still on the table? What I mean by that is, if I think about the revenue growth the core actually decelerated this core compared to say the last three quarters. And if I look at some of the areas like GBS you have application maintenance that\u2019s combined with BPO that\u2019s over a 50% of the business and well under company profit levels. And I'm just trying to understand specifically focused on GBS, is how you improve revenue growth, but should you improve revenue growth or is there more pruning that you can do as it relates to the total IBM portfolio, but particularly within GBS.","Martin Schroeter","Sure Keith, so I think, I look at our portfolio and as you know we talked about this and we have been pretty clear that, we look at our portfolio through the eyes of value. And I think the portfolio, not solely through the eyes of growth, value and -- no value or a limited value without growth is obvious that we wouldn\u2019t -- we would have a -- we would be thinking about whether or not that fits. But the portfolio we have today, I view as high value.","The AMS business as you pointed out, it's a high value business. Now the revenue is pretty stable, but it serves a really important need with our client base, it allows us based on how we do it with our industry focus, it allows us to drive value for our client. So I think of pruning is something you do when you don\u2019t see an opportunity for differentiation, when you don\u2019t see a longer term opportunity for value, and I look at the portfolio now and I think there is -- I think we have a very high value portfolio and I think that GBS, large GBS, all of it plays a critical rolled in that, I don\u2019t see a pruning opportunity here.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","I think there is no question about the success in the strategic imperatives, how you are ramping those. The biggest question on many of the follow up calls, well maybe I'll give it one more shot, [indiscernible], the investment you are putting forth in the degradation to gross margins, when are we going to see them stabilized or do you have line of sight to that? It just seems like when you give up an invest, at some point, you want to progress the fruits of those efforts and it went out time and time again, so I\u2019ll ask kind of one more time, do you see stabilization, and if so, when?","Martin Schroeter","Yes, sure Jim. So again -- and you know this is actually, it's an interesting question because -- it's an interesting timing of this question because I want to make sure that everybody understands that as we head now into the rest of this year and one of our focus item as it's always has been, but now the timing is right, is to get the returns for our investments. It's something if you were to pull 100 IBM executives, it's something that they would all say is, now it's time to get the returns.","So we have driven very heavy investments that has impacted our margins. But the investment is not the only opportunity, only lever we have to improve margins, we have a lot of opportunity in our services business and in our delivery model and how we drive margin. So yes it is time for us to get the returns we have invested quite heavily. The strategy is right, we hear it from our clients every day, the places that we are moving them to and the work we do in the core is highly, highly valuable to them. So I think now, the short hand in that is yes, now it's time.","And with that I\u2019ll wrap up the call by saying, we have been making significant investments and now we've added, by the way, a ton of capabilities to the IBM company. We started new businesses, we made new markets, we've changed, as we always do, industries and professions and we'll continue to do that. But now it's with the business positioned very well for the long term, in terms of capabilities. Always opportunity to add a little bit here or there, but with the business positioned well for the long term, now it is time to focus on improving the returns on those investments. So thank you very much for joining the call today.","Patricia Murphy","And Sam, I\u2019ll turn it back to you to close the call please.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today's call.

Ma'am, you may begin.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM. I'm here with Mark Loughridge, IBM's Senior Vice President and CFO, Finance and Enterprise Transformation.","Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings presentation. The prepared remarks will be available in roughly an hour, and a replay of this webcast will be posted to our Investor Relations website by this time tomorrow.","Our presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to their related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You will find reconciliation charts at the end, and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","Let me remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from us in Investor Relations.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark Loughridge.","Mark Loughridge","In the third quarter, we reported $23.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross and net operating margins and increased operating earnings per share by 10% to $3.99. For the year, we\u2019re maintaining our full year 2013 expectation for operating EPS of at least $16.25 on an all in basis, or $16.90 excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge.","Looking at the results by business, our total services business returned to modest revenue growth at constant currency, led by 5% growth in GBS. Our backlog was up 2% or 6% at constant currency with another strong performance from GBS.","Software delivered mid-single digit growth at constant currency in key branded middleware. In hardware, growth in System z mainframe was more than offset by declines in Power Systems apps and storage. Two-thirds of the overall hardware decline was driven by the growth market.","Across IBM we delivered strong performance in our growth initiatives, that addressed key market trends, smarter planet, business analytics and cloud, leveraging both organic investments and acquisitions. Our Smarter Planet solutions are up more than 20% through September and Business Analytics is up 8% year-to-date.","In cloud, we closed the acquisition of SoftLayer in July which significantly improves our capabilities in public and hybrid cloud. For the first time we delivered more than a $1 billion of cloud revenue in a quarter of which $460 million is delivered as a cloud service. To the first three quarters our cloud revenue was up more than 70% year-to-year.","From a geographic perspective our challenge this quarter was in growth markets, where revenue was down 9% or 5% at constant currency. Our performance in growth markets has historically outpaced major markets by 8 to 10 points. But this quarter for the first time the growth markets trailed the majors.","I will get into this specifics and action later in the call. For the quarter, IBM\u2019s revenue was down 4% or down about 1.5% at constant currency. So the currency impact to revenue was about 2.5 points. Currency also impacted our profit performance as we\u2019ve discussed in the past a weakening Yen drops largely to the bottom line. This quarter we improved gross and net margins. Our operating gross margin expanded by one point driven by an improvement in services margins and the relative strength of software and mainframe.","The net margin improvement also reflects savings from the second quarter workforce rebalancing activity, tough minded spending actions at a better tax rate. There are three drivers of the lower tax rate. First, discrete benefits associated with recent foreign tax audits. Second, a reduction in the ongoing effective tax rate which we now expect to be in the range of 23% for the year and through 2014.","And third, last year\u2019s tax included a higher rate on the gain from the divestiture of our RSS business. Bottom line we delivered operating EPS of $3.99 which was up 10% year-to-year. Now I will get into the third quarter details starting with revenue by geography. Where I\u2019ll discuss the results on a constant currency basis, I will start with a few comments by major geography and then provide a perspective on the major versus growth markets.","Americas revenue was flat year-to-year, which is up three point improvement from last quarter\u2019s rate; the improvement came equally from the U.S. and Canada and once again, we had strong performance in Latin America.","Our EMEA revenue was down 2%, fairly consistent with last quarter. Western Europe in particular showed some stability while Eastern Europe led by Russia had double-digit declines.","In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down 4%; within that, Japan\u2019s revenue was up 5% with good performance across hardware, software, and services. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth with good execution by the team in Japan. Consequently the AP decline was driven by the growth market countries.","So now let me comment on the major markets versus growth markets globally. Major markets year-to-year performance improved by almost two points from last quarter, in fact, this is the best major market performance since the first quarter of 2012.","Our challenge this quarter was in the growth markets, which were down 5%. Though we continue to gain share and deliver strong growth in Latin America as well as Middle East and Africa, we fell short of our objectives and the market in other regions.","Our performance at growth markets was driven about half by execution and half by a pause as China moves to the process to develop its new economic plans. China was down 22%. We experienced a slowdown in demand across the board, but most significantly in hardware, which was down about 40% and which makes up about 40% of our business in China.","While we had some execution problems during the third quarter, we were impacted by the process surrounding China\u2019s development of a broad based economic reform plan, which will be available mid November. In the mean time, demand from state-owned enterprises and the public sector has slowed significantly as decision-making and procurement cycles lengthened. We believe the changes will take time to implement and do not expect demand in China to pick up until after the first quarter of next year.","Now let me put this in context. The hardware performance in China accounted for all five points of the constant currency decline in the growth markets and for 1.2 of the 1.6 points of constant currency decline for all of IBM. Regarding execution in the growth markets we understand the issues and have already taken management actions to improve performance. Looking forward, we have confidence that we can get this back on track. We expect a change in trajectory starting in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll be back to growth early in 2014.","Turning now to IBM\u2019s revenue by segment; in GBS we improved our year-to-year constant currency growth rate to 5% led by consulting and systems integration. Our GTS performance is a modest improvement from last quarter\u2019s rate, reflecting the addition of SoftLayer to our portfolio. Our software revenue grew 2% at constant currency led by key branded middleware at 4%. Performance was stronger in the infrastructure layer including solution for data management, application server, security, mobile and rational development tools.","As I said earlier, in Systems and Technology the deceleration in our performance was primarily driven by the growth markets. In Global Financing, we had growth in both financing revenue, which is driven by client asset growth as well as new sales. The return on equity in our financing business was 38% this quarter.","Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 1 point, driven by a combination of margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix. Now let\u2019s take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was flat year-to-year, acquisitions over the last 12 months drove two points of expense growth. Currency contributed 1 point of decline driven by translation. So consequently our base expense was better by two points.","Now I\u2019ll comment on a few items that had year-to-year impacts. Last year we had a significant charge for workforce rebalancing activity. We also had a significant gain from the sale of our retail store solutions business. So looking at the year-to-year dynamics and SG&A workforce rebalancing is down nearly $400 million year-to-year and another income and expense divestiture gains are down over $450 million.","Next parts of our business didn\u2019t perform as expected and as you know IBM has a pay per performance culture. Accordingly performance related compensation across both cost and expense was down about $175 million year-to-year.","Finally, I want to comment on the impact of currency this quarter. In the third quarter the hedge activity was fairly neutral in the period though on a year-to-year basis hedging gains were down about $80 million was about three quarters in expense in the balancing costs. While there have been a number of currency movements year-to-year, we have been significantly impacted by the depreciation of the Yen, because our business in Japan is dominated by local services without cross border cash flows to hedge the impact falls largely to the bottom line. The year-to-year profit impact was more significant than the third quarter, and would continue at current spot rates through the first quarter of next year.","Now let\u2019s turn to the segments starting with services. This quarter the two services segments generated $14 billion in revenue, declining 3% as reported but a constant currency return to growth of 1%. Pre-tax profit was up 17% and pre-tax margin expanded by 3.3 points. Total backlog was a $141 billion, up 2% of spot rates and up 6% at constant currency. Backlog again grew across both the transactional and outsourcing businesses.","Turing to the two segments; Global Technology Services revenue was $9.5 billion, down 4% or down 1% at constant currency. This represents a 1 point improvement over the last quarter year-to-year performance. In outsourcing we continue to see decline in revenue from sales into existing base accounts and from the structural work we did previously on low margin contracts. Our Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 2% at constant currency and grew in both major and growth markets.","GTS delivered 12% pre-tax profit growth in the quarter and expanded pre-tax margins by 2.8 points. Margin expansion was driven by lower year-to-year workforce rebalancing charges and some savings from second quarter rebalancing action along with tough minded spend actions and continued efficiency improvements.","Turning to Global Business Services, revenue of $4.6 billion was flat as reported and of 5% at constant currency, that\u2019s up from 2% last quarter. With this performance GBS gained share. From a geographic perspective there is growth across the portfolio led by North America and Japan. Europe returned to growth for the first time since the beginning of 2012.","Looking at the GBS business by our two major categories, we had good results across the portfolio. Within the digital front-office, we delivered double-digit growth across the initiatives, Business Analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud, and within our back office solutions that we call the Globally Integrated Enterprise. We again grew in implementation services that support the traditional packaged applications.","Turning to profit, GBS grew 26% year-to-year and PTI margin expanded by 4.4 points. The year-to-year profit drivers included lower year-to-year workforce rebalancing charges, savings from second quarter rebalancing and tough-minded spend actions.","So to wrap up Services, we returned to revenue growth this quarter, our growth initiatives continue to perform, we grew pre-tax profit and expanded profit margins and we\u2019re entering the next quarter with solid backlog growth of 6% at constant currency.","Software revenue of $5.8 billion was up 1% or 2% at constant currency. Segment pre-tax income of $2.4 billion was up 2%. Our strategic key branded middleware revenue grew 3% or 4% at constant currency and held share.","I\u2019ll take you through the drivers by brand. WebSphere was up 1% at constant currency. Within WebSphere we saw strength in mobile and good performance in Application Server. Information management software grew 3% at constant currency. Our distributed database had a good quarter with double-digit growth. Tivoli software was up 3% at constant currency, driven by storage growth in our portfolio of security solutions.","Our security business delivered another quarter of double-digit growth. The acquisition of Trusteer in the third quarter extends our data security capabilities further into cloud and mobile environment. Rational grew 14% at constant currency. Rational\u2019s DevOps solution leverages IBM\u2019s cloud capabilities for the rapid and interim deployment of software. Social Workforce Solutions grew 15%, driven by Kenexa, which provides cloud-based recruiting and talent management.","Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we have a strong pipeline in software. Consequently we expect improvements in software revenue growth and double-digit growth in profit.","Systems and Technology revenue of $3.2 billion was down 17%. The growth markets performance drove two-thirds of the revenue decline, about half of which was China. This impacted each of the hardware brands. System z grew 7% at constant currency with double-digit growth in the major markets. MIPS were up 56%, driven again by specialty engines, which were up more than 90%.","During the quarter we successfully launched the new z Enterprise midrange server with over 50% more capacity than its predecessor. Power revenue was down 37% at constant currency. High-performance computing accounted for 10 points of the decline. To improve future performance we\u2019re continuing to invest to expand our power platform to go after the Linux opportunity, which is now larger than UNIX and growing more rapidly.","System x was down 16% at constant currency. Storage hardware revenue was down 10% at constant currency. The decline was driven by the growth market. In the major market storage revenue was up. Our storage products again delivered double-digit growth and we also continued to grow our flash solution. These were offset by declines in our legacy OEM midrange offerings and softness in the high-end.","Pure Systems continued to gain momentum. In the major markets we grew more than 30% sequentially. Globally we shipped over 2,000 systems in the third quarter with over 8,000 total shipments since announcement.","Moving on to the cash flow analysis, we discussed our free cash flow performance excluding the change in Global Financing receivables. We do this because we consider the financing receivables as an investment to generate return, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency.","As I mentioned earlier, our Global Financing business is delivering a terrific return on equity. This quarter we generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow, down $900 million year-to-year. There was three key drivers of the year-to-year decline. Higher workforce rebalancing payments for the second quarter program, changes in sales cycle working capital and our operational performance. For the first three quarters of the year we generated $6.6 billion, which is down $2 billion year-to-year. Looking at the uses of our cash, through September we spend $2.6 billion to acquire seven companies including four in the third quarter, the largest of which was SoftLayer.","We\u2019ve returned just over $11 billion to shareholders this year. We paid out $3 billion in dividends and spend over $8 billion and grow share repurchase to buyback almost 40 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, we had $5.6 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $10.2 billion. Total debt was $36.2 billion of which $25.8 billion was in support of a financing business, which is leveraged just over 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $10.4 billion, effectively flat year-to-year and our non-financing debt to cap was 39%. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility with a strong balance sheet to support our business objectives.","When you look at the year-to-year drivers of our operating EPS performance the 4% decline in revenue at constant margin impacted profit growth by $0.15 per share. Margin expansion was the largest contributor to our growth. Within that we had positive contribution from gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, mitigated by a higher E to R [ph]. Our ongoing share repurchase program contributed the balance at a level fairly consistent with last quarter.","To wrap up, in the third quarter the combination of continued momentum in key growth areas, better business mix, yield from productivity initiatives, reductions in spending and compensation, discrete tax benefits and effective use of cash, all enabled us to deliver 10% operating EPS growth. Clearly we need to improve performance predominantly in the growth market and keep in mind that we\u2019re dealing with a couple of substantial headwinds. We observe a significant impact from currency in these results and affected by the pause during the development of China\u2019s new economic plans.","As far as the growth markets are concerned, we will be dealing with the China impact for another couple of quarters, more broadly in growth markets. We\u2019re taking management actions to improve execution and are confident we can get it back on track and improve our performance starting the fourth quarter, driving to mid single-digit performance in growth markets in 2014.","Looking to the future, we expect continued strong performance in our growth initiatives, Smarter Planet, business analytics and cloud. These not only address key market trends, but they drive a higher mix of software and consequently a higher margin. We\u2019ll continue our transformation over the long-term to a higher margin annuity base and even stronger business profile. And so with this improved operational performance, continued momentum in our growth initiatives and the flexibility in the financial model we\u2019re maintaining our view of at least $16.25 of operating EPS in 2013 and remain confident in our ability to achieve at least $20 in 2015.","Now Patricia and I will take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multipart questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. Operator, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we\u2019d like to begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Steve with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steven M. Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","\u2026pipeline and maybe mid-single digit revenue growth and return to growth and services\u2026","Patricia Murphy","Sorry, Steve. Steve, can you start with the beginning. We missed the beginning of your question.","Steven M. Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Can you hear me?","Patricia Murphy","Now we can, yes.","Steven M. Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Sorry about that. Coming into the quarter, Mark, you talked about mid-single digit revenue growth in software and so much stronger services growth than you posted. So even aside from the hardware issues in China, it seems like things are a bit weaker. What you attribute that to, is it just demand as we\u2019re hearing at a lot of enterprise companies. How much of this execution because in the third quarter last year you had some software execution problems, you\u2019re talking about some growth market execution problems. I guess how much is under your control, how much isn\u2019t?","Mark Loughridge","Okay. Well, let me answer your question in stages just as you asked us. So let\u2019s start with software. I agree we did not have the software quarter we\u2019re looking for. If you look historically both for the IBM corporation and certainly for the software business third quarters tend to be difficult for us. Fourth quarters tend to be strong. So I would expect based on all of the work we\u2019ve done to look at their pipeline going into the fourth that we would maintain that relative characteristic and see our key branded middleware with growth rates in kind of mid-single digits and double-digit profitability in the fourth quarter.","If you look at the characteristics, once we get to the end of the year obviously quarters close out December 31. So there\u2019s an off lot energy in the sales organization as we close the year, but we have typically had the same pattern as you have seen if you go back to the last number of years with a difficult third followed by a stronger fourth quarter and I think that has a lot to do with our overall software performance.","Now when you go to the services organization, however, I would say that first of all with backlog up 6%, that\u2019s pretty good performance. And if you look at the GTS business, I mean GTS did improve revenue albeit on a more marginal base, but the GTS are long extended contract that is kind of the battleship, the turn here.","On the other hand, GBS at 5%, I think that\u2019s pretty good. And if we look back on the GBS profile over the last four quarters, they have taken that business from minus two to a plus five and as we look at their strength as they have built that backlog, we see close at a plus seven as we go into the fourth quarter and in both cases returning services, as we have said, to grow in the third quarter and both third and fourth generating double-digit profitability.","So I do think we saw the kind of cadenced improvement on our services business. I think on the software side, we wrestled with this kind of typically weaker third followed by a, what we are looking to be a stronger fourth.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Steve. Can we go to the next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. I wanted to follow-up on the first question bit more broadly. I understand some of the specific issues this quarter around China, but if we kind of step back and think about what\u2019s been happening with IBM. Over a longer period recently you\u2019ve had six straight quarters were revenue growth has been negative. You\u2019ve missed consensus revenue expectations for seven straight quarters.","If it weren\u2019t for a huge tax benefit this quarter, it would have been a very significant EPS miss, which has occurred to IBM in the last couple of quarters and hadn\u2019t occurred in seven or eight years. So if we step back beyond the current quarter, we see a pattern of financial performance that is way out of whack with your historical model, lower revenue growth and operating profit growth that is dramatically lower but it\u2019s been buttress by tax rate and not including workforce rebalancing charge.","So my simple question is what\u2019s changed in the last six or seven quarters? Has there been a \u2013 I mean, less of a focus on execution that had to deal with the change in leadership at the top? Are you seeing new secular forces? I think it\u2019s very easy to explain away a given quarter, but six, seven, eight quarters in a row begins to make a trend. And so perhaps you can try and address what you think is happening more broadly and whether we should be thinking about a financial model that is more like 0% revenue growth and something less than double digit earnings growth on a sustained basis.","Mark Loughridge","Okay, Toni, it\u2019s always a very good question. Let me answer your question by giving you a framework for how I would look at that in 2013, then moving into 2014 to give a framework for that dynamics and how we intend to deal with them.","So, first of all to state the obvious, I mean we never said that the roadmap aggression would be the straight line and we are accessing our progress on a year-to-year basis. First is the 16, 25 at least for the year. I will say that to me and I think we have stated this repeatedly, the tax and shares are operational cadence for us. But I do not debate your point that we have had some very discrete difficulties as we\u2019re down through the quarters which I want to address now.","Now I would say broadly that plus or minus in software and services, a portion of our business has been marching down the field and kind of the structure that we\u2019re looking for at, we talked a little bit earlier, GBS has made very good progress. We got backlog up, at 6% of constant currency we did get some lift in our GTS business both generating profitability. So I don\u2019t think that the services business have shown a substantially different vector and in fact are improving as we go forward.","Software, I agree with the point, difficult third quarter. I got to say, in that software organization just like for the broader IBM we tend to have more difficulty in third quarters and stronger fourth quarters. But to be specific to your question, what\u2019s changed? We had two major headwinds that really hit us hard this year.","So on a year-to-date basis, we had a $1 billion of year-to-date decline in profitability from our hardware business. Now that is quite substantial, that is quite substantial as a headwind and on top of that $1 billion is a profit decline in our hardware business. We had a $500 million year-to-year impact from currency. Now that\u2019s clearly the theoretical upper limit. But given the fact that, the bulk of an impact is from the movement of un-hedged currencies like the impact from the yen that presented us with a pretty stiff challenge.","So in a way if you look at the bottom line performance in 2013, the elements of financial flexibility whether that be tax, both the discrete items that we recognized in the third quarter or the improvement of the rate, which extends to 2014 or the benefit of share repurchase has helped along with the operational performance that we did see from software and services help mitigate, absorb and partially offset this very strong headwind we had in the hardware business and in the currency.","Now if you look at currency, currency at current spot rate should write itself as we go into the second quarter of next year. Now obviously we\u2019ll all be tracking that overtime. That\u2019s what the math would say. So that leaves us with the impact from hardware. So if you look at the hardware content, the point we\u2019re making in the third quarter performance that in that hardware base of business the kind of nexus of erosion that we had was really in China.","Now, China broadly in a year accounts for about 5% of IBM and about 40% of that business is hardware, but the hardware business across those elements of the product line accepting z series performance, it was down substantially. We were talking 40%, 50%, enormous reductions on a year-to-year basis in a geography we were intended to see growth rates. You can see that in compare we had for China last year, up 19%, so up 19% last year, driven heavily by really strong performance in hardware base, but it\u2019s year down.","And you got to look at that and say, what significantly accounts for that. And I would say, quite honestly, if you look at the elements in China and we have worked with the team in China that simply has been a substantial impact as the process surrounding China\u2019s development of broad based economic reform plan takes shape. And that is going to be announced and available, we think in November and probably it will take some time to implement. So I think we are looking at a couple of quarters, but once that economic plan is announced, adds clarity to market, we should see I think and fairly within our team, a recovery in the demand pattern for state-owned enterprise public sector.","Now if you look at the profile that we would be counting on that generating next year, we\u2019d be looking for the growth markets with that new economic plan in China to recover and generate something in mid single digits. And in fact if you took that hardware impact that we saw in China, I mean frankly that hardware impact in China is all of the decline in our growth markets unit.","So I think that\u2019s a rationale set of objective and with that performance in our growth markets unit next year, again back to mid single digits if we get the better definition on the economic plan in China and improved performance, for us the other regions in GMU that too should help us suspend the erosion that we\u2019re seeing in our hardware business.","On a year-to-year basis, I frankly think we have set a pretty low bar to establish our financial structure and our operations objectives for those business units, expecting only flat year-to-year profitability which clearly this year is a loss now, when we think we could even do things better than that. But on a flat basis for the STG business, in 2014 compared to 2013 with our new P series, power aid product set to address the Linux opportunity which you know is larger than UNIX opportunity in growing, better growth and volume behind our PureFlex business which is picking up steam and broader exposure to our flash memory contents in storage, that should help us right size it even though in the mainframe set of the house, we\u2019ll be driving more towards the microcode upgrade part of the z series cycle.","All of that fairly complemented in 2014 by the benefit on an year-to-year basis of the workforce for balancing yield that we\u2019ve already taken which in 2014 will be more than enough to offset the year-to-year challenge from the tax discrete items that we saw this year, complemented additionally by the financial flexibility that we have to grow our share repurchase.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Toni, let\u2019s go to the next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask you question.","Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks. On the growth market challenges, I think you\u2019ve been very clear on the macro drivers in the government issues within China. But by looking at the execution component you mentioned, as we think about the normalization process here, could you give us some more granularity on exactly what the execution issues are. And I think when we look at this longer-term given how sharp some of the downturn are, how sharp some of the shortfalls are in this segment for you. What gives you confidence that the problems in Asia-Pac and the growth market specifically aren\u2019t secular in nature for IBM?","Mark Loughridge","Yes, I think, let me give this framework for the explanation. First of all, if you look at the performance that we saw this quarter in growth markets, revenue at constant currency down 5% compared to the IT growth rate and growth markets are plus 5. We\u2019ve had about 10 point gap there. So we did very kind of simple back of the envelope analysis on that to distinguish what was macro and what was execution and we said, well if we took that big STG erosion that we saw in China that we would conclude is highly related to the process of developing the Chinese economic policy. If we snap that out, the growth markets would have been flat. And so to us that sounds like about 5 of that 10 point gap to the industry are coming from a macro environment issue. The other five we think it\u2019s pure execution.","Now I would argue that you\u2019re seeing our ability to put leadership teams on the ground to turn our performance in geographic. Now the hallmark in that was that for us is Japan. Japan has really turned around in a very big way under the leadership of Martin Jetter and his team got engaged by broadly and we\u2019ve seen that perform quarter after quarter with that leadership capability.","So in the growth market organization the leadership team that established that to begin with and drove that organization is now back in the cockpit led by Bruno Di Leo and his leadership team. They know how to get this done. They helped build this to begin with. So I think that\u2019s an explanation on the macro environment impact that we saw that we would say accounted for about half that differential to the industry as well as the leadership differential and the action that IBM has taken to address those on the execution element.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Bill. Can we go to the next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.","David M. Grossman \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. I wondered if you can just turn to free cash flow for me Mark. Is the free cash flow year-to-date in your view a good proxy for the 2013 decline or do you think you go up or down in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, are you still comfortable given where we are and where the fundamentals of the business are with the free cash flow target outlined in the 2015 roadmap?","Mark Loughridge","Yes, a very, very good point. Let me address that starting with where we see ourselves in 3Q and year-to-date basis. So year-to-date, we are down $2 billion in free cash flow, and if you look at the drivers behind that that would be broken down into the operational performance obviously of the business, our performance on sales cycle, working capital. Those two, I would say are execution base and then the complement being the impact that we\u2019ve seen on cash tax.","We do see that now as more and a little over $1 billion range. We originally thought more like $2 billion, we now think it\u2019s more like a $1 billion. In the cash side of our workforce rebalancing, but that\u2019s only the elements of that year-to-date performance, I think more importantly it\u2019s how we see that full year 2013 free cash flow, which will be down on the year-to-year basis, how we see that moving through the roadmap to 2014 and 2015.","So in 2014, based on that same kind of structured model that I described to you, we would see our free cash flow accepting the impact of cash taxes, growing at a rate of about 15% to 20%. Now cash taxes, we believe now in 2014 will be a headwind of about $2 billion, but even including cash taxes, we would see our free cash flow growing by a little over $1 billion. So the operational profile within that in that 15% to 20% range and on that basis, free cash flow growing faster than net income.","Going to 2015, we would see that free cash flow \u2013 the inclusion of cash taxes, growing at about 15% to 20%, again free cash flow growing more rapidly than net income, and in 2015 that cash taxes should be a tailwind as opposed to the headwind that we have been referring within 2014 and 2015.","Now if you took that back if they will, let\u2019s structure that around the financial roadmap, as you remember the roadmap, the tail what we saw in the usage of free cash flow and said, we expected to spend about $90 billion between share repurchase, dividends and acquisitions. That $90 billion on a gross basis is about $85 billion, $86 billion on a net basis and the free cash flow that we see across the roadmap is also in that range of $85 billion plus or minus, so over the roadmap those two relatively balanced and that\u2019s not including cash inflows that we would think would be likely from potential divestitures. So with that basis even though we had a disappointed free cash flow performance this year, we still see the overall construct through the roadmap supporting those original objectives.","Now across those elements of share buyback dividends and acquisitions there is fungibility right, you\u2019ve see that even in our to-date performance on the first two and half years of the roadmap and where share repurchase little less acquisitions so I don\u2019t think the category or the cadence across the years would be linear. But I think the aggregate is still very, very relevant in the best guide for you to use as you look at our usage of free cash flow.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks David, can we go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Ben A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, thanks, I appreciate it. Mark, I wanted to ask you about the $20 roadmap and the philosophy behind it, I think what our challenge tonight is going to be, when we go back to investors and we look at the base of 2013 and we exclude all the tax benefits, and you were talking about a number that might be around $16 and we are talking about trailing free cash flow around $14 and $0.60 so, eventually free cash flow and earnings tend to migrate to each other and then, let\u2019s just forget free cash flow and started to 16 base. You got to grow 12% each year to get to 20%.","And I\u2019m just thinking with the acceleration that we got to convince people that you are getting there so, I\u2019m wondering what is the confidence level in the $20 based on that based on that kind of a conversation that we need to have with investors to get you there and how do you get in there, and what your confidence level as of today. Thanks.","Mark Loughridge","Yes, really the basis for that trajectory to 2015 involves; number one, in 2014 stabilizing our STG or hardware business on a profitability basis to be relatively flat on a year-to-year basis. We have absorbed this year that $1 billion decline on a year-to-year basis and I showed how I thought that really did correlate based on the work the team has done to the issues we had in China, but we believe it should be a very reasonable objective to stabilize on a year-to-year basis relatively flat profitability with STG.","And what we are able to do that the vehicle for that being new product announcements across our STG businesses as well as returning growth market to mid single-digit growth on a constant currency basis once we get through this process surrounding China\u2019s development of a broad based economical full plan. Those two capabilities are the primary elements to stop the erosion and profitability and that part of our business. And then had the operational profile for software and services fell through the bottom line.","Additionally this impact that we wrestled with on currency again then on a year-to-date basis of $500 million headwind that kind of it\u2019s theoretical limit, that should reverse and actually be a tailwind in the second quarter of next year.","And then lastly, if you look at the compliment to help offset the year-to-year headwind from the discrete tax benefit we have in 2013 really the flow through of the workforce rebalancing yield that we\u2019ve already completed should be more than enough to neutralize that. And allow us to take really the financial flexibility, the strength of balance sheet, to complement that operational performance and maintain that trajectory in 2014 on our way to at least 25 up to 2015.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Ben. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.","Keith F. Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hi, thank you. My question is also, how do you get there in terms of 2015. And Mark was hoping you could specifically address how you are thinking about revenue growth which has been not only from a currency perspective from an absolute dollar perspective. How are you thinking about next year? And if we focus on services for the second, how does the pipeline and the backlog you mentioned is up 6%. If you\u2019re thinking about services for FY 2014, if you can provide any dimensions about how you are thinking about the growth profile there? Is it 1%, 2% or is it small single digits?","And the second part of that question is can hardware really be a flat revenue numbers you think about CY 2014 because it seems like there still be extraordinary pressure on the market overall. And even with normal products just curious if you think that can be a flat number with all the currency assumptions that you\u2019ve already outlined.","Mark Loughridge","Yes. First of all on the hardware base, my point was to drive the STG hardware business to flat profitability. I agree with you \u2013 I don\u2019t\u2019 think that is going to be necessarily flat revenue but flat profitability base\u2026","Keith F. Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay.","Mark Loughridge","All the works that we\u2019ve done. Now I will say in the next Q, 2014 for hardware business that would probably be driving in the first half down a couple of hundred million and the second half up a couple of hundred million, but relatively flat profitability, not revenue on the STG side of the business.","Keith F. Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay.","Mark Loughridge","As pointed out that\u2019s a relatively low bar given the level of profitability that the hardware business will generate in 2013.","On the services side, I do think it\u2019s worth clearly recognizing the real contribution that the GBS team has driven by constantly improving that backlog performance and then yielding that backlog performance right in the revenue line and let\u2019s go back on that four quarter march that they have been on. They have been kind of methodically driving a couple of points improving over quarter, that\u2019s why we feel it\u2019s a very confident basis for us to look at 7% revenue growth for GBS in the fourth quarter.","And if we have 7% revenue growth for that platform with ongoing improvement in backlog given the momentum they\u2019ve been able to drive with the faster take up of backlog to revenue for GBS that should really assist us as we go into 2014. But I think within that, the lynchpin assumption that we need to drive for 2014 and 2014 being the platform for moving into 2015 is stabilize that STG business at the low level profitability we see this year, return GMU back to mid single digit growth as we get through the process surrounding China\u2019s development as a broad based economic reform plan, allowing the improving momentum we see on the services business as well as a return to their more consistent profile in software business help drive that operational performance.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Keith. Can we take the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Market. You may ask your question.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, yep, thanks a lot. When I think about the implied December quarter expectations you have and given the commentary you made about the growth market headwind. Do you meet the execution issues to get resolved and see normal seasonality to achieve the implied December quarter expectations or could you get one of those two events do not happen. And then specifically just in the software side, I think it was up 1%, I would have thought it would be up more like 4%, 5%. Was there any China centric headwind on the software side as well for you this quarter?","Mark Loughridge","Well, the way I would frame the software performance is not around China. The China issue was predominantly an impact to our hardware business. The software issue I think is this ongoing challenge that we typically have in third quarters going into a stronger fourth quarter. So that\u2019s the way I would look at this.","Now if you look at the magnitude of improvement that we\u2019re looking at for our growth markets content, going to the fourth quarter and then into next years that profile going into 2014 remember about half of it we said we thought was macro driven that should resolve itself we believe as China establishes this broad based economical reform plan in March of 2014. And the second half of that really driven by the leadership and we do need to see that trajectory improve as of going to the fourth quarter to get back to mid single digit performance in 2014 consistent with the industry.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Amit. Can we take the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore. You may ask your question.","Robert Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc","Hi, thanks very much. If I could ask kind of a more strategic question particularly in services, if you look at your, you\u2019re just closing the SoftLayer acquisition this quarter, and beyond adding whatever point of revenue or whatever the GTS. What does that mean for you to go-to-market strategy, does it change the look of GTS and particularly given that it\u2019s coming at the same time. You also announced the planned divestiture anyway of the customer care BPO business for relatively low multiple. I mean when you combine those two things, are you sort of driving a more aggressive change to the look of GTS or is it just the fact that once high growth high multiple, once low growth, low multiple? Thanks.","Mark Loughridge","Well, let\u2019s separate those two. I mean the divestiture that was complementary to IBM and to the partner that we\u2019re working with for us it was an area that we thought we could get better capability of the partner, and the partner\u2019s capability and then we would apply our energies to broader intellectual property capability. If you look at the cloud content and the software content that we see are within cloud. We cross kind of a milestone for us this quarter worth of $1 billion of cloud revenue, the content within that about 610 million of it was the hardware and software and implementation services for us to establish cloud based operations within our customer set and then $460 million of that was cloud delivered services and solutions including software.","Now if you look underneath the dynamics in that, in that cloud delivered services and solutions content most of those customer engagement, for us, turned out to be incremental. And you remember when we started the roadmap content to drive cloud to be about $7 billion by 2015 we said that we thought only about $3 billion of that would be incremental due to the cannibalization of base. And so we\u2019re always using that as kind of a checkpoint. Actually we didn\u2019t see that in our own profile. Most of that content was indeed new and incremental.","So it does provide a very strong platform for us within GTS and a platform for moving to the market for other business units. I will tell you that since we\u2019ve made that acquisition, I have heard nothing but very positive statements from our business units on the capability and the added dimension that it applies to IBM and to GTS.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Rob. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks Mark for your comments about growth and execution improving in the fourth quarter, consider the risk of delayed U.S. Federal spending and any impact that may have on the enterprise sales cycles in the U.S.?","Mark Loughridge","Sure. Let me talk about that explicitly. So if you look at our U.S. federal business, Katy, our U.S. Federal business is a little less than 3% of our total revenue mix. So as you look at the risk within that 3%, it turns out that really the bulk of our Federal business is either or not exposed or even if isn\u2019t a category that is exposed has been deemed essential. So as we look at it, it\u2019s kind of a time dimension. So if we close on that issue in October, there really shouldn\u2019t be much of an impact for IBM.","If it extends through to November then it will be an issue, but something we ought to be able to deal with and manage through. If this extends in to December then it\u2019s going to get to be a meaningful number, say around a nickel that we will probably not be able to contain. But it is kind of a time based exposure that we are tracking quite carefully. The advantage that we do have to keep that total down is how much of our business is in fact being the central.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Katy. Operator, can we take one more question please?","Operator","The last question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you very much Mark and Patricia for your details. I have a quick clarification, you\u2019d mentioned tax rate of 23%, is that what you mean going forward for every quarter or it\u2019s kind of for the full year which means that Q4 they have to go up to something like 30%. Now the bigger question is following up on the last question about the Federal Government. Does that also impact your signings and booking in new businesses coming in, also as I would imagine there is kind of big pause there of new business being handed out?","Mark Loughridge","Yes, let\u2019s take the bookings issue first. If you look at the business unit that would be most impacted by that exposure, it would be our GBS business. But I have nothing but very positive observations of their performances both on driving performance on a global basis generating profitability from that growth and increasing their backlog. So though that would be the area most exposed you sure wouldn\u2019t see it in the results.","As far as the tax rate, what I\u2019m referencing is the average tax rate that we would assume before discrete items and that tax rate would be the tax rate for the year and for the quarter. Going forward for 2013 as well as 2014, but again that\u2019s tax rate before discrete items.","So let me now just take the opportunity to wrap up or thank you for the questions and the time on the call. Obviously this was a tough quarter for us, especially in the STG and the growth market, but we\u2019re on track to deliver at least $16.25 for the year on an all-in basis and we believe with the actions we are taking, we\u2019ll have stronger operational performance as we go into 2014.","In STG we\u2019re going to wrestle with the mainframe wrap in the first half of next year, but should return to profit growth in the second half and stabilized hardware profit on a year-to-year basis for year. That\u2019s the game plan.","And in growth markets, we\u2019ll improve the trajectory to get back to mid-single digit performance for the 2014 full year, especially after we get to the broad based economic reform plan that\u2019s developing in China, consistent I think on that trajectory basis for growth markets, consistent with the overall industry.","We\u2019ll continue to use the overall flexibility of our financial model, including productivity and share repurchase and I think we are going to see that ongoing operational performance in our software and services business show through then to drive the bottom line. So this keeps us on track to our 2015 objective of at least $20 of operating EPS.","I want to thank you again for joining us and now as always it\u2019s back to work.","Patricia Murphy","Operator, can I turn the call back to you to close it out.","Operator","Thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call.

Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM. I\u2019m here today with Martin Schroeter, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our fourth quarter earnings presentation. The prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours, and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I\u2019ll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC.

You will find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation, and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Martin Schroeter.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks, Patricia. Let me start by saying we\u2019re pleased with the progress we made again this quarter. We delivered revenue of $22.1 billion, operating net income of $4.7 billion, and operating earnings per share of $4.84. As we get in to our results, you\u2019ll see that our fourth quarter and full year performance reflects the transitions in our business as we address the significant shifts in our industry, as well as some of the cyclical challenges of the global business environment.","So as always in January, I\u2019ll start out with some comments on the year, show you the progress we\u2019ve made in our transformation, discuss the details of the quarter, and then wrap up with our view of 2016. For the full year, we delivered nearly $82 billion of revenue, and $14.7 billion of operating net income and our operating earnings per share were $14.92. As we\u2019ve said, this transformation will play out over time, and with revenue down 1%, for the second consecutive year we\u2019ve had modest improvement in our year-to-year revenue performance, excluding the impact of currency and divestitures. I\u2019ll comment on year-to-year revenue performance on this basis throughout.","Our strategic imperatives continued strong performance, up 26% for the year. This now represents 35% of IBM\u2019s revenue. Our profit and margin reflect our portfolio actions as we shift to higher value, as well as the level of investments we\u2019re making to drive our transformation. We generated over $13 billion of free cash flow, which is up year-to-year. This is 98% of our GAAP net income, in line with our expectation that free cash flow realization will be in the 90s.","A couple of years ago, we laid out our strategic imperatives around big data and analytics, around cloud, and around mobile and security, the areas where our clients are looking to us to help move them to the future. I want to spend a minute on the progress we\u2019ve made since then in shifting our business toward these strategic imperatives, and in the investments we\u2019ve been making, which aren\u2019t yet reflected in our revenue streams. We have said, we expect these strategic imperatives to deliver double-digit revenue growth, and in 2015, our performance in our strategic imperatives accelerated.","Together, cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security grew 26% and delivered $29 billion in revenue. As I mentioned they now represent 35% of IBM, which is up from 22% two years ago. With 57% revenue growth over the last year, cloud is now a $10 billion business for us. This made us the largest cloud provider in 2015, which is what you\u2019d expect, given our extensive relationships in enterprise IT and incumbency in the data center, positioning us to help our clients implement hybrid cloud environments.","Revenue from our as-a-Service offerings increased about 60% to $4.5 billion for the year, and we exited 2015 with an annual run rate for our as-a-Service business of $5.3 billion. The $10 billion also includes $5.6 billion of revenue from our foundational offerings where we provide software, hardware and services so clients can build their own clouds. In either case, what we\u2019ve been saying for some time is that clients are utilizing a cloud not just to reduce costs, but to gain agility and enable innovation. And whether they\u2019re consuming as-a-Service, or through their own clouds or as in the case of most enterprise clients who are implementing a hybrid environment, we\u2019re leading that move.","To address opportunities we see in this space, in 2015 we made seven cloud acquisitions including Cleversafe for object storage, Gravitant for cloud brokerage services, and Clearleap for cloud video services. We also invested nearly a billion dollars in capital expanding our global cloud data center footprint to 46. We already have an ecosystem of millions of developers globally, and our Bluemix Platform-as-a-Service has already expanded to over a million users, adding 15,000 developers a week.","With nearly $18 billion of analytics revenue, we\u2019re also the largest analytics provider, and we\u2019ll extend that lead by moving into new areas including Watson Health and Watson Internet of Things. In Watson Health, we are integrating our own organic capabilities with content acquired through Merge, Phytel, and Explorys. Healthcare is a new revenue and profit opportunity for us as we change the face of healthcare through our cognitive platform to provide value to providers, payers, and partners. We\u2019re also addressing the IoT market.","Our Weather Company acquisition not only gives us tremendously valuable data and digital content, but a high volume, cloud-based, insight-driven platform that we\u2019ll integrate with Watson to address significant new opportunity spaces. We\u2019ll talk about how we\u2019re addressing these opportunities at our investor briefing at the end of February. And while we are investing in capabilities for the future, we\u2019re also returning significant value to shareholders. We paid out nearly $5 billion in dividends, and we reduced our average share count by 2.7%.","So we got a lot done in 2015. To sum it up, our revenue for the year was down 1%, we expanded gross margin, we invested heavily for the future, and we returned capital to shareholders, all while transforming the business. The progress we\u2019re making gives us confidence that we\u2019re on the right strategy, and the actions we\u2019ve taken not only advance our transformation, but also will contribute to our growth rate in the future. I\u2019ll come back to the full year, and 2016 after going through the details of the quarter starting with the financial metrics.","Our revenue for the quarter of $22.1 billion was down 2%, reflecting the transition we\u2019ve been describing. I\u2019ll spend just a minute on currency, which continues to be a headwind. Currency impacted our reported revenue by over 6 points or $1.5 billion, which is about $350 million more than the spot rates suggested 90 days ago. For the year, currency translation reduced our revenue by over $7 billion. That by itself is the revenue of a Fortune 500 company and currency was also a headwind to our profit performance. We estimate it impacted our profit growth by about $300 million in the fourth quarter and over $1 billion for the year. At current spot rates, we would expect a significant impact to revenue and profit again in 2016 not just from the translation, but from the year-to-year cash flow hedging dynamics. I\u2019ll come back to this.","Our margin performance reflects some ongoing dynamics in the business, like higher levels of investment, and an impact from the mix of contracts and resource shifts in our services business. But it also reflects some unique items in the fourth quarter of last year, the largest of which was $1.4 billion gain from the sale of our x86 server business. This prior period gain represents effectively all of the year-to-year decline in PTI margin. I\u2019ll talk more about the margin drivers in the segment discussions.","Our underlying effective tax rate was 20%, and this quarter the rate also reflects the recent U.S. tax legislation, and the settlement of our U.S. tax audit, which we have talked about throughout 2015. And so bottom line, we delivered $4.84 of operating earnings per share. We generated over $6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, and $13 billion for the year, and as I mentioned, this is 98% of GAAP net income. We returned about three quarters of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015 through dividends and gross share repurchases.","Now turning to the revenue by geography, we had good performance across many of the major markets. Europe returned to growth, led by continued growth in Germany, France, and the UK. In fact, Germany posted double-digit growth and in December, we announced Munich as the headquarters for our new Watson IoT business, as well as our first European Watson innovation center. In Asia Pacific, Japan continued to post growth, led by services.","In the AP growth markets, we had double-digit growth in India and Australia though China declined. Our U.S. revenue was down. We had strong growth in the U.S. in all hardware platforms \u2013 zSystems, Power, and storage, but it was offset by weak services and transactional software performance. The growth markets in total were down 4%, roughly in line with the last two quarters, and from a regional perspective, growth in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa was offset by declines in Asia Pacific.","Turning to the segment perspective, our total revenue was down 2%, and gross margin declined about a point. Our Global Technology Services revenue grew, as we help our clients transition to a hybrid cloud services platform bringing in more cloud, mobility and security to infrastructure services. This contributed to our backlog growth for the year. Our GTS gross margin decline is driven by investments in cloud data centers and the ramp of new contracts, which generally have lower up-front margins.","In Global Business Services, we\u2019re adding resources and growing quickly in strategic areas, while transitioning away from some of the more traditional areas. This shift of resources impacts productivity in the near-term, which puts pressure on margin. In Software, our annuity content grew, but transactional performance has been impacted by the flexibility we\u2019ve been providing in ELAs with our larger clients. The transactional performance in the fourth quarter was consistent with what we saw in September. But a larger transactional mix in the fourth quarter drove a deceleration in the overall software growth rate.","Our Systems Hardware revenue was up, driven by zSystems and Power. This caps a very strong year in our Systems business, reflecting that our leading edge servers run the most contemporary workloads. The Systems margin is driven by the lower mainframe margin, as is typical at this point in the cycle.","Turning to expense, our Operating Expense and Other Income is up 9%. There a few large items that impacted the growth rate this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the sale of our System X business in the fourth quarter of last year, resulting in a gain of $1.4 billion in that period. And this quarter we took a charge of about $85 million for the write-down of the equity component received as consideration.","So together, these were $1.5 billion year-to-year impact to our expense. We also had a year-to-year reduction in workforce rebalancing. We had $580 million of workforce rebalancing charges in the fourth quarter of last year, with essentially none this year, so this reduced expense growth by 10 points. And currency reduced expense growth by 8 points. Between the translation of non-dollar spending, and the cash flow hedging gains that are reported in other income and SG&A. This is pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen all year.","Outside of these larger items, our expense dynamics have been consistent throughout the year. We\u2019re accelerating shifts within our operational expense base driving productivity and efficiency in some areas, while increasing investment in support of our strategic imperatives. This year, we shifted $5 billion of spend to our strategic imperatives, that\u2019s across cost, expense and capital expenditures.","Now let\u2019s turn to the segments, and we\u2019ll start with services. We ended the fourth quarter with a services backlog of $121 billion, which grew for the third consecutive quarter. We continue to see momentum in our services offerings that modernize our clients IT systems and move their operations into the cloud-based mobile world. We\u2019ve seen reports that suggest the adoption of cloud it means shrinking deal sizes, but this is not what we are seeing. Clients are looking to transform their most critical systems into hybrid cloud environments, and the complexity of these partnerships in many cases results in larger engagements. ","In fact, this quarter we have signed 26 services deals greater than a $100 million, and for the full year we signed over 70 of these substantial transactions, which is 40% more than last year. So with a growing backlog and a 40% increase in large deals during the year, we are not seeing shrinking deals. Now about 70% of those transactions feature hybrid cloud content, which reflects both the value our clients see in hybrid, and the reality that not all of their workloads will be optimized for the cloud. ","Just recently, we signed a $1.4 billion expansion in the scope of our relationship with European Bank BNP Paribas. This is a joint GBS and GTS engagement, and as part of the agreement, we'll operate two of the bank's data centers in Belgium as hybrid cloud centers, providing cloud infrastructure and a full suite of business transformation services spanning applications testing, business intelligence, security and core banking solutions.","Global Technology Services delivered $8.1 billion of revenue, and grew for the third consecutive quarter. ","Our strategic imperatives including our hybrid cloud services in GTS grew strong double digits this quarter, and for the full year. This includes strong demand for Softlayer, which again grew double digits this quarter. This Infrastructure-as-a- Service cloud platform provides our clients with a full range of cloud services including virtual and bare metal servers along with a dedicated dark fiber network infrastructure. As clients evaluate their technology roadmap, they are looking for agility and innovation and to gain insight into data from all sources. ","Our hybrid cloud stack is an open platform that enables this innovation. Our clients can choose from public, private, and dedicated environments based on their needs, such as workload, performance, data sovereignty, and regulatory requirements. Entire industries and value chains are being disrupted, and our clients are looking to us for competitive advantage.","To expand our Cloud capabilities, this past quarter we announced the acquisition of Gravitant. Gravitant develops cloud-based software to enable organizations to easily broker software and computing services across multiple suppliers and cloud environments from a single screen.","We also announced the acquisition of Clearleap, a premier provider of cloud-based video services. This will provide our enterprises with a fast and easy way to securely manage, monetize, and grow user video experiences. The Clearleap video platform is optimized for massive scalability, which enables clients to ramp up and support millions of concurrent users within seconds to support special events. The innovations have attracted leading brands such as HBO, A&E Networks, the NFL, and Sony Movie Channel.","Finally, our maintenance business continues to contribute significant revenue and profit by delivering a wide range of support services to maintain and improve our clients\u2019 IT infrastructure. We continue to see strong demand for our Multi-Vendor Support services where clients can leverage our global distribution and inventory capabilities.","Our GTS PTI margin is up about two points year to year. This was driven by lower workforce rebalancing charges and savings from actions taken throughout the year to drive efficiency in our delivery model. Mitigating these savings, we continue to invest to contemporize our clients IT systems, transforming them into digital enterprises. We\u2019re scaling our Softlayer footprint with 46 cloud data centers opened around the world. ","Finally, as we\u2019ve talked about throughout the year, currency is impacting margin, and remains the largest impact on year-to-year profit growth given the strong dollar environment. ","Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.3 billion in the quarter. We continue to transform our GBS business, and our signings were up double digits this quarter driven by our digital offerings. Revenue from our strategic imperative practices was again up strong double digits. ","Our analytics practice grew over 20%, our cloud services were up over 60%, and our mobile practice more than doubled. Our revenue continues to be impacted by the wind down of traditional enterprise application implementations. Clients are moving away from ERP engagements to initiatives that focus on digitizing their business with analytics, cloud, and mobile technologies.","In December we announced that as part of our partnership with Apple, we\u2019ve now delivered over 100 MobileFirst for iOS applications. This unique partnership brings together the simplicity of design and ease of use of the Apple mobile device, with our ability to build applications that scale securely and efficiently to the enterprise helping to transform the way work gets done across 14 industries and 65 professions. These apps allow our clients to securely access their most critical data and processes, so that they can redesign workflows and drive productivity. Since we announced the partnership with Apple, we\u2019ve generated over $1 billion in signings from the program.","GBS profit margin was flat year to year. Let me talk about some of the dynamics within that. We have a benefit from lower workforce rebalancing charges. In parts of the portfolio where the market is declining, we are seeing price and profit pressure and we are taking actions to optimize our cost structure. We continue to invest in our analytics, cloud, and mobility practices. ","We\u2019ve hired and shifted significant resources to these areas, which impacts productivity and margin in the near term. We are also scaling a new cognitive consulting practice launched last quarter that is focused on helping our clients unlock the transformative value of cognitive business.","Our Software revenue was $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter. Our annuity content grew year to year, while transactional content declined. Our Software profit performance continues to reflect the revenue trajectory, a higher level of investments in areas like Watson, Watson Health, IoT and Bluemix, and an impact from currency translation","Let me spend a minute on the revenue dynamics. Looking at the transactional content, recalling our last earnings call, we talked about weaker transactional performance at the end of September, which impacted the third quarter. Our fourth quarter transactional performance was very similar to what we experienced in September. Given the much higher transactional mix in the fourth quarter, this had a larger impact on our total software performance, resulting in a deceleration in software growth in the fourth. ","Looking ahead to first quarter, which has a lower transactional mix, we will see an improvement in our revenue trajectory. We\u2019ve said in the past that our performance reflects that many of our large clients with multi-year contracts are utilizing the flexibility on deployment of their software, as they build out their environments with our broad portfolio, and this is continuing. Outside of our top 250 clients our software revenue was up low single digits in the fourth quarter, and for the full year.","On an annual basis, about 70% of our software business is annuity-like, including Software-as-a-Service, and subscription and support. Our renewal rates are steady, our SaaS business is growing, and our overall annuity revenue grew in the fourth quarter and the full year.","Middleware serves the purpose of integrating different environments \u2013 on prem, and cloud. To enable hybrid environments, our key capabilities have now been delivered on Softlayer, or as part of our IBM Bluemix platform. IBM\u2019s middleware remains the number one integration platform in the world, and now integrates across cloud environments. ","To put it simply, this allows clients\u2019 existing apps to access the cloud, and new \u201cborn on the cloud\u201d applications to access clients\u2019 existing assets. To accelerate the integration of middleware in a hybrid cloud environment, we made an organizational change at the beginning of this year, moving a portion of our middleware business into our cloud business, reflecting the importance of our middleware in the hybrid cloud marketplace.","We are also adding substantial new capabilities into our software and solutions portfolio. One example is the Weather Company acquisition, which will provide the basis for our IoT platform. This acquisition brings with it a high-volume platform that can ingest sensor data at scale. This platform can handle enormous complexity, taking in four billion weather forecasting points and 26 billion queries in its cloud service each day. This is the fourth most-used mobile app, handling seven times more transaction volume than the world\u2019s leading search engine. Some of this has been running on our cloud already and of course we will move all of this to IBM cloud. ","And then we will layer in Watson to give it the cognitive capability to apply machine learning at scale. This then gives us the ability to expand this platform capability to industries beyond weather, like health. The power of the platform is its ability to use Watson cognitive capabilities to gather new insights by connecting data at scale from multiple industry domains.","Our Systems Hardware segment revenue was $2.4 billion. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in both z Systems and Power. We have continued to deliver innovation to our systems to enable them to run the most contemporary workloads. In fact, about half of our systems segment revenue in 2015 was to address analytics workloads, or hybrid and private clouds.","This quarter z Systems revenue was up more than 20%. Since the launch of z13 in the first quarter of 2015, we have delivered growth of 35%, with strong double-digit growth in every quarter since the launch. z13 was contemporized for the workloads around mobile, hybrid cloud and analytics, which continues to resonate well with our existing customers, and bringing new customers to the platform. For the year we added 50 new clients across 25 countries.","Power revenue grew 8%, which is the strongest performance of the year. In Power we are serving a high value market, while adding capabilities and finding new economic models to grow over time. Unix is a declining market, but we continue to address it because it is very a high value space. At the same time, we introduced low-end Linux-based Power systems to capture the growing Linux market, and are building an IP stream through the OpenPOWER ecosystem. Even though the Unix market is declining, by delivering innovation and repositioning the platform, our Power systems have grown four quarters in a row. This is a good example of how we transform ourselves.","The growth in our servers was mitigated by a 7% decline in Storage hardware, which continues to be impacted by weakness in traditional disk and tape. As we have said, value in the storage market continues to shift to software and offering requirements that are driving demand for flash and object-based storage. We are well-positioned in these new areas, with growth in flash, and our recent acquisition of Cleversafe.","Looking back at 2015, our Systems results reflect a successful transformation and repositioning of the business. Revenue was up 8% for the year, and profit up about $600 million. This performance reflects our solid mainframe product cycle and the successful Power transformation, with Power revenue growing for the first time since 2011.","So moving on to cash flow, in the quarter, we generated $7.1 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. We invested $1 billion dollars in CapEx, and generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow.","For the full year, we generated $17 billion of cash from operations. We invested almost $4 billion in CapEx this year, with a significant amount going to support our growing services backlog, and for cloud as we build out cloud data centers. And so we generated free cash flow of $13.1 billion, an improvement of almost $700 million year to year. The primary driver of this improvement was lower cash tax payments of about $3 billion. ","Our cash and tax book rates for 2015 were fairly consistent, and so the year-to-year benefit to cash flow was driven by a much higher cash tax rate in 2014. We also had over a $1 billion of improvement in our sales cycle working capital. This was partially offset by a decline in our profit performance, and payments of performance-based compensation.","Looking at uses of cash, we\u2019ve invested over $3 billion on acquisitions this year. We\u2019ve acquired 14 companies, including seven in the fourth quarter. The Weather Company acquisition I mentioned earlier will close in the first half of 2016.","Over the course of the year we\u2019ve returned $9.5 billion to shareholders including dividends of nearly $5 billion and $4.6 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back 30 million shares, reducing our average share count by 2.7%. At the end of the year, we had $5.6 billion remaining in our buy back authorization.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.2 billion. Total debt was nearly $40 billion, of which $27 billion was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains just over seven to one. The credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 55% investment grade; you can see this in our supplemental charts. The year-to-year reduction in investment grade was driven by rating changes to our existing portfolio, not by changing our approach to the market.","Our non-financing debt of $12.7 billion was almost a $1 billion lower than September, and up just over $1 billion year-to-year. Our non-financing debt-to-cap was 54%, four points lower than September, and five points lower than a year ago. Our debt-to-cap ratio was impacted again this year by a reduction in equity due to currency translation, and pension re-measurement. Together, these impacted our equity by about $3.5 billion. The performance of our retirement-related assets, and return and discount rate assumptions at year-end are in our supplemental charts. You can see our funding levels remain solid with the U.S. and worldwide tax-qualified plans at 101% and 97% respectively. And importantly, our balance sheet continues to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term.","So now let me wrap up where I started the call by saying that we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we made again this year in the transformation of our business. We\u2019re continuing to invest and add capabilities to drive the transformation. In 2015, we spent over 6% of our revenue in R&D, we invested about $4 billion in capital, and over $3 billion to acquire 14 companies. We are integrating acquired content with our organic capabilities, and leveraging partnerships and a broader ecosystem to build new high value platforms. And we\u2019re applying our cognitive capabilities to more of what we do.","Within our spend, we\u2019re shifting to key opportunity areas, and we\u2019re seeing the returns in our strategic imperatives results. With $29 billion of revenue, these now make up 35% of IBM. In 2015, we had a successful mainframe cycle, and Power grew as we repositioned it to address a broader opportunity. Our services backlog was up and we exited the year with a $121 billion book of business. Our software annuity base, which is about 70% of our software revenue also continued to grow. Our overall Software performance reflects reduced transactional levels as our largest customers utilize flexibility we\u2019ve provided and commit to our platform for the longer term.","The macro environment, as always, is mixed, and currency continues to be a significant headwind. While we are focused on remaining competitive in local markets, the translation impact is significant. It was an 8 point impact to revenue growth in 2015, and at current spot rates, currency would be another 2 to 3 point impact this year. The profit impact is substantial as well, and given the sustained period of dollar strengthening, the profit impact in 2016 will in fact be greater than 2015, both because of the translation impact, and the roll-off effect of cash flow hedging gains. At current spot rates, we expect currency to impact pre-tax profit growth in 2016 by about $1.3 billion with nearly three quarters of that coming from a year-to-year reduction in cash flow hedging gains.","So now as we look forward to 2016, we\u2019ll continue to deliver strong growth in our strategic imperatives. We expect some modest expansion in gross margin, and will continue to invest at high levels. And we\u2019ll continue to return value to shareholders,","through share repurchases and dividends.","Taking all of this into consideration, we expect Operating EPS of at least $13.50. This reflects an impact from currency of over a dollar of EPS, which is about a seven and a half point impact to the growth rate. Our free cash flow will follow our profit performance, and we continue to see our free cash flow realization in the nineties.","Looking at the quarterly skew, as you know the first quarter represents the smallest quarter in terms of contribution to our full year earnings. At this point in prior years our first quarter view has been from 14% of the full year to a few points higher than that. Given the magnitude of the currency headwind and the skew of our investments this year, we would expect the first quarter of 2016 to come in at about 15% of the $13.50.","Bottom line, we remain confident in our strategy, and in our ability to execute. And we look forward to continued progress in our transformation in 2016.","Now Patricia and I will take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and year. And second, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.","Operator, let\u2019s please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will begin to question-and-answer session of the conference.[Operator Instructions] First question is from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Sir, you may ask your question.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes, good afternoon, Martin. When you began 2015 you talked about software as really being kind of the pivot for whether you might hit the high end of your guidance range to the low end of your guidance range. And you anticipated or hoped that software would improve in the second half. What we saw was the opposite is that software decelerated significantly in the second half of this year. And I\u2019m wondering, if you could reflect on: A) what happened and B) while there should be some improvement next quarter because of less transaction and I gather the weather channel will be added into that division.","How do we think about software in 2016, should we be expecting a business that\u2019s down low single-digit at constant currency again? And perhaps you can talk about kind of the forces that play both again what happened in terms of deterioration in the second half and how we should think about the forces that play in 2016? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure thank you, thanks Toni. A few comments on software, so as we said in our prepared remarks, the deceleration third to fourth really was driven by this \u2013 by the mix shift and the continuation of the transaction closing rates that we saw in September. So we talked about \u2013 coming out of September we talked about a slower rate of closing in some of our larger deals and that\u2019s what we experienced as well in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, because of the mix shift alone we see an improvement and as you point out the weather company another acquisitions by the way to the extent that they are \u2013 have software in them they will obviously bolster that growth rate.","A few things, I think are important to note within software. First, as we said in our prepared remarks and the phenomena is really no different in the fourth and what we\u2019ve seen all year, our annuity business within the software business. So that\u2019s about 70% of our overall software stream. Our annuity business continues to grow. So that has a service in it, it has our subscription and support business in it as well, so that continues to grow.","And then outside of our largest clients and this is a phenomena that we\u2019ve been talking about, outside of our largest clients where they don\u2019t have as broad access to our software portfolio, we continue to see growth as well, both transactionally and they\u2019re obviously part of the asset service stream. Within the large clients as I mentioned earlier and as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we provide flexibility, it gives them \u2013 it gives our clients an ability now to manage their projects and they deploy maybe differently than they anticipated at the beginning of the year. From my discussions with our clients, a lot of that depends on the visibility they have both of their demand patterns and the visibility they have to sort of the \u2013 kinds of projects they might have to implement in the near-term.","So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s any different than what we\u2019ve experienced in the past. I would say that one of the things we look at closely, particularly with regard to the usage of our software and how it\u2019s getting deployed, is our ability to maintain these renewal rates on our subscription and support. And our renewal rates around the world remain very high in the mid-90s globally. And if we look in the U.S. where we had a weaker software transactional performance, actually our renewal rates in the U.S. are even higher than that, they are higher than they are in Japan, they are higher than they are in Europe, they are higher than they are in Australia. So our renewal rates continue in a very good track and that suggests that our annuity business within software has some good growth prospects.","But as we said in our prepared remarks again, just from the mix benefit of having more of that annuity mix in the first quarter, we will see an improvement. And then as you noted the acquisitions will sit on top of that.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Toni. We can go to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Katy, you may ask your question.","Katy Huberty","On a high note in servers both mainframe and power, how are you thinking about growth rates in 2016 as you move into the latter half of the cycle and how might that influence gross margins? It looks like it had an intact to the fourth quarter? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. Your question actually cut off a little bit. I think you said, finishing at a high note in the fourth quarter, I\u2019m going to assume that was the question, Katy. So, I\u2019ll answer for mainframe and for power and how we\u2019re entering 2016.","So first on mainframe, another very good cycle in mainframe, so as you know we announced that in the first quarter, the growth rates have been pretty consistent throughout, that we doubled in the first, growth in the second, good third quarter, again fourth quarter we finished at about 20% year-to-year of constant currency. And the adoption rates are consistent with what we would expect.","So for the full year the mainframe is up 35%. And as is typical in the mainframe cycle, margins in the announcement year tend to be a little bit lower. And we will see margin improvement as we get to the latter half of the \u2013 or the latter part of the mainframe cycle in 2016. From a power perspective, well I\u2019ll tell you, the power team has done a wonderful job of transforming a business. And I think it\u2019s a really good example of how IBM transforms its businesses.","So since as we put in the prepared remarks we have not grown since 2011 and in 2015, we grew each of the four quarters in the power business, finishing the fourth at plus eight. And I think what\u2019s underpins that and what\u2019s important to note is we continue to serve a decline in market for part of that Power business, the UNIX market is declining, it has been declining, but it\u2019s still high value and it\u2019s still serves a very important role in our clients environment and does some other most important works. So it \u2013 continues to be an important market place.","But at the same time, the team has been able to reinvent the platform, make it relevant in the Linux space so we\u2019re seeing very good Linux placements in Power and the applicability of that POWER8 platform in Cloud spaces for instance and running other ERP type missions has been a terrific boost to the overall growth rates.","And then keep in mind that we\u2019ve also \u2013 the team is also put in play from a business model perspective, the OpenPOWER Foundation, which is an intellectual property play. So that will also boost margins. So the Power, again the Power team has done a terrific job of repositioning a product which had a very strong acceptance and that\u2019s delivering high value in a declining market space into now a business that has grown four quarters in a row with a lot of leverage from here as our OpenPower consortium members start to deliver their own systems into that Linux space.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Katy. Rovena, can we go to the next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask on services if we can expect some improvement in growth in 2015 given the backlog chime you talked about that Martin. And also your confidence in services margin, expansion in 2016, because, if I heard correctly, no workforces were down saying in the fourth quarter. Is that a signal that you\u2019re on a good place with your offshore delivery right-sizing? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks Tien-tsin. So a couple of comments and I\u2019ll disaggregate, I guess I\u2019ll talk about GTS and GBS separately. So first, we did, as we said in our prepared remarks, we finished with a very good backlog growth of 1% ex-currency. Now that is $121 billion book of business. So even, 1% growth is a lot of additional business that we feel quite good about the backlog, we\u2019re entering with \u2013 and even when we look at the signings progress throughout the year, for the full year GTS, global technology services grew signings and GBS grew signings and in fact GBS exited fourth quarter with double-digit signings growth in the quarter. So a very strong return to growth which put them into growth for the year, so from a backlog perspective and from a relevance of our offerings perspective, I think those signings numbers suggest that there are substantial deals out there, there are deals that play well to \u2013 our high value view and our ability to move our clients into hybrid environment and our ability to continue to grow \u2013 to continue to grow that backlog.","From a margin perspective in GTS, keep in mind that at a total GTS level we have very good margins. But we also have a maintenance business in there which has a lot of margin within it. When you pull out the maintenance margin and just look at DSO business, we still see opportunities to expand margins in that area. And keep in mind, with regard to workforce rebalancing while we didn't have a charge in the fourth. We\u2019ll continue to remix our skills and we'll continue to move our work to where global delivery centers can best do it. So that will not be a year-to-year impact in the first quarter. But we will continue to remix skills and so as we bring on new contractors as an example and we've seen a lot of contract growth in Europe, we've seen a lot of contract growth in Asia. We will have an opportunity, we do have an opportunity to continue to expand our margins as we globalize some of that work.","Our movement of work into global delivery centers, it varies by geography and quite frankly its varies by country. In the U.S. we were in pretty good \u2013 we are in a pretty good spot here but where we sign new contracts obviously we take on a lot of people and we've got to figure out how do we optimize those delivery platforms. And then in GTS as we've talked about we continue to work our way through a transformation towards higher value and what we see from the margin perspective is that the work we're doing to digitize our clients front office the work we're doing to provide a cognitive solution to our clients which is just starting now to roll into our consulting results.","That is all high margin and we see a lot of opportunity continue to generate those kinds of margins. In the work we're transitioning out of, that is pretty price competitive and then and so we're seeing declining margins but more importantly as we shift the resources and as we move those skills there is a productivity hit to the overall business. So we're not relying on a dramatic net back if you will and our GBS margins going into the year but we do see a very good opportunity on the other side as we finish that transition.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Tien-tsin. Let's go to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian White from Drexel. Sir, you may ask your question.","Brian White","Yes, Martin, if we look at the different business segments in 2016, what businesses do you think have an opportunity to actually grow in constant currency and what businesses have an opportunity to expand margins in 2016? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Brian thanks. So a few comments, I think what we're going to see in 2016 is really the phenomena that we\u2019ve been talking about now for a couple of years which is our clients are investing heavily in these growing areas of cloud of analytics, of mobile, social and security and as you saw in the full year of 2015, we grew that 26%, right now it\u2019s 35% of our business. So our client discussions today are still built around those that shift into those parts of the business.","We\u2019ll also see a continued discussion around parts of a business where they\u2019re focused on us delivering productivity to them, now productivity to your clients means reduced revenues for us, but that\u2019s the phenomena we\u2019ve been in. And so when we look at 2016, I think we'll see a continuation of both of those. As you know in 2015, we ended the year with a revenue base it was about 1% smaller than it was the prior year given those two dynamics strong growth in the strategic imperatives and delivering productivity to our clients in the rest.","So that probably \u2013 that trend is what we\u2019re going to see now the mix obviously be different the strategic imperatives are representing a larger part of the business than they did in then where they started in 2015, but that trend will continue. On a segment-by-segment basis, GTS has grown now three quarters of the year and as I said with pretty good backlog growth and we think that trajectory continues to hold.","GBS improved in the fourth, relative to the third, so a sequential improvement in its year-to-year growth rate. But we\u2019re not relying on that bouncing back rapidly as we know we\u2019re going through a transition there, and we want to get through that transition as rapidly as possible. But having said that, about half of their business now is in strategic imperatives, but half isn\u2019t so we\u2019re going to continue that transition.","The systems business will continue to see momentum as I mentioned in the power business where the team has done a terrific job of repositioning the platform. But the mainframe is coming into the back half of the cycle and so we won\u2019t see the same growth levels that we saw. And then software as I mentioned in response to the prior question that transactional mix will not play as bigger role in the first quarter as it did in the fourth and so obviously we\u2019ll see how we transition through the year, but bolstering that software growth will also be some of the acquisitions.","So I think there are discussions with our clients, as I started with the discussions with our clients are going to reflect these two halves of our business which is discussions around moving to the future and the other discussion are helping them drive productivity.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Brian. Rovena, can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Sure, Ma\u2019am. Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Sir, you may ask your question","Steve Milunovich","Great, thank you. Could you talk a bit about free cash flow you said free cash flow will follow profit. Does that literally mean you expect about $13.50 in free cash flow per share? I would think maybe not given that you had a $3 billion positive swing on the cash taxes and maybe you could go through cash taxes, pension, working capital, CapEx, some of the swing factors and where you think that I\u2019ll come out on free cash flow this year.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Steve, and you\u2019re right. We \u2013 what my reported remarks or my remarks we\u2019re not intended to say, we\u2019re going to do $13.50 in free cash flow per share. That was not the intent. But what I \u2013 we do want to say is that our free cash flow performance in absolute terms will follow the profit performance. So a few comments, first we did have a year-to-year reduction in our cash taxes. But keep in mind that in 2015 our cash tax rate and our book rate were pretty similar.","And so the relationship you see in 2015 is the right relationship, yes, year-to-year there was a benefit, but that\u2019s because we had a very high cash tax rate in 2014. So the 2015 relationship, which we \u2013 where we produced 98% of our debt net income was the realization per free cash flow is the one we\u2019re talking about for 2016 as well we see that relationship. Now within that \u2013 the guidance that $13.50 \u2013 at least $13.50 we translate the free cash flow kind of in the $11 billion to $12 billion range.","And within that we have assumed some growth in CapEx for the year, as we continue to drive our cloud platform and our investments in there and our system, our services business. The operational performance that\u2019s embedded within that obviously will have an impact. Then the rest and I\u2019ll give you a few pluses and minuses here. The rest kind of translates to basically flat. So really is the profit performance. So we\u2019ll have slightly higher income tax payments as an example.","We\u2019ll have a less \u2013 a little bit of a less benefit of working capital. We have slightly lower pension payments, we have slightly lower workforce rebalancing payments assume. So you put all that together and what I meant by free cash flow will follow profit is that free cash flow at $11 billion to $12 billion of free cash flow roughly translates to what we see in profit performance at that at least number.","Bear in mind that, as we talked about on profit. There\u2019s about $1.3 billion impact of profit year-to-year from currency. And while the dynamics are a little bit different in cash flow that does translate roughly to the impact to free cash flow as well. So what you\u2019re seeing in here in our guidance, which was a big impact from currency, is also a big impact in free cash flow for next year.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Steve. Rovena, can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman from Stifel Financial. You may ask your question sir.","David Grossman","Thank you. So Martin, if I read the press release right, it said the strategic imperatives decelerated through about 16% growth year-over-year at constant currency. That\u2019s obviously down from where you were in the first three quarters. What were the primary components driving the deceleration? And what would be a reasonable target for growth in those strategic imperatives in 2016?","Martin Schroeter","Sure. Thanks, David. So a couple of things, as we said for the year we were at \u2013 we had very good growth of $29 billion. What we saw in the quarter was about $1.7 billion sequential increase in strategic imperative revenue. And that\u2019s better than it was first to second, better than second to third. So we did see kind of a typical seasonal sequential improvement in our strategic imperatives from third to fourth. When we talk about our strategic imperatives at Investor Day, we said they\u2019ve been growing kind of in this uncanny rate of 18, 18, 19, 19, 19 very steady over the last few years. And we said that our model assumes that we will transition to those areas at a similar kind of rates, I think we had 15 to 19, think of it as high-teens if you will.","As we went through this year and as we said at the beginning, first quarter we printed over 30, and as we said we\u2019re not relying on that throughout the year. So we finished the year on a full-year basis, now relative to that 15 to 19 range, where we finished at 26% growth year-to-year. So we\u2019re ahead of what we expected. We\u2019re transitioning into those areas faster than we had expected back at Investor Day. And so we finished at 35% of the revenue streams. And again in Investor Day, we said by 2018 we get to about 40 or at least 40.","We think we\u2019re in good shape to make it there, but 26, we\u2019re pleased with, because we\u2019re transitioning faster than we have over the last four years or five years. And again, it\u2019s on a higher base. So we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019re making and continuing to grow these strategic imperatives.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, David. Can we go to next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Martin Schroeter","Jim, we can\u2019t hear you if you are on mute.","James Schneider","Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me now?","Martin Schroeter","Yes.","Patricia Murphy","We can.","James Schneider","Okay, sorry. Just in terms of the software performance during the quarter, can you maybe talk about the impact and quantify the impact you saw from the ELA, because there is no weakness in Q4. And then can you maybe give us some kind of bracketing for 2016 about what impact you expect from ELAs to the extent you can see it going forward over the next couple of quarters?","Martin Schroeter","Well, sure, Jim. So a few things, one, and I\u2019m not saying you implied this, but ELAs are very \u2013 ELAs are Enterprise License Agreements for all of our listeners. ELAs, Enterprise License Agreements are very powerful \u2013 a very powerful way for our clients to consume our software, gives them broad access to the portfolio we offer like our middleware platform, which is quite valuable to them as they think about their hybrid cloud environment.","So we do more ELAs, more Enterprise License Agreements, we did more in 2015 and we did in 2014. We haven\u2019t seen a dramatic change in the length of time our clients commit to the platform for those. As I mentioned on an earlier question, our renewal rates for the subscription and support that underpins their deployment of those continues at very high rates.","So the ELA structure is one that we think is \u2013 and our client think as a terrific way to consume our portfolio. Now parts of our portfolio will continue to \u2013 will continue to be consumed on an EL basis \u2013 ELA basis. And as you saw us, maybe you saw us, earlier this year we moved parts of our middleware portfolio into our cloud business. That\u2019s really a reflection of the importance our middleware places in these hybrid cloud environment. So some of that could get start to get consumed in different models from ELAs that \u2013 maybe they get consumed on a more individual basis, maybe they get consumed on an as-a-Service basis, but the ELA construct remains quite powerful.","As I noted earlier, the big difference we saw was in the breath of the access that some of our clients have and they \u2013 because they don\u2019t have the visibility they need to their demand environment or because they don\u2019t have visibility to the most immediate need they might have, they\u2019ll move around the deployment of those licenses into different areas. But again with our renewal right staying high, we know that they are still consuming those. So the ELA construct quite powerful. It\u2019s the right way I think for our clients to consume our software and the right way to give them flexibility to deploy it.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Jim. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia from CLSA. You may now ask your question.","Lou Miscioscia","Hey thanks. Hey, Martin, Lou here. So just sticking on the software, if you go back to the second half of 2014 when the flexible pricing started to hit software growth in a meaningful way and then obviously it hit it all through 2015, when are we going to get the grandfathering position where we can get half the flexible price in which \u2013 I know that when we talked about this before you\u2019ve said that it was the right thing to do for the customer. But customers want everything for free and I assume you are not trying to move through an open source type of model. So I\u2019m just wondering when we can get passed and what else you can do to try to get software growth in your most profitable area in the company?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Louis. So a couple of things that I\u2019d say. First, this is the right thing to do to offer our clients flexibility as they try to get insights into their demand environments and as they try to deploy their projects. So it is absolutely the right thing to do. We felt that way when we started talking about, and I think it\u2019s still the right thing to do.","Again, what\u2019s important to us is that they commit to the platform, number one. Number two that they are actually deploying the software and we see that as I mentioned in our renewal rates where as long as our renewal rates are staying high we know they\u2019re using our software. So all of that is good for the model. And in the long-term, we think that we will benefit from all this. Now, bolstering our software growth this year and our software performance this year will be some acquisitions we made, so those will certainly help as we go through the year, but this is \u2013 again, it\u2019s the right thing to do for our clients.","And as we continue to move our software into a broader and broader ecosystem, we\u2019ll continue to see growth in those clients that that don\u2019t have access to so much, so that will continue. But from an overall perspective with the acquisitions, which will help a bit, and again our renewal rates staying high. Over the long-term, this is a terrific business for us.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks. We\u2019ll go to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Sir, you may ask your question.","Keith Bachman","Hi, many thanks. I also wanted to focus on the software area. I think on the last call you mentioned that Software-as-a-Service was a small part of your existing portfolio, I think around 5% of revenues. As you think about 2016, could you address how you see the growth of as-a-Service impacting your software both revenue growth and profitability? And more specifically, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve gotten a specific answer on can you grow software in 2016 and will your margins be up down or flat? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Keith. So, a few things. So, our SaaS revenue overall as a percentage of our total software business is still fairly small percentage, but it is growing and is growing quite well and we are always releasing new SaaS and acquiring new SaaS opportunities. So we see continued very strong growth in our SaaS portfolio into 2016. Now, it\u2019s small and so relative to the total, it\u2019s not going to drive a ton at the top-line, but over the long-term this will be a good economic model for IBM.","Additionally, the new businesses we\u2019re building have this strong SaaS component or as-a-Service component to them. So, Watson for instance is an as-a-Service offering. Our new Watson Health business has built heavily on an as-a-Service offerings. And other as well are moving into much more heavily weighted to our as-a-Service. So the as-a-Service fees, which is part of our overall as-a-Service exit run rate $5.3 billion has pretty good growth in it. In terms of profitability, we talked in our prepared remarks about continued margin expansion in 2016. And part of that quite frankly is going to be driven by additional volumes on our as-a-Service platform, that\u2019s both Software-as-a-Service, infrastructure-as-a-service and our platform-as-a-service, our Bluemix property.","So we will see as those revenues climb, we will see profitability in fact margin expansion out of those \u2013 excuse me as-a-Service properties. Within SaaS specifically, our margins and software are quite high while the move into a SaaS model is not accretive to margins in software. It\u2019s not a big impact and it is accretive to margins and total IBM because we don\u2019t have a lot of these SaaS properties. So, in 2016, we see margin improvements across our as-a-Service properties. Margins within SaaS specifically are accretive to IBM and we see that continue in 2016.","Patricia Murphy","Okay. Thanks. Rovena, can we please take one last question?","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am. Thank you. Our last question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Sir, you may ask your question.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks. Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess \u2013 Martin just in the strategic imperatives revenue stream that you guys have, you absolutely have a fair bit of scale over the margin right now, especially in Analytics and Cloud. Can you explain and talk about what do you think the margin and the free cash flow profile of the strategic imperatives assets is versus overall IBM, I think that would be helpful for people to understand? And then is the mix of strategic imperatives, software service and hardware change a whole lot from the last analyst have you guys talked about it?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Amit, a few things. I will answer the strategic imperative revenue part of your non-multipart question first. So on the strategic imperative revenue, I guess, the margin profile of that for the bulk of that business, which is focused on again Cloud or on our Analytics business, for a lot of that it just looks like our existing margin profile. So, where we\u2019re selling our hardware, where we\u2019re selling our software in for our clients to build an Analytic solution or for them to build their own Cloud then the margin profile looks like IBM\u2019s.","And as you know IBM is a high margin solution company. For the as-a-Service component of that, the margins are a little bit lower than that. Now a lot of that is because we don\u2019t yet have the scale that we\u2019d like or is it\u2019s that differently we\u2019re investing very heavily in order to drive that platform into our clients\u2019 environment. And so, we\u2019ll see margin improvement as we go into 2016 as we add more scale or take advantage if you will of the investments we have made. So in total the strategic imperative revenue over time will not have a dramatically different margin profile than what we see today. Again, because most of it has what is our margin profile today and the rest will continue to improve margins as our investment rates or as our revenue growth rates meet up and the capacity meets up with the investment rates.","Relative to the mix, our software mix within our strategic imperatives is still at about twice as high as the rest, if you will, the rest of the business. So as you know in across services, hardware and software, if you look at the mix of those, the software piece in the strategic imperatives twice as high as what we see in the rest of the business. Now, it is down a little bit year-to-year as we in any given year or any given quarter, we have a different mix. We have certain programs that roll in, but it remains on \u2013 in total at about twice as high a mix as what we have in our core business. Thanks, Amit.","Martin Schroeter","So let me just wrap up the call with a couple of comments, first, and I think we have been clear about this. We manage our business for the long-term. And in 2015, we made a lot of progress, a lot of very good progress in transforming the IBM company. You see this not only in the growth rate in the strategic imperatives, but importantly you see it in the big steps we\u2019ve taken to address some of these new opportunities. We had an opportunity last year to invest quite a bit of capital. We bought 14 companies. We will continue to be acquisitive.","So with the returns we\u2019re seeing on our investments, we are more and more encouraged that the strategy is right and that we\u2019re executing to transform IBM. In 2016, we\u2019ll have our Investor Day in February. We\u2019re going to talk more about both the transformation of IBM. We\u2019re going to talk about how we present their information to the financial community to help understand IBM, particularly as we emerge as a cognitive solutions and Cloud platform company. I think it\u2019s very important to understand what IBM is emerging as and again we\u2019ll talk about that in our Investor Day.","So, thank you very much for joining the call today, and we\u2019ll see you in February.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time."],"11841":["International Business Machines Corp.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the meeting over to Miss Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President Investor Relations for IBM. I\u2019m here today with Martin Schroeter, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our second quarter earnings presentation. The prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I\u2019ll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from us in Investor Relations.","Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to their related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You\u2019ll find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call to Martin Schroeter.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks, Patricia. In the second quarter, we generated $20.2 billion in revenue, $3.5 billion in pre-tax income and $2.95 of operating earnings per share.","Ninety days ago, we told you what we expected for the second quarter. We said we\u2019d continue to see strength in the strategic imperatives and we delivered 12% revenue growth led by cloud. We said we\u2019d continue to build as-a-service capabilities. Our cloud-as-a-service revenue was up 50% and we exited the quarter with an annual run rate of $6.7 billion in our cloud-as-a-service businesses. That\u2019s up from $5.4 billion last quarter. Certainly we have a benefit from the acquisitions recently closed but we has solid organic growth as well.","We said we\u2019d continue a high level of investment as we move into new areas and build new markets, and we did that both organically and through acquisitions. And we said that, given seasonality and actions we took in the first quarter, we\u2019d grow our pre-tax income by about $2 billion quarter to quarter, and we grew a bit more than that. In total, we got done what we set out to do and we saw some improvements in trajectory relative to long-term trends, though, as always, the rate and pace varied by business unit and geography.","Let me touch quickly on some of the drivers for the quarter. As I said, we continued to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our strategic imperatives. Over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered $31 billion in revenue, and now represent 38% of IBM. Growth was led by cloud, where our revenue was up 30% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, and over $11.5 billion over the last year so good progress in cloud. Looking at revenue from a segment perspective, the strongest growth came from cognitive solutions led by our analytics and cognitive capabilities and security.","In technology services and cloud platforms, our infrastructure services revenue continues to grow while integration software declined as we shift those offerings to cloud. And our GTS backlog grew on the back of strong signings. Our systems business again reflects the product cycle dynamics in terms of revenue and margin. And Global Business Services continues to reflect a shift in our business. We\u2019re continuing to deliver double-digit growth in the strategic areas led by mobile and cloud and our application management business is stable though pressure in the more traditional areas of consulting and some inconsistency in our execution continue to impact the GBS results.","As we shift IBM\u2019s business overall, it\u2019s important to understand that we\u2019re not only moving them to new spaces but in fact creating entirely new markets. So as I said, we\u2019re investing at a high level both by growing organic investment in areas like our Watson platform capabilities and our cloud data center capacity and getting acquisitions into our run rate. Our investments together with currency, product cycle dynamics, and the actions we took in the first quarter are reflected in our profit performance in the first half of this year. I\u2019ll talk about how the second half plays out relative to the first later in the call as we continue to expect to deliver at least 13.50 of operating earnings per share for the year.","Let me spend a minute on what we\u2019ve got done as we move into new areas and become a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company. Clients are looking to become digital businesses and our cognitive solutions bring together digital business with digital intelligence to improve decision-making and add intelligence into all products and processes. For example, companies such as Kimberly-Clark, the ISS group, and sesame workshop announced in the second quarter they are working with IBM on innovative Internet of Things solutions for everything from facilities management to early childhood education.","Healthcare organizations such as the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and the American Diabetes Association were among many in the quarter that announced they are leveraging Watson to create new approaches to treatment and patient care. And in the second quarter, we announced Watson for cyber security, a new cloud based version of our cognitive technology trained on the language of security. What these innovative client initiatives have in common is that they are industry-based cognitive solutions enabled by the IBM cloud and all of this is supporting the movement of our clients to hybrid environments.","This quarter, we extended our cloud innovations available on Bluemix including the first Apache Spark development environment for data scientists to more quickly and easily analyze big data. We delivered new IoT services using Bluemix OpenWhisk, our event driven programming model to speed development of IoT applications on the IBM cloud. We announced block chain agreements with banks such as Mizuho and Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Ark\u00e9a and we opened a Bluemix garage in New York City to help financial services clients rapidly design, build, and pilot their own block chain solutions as well as other emerging fintech applications and services.","We leveraged recent acquisitions in Clearleap, Cleversafe and Ustream to announce new Video-on-Demand services deals with major brands such as Mazda, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Comic-Con. We also continue to partner with major IT industry players, leveraging IBM\u2019s unique hybrid platform to grow and extend their own offerings and client migrations. For example, we announced that IBM cloud would be a strategic partner of Box Zones in Europe and Asia. Box Zones and the IBM cloud will uniquely enable clients to store and manage data across hybrid environments in the country of their choice and we expanded our global partnership with VMware to deliver desktop services in a security-rich environment on the IBM cloud.","We also announced a breakthrough in making quantum computing available on the IBM cloud. The IBM Quantum Experience is a great example of how cloud is making emerging technologies available that wouldn\u2019t have been accessible in the past. This kind of open innovation will allow for the next stage of development in quantum information technology and help push a universal quantum computer to reality even faster. Now Quantum isn\u2019t a new idea. Researchers have been working on it for a long time. But it\u2019s a not niche either. On the day we announced it, it generated 138 million Twitter impressions and to give you a sense of that level of interest, it\u2019s fewer than Andy Murray when he won Wimbledon. But it\u2019s more than the impressions generated by Phil Mickelson\u2019s record tying score in the first round of the Open last Thursday.","Since the launch in May, we already have active users in nearly 150 countries that have run more than 175,000 experiments through the IBM Quantum Experience. As we move into new areas, we\u2019re also continuing to deliver innovation in the core. For example, in Infrastructure Services, we\u2019re shifting from being a systems integrator to a services integrator, connecting and streamlining multiple environments and delivering as-a-service solutions to our clients. You see this in our recent engagements with Pratt & Whitney and Emirates.","To help systems innovation, this quarter we acquired EZSource to help developers quickly and easily update mainframe applications. And in software we entered into an agreement with a strategic partner to license the intellectual property of some of our assets within our core software portfolio to accelerate product innovation and extend the capabilities to hybrid cloud. I\u2019ll expand on some of these solutions and go into more detail on our strategic imperatives performance in the segment discussions. But first let me walk through our financial metrics for the quarter.","Our revenue for the quarter was $20.2 billion. While there was a lot of movement in individual currencies in total, currency translation had a 20 basis point impact to revenue growth. I\u2019ll talk to our performance at constant currency. Our revenue is down 2.5%, and on a geographic basis Americas was down 2%. This was an improvement from last quarter\u2019s rate across the U.S., Canada and Latin America. Europe was weaker, due primarily to Germany and Switzerland. And Asia Pacific was down about 2%. And with strong growth in India once again, and sequential improvement in all of the BRIC countries, the BRIC\u2019s returned to growth. Our gross margin performance reflects higher levels of investment, especially in cognitive solutions and the fact that we\u2019re building scale in our as-a-service businesses.","Looking at expense on a year-to-year basis, there are a few items to note. First is an increase in investment levels. We also have a higher level of IP income this quarter due primarily to the licensing partnership I just mentioned. And while not an impact to this year, we did have work force rebalancing charges last year as well as some gains that mitigated those charges. And finally, we have a year-to-year impact from currency as last year\u2019s hedging gains roll off. In fact, at a PTI level, when you consider both the hedge and the translation impact, currency impacted profit growth by about $250 million.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 19% all in, at the higher end of the range we provided at the beginning of the year, which you will remember was 18% plus or minus a couple of points without discrete items. From a cash perspective we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and more than $13 billion over the last 12 months. This is over 100% of our GAAP net income, and over the same period we returned about 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and gross share purchases.","As we get into the segments, remember our strategy and point of view is that to be successful you need to bring together cognitive solutions to improve decision-making and outcomes, to approach that with an industry context and skills, and to enable that in a hybrid environment to get the agility of the cloud while leveraging the breadth of an enterprise data and processes. Now I\u2019ll talk about how each of our segments plays a critical role in how we capture these opportunities.","Starting with our Cognitive Solutions segment where revenue growth accelerated to 4% in the second quarter. We had sequential improvement in both solutions software and transaction processing software. Our solutions software revenue was up 6% for the quarter. Our strong performance in SAS continued with double-digit growth in revenue. Growth was led by analytics and security, and acquisitions clearly provided lift.","Our Analytics business is the largest portion of the solutions software portfolio. Analytics grew in key areas including Cognos, information integration and big data, and of course Watson as we add to our capabilities. The Weather Company acquisition is off to a good start as we integrate it with Watson Technology.","In June, we introduced Watson Adds [ph], leveraging the weather platform, which delivers as many as 26 billion forecasts daily. Consumers will be able to interact with IBM Watson through advertising, by asking questions and receiving relevant product information. Campbell, Unilever and GSK Consumer Healthcare will be the first marketers to collaborate with The Weather Company on Watson Adds [ph].","Security had strong revenue growth and together with our Security Services we outpaced the market by 3X. Our momentum is driven by our unique market position. We have built an extensive security portfolio tailored to the needs of our clients for integrated security across their entire operations. As a result, we\u2019re the number one enterprise security software and services provider and hold a leadership position in 12 of the 14 segments according to Forrester, IDC and Gartner.","This quarter we closed our Resilient acquisition, adding leading incident response technology and expertise to our portfolio. We had strong demand for our Guardian offerings as we saw clients moving to our database security offerings across a range of industries including Information Services and banking. And in May we announced Watson for cyber security, a new cognitive system we have been training and will make available in a beta program later this year for use by our customers. As part of this announcement, eight leading universities will also train Watson in the language of security.","We\u2019re growing and broadening the reach of Watson with new capabilities, partnerships, and engagements to accelerate adoption. Clients across industries are expanding their Watson engagements, moving from pilot use cases in consulting engagements into long-term production. As an example, in the second quarter, design software leader Autodesk signed a multi-year production SAS agreement with Watson to leverage Watson Engagement Advisor. This engagement builds on the value and strong usage proven during the pilot to resolve customer inquiries. This is one demonstration of our focus on the core conversational service for client applications and the developer community.","We also introduced new offerings such as Watson Company Analyzer, which helps companies reduce the time and effort required to collect, digest, and synthesize information for building strategic business relationships and understanding competitive market spaces. And in Watson Health, we continue to capitalize on our differentiated ability to understand, reason, and learn with industry specialization.","We launched Watson Care Manager, which provides structured programs and tools to support care coordinators in delivering care to patients. This offering enables patients to avoid rehospitalization. In the second quarter, we extended partnerships with the American Cancer Society and the American Diabetes Association, which are examples of the strong support and momentum Watson Health has with leading clinical and research communities. And at the White House Cancer Moon Shot Summit, we made a commitment to utilize our cognitive solutions to help doctors offer personalized care to 10,000 veterans fighting cancer.","We\u2019re working with Teva, a large pharmaceuticals client to improve drug efficacy for millions of patients with complex and chronic diseases by leveraging the IBM Watson Health cloud solution. We formed a medical imaging collaborative with 15 industry leaders to put Watson to work extracting insights from invisible unstructured imaging data. And in April, we closed the Truven acquisition. The data and insights from Truven will be integrated into our Watson Health cloud.","So now looking at the profit results for the segment. Gross margin was down largely driven by mix shift to SAS and higher investments including acquisition content. Pre-tax income performance continues to reflect our higher level of investment and strategic growth areas like Watson platform, Health, and IoT again this quarter. Global Business Services delivered $4.3 billion of revenue. Our performance was similar to recent quarters with continued growth in our strategic imperatives, offset by declines in the more traditional consulting areas.","We saw double digit growth in our digital practices around cloud, analytics, mobility, security, and cognitive. And we continue to aggressively shift resources and investments to drive these businesses.","Our GBS team leads the industry mission for IBM as we have amassed over 100,000 industry resources. Our consultants build strategies that help our clients gain new insights on data and launch new business models for competitive advantage. We\u2019re scaling the industry\u2019s first cognitive consulting practice which draws on the expertise of more than 2,000 consulting professionals spanning machine learning, advanced analytics, data science, and development.","We continue to ramp the IBM interactive experience. We have opened over 30 digital studios around the globe including new studios in Singapore and Seoul. We also completed the acquisition of Aperto, a digital agency in Berlin with over 300 employees and a roster of enterprise clients such as Airbus and Siemens. We\u2019re shifting away from traditional on premise ERP to cloud-based application management and consulting. We closed on the acquisition of Bluewolf this quarter, a top sales force partner and recognized leader in cloud consulting and implementation services.","We\u2019re also growing our services on workday applications, leveraging the skills we brought on through our Meteorix acquisition last year. Overall, we delivered 60% growth in our cloud practice this quarter. Application Management remains stable as clients look to us to manage the lifecycle of their applications, and bring new applications to market faster through digital cloud platforms.","Turning to profit. GBS gross profit and PTI margins were down year-to-year. These margin declines reflect the investments we\u2019re making in our digital practices as well as some issues in our execution. And in some of the traditional service areas that are not as differentiated, we\u2019re seeing price and profit pressure. We continue to invest and shift resources to our higher value services around digital and cognitive.","We\u2019re also taking actions to improve our delivery efficiency and execution while remaining focused on our commitment to our clients\u2019 success.","Technology services and cloud platforms delivered nearly $9 billion of revenue with growth in infrastructure services offset by declines in technical support services and integration software. Across the segment, our strategic imperatives were also up strong double digits. We had strong signings performance in GTS and the backlog for the segment continued to grow.","We saw continued momentum in infrastructure services as clients turned to us to optimize their IT environments and move them to cloud. We again had strong growth in the IBM cloud. Our point of view is that clients can unlock the most value for their businesses by moving to hybrid cloud infrastructures which provide agility and enable new business models while at the same time tie back to their core systems of record. We always said that hybrid capabilities are critical for an enterprise grade cloud and we continue to lead in a rapidly growing hybrid cloud market. We\u2019re shifting from systems integration to services integration as we connect multiple environments and build out hybrid infrastructures, delivered as a service to the client.","Our as-a-service revenue for the segment was up over 50% for the quarter. We continue to sign transformative agreements with clients to optimize their infrastructure and help digitize their operations. At Pratt & Whitney, we\u2019ll move their business, manufacturing, and engineering enterprise systems to a fully managed environment on the IBM cloud. They\u2019re expecting to double their engine production by 2020 and we\u2019ll provide them with the means to manage, analyze, and grow their infrastructure dramatically to accommodate the company\u2019s growth.","And this quarter, we signed a seven-year $1.3 billion agreement with CSC to expand our cloud partnership and build a secure scaleable and flexible mainframe infrastructure that will enable CSC to economically scale up and down demand to address current and future client needs and reduce its capital outlays. This builds on announcement earlier this year that integrated Bluemix into their cloud management platform. Bluemix provides our clients with speed and agility in launching new business models and applications in the cloud. And along with the rest of the integration software portfolio, it\u2019s at the heart of our hybrid cloud strategy. Overall, integration software revenue declined.","From a product perspective we had continued strength in our connect products as clients integrate applications, data, and processes for both on-prem and cloud-based acquisitions. Across integration software, our annuity content is growing and we accelerate the shift to an as-of-service consumption model through new cloud capabilities delivered on our Bluemix cloud platform. For example, this year Kaiser Permanente began its move to the IBM cloud and Bluemix as the strategic platform for their transformation to a more agile data driven organization engaging with millions of individual members and patients. This will allow them to take advantage of new technologies, existing data and back end systems in a hybrid model.","Turning to profit, our gross profit was down year-to-year driven by the mix of businesses within the segment. Our PTI margin also reflects this business mix impact as well as the investments we\u2019re making to build out our cloud platforms. Additionally, this quarter we entered into an agreement with one of our strategic business partners where we will license the intellectual property of select assets within the integration software portfolio while jointly going to market to ensure our clients\u2019 success. This will shift our spending profile for these assets to a more variable cost structure anything forward.","Systems revenue was down consistent with the cycle. Our systems hardware revenue was down 28%. Operating system software revenue was down 4% this quarter, which is a modest sequential improvement in year-to-year performance but as we said, we expect operating systems to continue to be a drag on growth. Revenues for our z Systems declined 40% in the second quarter while margins improved, consistent with where we are in the product cycle. We\u2019re continuing to expand the z client base adding 13 new clients in the quarter and nearly 70 since the beginning of the cycle. We had had our first major z13 win in China this quarter with a large Chinese bank migrating its mainframe install base to our latest technology. We\u2019re continuing to drive innovation in the z Systems platform. ","As I mentioned earlier, we acquired EZSource, which will help our clients modify applications for their digital transformation while also supporting agility and hybrid cloud. Our revenue was down in the second quarter with growth in the mid-range offset by declines in the high and the low end. The UNIX market is a high value space that\u2019s been declining and we represent the majority of the market. Our performance here reflects the replacement dynamic, following strong performance in the high end of POWER8 in the second quarter of last year. While the midrange has been growing year-to-year, we will see a similar replacement dynamic in the third quarter as we ramp on the midrange POWER8 introduction.","We\u2019re also addressing the growing Linux market, and this quarter we grew year to year and quarter to quarter with our Linux on Power strategy. It is becoming a more meaningful part of our business with over 10% of our POWER revenue in the second quarter. We have seen particular success with Hanna [ph], a play that we started a year ago. We will expand the Linux-only portfolio by leveraging OpenPOWER, we plan to bring two new servers supporting cloud-enabled big data and cognitive applications to our portfolio and release our second generation HPC [ph] server with POWER8 processors connected to an Nvidia GPU acceleration.","Turning to Storage, as we said in the past, storage value is shifting to software, which is reported in our Cognitive Solutions segment. In Storage Software, we\u2019re continuing to grow software-defined storage, which includes object storage and our newly introduced Spectrum suite offerings. Storage hardware revenue decreased 13%, which continues to reflect weakness in the traditional disc storage market. We released the new all flash DSAK [ph] storage offering during the second quarter, giving us competitive differentiation with plans to deliver all flash offerings across the entire portfolio.","Our Systems gross profit and pre-tax income declined, reflecting the revenue performance. Our Systems gross profit margin was flat with margin improvements in both z Systems and POWER, offset by lower storage margins and the impact of mix.","So now after going through the segments, I want to address the performance of software across our segments. Our total software revenue was up 1%, driven by an acceleration in the annuity content. Subscription and support revenue was up reflecting increased deployment by our clients and steady renewal rates. And the investments in new areas are paying off with growth in SAS. Acquisitions contributed to that growth, and we also grew our annuity base on an organic basis. I will remind you that while the SAS acquisitions add to the top line, they\u2019re a drag to profit in the first year.","Looking at the annuity growth by business area, we had strong growth in cognitive solutions as well as integration software, while the annuity content in operating systems declined.","Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet, we generated $3.1 billion of cash from operations excluding our financing receivables. After a billion investment in CapEx, we generated $2.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. For the first half, free cash flow of nearly $4.5 billion is essentially flat year to year, with lower cash taxes offsetting the year-to-year operational performance. These first half results support our expectation that we will deliver the high end of the full-year free cash flow guidance range we provided earlier this year. This takes into account the cash payments related to the work force rebalancing charge taken earlier in the year as well as the timing of tax payments in the second half.","Looking at the uses of cash in the first half, we have invested $5.4 billion in acquisitions. So far this year, we have acquired 11 businesses, including Truven Health Analytics and the digital assets of The Weather Company. In the last six months we have returned $4.4 billion to shareholders, including $2.6 billion in dividends. In April, we again raised our dividend, and with that we\u2019ve now doubled our dividend per share since 2010. In the first half, we bought back over 12 million shares and we ended June with 956 million shares outstanding and 3.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Moving to the balance sheet, we ended June with $10.6 billion in cash. Our total debt was about $44.5 billion of which $26.5 billion was in support of our Financing business. The leverage in our Financing business remains at seven-to-one, and the portfolio remains strong at 52% investment grade. You can see more on this topic in our supplemental material in the backup.","Our non-financing debt was 18 billion, and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 59%. The increase in both reflect the timing of our debt issuances relative to maturities this year. Our balance sheet continues to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long-term.","So now let me wrap up and talk about our view of the second half and put it in context of the first half performance. We thought we\u2019d lay it out on a slide for you. You\u2019ll recall in the first quarter we took significant actions to transform our workforce and change the way we work, resulting in significant workforce rebalancing and real estate charges. As we said, this is about rebalancing skills more than capacity reduction, and so these actions free up spend that can be reinvested to build capabilities as well as contributing to the bottom line. We\u2019ve started to see some savings already, but the majority of the growth savings we\u2019ll see in 2016 will come in the fourth quarter. We mapped all of that out in our last call, and we\u2019re right on track.","As expected, our mainframe product cycle also had an impact to our EPS growth in the first half. As we enter the second half, our mainframe compares will get easier. In fact, we expect mainframe to be fairly neutral to EPS growth. Over the last 12 months, we have been investing at a high level both organically and through acquisitions, as we build cognitive and cloud capabilities. The organic investments had a mid-single digit impact on our EPS growth. As we wrap on the higher level of spend in the back half of last year, this will have less of an impact on EPS growth over the next two quarters.","We\u2019ve completed 20 acquisitions over the last year. The acquired content is contributing to our top line and will continue to do so in the second half because these are primarily as-a-service capabilities and require additional investment as we create new spaces, they have a return profile with a longer payback. The acquisitions we\u2019ve completed to date had a low-single digit impact to our EPS growth rate in the first half. They\u2019ll continue to be dilutive in the second half, though at a lower level. Many of these new capabilities are delivered as a service. As these ramp, it\u2019ll benefit our second half relative to the first, not only from a software mix perspective, but adding scale will also help our margins.","And of course, we\u2019ve talked about the impact of currency on our profit growth in 2016, due primarily to the roll-off of last year\u2019s hedging gains. We can\u2019t predict where currently will go from here, but at current spot rates the impact from currency will moderate in the second half due to year-to-year hedging dynamics and a slightly better translational environment. And finally, you\u2019ll recall we had a significant discrete tax benefit in the first quarter. Relative to the ongoing effective tax rate, we continue to expect to be in the range we provided at the beginning of the year. Put it all together, and we expect our second half EPS dynamics to be significantly improved over the first and continue to expect to deliver at least $13.50 of operating EPS for the year.","So with that financial context to our second half from a business perspective, we\u2019ll continue to focus on using cognitive to help clients get value from their data, to improve decision-making and outcomes, moving our clients to hybrid cloud environments and with a strong industry dimension. As we do that, we\u2019re moving into new spaces and, in some cases, creating entirely new markets. We\u2019ll continue to shift our business toward our strategic imperatives, with strong growth in our as-a-service offerings and continued growth in software. And we\u2019ll continue to invest to add capabilities and to deliver innovation across the business, all while returning value to shareholders.","And so with that, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Katy Huberty","Thanks. Good afternoon. You didn\u2019t mention the UK in your commentary around EMEA. How did the headlines around Brexit impact the month of June? And did it have any impact on not raising the full-year outlook despite beats in the first and second quarter? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Katie. Thank you. So we certainly \u2013 I don\u2019t think that Brexit coming at the end of the quarter helped us at all, but we obviously finished kind of right where we expected to finish. And when we look at our full view of the year, we don\u2019t see an impact, if you will, that has any real materiality on us. And that\u2019s why we continue to hold our operating EPS. So it certainly didn\u2019t help but, again, no \u2013 nothing that said we should change our operating EPS for the year. What I typically observe in these kinds of instances is that our discussions with our clients have to go through a process of reprioritization, if you will. And remember, the extent of the discussions we have with our clients is about their most important processes.","So as they reprioritize, the length of time that takes depends a lot on how much uncertainty they\u2019re faced with. And obviously, the political leadership in Europe and the UK can help reduce that uncertainty, but we didn\u2019t see \u2013 again, we don\u2019t think it helped but it didn\u2019t cause us to change our guidance.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Katie. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes. Thank you. Martin, I estimate that software acquisitions helped about $350 million to $400 million in terms of the revenue impact year-over-year. And if that\u2019s the case, then company revenues declined about 4% or a bit more and software revenues declined about 5% or a bit more. I was hoping you could clarify if those numbers are correct, because if they are, it actually suggests that both company revenue and software revenue decelerated from Q1 even though the compare was actually a bit easier. So I was wondering if you could address this notion of what appeared to be some deceleration in the business on an organic basis.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Tony. A couple of things. First, the acquisitions are part of IBM, so when you say company revenue, I think of the total as kind of company revenue. Within the total, as we\u2019ve talked about, we did at Investor Day and I think this is generally true, given the volume of acquisitions we do, we generally over the long term see about a point help. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we got about twice that. We got about two points of help in total. Now, that\u2019s not all software obviously. Also as you know, we\u2019ve been acquiring some businesses for our GBS business. So on an acquisitive impact across IBM, it was about two points.","What we saw in software in the second quarter, I would describe the dynamic as very similar to what we\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters, which is we \u2013 in our largest clients, we see continued deployment, and therefore we continue to grow the annuity base in those large clients. And outside those large clients we continue to see growth in total. And then, again, the transactional business, which tends to have an out-sized impact in the second and the fourth quarter because of our mix of revenue \u2013 of transactional versus annuity also plays into this when you start looking at it sequentially because they\u2019re not fully comparable, if you will. The mix is a bit different. So acquisitions clearly a benefit to us. About two points, as I said, in total, a mix of software and services. And a set of software dynamics underneath that that suggest to us continued deployment, continued growth in the annuity base, and still some transactional growth pressure, if you will, in some of our largest clients.","A \u2013 Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Tony. Rowena [ph], can we please take the next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMC. You may ask your question.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just on the services side, I saw that signings were up nicely. Anything unusual there? And can we see an eventual pull-through there with consulting maybe following behind it? And, Martin, you did mention some inconsistency on execution I think a couple times. Can you elaborate on that? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Tien-tsin. Thanks. So we did have pretty good signings, and that signings kept the backlog in total flat year to year. What we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace, if I start to disaggregate between GTS and GBS for a moment, we continue to see very strong growth in GTS. You saw that in the signings numbers and you see that in the growing backlog. And that profile, if you will, of what we\u2019re working on for our clients is very consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about in the past, which is our clients are looking to move to hybrid clouds. Our clients are looking for us to help them develop and deploy and run some of the latest technologies such as mobile. So that trend continues. The size of those deals continues to be quite substantial. Not every deal is a big deal, but we haven\u2019t seen any reduction certainly in deal sizes. In fact, we\u2019ve had some of the biggest deals \u2013 some of the volume of biggest deals that we\u2019ve seen over the past few years continue in the GTS business.","And when we look forward at that GTS relationship, if you will, in over the last, call it, 10 quarters, over two and a half years or so, we\u2019ve had pretty good consistent book-to-bill greater than one. So the booking rates, as you know, are the signings we report. And then on the billing side, in GPS you have our maintenance business as well. And so obviously that doesn\u2019t go into the bookings side of the equation. So you\u2019ve got to do the math right but book-to-bill in GTS has been over the last 10 quarters very consistent. Again, reflects, I think, the strong value we bring to clients.","On the consulting side in GBS, we did have a good signings quarter. There is plenty of business out there and we see good uptake of our most advanced offerings, if you will, those that help digitize our clients. We continue to pull back on that enterprise kind of wide application installation. When we say pull back, by the way, that means we\u2019re moving resource and we moved again more than a third of our resource out of that part of the business. So it\u2019s not a surprise that that part of the business is declining. So the consulting opportunity is certainly there. When we talk about execution, when I talk about execution issues, I guess the way I\u2019d say it is, look, we \u2013 we take on our industry skills, take on some pretty complex projects for our clients, and sometimes we have to spend a bit more money than we would have thought in order to make it all working properly and making sure our clients are satisfied. So that\u2019s on us. That\u2019s on execution. The teams, you know, they\u2019ll work through these things but I wouldn\u2019t call it \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call it widespread.","A \u2013 Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Tien-tsin. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Apelo [ph] with JMP Securities. You may ask your question.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you very much. Martin, one quick question I wanted to ask about the EPS trajectory in the second half. And I know you reiterated at least 13.50 in EPS. But in light of the macro headlines, I was wondering if you\u2019re thinking about weighing Q3 and Q4 any differently in the second half of the year. Thanks.","A \u2013 Martin Schroeter","Thanks, Greg. Sure. So we included a pretty detailed chart, I think, on some of the first half to second half trajectory changes. And I think the one point to make kind of across the board on that chart is that everything there, it gets either the same or better in the fourth. And so when we look at all of the impacts as an example, you know, we\u2019ve got the chart that shows as-a-service scale helping and a chart that shows the actions we took in the first quarter helping in the second quarter. All of those have a bigger impact in the fourth than they do in the third. And the rest do as well, but those are just, again, two examples.","So I guess the way I think about third versus fourth in a total perspective, you know, in total third quarter for us tends to be in a fairly tight range. You know, our annuity business plays a bigger role in our overall revenue streams than our transactional business does in the third. So in that EPS range in the third, we have typically been kind of 22% to 24% of the full year. And, you know, when we look at that with the momentum we have on the things that are on that chart, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re more in the middle to the high end of that range in the third and then, you know, the rest obviously in the fourth. So while, you know, those statistics are good indicators in total when we\u2019re going through a transformation like this, you know, at the margin again in the third, we\u2019d say kind of mid to high end of the historical range for third quarter EPS.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Greg. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. I wanted to build on the margin question. I was wondering how should we think about the impact of the margin profile, the strategic imperatives through the transformation over the long term? Do you think we\u2019re through the heavy CapEx there and, you know, will the exit of this year and the margin profile there be a good proxy for 2017? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Joe. A couple of things on margins. First, we have talked a bit about what drives margin in the IBM financial model at length, and as you\u2019ll remember, we talked about mix of our business. We\u2019ve talked about productivity in our services business. We\u2019ve talked about portfolio actions. And then this year we started talking about kind of as-a-service based on scale and you can see three of those four elements in our more detailed list of what changes first half to second half. The ones that\u2019s not there obviously is portfolio actions because we don\u2019t have any, you know, we don\u2019t have any big divestitures planned here that are going to drive portfolio. In fact, the way I\u2019d say it is when we look at the portfolio, we think each of the elements can drive value for our clients, and we still see high value in the elements.","Part of the way we get comfortable with each of those elements driving value is when we look at the margins on the strategic imperative content relative to the rest, the margins on the strategic imperatives content has been and second quarter again higher than what we see on the core business. So I interpret that as, you know, the places we\u2019re moving to, the places we\u2019re building value for our clients looks like a pretty high value marketplace, and we\u2019ll continue \u2013 it\u2019s one that\u2019s worth us continuing to serve. So we think, you know, we build on margin with three of those four components that we typically have from an as-of-service perspective I don\u2019t think we\u2019re through the capital requirements by any stretch. We\u2019ll continue to shift our capital to the cloud business to make sure that we have got the right scale that we need for our model. So we\u2019re not through it, but again I don\u2019t think IBM is becoming more capital intensive overall. A lot of times it\u2019s just a shift from one to another. And then obviously we\u2019ll keep investing in the capital we need to drive our acquisitions as we integrate those as well.","A \u2013 Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Joe. Rowena, can we please take the next question?","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am. Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.","StevenMilunovich","Great. Thank you. The strategic imperative revenue growth, I think it\u2019s slowing. I think it was 17% year-over-year last quarter, 12% this quarter. Analytics is a big piece of that. I think that went from 9% to 5%. Could you talk about what kind of growth you see going forward as these numbers get bigger? And conversely what was the decline in the core franchise revenue? And what\u2019s been the trend there the last few quarters? Thanks.","MartinSchroeter","Sure. Thanks, Steve. On the core, if you will, everything outside the strategic revenue \u2013 everything outside the strategic imperatives, that\u2019s kind of been flattish. Right. It\u2019s been flat quarter-to-quarter I should say. It\u2019s down but it\u2019s kind of flat quarter-to-quarter. So in change in trajectory on that part of the business.","In the strategic imperatives, you know, when we started talking about this a year and a half ago at our Investor Day, and we put on the table at the time that that business would grow to $40 billion or 40% of our revenue by, you know, at the end of 2018. We think, and we draw that plum line, we think we\u2019re, you know, I\u2019d say probably a little bit ahead of the track that we need to get there. We\u2019re certainly ahead on the percentage mix because 38% of our business is already there, and we only got \u2013 we got 2.5 years to go from a timing perspective.","So we\u2019re on track to the $40 billion because with $31 billion now trailing 12 months, we actually don\u2019t even have to grow at this rate to get over the line. Now, you know, the acquisitions will play a role in this, and we see continued momentum here. But we don\u2019t even have to grow at this rate in order to get where we set out to get a year and a half ago.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Steve. Can we please take the next question?","Operator","Yes. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian White with Drexel. You may ask your question.","Q \u2013 Brian White","Yeah. Martin, on the cloud business, so cloud it looks like grew 30% year-over-year. Has the cloud business reached the bottom in the margin profile and is on an upward trajectory? Or do we still have a little bit more of a decline? And if you can just put us \u2013 give us some type of an idea where are you in cloud margins versus where you hope to be optimally in, say, four or five years? Thank you.","A \u2013 Martin Schroeter","Sure, Brian. So two things. Remember, you know, our cloud business, we\u2019re really \u2013 if I had to oversimplify it, we have \u2013 we have part of our business helping our clients build their own clouds. And that includes hardware, it includes software, it has some services as well. And when we do that with our clients, the margins we see in those businesses are exactly what we kind of see in the rest. That\u2019s kind of the demand profile of where some of that business is going. The margins don\u2019t look any different from that perspective. To the extent the mix is different between how much hardware and how much software and how much services go in, there may be a different margin on the solution. But as I mentioned in total, our strategic imperatives are mixing a bit richer and so we\u2019re seeing better margins in total across the imperatives. So that\u2019s the \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of help our clients build their own cloud.","On the ads of service side of this, I think that as we put on the chart, you know, the ads of service component even though we\u2019re going to continue to drive a fair bit of investment here, the as of service component will start to add \u2013 be accretive to our margins on a year-over-year basis starting in the second half already. Now, we\u2019ll see where the marketplace goes and we\u2019ll see where how much we rely on getting or keeping, if you will, that margin growth as opposed to reinvesting. But we see, again, on a big part of some of that cloud business, we see margins that are consistent with what we see in other parts, and the as of service business we start to see year-over-year accretion in the margins from that, even though again, we\u2019ll continue to invest quite heavily.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Brian. Rowena, can we please take the next question.","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am. Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may ask our question.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. Martin, for overall IBM strategic imperatives grew 38% of revenues, but in GBS strategic imperatives is already over 50% of segment revenue. But yet overall GBS revenue was down 3%. So I think there\u2019s a notion of people expecting aggregate IBM to eventually get to growth as you see strategic imperative mix increase over time, but I was wondering if you can comment more specifically with respect to GBS. What some of the offsets were on that revenue line? I think execution you were alluding to margins, but more specifically on the revenue line, which caused deceleration? What would imply strong deceleration in the core on GBS?","Martin Schroeter","Yeah. Thanks, Wamsi. And that\u2019s right. We did see some pretty strong deceleration or declines in the core of that. And as I said, we\u2019re continuing to shift our skills and our resources out of that part of the marketplace. So in a business which if you oversimplified it is really about how do \u2013 how do industry experts charge or bill for their time, your billing is going to be limited or constrained by how much resource you have applied to it. That won\u2019t surprise you.","And then as I mentioned, we moved about 35% of our resource applied to those core parts of the business over into the strategic imperatives. So that has two effects: One, it obviously reduces the ability of us to grow revenue in those places when you constrain the resource; and, two, because the productivity is not a one-for-one, you know, someone who \u2013 someone who is billing on an implementation in an enterprise resource kind of an application doesn\u2019t immediately become a cognitive expert or doesn\u2019t immediately become a mobile expert. So there is a productivity impact, and what we give up, while we give up 100% let\u2019s say of that billing capability, we don\u2019t get 100% back right away. And that\u2019s really what you\u2019re seeing in our Consulting business.","In GBS outside of the Consulting, the Application Management, the Global Process Services businesses, they\u2019re fairly stable within the overall GBS equation. But the Consulting business continues to go through this transition as we pull resources off and we put them into and devote the resource or the investments if you will to the strategic imperative areas.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Wamsi. Can we take the next question please?","Operator","Yes. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","James Schneider","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the GBS segment, it sounds given what you just said about the continued pricing headwinds that you\u2019re seeing in the traditional ERP implementations, and maybe the execution issues, that that\u2019s going to be persistent headwind even in the back half of the year. So can you maybe give us some kind of commentary around when you would expect at least the impact of the runoff of some of that more commodity-like business to start to let \u2013 not be a headwind anymore? And can you see kind of the end of the execution issues in terms of the cost of some of those implementations that might have been overrun?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Jim. So a couple of things. One, on when do we kind of work our way through this, one thing to look at here is the signings performance in the quarter, and GBS did grow signings in the quarter. Now, there is obviously a lag. It sits in the backlog. And as you saw in our total backlog is flat. I mentioned earlier that GPS [ph] was up in backlog, and obviously therefore the GBS component of that is down a little. So while we are growing signings, which are a pretty good leading indicator of the kind of business, and that\u2019s a function of all the people we have moved into those new areas while we\u2019ve pull back from the others, that total signings equation is now starting to work. We grew signings in total, right? So the new stuff is offsetting if you will the old stuff. But not enough yet to get the backlog back to growth. And we\u2019ve got to get that backlog back to growth in order to have kind of turn the corner for that signings equation, which we got back to growth to get the revenue equation, if you will, back to growth.","A \u2013 Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Jim. Let\u2019s take one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. You may ask your question.","David Grossman","Thank you. So, Martin, there are several factors that are impacting the free cash flow conversion this year. Can you help us understand what known factors are out today? Headwinds or tailwinds that we should consider for conversion next year?","A \u2013 Martin Schroeter","Sure, David. Thanks. So as we said, we reiterated our view of free cash flow at the end of the first. We were comfortable at the time and remain comfortable to be at the high end of what we had originally provided. So within that, realization for us is a pretty good measure of how we\u2019re converting our cash. Our model is to be in the 90s, and I think with kind of the headwinds, tailwinds we see within free cash flow for the year, I\u2019d say we\u2019re probably more likely to wind up in the high 90s in 2016. Now as we get into next year, you know, there\u2019s a lot that we have to get through in order to understand what next year is going to look like. But I am comfortable that while, you know, we\u2019ll finish again probably high 90s this year. I\u2019m comfortable that our model is right even for next year that we\u2019ll be in the 90s again next year when we look at all of the pieces.","Martin Schroeter","So let me conclude the call by reminding everyone that, you know, we\u2019re running our clients\u2019 most critical process, and that puts us into a pretty unique and terrific, quite frankly, position to move them to the future. And it\u2019s not just about the infrastructure, which is obviously important. We\u2019ve always felt that it\u2019s important and we think it\u2019s important today. But it\u2019s also about helping them become digital businesses and helping them inject cognitive into everything they do. It\u2019s what they\u2019re asking for and it\u2019s quite frankly been our perspective on where the world is going.","So we\u2019re not only doing that with our existing clients and not only doing that in kind of a traditional IT, but in some cases we\u2019re building entirely new businesses, and entirely new markets. And so that, you know, for many is beyond what some of you would focus on in terms of infrastructure, but it\u2019s becoming a bigger and bigger part of what IBM is becoming, and again it\u2019s our view of where value will be created for clients and for our investors. And so as we make those shifts and as we build these new markets, you know, we take \u2013 we take our temperature, if you will, at the end of June and we\u2019d say we\u2019re right on track with what we wanted to get done for the year. So with that, thanks for joining the call","Patricia Murphy","Rowena [ph], let me turn it back to you to close out the call.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today\u2019s conference.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma'am, you may begin.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM. And I want to welcome you to our first quarter 2019 earnings presentation. I'm here with Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We will post today's prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. Some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the Company\u2019s SEC filings. Our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures to provide additional information to investors. We've provided reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC.","Before turning the call over to Jim, I want to remind you we recently made changes to our management system and our organizational structure. Our segment reporting for 2019 has been updated to reflect this business structure. We provided two years of historical financial information by quarter on these segments a couple of weeks ago, and this can be found on our investor website. And today, we will be discussing our first quarter results in this new segment structure.","So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Kavanaugh","Thanks Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us. In the first quarter, we delivered $18.2 billion of revenue with significant operating leverage. We delivered $2.2 billion of operating pretax income and $2.25 of operating earnings per share. And we have now generated over $12 billion of free cash flow over the last year with realization well over 100%.","We had strong performance in offerings that help clients with their digital transformation and journeys to cloud. At the same time, we continue to take actions to optimize our portfolio, while investing to lead in the emerging high-value areas of the IT industry. You saw this play out in our results. Our Cloud growth accelerated to 12% at constant currency. Our Cloud and Cognitive Software was up 2% and our Consulting revenue was up 9%, also both at constant currency. We had significant margin expansion with operating gross margins up 90 basis points, driven by both services segments and we had solid free cash flow. Improving margin has been a focus for us and our performance this quarter is a result of actions we have been taking, not only our focus on higher value and portfolio optimization but also driving productivity and operational efficiency, especially in our services business.","With this start to the year, we are maintaining our full year expectations for operating earnings per share and free cash flow. In the first quarter, our revenue was down less than a point year-to-year at constant currency, slightly better than our fourth quarter performance. Our reported revenue as expected includes a significant in currency headwind as always, all focused on constant currency performance. From a geographic perspective, our year-to-year revenue growth in the developed markets improved a couple of points sequentially, consistent with the expectations we discussed last quarter. That said we had weaker performance in the emerging markets in Asia Pacific, which impacted our overall revenue performance.","Looking at our results by segment, we had continued revenue growth in global business services and in our Cloud and Cognitive Software. In GBS, as I said, we had another quarter of strong growth in consulting as we help clients with their digital re-invention. And we again expanded our margins in GBS. In our Software segment, growth was driven by our hybrid cloud offerings, security and solution areas like supply chain and Watson Health. In Global Technology Services, we're continuing to help our clients to implement and manage hybrid multi-cloud environments. This is evidenced in the increasing share of our backlog, which is now Cloud. At the same time, consistent with our high-value focus, we're continuing to take actions to optimize our GTS performance by exiting lower-value content. While this contributes to lower GTS revenue, we had higher profits, margins and cash contribution.","Our Systems' revenue declined, reflecting the IBM Z product cycle dynamics and weaker performance in storage. Across our segments, clients continue to be focused on solutions that deliver innovation and growth. Though, as we mentioned last quarter, we're seeing an increasing bias towards engagements that provide productivity and predictability of spend. And so our results this quarter reflect our ability to deliver both innovation and productivity, helping our clients transition their business models to hybrid cloud. Our Cloud revenue growth in the first quarter accelerated to 12% with our as-a-service offerings up 15%. With this, our Cloud revenue has grown to $19.5 billion over the last year.","Over the last several months, we've talked about the next chapter of Cloud, which focuses on shifting mission critical work to the cloud and optimizing everything from supply chain to core banking systems. To address this opportunity, enterprises need to be able to move and manage data, services and workflows across multiple cloud and on-prem. And they need to be able to address security concerns, data protection and protocols, availability and cloud management. This requires a hybrid multi-cloud open approach. And so we have been reshaping our business to address this opportunity, investing heavily to build capabilities across our business, like IBM cloud, IBM cloud private and IBM cloud private for data, the IBM multi-cloud manager, cloud garages, cloud migration services and cloud optimized systems. These are the innovations that are driving our $19.5 billion of cloud revenue.","In the first quarter, we introduced additional capabilities that will accelerate hybrid cloud adoption, including Watson Anywhere, which makes IBM Watson available on premises, as well as on any private or public cloud and IBM cloud integration platform, which provides a standard way to integrate services and applications across multiple cloud environments. More broadly, we have built a framework of offerings to facilitate our clients' journey to the cloud. It is designed to help our clients across the four key stages of their cloud transformation journey, advice, move, build and manage. These offerings span our cloud and cognitive software, global business services and global technology services, leveraging the integrated value of IBM.","And so we have a strong foundation for the addition of Red Hat. Together, we will be ideally positioned to help our clients shift their business applications to hybrid cloud, while addressing the issues I just mentioned around portability, management consistency, security, remaining open, which avoids vendor lock-in. This will not only enhance the growth of Red Hat business after closing but with all of IBM, as we saw more of our data and AI software on containers across multiple platforms and more of our services from app modernization to multi-cloud managed services. At IBM, we're investing and building capabilities to be ready to drive these synergies. We're moving through the regulatory process and continue to expect to close in the second half of 2019.","Before getting into the financial metrics, I want to lay out the contributors to our year-to-year operating earnings per share performance, especially because there are a couple of larger items in last year's results that impact the dynamics. In fact, these larger items contributed $0.32 benefit to last year's earnings per share, which of course creates a headwind to this year's growth. And so looking at the drivers, as I said, our revenue was down less than 1% at constant currency. But with the stronger dollar, revenue was down 4.7%. At constant margin, revenue was a headwind of profit and earnings per share growth. Last year, we took pretax charges associated with the actions to realign our skills to key opportunities, and better position our systems cost structure. These together with the benefit of the actions and our ongoing operating efficiencies, resulted in strong pretax income growth and pretax margin expansion. Last year, we also had a large discrete tax benefit associated with an audit settlement. With a much smaller discreet benefit this year, tax was a significant headwind to our net income. And finally, a lower share count contributed to growth. Putting this all together, we had solid operating leverage and margin expansion, offset by $0.32 impact of last year's significant items, resulting in an operating EPS of $2.25.","So now getting into profit and margin metrics, we continue to drive operating leverage, expanding both gross and pretax margins. Our operating gross margin was up 90 basis points. This was driven by strong performance in both services businesses, together up 160 basis points. We also had a year-over-year benefit from the charge we took last year in Systems, which was offset by the impact of the IBM Z product cycle. Our operating expense was better 11%, which resulted in a 2 point benefit in our expense to revenue ratio. Overall, we've been driving productivity in our business, including implementing new ways of working and leveraging automation and infusing AI into our processes. This drives operating leverage and provides flexibility to increase investment in areas like hybrid cloud, AI and Blockchain. But we have a few other drivers of our expense performance this quarter, including currency and lower workforce rebalancing charges mitigated by a lower level of IP income.","Regarding currency, while a stronger dollar hurts the top line, it generally helps expense due both to translation and the benefit of hedging contracts. In the first quarter, currency helped our year-to-year expense by nearly 6 points. Much of this was reflected in other income and expense. In fact, the $200 million year-to-year change in other income and expense was entirely due to hedging benefits. Remember, these hedging gains mitigate the currency impacts throughout the P&L. Expense also includes the year-to-year reduction of over $500 million for workforce rebalancing, driven by last year's charge.","And finally within expense, we absorb the lower level of IP income as it hurts our PTI growth by over $200 million. Putting this expense performance together with our gross margin expansion, pretax margin was up over 300 basis points. Our operating tax rate was 10%, including discreet. This is right in line with our all-in first quarter expectation of 10% to 11% we provided in January. And as I said earlier, this was a significant headwind to our net income growth year-to-year.","Looking at our cash metrics, we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up about $350 million over last year. There's a lot of seasonality in our cash generation. And so looking over the last 12 months, we generated over $12 billion of free cash flow that's 114% of our GAAP net income normalized. I'll touch on the cash drivers and uses of cash a little later.","And so now before getting into the segment performance, I want to spend a minute on an overview of our 2019 segment structure. As Patricia mentioned, we shared historical information on this new structure a couple of weeks ago. As our clients become digital enterprises, they need tighter integration between hybrid cloud and their data and AI platforms to unlock value. And so we recently made changes to our management system to more effectively address our clients' evolving needs and in preparation for the acquisition of Red Hat. The changes also better align our portfolio to the market and to underlying business models.","The business changes resulted in three adjustments to our segment structure for 2019. First, we brought our Cloud and Cognitive Software together in one segment. Second, we combined our security services with security software, consistent with the way we are running that integrated business. And then finally, we moved the results for the businesses we're divesting to the other categories, to provide better transparency to the ongoing operational performance of our software and GBS segments. This concludes the pending sales of our collaboration and on-prem marketing in commerce software to HCL, the pending sale of the balance of our marketing and commerce software to Centerbridge and the just completed sale of our Seterus mortgage servicing business.","And so looking at our new segments, we created the cloud and cognitive software segments, bringing software platforms and solutions into one segment. Within this segment, we'll report cloud and data platforms which bring together software for hybrid cloud management with data and AI platforms cognitive applications includes vertical and domain specific solutions that are built on cloud and data platforms. These offerings are increasingly being infused with AI and then transaction processing platforms, includes the middleware and database software that supports our clients' mission-critical workloads running on ZOS, as well as storage software.","Looking at our services segments, the scope of Global Business Services segment overall is unchanged. Other than moving the divested mortgage servicing business to other. Global technology services is consistent with the services component of technology services and cloud platforms, excluding security services. And then finally, our systems and global financing segments are also unchanged.","So now let me get into the segment results, starting with our Cloud and Cognitive Software segments, where revenue grew 2%. Our clients' journey to cloud and AI is now turning to more mission-critical workloads. As I just mentioned, linking the data, AI and applications together with hybrid cloud in a secure way is critical for any successful digital reinvention. We are uniquely positioned to do this with our comprehensive cloud and data offerings, coupled with a deep understanding of our clients' workflows and security needs. Within this segment, we had good growth in cloud and data platforms and cognitive applications, while transaction processing platforms was flat. I'll breakdown some of the drivers behind these areas.","Our cloud and data platforms grew 2%. We delivered growth this quarter by helping clients build across public and private clouds with IBM Cloud Private, which as you know is built on Linux containers and kubernetes. We help them modernize and integrate applications and environments with our integration and digital business automation platforms. And then collect and manage data with the hybrid data management platforms, all of which grew this quarter. This need for tighter integration across hybrid cloud, data and AI are also driving traction for our IBM Cloud Private for data offerings, as well as Watson Assistant and Watson OpenScale that run on IBM Cloud Private for data.","We see the value of bringing together the hybrid cloud and data value propositions at a European Tax Authority, which is using our digital business automation platform to re-design their tax processes around their data lake and improve the tax payor experience. In Cognitive Applications, revenue was up 4%. Growth was led by security, as well as solution areas like health, supply chain and weather. In security, we delivered strong double-digit growth with our integrated software and services value proposition. In particular, we continue to see good traction with our threat management software and services offerings, including QRadar and Resilient. And our security intelligence operations and consulting services, which detect and respond to security threat for our clients. Panasonic, for example, is leveraging QRadar and related services to strengthen its threat management posture. Panasonic is also piloting our next gen X-Force Threat Management offering.","In Watson Health, we have broad based growth across areas, including payor, provider and government, as clients look to harness data to create actionable insights. We also had good results from our weather offerings, which grew double-digit this quarter and reached a new all time high in the number of active users. Transaction processing platforms revenue was consistent with last year as clients continue to commit to our platform for the longer term. Performance reflects the value we provide clients managing these vital workloads, and their preference for predictability and IT spend.","Turning to profit for this segment, we expanded pre-tax margin by 2 points year-to-year. This reflects a lower level of workforce re-balancing this year, mitigated by a headwind in IT income and continued investment in key strategic areas. As we look forward, essentially all of our software portfolio now runs on Linux containers, orchestrated by kubernetes. We have introduced new offerings like IBM Cloud Integration platform, the Digital Business Automation platform and Watson Anywhere to further accelerate hybrid cloud adoption. And we have ongoing activities to educate all of IBM's employees on the journey to cloud, which includes Red Hat skills. All of this better prepares us for the Red Hat acquisition.","Moving to Global Business Services. We continued the momentum from last year and delivered another solid quarter. Revenue grew 4% and gross margin expanded 280 basis points. We again had strong growth in consulting, which was up 9% as clients embark on their digital journey to a cognitive enterprise they are turning to GBS to help them with their strategy and implementation, leveraging our deep industry expertise and innovative technology portfolio. The growth this quarter was led digital strategy and IX, as well as consulting for cloud application migration and our next generation enterprise application practice.","Within cloud application migration, GBS cloud advisory services works with enterprises to plan and implement a clear strategy and roadmap for their hybrid cloud journey. We are doing this with Tribune Publishing as they transform from a legacy print company to a digital company, helping them determine the right environment for each of their applications and optimizing their migration to the cloud. Our next generation enterprise application offerings assist clients as they build and implement cloud native applications in areas such as Workday, Salesforce and S\/4HANA. IBM is now leading the market with over 200 S\/4HANA impact assessments, over 200 implementations and more than a 125 go-lives. In application management, we are shifting our business to cloud-based offerings and continue to have good momentum in our cloud migration factory and cloud application development.","Overall, application management revenue was flat due to ongoing declines in the traditional application management engagements. And then Global Process Services had solid performance in first quarter. Revenue was up 5% with strong performance in risk and compliance along with financial process services.","Turning to GBS profits, our gross margin was 26%, which is up 280 basis points, driven by our mix of higher value offerings, the yield on our productivity and utilization initiatives and a continuing help from currency, given our global delivery mix. This enables us to make investments as we prepare for the Red Hat acquisition, such as scaling our existing Red Hat practice to enhance our journey to cloud offerings for clients leveraging Red Hat capabilities. We are also creating new offerings around advice, build, move and manage services through industry points of view and platform plays. In global technology services, as I mentioned last quarter, we are taking actions to optimize our portfolio by exiting low value services content to increased margin, profit and cash contribution and better position the business for the longer-term.","GTS plays an important role in IBM's integrated value proposition, building on its deep client relationships to shift our clients to hybrid cloud. As we moved through last year, we improved GTS profits and margin creating operating leverage. This gives us a solid base from which we can deemphasize lower value contract and third-party content, enabling continued investment for chapter two of the cloud and delivering sustained margin improvement. This is where we are focused. We saw this play out in our first quarter results as overall revenue declined, but gross margin expanded 110 basis points, driven by the mix shift to higher value, a lift from cloud scale efficiencies and productivity improvements.","So now looking at the GTS revenue by line of business, infrastructure and cloud services was down 3% and technology support services was down 2%. Within infrastructure and cloud services, we continue to have solid growth in cloud revenue, which was up 13%. This is driven by the backlog where cloud is now over 30% of the total services outsourcing backlog. Keep in mind, most of the cloud opportunity is ahead of us. 80% of the enterprise workload, which represent mission-critical work, has yet to move to the cloud. As clients migrate these workloads to a hybrid multi-cloud environment, they face increased complexity in managing their infrastructure, because we've been running these workloads, we're better positioned to help our client to build and manage these new environments.","During the first quarter, we announced that we're moving and managing BNP Paribas and Santander, a couple of the larger banks in Europe to hybrid cloud. That\u2019s on top of companies like Lloyd, Alliance, Westpac, American Airlines and Anthem Insurance, the list goes on. That's all mission-critical work starting to move and they are moving it with IBM. The portfolio actions I mentioned earlier create flexibility to invest in additional cloud capabilities to capture this high value growing market. For example, our IBM services for multi-cloud management offerings provide a single system to help enterprise simplify the management of their IT resources across multiple cloud providers, on-prem environments and private clouds. And as we prepare for the Red Hat acquisition, we are investing to build on our partnership as a services integrator for Red Hat to be a leader in hybrid multi-cloud services.","In Systems, revenue was down 9% this quarter with declines in IBM Z, reflecting where we are in the product cycle and in storage, driven by markets and competitive dynamics. That said we had good performance and power. This quarter, IBM Z revenue declined 38%. I'll remind you we are wrapping on strong performance from last year when we had 54% growth. We are seven quarters into the z14 cycle, and the program continues to track ahead of the prior program. We had strong growth in volumes or ShipNet and new workload MIPS continue to outpace our standard MIPS. This growth is led by Linux again this quarter.","In our single frame z14 designed specifically for cloud data centers remains a growth diver. Power revenue grew for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 9%, driven by Linux and the full rollout of our POWER9 based architecture. As clients look to handle more data intensive workloads in AI, HANA and UNIX, they are turning the POWER9 systems. These systems are built to handle advanced analytics and cloud environment. Both the high end and entry-level offerings posted strong growth this quarter as clients continue to adopt this new technology.","Storage hardware was down 11% with declines in both the high end and mid range, offset by continued growth in All Flash arrays. Performance reflects declines in our high-end, which is tied to our mainframe cycle, and the ongoing competitive dynamics and pricing pressures. We are continuing to introduce new innovations and functionality to differentiate in this environment as we look to manage the portfolio for the market shift to flash. Looking at systems process, pretax margin was down a point, driven by a mix headwind due to where we are in the z14 cycle.","So now turning to cash flow, we generated $2.3 billion in cash from operations in the quarter, excluding our financing receivables. Our free cash flow of $1.7 billion is up about $350 million year-to-year. This performance results in free cash flow of $12.2 billion over the last 12 months, and continued strength in our normalized free cash flow realization rate, which is 114%. Our CapEx decline reflects effective capital management and the strategy I mentioned earlier to deemphasize some lower value content. This reduces our capital requirements. And so, free cash flow came in where we expected and there was no change in our full-year outlook of about $12 million.","Looking at uses of cash, we've returned $2.3 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $1.4 billion of dividends and over $900 million of gross share repurchases that\u2019s $10.3 billion over the last 12 months. We bought back nearly 7 million shares and at the end of the quarter, we had $2.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. I'll remind you we plan to suspend share repurchase in 2020 and 2021 as we pay down debt for our Red Hat acquisition to get back to our targeted leverage ratio.","Looking at the balance sheet, we closed the quarter with a cash balance of over $18 billion and total debt of $50 billion. Both of these are up from December as we prepare for the acquisition of Red Hat later in the year. About 60% of our total debt is in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 9:1, and the credit quality of our financing receivables remain strong at 55% investment grade, that\u2019s 2 points better than a year-ago. As a reminder, our financing debt will decrease throughout the year as a result of the winding down of our commercial OEM content.","So to summarize, free cash flow is on track and our balance sheet reflects the strength required to support our continuing investments and return to shareholders. So let me make a few summary comments on the quarter and our view of the year before we move on to Q&A. In the first quarter, we grew in key high-value segments, led by Global Business Services and Cloud and Cognitive Software. While our overall revenue reflects the IBMZ product cycle dynamics and a focus on deemphasizing lower value work and services.","Across IBM, our cloud growth accelerated as we help our clients transition their business models to hybrid environments. We had significant margin expansion with gross margin up over 90 basis points. This reflects our shift to higher value and our focus on productivity and operational efficiencies. What I characterize as improving fundamentals. We're continuing to prioritize our investments and announced additional actions to divest some businesses that aren't contributing to the integrated value proposition for our clients. And we're continuing our planning and preparation for the acquisition of Red Hat. With this performance, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.90 of operating earnings per share and about $12 million of free cash flow.","I want to remind you what is and is not included in these expectations, and this is consistent with what we discussed last quarter. We continue to expect Red Hat to close in the second half. Because of financial implications to the year are dependent on the timing of the closing, we have not included Red Hat in the expectations. In contrast, the timing of the closing of our two remaining announced divestitures does not have a significant impact on the year, that's because we continue to expect the combination of the foregone process, the gain on sale, the actions to address the structure and stranded costs and the resulting benefit from these actions to have minimal impact to our profit and earnings per share for the year. And so our guidance assumes these divestitures.","Looking at the view of earnings per share for the year, we assume we'll deliver about 22% in the second quarter, in line with the last couple of years. And then looking at the second half, we would expect the growth in EPS to be skewed to the fourth quarter. This assumes we will close the software divestitures in the second quarter with the gain effectively offset by the foregone profit and the charges for actions to address the structure and stranded costs. In other words, we expect essentially no impact to the second quarter.","Looking at free cash flow, we do expect an impact from the divestitures, as well as some pre-closing financing costs for the Red Hat acquisition. But with a solid start to the year and free cash flow, we are comfortable that we can absorb these headwinds and the full year expectations of about $12 million.","And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia for the Q&A.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, as always I'd ask you to refrain from multipart questions. So operator, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Patricia Murphy","Katy, you there, we can't hear you. Maybe you're on mute.","Operator","Okay. It looks like she is no longer showing in queue. Would you like me go onto next question?","Patricia Murphy","Yes. Please.","Operator","Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Toni Sacconaghi","Jim, I'm just wondering if you can comment about how the quarter turned out to your expectations 90 days ago. I think at the time in Q4 you delivered minus 1% growth to constant currency and you've stated that revenues would improve 1 to 2 points in terms of the growth rate, which didn't occur. And on the margin side when I back out restructuring expenses, it actually looks like operating margins declined year-over-year in Q1 and even if I adjust for IP income, it still looks like they were flat year-over-year. So perhaps you can address each of those, particularly relative to your expectations 90 days ago and whether there was anything that fell short of where you thought you would be? Thank you.","Jim Kavanaugh","Sure, Tony and thanks as always for your question. There is a lot packed into that. So let me take a step back and just give you a perspective of how we saw the quarter play out, and I'll touch on each of your points here as I go through this. We feel like through the first 90 days of the year, we started out with a solid performance. Why, because we see the fundamentals of our business model playing out in terms of growth in key high value areas, whether that'd be cloud and our acceleration there, security, digital and data and AI. And while we see the growth in those key high value emerging areas, we're also delivering strong operating leverage by expanding margins, growing pretax income, expanding operating pretax margins and delivering strong free cash flow. So when you look at the quarter, let me start with revenue, because you've talked about what we expect in 90 days and where we're at.","Underneath our revenue, we see continued momentum in our GBS business led by consulting, strong growth again 9% as we're enabling clients to really move on their journey to cloud and drive their digital reinventions and competitive advantage. We also had solid execution in our cloud and cognitive software where our value propositions around hybrid cloud are playing out very nicely and we're winning in the market. And we saw accelerated growth in our cloud-based business. Basically going from mid-single digits in the fourth quarter when you look at our cloud performance to now exiting first quarter where in the quarter we grew 12%, and now we have a trailing 12 month $19.5 billion cloud business that's growing 12%. Now from geography perspective and it gets right at the heart of your question, we talked about 90 days ago that we saw about 1 to 2 point sequential improvement. And if you look at our developed markets, we had pretty good execution. And we delivered that accelerated 1 to 2 points in fact over 2 points when you look at developed markets led by Japan, UK, Italy, Spain and many others that grew very well.","It was in the emerging markets, in particular as I said in the prepared remarks, around the AP region where we saw a deceleration in revenue. And that was really driven by our transactional related businesses, both systems and cloud and cognitive software where we had a good transactional pipeline entering the quarter. And just based on client buying decision delays, we did not execute. Those are great value propositions. They're in front of us right now. The teams on the field and we're focused on closing that sales execution. Now, let me go to operating leverage, because you talked a little bit about our operating leverage and with and without charges but let me set the record straight.","One, strong gross profit margins up 90 day basis points, driven by our services base of business, which is up 160 basis points year-over-year and this is a strongest operating margin, gross margin that we've had in four years from a year-to-year expansion. On pretax margins you're right, up 320 basis points as printed. But within, that we did get a benefit by much lower workforce rebalancing last year but we're also seeing the fundamentals of our enterprise productivity initiatives play out. And when you adjust for the $200 million impact year-to-year in IP, our operating pretax margins are up they're not down. So we feel like we started out. We delivered a strong quarter. We should have came up with some more revenue, especially in our emerging markets, the team is focused here in the second quarter. But with all that said for the first 90 days, we think we're up for a solid start and that gives us confidence in maintaining our guidance.","Patricia Murphy","Okay Brandon. Can we please go to our next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty","Jim, what was the thought process behind not giving strategic imperative segments anymore? And then how are you thinking about Cloud and Cognitive Software growth going forward relative to the 2% growth over the last couple of quarter and especially in the context of the delayed deals that you've referenced in Toni's questions?","Jim Kavanaugh","Around strategic imperative, again, let me put this in perspective. We put this sign post out back in the beginning of 2015 if you all remember at our Investor Day. Why, because we had to lay the groundwork and how is the Company we needed to fundamentally shift our capital investment allocation and transform our portfolio into capturing the shifts in growth in cloud and data, and analytics, and security, and mobility. Now you fast forward to the end of 2018 and at the time we made this announcement with that signpost, we were about less than a quarter's worth of our business, I think Patricia. We exited '18 where we were consistently above 50%.","And when you take a look at that that has become more and more, or I should say less and less of a relevant metric as we move forward. And more importantly, as I've spent quite a bit of time over the last quarter, both at Think with many of you as analysts and also with our investors, to talk about as we changed our external segmentation to reposition and get this company focused our chapter two and the journey to cloud and hybrid cloud. The same feedback we got from many of you and many of our investors is the strategic imperative metric has passed its course and they are looking for now what are the relevant metrics on managing the Company moving forward. And that as we put out in our new segmentation is going to be around cloud, in particular, accelerating our leadership position in $1 trillion market opportunity around hybrid that is going to be around as a service and our scale efficiencies and margin. And finally, it's going to be around operating leverage and value. And that is going to be instantiated in gross margin and operating pretax margin.","Now to your second question real quick cloud and cognitive software. Again, as I stated, solid execution again building on a couple of quarters, strong value proposition, strong offering, team executed well, both across cloud and data platforms we were we up 2%, but also across cognitive applications where we were up 4%. And I talked about in the prepared remarks how we continue to differentiate around our hybrid cloud software value proposition where our integration software had a very strong quarter lead by ICP and ICP for data, which has strong adoption and also our cognitive applications where we're growing both in our domain, security and even emerging areas like Blockchain, but also in our industry verticals where we have continued momentum in Watson Health and in supply-chain and weather. Weather we had an all-time high, great quarter and first quarter all-time high on the number of active users.","So when you take a look at this portfolio, we had a couple quarters of solid execution. Yes, in emerging markets we had some buying decision delays that will come back here in the second quarter. But we feel very confident in this portfolio. We feel very confident in the value proposition and differentiation. And we see pretty consistent performance moving forward here in the second quarter and throughout the year.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Katy. Can we go to next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from John Roy with UBS. Your line is open.","John Roy","Jim, I've question for you on really, you were talking about organic constant currency revenue growth. And it looks like you are saying that if the transactional business that come through, you really would have had at this quarter. I'm really questioning or I want to get an idea of how sustainable do you think that is? I mean, if the transaction itself comes through, can you really continue to see organic constant currency revenue growth?","Jim Kavanaugh","Yes, if you take a look at it John, obviously, we don't give guidance on revenue. But let me give you some dynamics of how we're seeing the business, both around the trajectory of coming out of first quarter but also the operational indices we see right in front of us, and our business plans and strategies that we're executing on moving forward. First, around GBS. Our GBS business has a lot of momentum. We actually delivered signings growth again for our GBS business those were -- we got great momentum around our consulting business and it's driving the digital reinventions of our clients and our journey to cloud. And we see that they are just continuing that momentum in growth right in front of us here in the second quarter. But second half is going to be dependent, as you know, in a very short-term fast yielding type of backlog. We got to continue doing the signings in 2Q, that's going to fuel backlog, that's going to fill revenue in the second half. But we feel good and we feel consistent growth in GBS.","In Cloud and Cognitive Software, as I just answered to Katy, we feel confident in that offering portfolio and we also feel confident in continued growth here in the second quarter pretty consistent performance. Around GTS, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks and I'll go back to what we talked about add late 90 days ago, is we embarked on a very conscious strategy around exiting low value third-party OEM content. We said at that time it was going to depress revenue in the near-term but have higher value and higher margins. And better position our portfolio for the long term as we go through the acquisition closure of Red Hat and really trying to address the leadership position in a hybrid multi-cloud arena. So I would expect GTS, as least in the near-term to be pretty consistent with what you just saw in first quarter.","And then you get to our system space of the business. This business as you all know quite well always follows innovation cycles. We are on the backend of our mainframe cycle. We got about one more quarter to go through on that. It's going to be GA plus 7 and plus 8 if I'm counting right. It's been our most successful program in a long time but we've got another quarters' worth of headwind on that. But we've got strong growth and momentum in our power following that innovation cycle. We rolled out our POWER9 architecture for the first quarter. We had our high-end. We had strong adoption. We continue to win in that space leveraging our cloud design systems for AI and for data intensive workloads. And then storage, storage was a weak performance in the first quarter. It was entirely driven again by the high end DS8000, which was attached to our mainframe. And we see that pretty consistent until we can bring new innovation to market.","So if you look at first quarter where we were down about 90 basis points at constant currency, you take the divested content out of that and we were roughly about flat. If you look at second quarter, I would see pretty consistent performance again, recognizing we got a big headwind on mainframe in the second quarter we grew a 112% last year as we move forward.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks John. Can we go to the next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jim Schneider","Maybe Jim, I was wondering if you could comment on the overall performance in the services business. Signings were down year-over-year but seems like you're continuing to see very good growth in GBS and maybe little more tempered performance in GTS. So can you maybe just give us a sense about where clients headed at in terms of our new services contracts overall, and maybe any diversions you're seeing in bookings within GBS and GTS right now?","Jim Kavanaugh","As you stated, yes, signings were down, down 14% if I remember correctly, about $7.5 -- $7.6 billion overall in signings. But let me take a step back and give you some of the dynamics underneath that, because I think it's very, very important because wire signings and indicator that's of interest to all of our investors, because it leads the backlog that then leads to backlog realization and revenue. And as I've said many quarters, all signings are not equal and they vary. They vary with lumpiness, mainly based on the size of signings. And when you look at our first quarter, our first quarter being down 14%, our greater than $100 million signings were down over 50%. Why, because we just came-off of a fourth quarter, if you remember 90 days ago, where we had one of our strongest quarters in greater than a $100 million signings in years where we signed 19 deals greater than a $100 million and we actually had signings growth well north of 25%.","Also, we had a very strong signings quarter, particularly and greater than $100 million deals last first quarter where we signed 10 deals and our greater than $100 million signings were up a 130%. So we had a very tough compare as we both looked at last year and also just on what we executed with solid execution exiting the year. But now let's take a look at backlog. Backlog has many factors that influence, and signings only being one of it, the duration, the mix of those signings, erosion and client dissatisfaction issues and also new signings, new logo versus extensions. And when you take a look at our GBS business, to your point, we have strong momentum. We grew signings in the first quarter, because while our greater than $100 million signings were down 50% plus, we actually grew less than $100 million signings, which is going to fuel that backlog and be better revenue realization in the near-term as we move forward.","So all-in-all, GBS is doing a very nice job. We restructured our offering portfolio. We are winning in the marketplace with this digital reinvention and our journey to cloud. And you're seeing a much shorter duration backlog and a better backlog optimization because our quality of delivery as we transform that has led to a much lower level of erosion, which has led to higher realization of revenue. That's what's playing out in GBS.","In GTS, that is the function as we're shifting our portfolio to really capture the hybrid multi-cloud opportunity, and that backlog in GTS is flat. It's flat while we transitioned now in our GTS outsourcing business, our cloud penetration is over 35%. And we're going to continue driving that differentiated value proposition in the near-term. But as I said to the last question around revenue realization, we're continuing down the strategy of managing this business from margin, profit and cash, and we're going to use our balance sheet appropriately and effectively around third-party capital content.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Jim. Brandon, could we please take the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hey good afternoon, forgive me for asking another GTS question, but that was the only real delta I think versus our model with margins being better, revenue being a little bit lighter. So I heard everything you just said, you mentioned GTS in the near-term should be pretty consistent with what we saw on Q1. But I'm curious, if you wanted to reconcile your prioritization of margin versus growth, the portfolio cleanup, the deterioration in signings and maybe even re-segmentation impact on revenue and when might we see an inflection point would you care to remix back to growth? Because there's a lot going on there, just trying to make sure we could recast this properly.","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay, Tien-tsin, thank you very much for the question. On GTS, I'll remind all of us last quarter, we discussed the portfolio prioritization efforts that we were doing in GTS. Why? We continue to focus and shift this business to higher value for our clients and win in the marketplace. And over the last few quarters, we have been exiting low value content in our GBS business that we said would have some near-term impact on revenue, but will result in higher margins and more importantly a better business profile going forward over the long-term.","And if you look at first quarter, that's exactly what played out. Our GTS revenue was down about two points from exiting that lower value content, but Tien-tsin to your question. Our gross margins where I really believe in services based business where value is really instantiated. We're up a 110 basis points year-over-year as we continue to drive the value of that mix shift, our productivity initiatives and our cloud scale. But let me spend a moment as to why? Why are we doing this? This is part of a very conscious strategy to focus this business on margin, profit and cash.","We chosen our investment prioritization and Chapter 2 was all about leading in hybrid multi-cloud, high-value market with the acquisition of Red Hat and the combination -- through a combination of cash and debt. You see we are very focused on maintaining a very strong balance sheet and are maintaining our strong investment grade profile and paying down that debt and getting back to our targeted leverage ratios in a few years. We've committed that to our shareholders, and we are taking the actions.","GTS being one action about getting out of low value third-party content, that ties up our balance, that ties up our financial flexibility and brings little to no profit to it. The second is our IGF business where we made a decision to get out of our commercial OEM that in addition to, as we stated the intense is to spend share we purchase in 2020 and 2021. So, we are serious about our investment personalization, the lead in Chapter 2. We're serious about getting our balance sheet and continue on the strength of that to support our dividend growth policy and continue to invest in our business, and we're serious about driving the innovation and the investments to win in that space.","And I'll just conclude to your question. GTS has tremendous value to our integrated model of IBM. 90% of our most strategic accounts, we call them integrated accounts taken advantage of IBM's integrated value through outsourcing. More than 50% of the software used in our sourcing is IBM content and that\u2019s growing, and 60% of our outsourcing engagements include the management of mainframe. So, it is very integral part, we're been selective in our investment prioritization because we chosen where we want to win and how we're going to win going forward.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Tien-tsin. Let's go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Jim, you typically take a workforce rebalancing in the first half of the year. You talked about the divestitures not having much net impact. Is that because you're going to include essentially a workforce rebalancing in that beyond just the divestiture and Red Hat and so forth? Or are we going to see a bigger separate charge at some point?","Jim Kavanaugh","Yes, thanks, Steven. It's good to hear from you again. Yes, let me put in perspective. From a product perspective, around the announced divestitures which most recently included the sale of our marketing and commerce remaining products Centerbridge that on an annualized basis about $1.8 billion, right. From a profit perspective very said very consistent the last quarter that we are going to have a gain on the sale, we're going to have a foregone profit and stranded cost, we were going to take actions to address the foregone profit -- or excuse, the stranded cost and structure of our business overall.","And when you take all of that together, there is going to be minimal impact on our full year and let me bring this home to second quarter right now, because as we stated, we expect to close majority if not all of this by the second quarter. And when we take each of the components, the gain on sale, we expect the gain on sale to somewhere be between $500 million and $700 million. And our guidance assumes for right now it\u2019s the low end of that range. With your question, we're going to take actions to address the stranded cost and structures that\u2019s going to spend a majority, a vast majority of that gain.","And then Steve as you know, the return on that restructuring in those actions will help us mitigate the foregone profit in the second half of the year because the second half of the year, we are going to have about a two point revenue headwind with that business gone and we'll have a foregone profit that we're going to have to manages as we go forward, so both for the full year and in the second quarter, minimal to no impact to our profit overall.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Steve. Brandon, could we please take the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is open.","David Grossman","Jim, obviously, you've been open active in divesting or licensing in certain lines of business that are no longer core to your strategy. We certainly understand your reluctances to talk too much about this publicly, but is there anything that you can share with us that they give us, some idea of how many other assets in the portfolio may this profile? And how much of a drag there has been on your growth rate?","Jim Kavanaugh","Thanks David. And I think you've answered your question yourself already. I am not going to comment on any further actions, but I'll just give you the high level perspective. IBM is the high-value company and how we remain high-value is through portfolio optimization. We consistently look at our portfolio, and I think we stated this many times before, we look at many different factors from market attractiveness to our ability to win and differentiate to where client value and profit pools are shifting overtime to the value of our integrated model and how well that place together. And we will consistently do that to make sure that we are optimizing the right level of return for our investors, and we can win in the marketplace and deliver the innovated value and technology to our clients to enable them to win and create competitive advantage. And that's what we're focused on overall, David.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Dave. Let's go to the next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura\/Instinet. Your line is open.","Jeff Kvaal","Yes, question and perhaps a clarification. I think the question is. Could you Jim, help us with the Cloud as a Service revenue? It seems as though the cloud revenue overall accelerated, but I'm not sure that translates to be as a service side of things. I wondered, if you could help shed some light on that? And then secondly, it seems as though you were indicating the backlog for GBS grew and GTS was flat, but it looks like the overall backlog is down and I'm trying to square that circle?","Jim Kavanaugh","Sure, Jeff. No problem. Thanks for the question. So -- but actually both kind of clarification question, so let me just try to address it real quick and directly. Our as a Service -- first of all our cloud, our cloud business accelerated in the quarter. First quarter, we grew 12% overall at constant currency that comes up mid single digits in the fourth quarter. If you look at our as a Service business within that, our as a Service business now has an annualized exit run rate of 11.7 billion and that's up mid-teens. I think 15% if I remember correctly.","And that is down quarter-to-quarter, but Jeff I would tell you that's due to normal seasonality and also as we talked about in the fourth quarter, there were specific project milestones that we achieved in our AMS business that drove that our AMS business to a 4% growth in the fourth quarter, we said that would normalize back down to about flat. So when you take a look at normal seasonality from fourth quarter to first quarter, and you take into account to catch-up of those project milestones as we continuously improve our service delivery quality that was expected from our perspective and we see that continue momentum building throughout the year as we move forward with the value of our offerings and proposition.","And just a clarification question, on backlog. Backlog is down 2% at constant currency. I stated that GBS signings grew, and we have continued momentum in the backlog overall it did not make a comment about that. But I give you some color around the dynamics of the backlog as our GBS business as we architected our offerings and you see a play out in consulting our backlog is moving to a much short duration, higher faster yielding content with greater quality less erosion and its driving backlog realization and revenue momentum. Overall, I did not make a comment about GBS backlog overall.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Jeff. Brandon, why don\u2019t we take one last question?","Operator","Our last question is from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open.","Keith Bachman","Jim, I also want to ask about services and the growth rates. And particularly, if I look at GBS, could you make some comments on the durability of that? It's the first part my question. Application maintenance was flattish. Consulting was pretty good at 9%. Should investors be thinking about 3% to 4% growth for the year? And then the second part of my question as it relates to services, if you could revisit since you've had some time since the Red Hat deal was announced. What are your expectations about how the services business, both GBS and really GTS, how the Red Hat business may impact growth or improve growth once that's included into your portfolio, because I think investors are frankly concerned that GTS may have a long runway or runoff here, but how you're thinking that Red Hat may impact both services business but particularly the GTS side?","Jim Kavanaugh","Thank you, Keith for the question. GBS overall, as I stated, we have very good momentum in the business. Coming throughout the second half of 2018 and into the first quarter where we grew 4% led by consulting up 9% and within that great growth in digital strategy, iX, -- excuse me, our cloud migration and implementation services. NextGen enterprise apps growing. So very good momentum overall.","And again, we're coming off another quarter of growing signings, especially in small deals. So when we look at right in front of us we see pretty consistent performance. I think you said somewhere around 3%. Plus or minus, we see that right in front of us and if we continue as we stated winning in the marketplace and driving those signings in the second half is going to fuel backlog, it's going to fuel revenue, we feel pretty confident as you know we run multiples scenarios about our guidance, which by the way is on earnings per share and free cash flow but we feel pretty confidence that we got a strong hand here, our team that\u2019s executing on the field and we're delivering real value to our clients and that\u2019s why we're seeing the performance overall.","The second question I think you asked if I remember correctly was around our services businesses and Red Hat. First and foremost we're very excited about the potential combination of IBM and Red Hat as we talked about I think in a handful of other areas around us accelerating the leadership in a $1 trillion hybrid cloud market. We believe this differentiates us as we move forward and we can\u2019t be more excited when you look at Red Hat performance, exiting fiscal year 19 and what they reported and shared publicly, accelerating revenue up in the high teens, the backlog is up 22% if I remember correctly, strong margin contribution and they are delivering very strong cash flow.","I think north of a billion dollars on operating cash but when you look at the services piece we're expecting synergistic effects across our portfolio of IBM and us leading this next-generation of hybrid cloud both in our software base of business but also services and when you take a look at services overall, we have spent a lot of time and I talked about this in the prepared remarks about re-architecting our offerings to enable our clients on their journey to cloud, and that spans everything from advising, to building, to moving, to managing.","The journey for all of our clients from an enterprise perspective of really taking the 80% of the next phase of the mission-critical workloads to provide competitive vantage for them, so, we're going to have consulting based on synergistic effects, on strategy implementation, we're going to have cloud migration, app development. There's a whole slew of offerings that our teams are now armed with. And we are ready to go once we close this acquisition overall.","So thank you all for very good questions. Let me wrap it up and just make a couple comments. We had a solid start to the year as I said and I firmly believe the fundamentals of our business model are playing out in terms of growth in key high-value areas like software and GBS, while delivering strong operating leverage across our business. We will continue this in the second quarter with revenue dynamics from 1Q to 2Q similar to last couple of years, which is about a sequential dollar increase of $900 million to a $1 billion.","And as I said, we expect our second quarter to be about 22% of our full year EPS and that is right in line with what our last three years have been. So, from seasonality, you should expect pretty similar to history. This keeps us right on track for a full year expectations for earnings per share and free cash flow, and we will continue to take actions to plan for Red Hat acquisition and position this company for the longer term.","So with that, I thank you for joining us today. We look forward to continuing the dialogue over the course of the year.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Brandon. Let me have you close up the call.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time."],"11903":["International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call January 21, 2020  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Patricia Murphy - Vice President, Investor Relations ","Jim Kavanaugh - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Matt Cabral - Credit Suisse","Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein","Amit Daryanani - Evercore ISI","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","Jim Suva - Citigroup","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","Operator","Welcome, and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma'am, you may begin.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM, and I want to welcome you to our Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Presentation. I\u2019m here with Jim Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll post today\u2019s prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow.","Some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company\u2019s SEC filings.","Our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, to provide additional information to investors. For example, consistent with last quarter\u2019s format, we present revenue growth at constant currency throughout the presentation. In addition, to provide a view consistent with our go-forward business, we\u2019ll focus on constant currency growth adjusting for the divested businesses for the impacted lines of total revenue, cloud and our geographic performance.","We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation, and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC. I also want to remind you that IBM\u2019s revenue, profit and earnings per share reflect the impact of purchase accounting and other transaction-related adjustments associated with the acquisition of Red Hat. These adjustments and charges are primarily non-cash.","So, with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Kavanaugh","Thanks Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We had a solid finish to 2019. In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue at actual rates, and it was up 3% at constant currency, excluding divestitures. Our operating gross margin was up over two points, which is the best margin expansion in some time. We delivered $4.2 billion of operating net income, and $6 billion of free cash flow, and we had $4.71 of operating earnings per share.","We also reduced our debt balance by another $3 billion in the quarter, for a total reduction of $10 billion since the end of June. This caps off a year with $77 billion of revenue, $12.81 of operating earnings per share, and about $12 billion of free cash flow, in-line with our expectations. In 2019, we took a number of actions to strengthen our foundation for the next chapter of our clients\u2019 digital reinventions.","We acquired Red Hat, with the number one Linux operating system, RHEL, and the leading hybrid cloud platform, OpenShift. We modernized our software portfolio, making it cloud-native and optimized for OpenShift. We announced the industry\u2019s first public cloud designed specifically for financial services. We expanded our services offerings and skills for the cloud journey, including consulting and technology services for Red Hat and multi-cloud management.","We expanded the reach of our Watson AI offerings, and we are leading the industry in our approach to trust and transparency for data and AI. We continued to deliver innovation in areas like our new z15 mainframe and quantum. And we divested select software and services businesses as we continue to prioritize our investments and optimize our portfolio. With 3% revenue growth, we\u2019ve started to see the benefits in our fourth quarter results.","Cloud and Cognitive Software revenue was up 9%. We had growth in all three lines of business, reflecting demand across our software portfolio. We had good adoption of our Cloud Paks, continued growth in security and Red Hat again posted strong performance. In Global Business Services, we had continued growth in consulting and in application monetization projects, as we help our clients on their digital journeys.","We\u2019re also seeing this in our GBS signings this quarter, including acceleration in new Red Hat engagements. Global Technology Services revenue was down 4%, in line with the expectations we discussed last quarter. We expanded Global Technology Services gross margin, consistent with our focus on managing the business for margin and profit. And in Systems, we had a good start to our z15 cycle and growth in high-end storage, resulting in double-digit revenue growth and gross margin expansion in the segment.","Across our segments, our Cloud revenue growth improved to 23% this quarter, and our cloud revenue for the year was $21 billion. By leveraging our technology, incumbency and expertise to help our clients with their journeys to cloud, it now represents 27% of our revenue. ","We know there\u2019s a lot of interest in our hybrid cloud approach, including Red Hat, so I\u2019ll focus on that up front. As we have said, the next chapter of cloud will be driven by mission-critical workloads managed in a hybrid, multi-cloud environment. This will be based on a foundation of Linux, with containers and Kubernetes. This quarter we had strong performance in RHEL and OpenShift.","Red Hat\u2019s normalized revenue was up 24%, eclipsing a billion dollars in a quarter for the first time. In August, we introduced Cloud Paks, cloud-native software that simplifies deployment, reduces operational costs, and allows clients to build once and run anywhere. Cloud Paks bring together IBM middleware, AI, management and security, and Red Hat\u2019s OpenShift platform.","Our strong performance in Cloud Paks this quarter is an example of the synergy from the IBM and Red Hat combination. As we look forward, the largest hybrid cloud opportunity is in services, advising clients on architectural choices, moving workloads, building new applications and of course managing them.","With IBM Services\u2019 expertise in digital reinventions and managing mission-critical workloads, we are well positioned to help our clients on this journey. And now in the fourth quarter, demand for our cloud capabilities continue to ramp and we\u2019re starting to realize the synergies across IBM and Red Hat. We see it in our total cloud revenue, which as I said was up 23%, and we see it in our combined software revenue growth of 9%. ","Across GBS and GTS, we nearly doubled the number of new services engagements leveraging Red Hat versus last quarter. We\u2019re continuing to expand our client base, and now have over 2,000 clients using Red Hat and IBM container solutions. And we doubled the number of Red Hat large deals versus the previous quarter, with 21 customers with deals greater than $10 million.","And as I said, Red Hat\u2019s normalized revenue is up 24%. Within that, Infrastructure revenue, which is predominantly RHEL, was again up double-digits, and a point higher than last quarter\u2019s rate. We\u2019re continuing to take share with RHEL as clients put more of their enterprise workloads on Linux. Revenue in Application Development and emerging technologies was up over 50% this quarter, driven by OpenShift and Ansible.","As I mentioned, IBM\u2019s Cloud Paks include the OpenShift platform, and so as we sell Cloud Paks, this drives additional Red Hat OpenShift revenue. The transactional nature of Cloud Pak sales accelerated the revenue growth of OpenShift and total Red Hat, reflecting IBM\u2019s seasonally strongest quarter.","Our partners also see the value of IBM and Red Hat. For example, we\u2019re expanding IBM\u2019s partnership with Workday, one of our most important enterprise-wide business platform providers. As Workday grows, it has committed to using the Red Hat portfolio as a key component of its service delivery infrastructure. Workday is also expanding its use of the IBM Cloud.","We\u2019re also extending our partnership with Box. Box has chosen Red Hat to help power its IT infrastructure and Watson as its preferred AI provider for intelligent business processes. IBM and Box are also working together to deliver joint solutions focused on governance, security and AI. And so, we\u2019re off to a great start with Red Hat, with solid revenue trajectory and expanding client base, both good indicators of our clients\u2019 confidence in the value of IBM and Red Hat together.","So, let me turn to IBM\u2019s key financial metrics. Similar to last quarter, IBM\u2019s revenue, profit, and operating earnings per share reflect the impact of Red Hat\u2019s non-cash, transaction-related activity and adjustments. Our revenue of $21.8 billion was up more than $3.7 billion sequentially. That\u2019s above the high-end of the range we discussed in October. ","Strong transactional performance drove our 3% year-to-year revenue growth. With the contribution from our high-value software and systems, our operating gross margin was up 230 basis points, and our gross profit dollars were up 5%. ","Our operating expense was up 15%, reflecting the impact of Red Hat, and significant investments we\u2019re making to strengthen our foundation for chapter two, and deliver sustainable revenue growth. The majority of the increase, 10 of the 15 points, is driven by acquisitions and divestitures. This includes Red Hat\u2019s operational spending and higher interest expense associated with the incremental debt we took on.","The 10-point increase also reflects a year-to-year benefit from divested businesses, including a gain of about $135 million associated with a divestiture completed in the fourth quarter, but to be clear, the benefit from the divestiture gain is more than offset by the investments we\u2019re making in innovation and in go-to-market capabilities.","Over the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve had higher spending for our z15 launch, for the containerization of our software, and for research in areas like quantum. And you see that in higher base expense across SG&A, research and development, which together with lower IP income drove 4 points of our expense increase. Our operating tax rate in the quarter reflects a full-year rate of about 9%, versus the all-in operating tax rate of 9% to 10% we previously discussed.","Looking at our free cash flow, as I said earlier, we generated $6 billion in the quarter, and nearly $12 billion for the year. That\u2019s 126% of GAAP net income. Our strong cash generation and focus on capital allocation leaves us with a stronger balance sheet, ending the year with a cash balance of about $9 billion, and an improved debt profile with $10 billion of debt reduction in the second half.","So, now I\u2019ll turn to the segment results, starting with Cloud and Cognitive Software, which was up 9% this quarter. We had growth across all three lines of business of Cloud and Data Platforms, Cognitive Applications, and Transaction Processing Platforms. And cloud revenue in the segment was up over 75%, demonstrating good adoption of our hybrid cloud solutions, including Red Hat and Cloud Paks.","Looking at the business areas, Cloud and Data Platforms revenue was up 20% this quarter. This is one area we\u2019re starting to see the synergies of bringing IBM and Red Hat together. We had broad-based traction across the suite of Cloud Paks that addresses workloads from automation to data to integration. Clients are realizing the benefits of hybrid cloud with this containerized middleware and data platform software portfolio, including faster deployment and improved automation.","Cognitive Applications grew this quarter, reflecting the strength of our AI led software solutions, including areas like Security and IoT. We are continuing to drive new innovations in these areas. In November, we launched the Cloud Pak for Security, and early client reaction has been positive. This offering allows clients to integrate their security tools and connect to existing data sources, enabling them to resolve security incidents more quickly, using open standards. This is the way we believe companies will effectively handle security in the hybrid cloud era and get more value for what they\u2019ve already invested in cybersecurity.","In IoT, we announced Maximo Asset Monitor. This is a new AI-powered monitoring solution designed to help maintenance and operations leaders better understand and improve the performance of their high-value physical assets. This new offering extends the Maximo suite, deployed in nearly 100 countries and recognized by IDC as a leader for Enterprise Asset Management applications.","And then in Transaction Processing Platforms, revenue also grew this quarter. This performance reflects the value we provide clients managing critical workloads, and their preference for predictability in IT spend. While not directly correlated, new innovation, like the z15 mainframe, bolsters clients\u2019 confidence and drives commitment to our platform for the longer-term.","Looking at the profit for this segment, the decline in pre-tax margin was driven by the purchase accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition. We are pleased with the momentum in Cloud and Cognitive Software in 2019. Revenue was up 6% for the year, driven by the hybrid cloud strategy, modernization of our software portfolio and the strength of IBM and Red Hat together.","Moving to Global Business Services, our revenue was flat in the quarter, and up for the year. In GBS, we bring together industry and technical expertise to help clients with their digital reinventions. As we enter chapter two, clients are making architectural choices and embarking on application-led transformations. We\u2019ve been investing in offerings and capabilities to help advise clients, and move their applications to a hybrid multi-cloud.","Against this backdrop, our consulting revenue grew 4%, driven by services that enable each phase of our clients\u2019 digital journey. We again had growth in application modernization and development, next-generation enterprise applications like S\/4 Hana and Salesforce, and in offerings that use AI to unlock new opportunities and realize productivity improvements. We see this at ExxonMobil, where GBS iX partnered with the client to create its recently announced ExxonMobil Rewards+, the all-in-one loyalty and payment application, which is hosted on the IBM Cloud.","Our Application Management performance reflects continued revenue growth across the offerings that build and manage cloud applications. The year-to-year decline in AMS reflects strong prior year performance, driven by the achievement of significant milestones across a few accounts. In Global Process Services, revenue declined, as demand is shifting from traditional BPO offerings to new business platforms around intelligent workflows.","Overall, we had good signings performance across all three lines of business in GBS, with strong demand in digital strategy and iX, cloud application development and modernization, and offerings around intelligent workflows. We more than doubled our Red Hat signings sequentially and had 50 new client engagements in the quarter with companies such as Honda, Toyota, and Vodafone.","Turning to profit, GBS gross margin was 27%. While this is flat year-to-year, we had margin contribution from yield on our contract delivery improvements, mix shift to higher value content, and currency benefit from leveraging our global delivery resource footprint. This was offset by investments we\u2019re making in capacity and offerings to capture the market opportunity. Overall, GBS had another solid year, with full-year revenue growth of 2% and gross margin expanding by almost a point. ","In Global Technology Services, revenue declined 4%, consistent with our expectations as we came into the quarter. We again had year-to-year declines due to lower client business volumes, impacting some of the more traditional labor-based managed services. We are taking actions to accelerate the shift to higher value segments of the market opportunity. We are introducing new managed services offerings for public and private cloud, in areas like cybersecurity, data management, and hybrid orchestration.","We are investing in joint services offerings across GBS and GTS, and deploying joint go-to-market capability, as clients look for solutions across applications and infrastructure. We are expanding our cloud data center footprint, and we are taking structural actions to improve our cost competitiveness, while deploying a more asset-based delivery model.","Our incumbency is a huge differentiator as the shift of mission-critical workloads to the cloud accelerates, given our intimate knowledge of our clients\u2019 industry, business, and regulatory requirements. An example is the first financial services-ready public cloud that I mentioned earlier. We developed this, in collaboration with Bank of America, leveraging our knowledge of the financial services industry environment to address the requirements for regulatory compliance, security, and resiliency.","We continued to have solid growth in our cloud offerings in GTS, with 13% growth in cloud revenue and double-digit growth in cloud signings. This quarter, clients such as Banco Sabadell and Broadridge are turning to IBM to enable their transition to cloud. At Banco Sabadell, IBM will modernize the bank\u2019s IT environment.","We\u2019re bringing together IBM Services and Red Hat OpenShift to deploy new cloud-native applications and modernize existing ones, while meeting the bank\u2019s security and regulatory requirements. And, at Broadridge, we are moving their mission-critical workloads to the cloud. This solution will leverage our deep financial services industry expertise and open source capabilities to allow Broadridge to provide industry-leading solutions.","Turning to profit, we had good gross margin performance in GTS. Our year-to-year gross margin expansion of 20 basis points was driven by continued scale out of our public cloud, the mix of our portfolio, and our productivity actions. We had the largest sequential improvement in pre-tax margin in some time.","In Systems, revenue was up 16% this quarter. Growth in IBM Z and Storage was mitigated by a decline in Power. IBM Z was up a strong 63%. The performance reflects our first full quarter of z15, and demonstrates the client demand for technology that addresses data privacy and resiliency, across hybrid cloud.","We shipped the highest MIPs in history this quarter, driven by growth in new workloads. And we\u2019ve already seen broad adoption of the new mainframe across a number of industries and countries. For example, we see large financial institutions migrating their global mainframe footprint to z15 as a critical backbone of their environment and cloud-native strategy. ","Cloud-native development simplifies building new applications and modernizing existing ones. This gives developers a consistent way to deploy their applications across public and private clouds, while taking advantage of the underlying performance, resiliency, and security of IBM Z.","And in October, we announced Red Hat OpenShift for IBM Z, bringing together the industry\u2019s most comprehensive enterprise container and Kubernetes platform with the enterprise server platforms of IBM Z and Linux One. With these unique innovations, IBM Z continues to deliver a high-value, secure, and scalable platform for our clients. ","In the fourth quarter, Power declined. I\u2019ll remind you that last year we launched our next generation POWER9 processors in the high-end, as well as completed the roll-out of our supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy. Storage revenue was up 3%, led by growth in the high-end.","In November, we launched the next generation high-end storage system, DS8900. This new system, tightly integrated with the z15 mainframe, offers industry-leading response times, availability and pervasive end-to-end encryption. Looking at profit, our Systems pre-tax margin was up more than five points, reflecting the benefit from new hardware launches. New innovation is fundamental to this segment, and we\u2019ve accomplished a lot this year with the release of both the new z15 mainframe and DS8900 high-end storage.","Now turning to cash, we generated $6.7 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables, and $6 billion of free cash flow. This capped off a year with $14.3 billion of cash from operations, also excluding financing receivables. Our net capital expenditures were $2.4 billion. The year-to-year decline reflects our strategy to de-emphasize lower value content across our services and financing portfolios.","It also includes a benefit from real estate sales, which reduced our net CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $11.9 billion in 2019, in-line with our view from the beginning of the year. And our free cash flow realization was 126%. I\u2019ll remind you our free cash flow reflects a few headwinds we\u2019ve discussed, including the headwind in cash taxes, predominantly in the second half, the impact from Red Hat, including pre-closing financing costs, and the impacts of actions we\u2019ve taken on our portfolio.","Looking at uses of cash, of course our largest was the acquisition of Red Hat. We also returned over $7 billion to shareholders this year. This includes $5.7 billion in dividends. We\u2019ve now increased our dividend per share for 24 consecutive years, and we remain committed to growing our dividend. We also spent $1.4 billion on share repurchases prior to the closing of Red Hat.","Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of $9 billion. That\u2019s down $3 billion from a year ago, when we were increasing our cash balance in advance of the Red Hat acquisition.","Now, let me spend a minute on our debt profile. With the additional debt we took on to fund the Red Hat transaction, we had $73 billion in debt at the end of June, a combination of Global Financing debt, and non-financing, or what I\u2019ll call core debt. We suspended our share repurchases at the time of the Red Hat acquisition, allowing us to focus our strong cash generation on debt repayment.","In the fourth quarter, we reduced our debt by $3 billion, contributing to a $10 billion reduction in IBM\u2019s core debt since June. Our total debt now stands at $63 billion, of which core debt is $38 billion. This puts us on track to achieve a leverage ratio consistent with a mid to high single-A rating within a couple of years.","I also want to comment on our Global Financing debt, which is fully supported by financing assets, with a leverage ratio of 9 to 1. While there is no meaningful change to debt levels in the second half, we reduced our Global Financing debt by $6.5 billion since the beginning of the year. In February, we announced the wind down of our OEM commercial financing operations, which we essentially completed by the end of the year.","In addition to reducing our debt levels, this improved the overall credit quality of our receivables, which ended the year at 62% investment grade. And as we typically do in January, I want to provide an update on the performance of our retirement-related plans. Our U.S. plan has been frozen since 2008, and over the last several years, we\u2019ve moved our asset base to a lower risk, lower return profile.","We had strong returns this year, with just under 15% return on assets, well ahead of our expected returns. At the end of 2019, in aggregate our worldwide qualified plans are funded at 102%, with the U.S. at 107%, that\u2019s up 3 and 2 points, respectively, from a year ago. You can see our retirement-related plans continue to be well funded.","Now, let me wrap up with a few comments on 2019, and how this positions us for 2020. We\u2019ve been focused on the next chapter of our clients\u2019 digital reinventions. Up front, I talked about what we\u2019ve done in 2019 to strengthen our foundation for chapter two. We acquired Red Hat, modernized our software portfolio, and brought these together to create the leading hybrid cloud platform.","We are introducing joint GBS and GTS offerings to help clients on their cloud journeys. We brought new innovations to market, I mentioned the Cloud Paks, the financial services public cloud, z15 and high-end storage. We also have a leadership position in quantum, and again we\u2019re the leader in U.S. patents.","At the same time, we divested some businesses that weren\u2019t important to our success in chapter two. And now in the fourth quarter, we had good transactional performance across our high-value software and systems. ","We\u2019re starting to realize the synergies from the combination of IBM and Red Hat in Cloud Paks, in services engagements, and in Red Hat itself. And in services, we\u2019re seeing good growth across GBS and GTS in the services to advise, migrate, build and manage hybrid cloud environments, along with some pressure in the traditional labor-based services.","All together, we delivered revenue growth of 3% this quarter. With our high value mix and focus on productivity, we expanded our gross margin. And we had strong free cash flow generation. With this trajectory, in 2020 we expect to grow revenue, operating earnings per share and free cash flow, and expand operating gross margin.","Within that, we\u2019ll maintain a high level of investment, focused on hybrid cloud and data and AI capabilities. We\u2019ll drive productivity and take structural actions, especially in our GTS business. And remember, we\u2019ll continue to face year-to-year headwinds from the divested businesses, especially in the first half, and our P&L will also still have an impact from the Red Hat non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, though less than 2019.","Looking at tax, we expect an operating tax rate in the range of 7% to 9%. Like 2019, that\u2019s an all-in rate, including an estimate of discrete items. Put all of this together, we expect to deliver at least $13.35 of operating earnings per share for the year. Turning to free cash flow, we expect about $12.5 billion in 2020. Within that, we\u2019re expecting growth in CapEx as we continue to build out cloud capacity. And as we said back in August, we expect Red Hat to be accretive to free cash flow, and that\u2019s net of the incremental interest expense.","With that, let me turn it back over to Patricia for the Q&A.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to mention a few items. First, I\u2019ll remind you that the year-to-year growth rates we\u2019re providing today for Red Hat are normalized, to provide comparability to Red Hat\u2019s historical performance. Second, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and the full year. And finally, as always, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.","So, Sheila, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thank you. Jim, nice to see the strong overall revenue performance and Red Hat performance as well. I know you don't explicitly guide revenues, but can you help at a high-level bridge the big items that we should be thinking about in 2020 relative to 2019 for revenues? And then do the same for free cash flow. I know you touched a little bit on CapEx, but if you could maybe break it down between core business, Red Hat, tax, pension, what are some of the larger puts and takes that we should think about embedded in that $500 million increase year-to-year? That would be great. Thank you.","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay. Thank you, Wamsi, and I appreciate the compliment to all the IBM-ers around there, who have been working hard. Let me start out as we always talk about our guidance. It's the first time we're coming out with 2020 guidance overall. And as we always do, we take into account multiple scenarios trajectory of our business, operational indices, business plans, etc., and all that gives us confidence in the expectation we went out with regards to $13.35 at least on EPS, and approximately $12.5 billion, but there are a couple of things underneath that, and some of them, which you talked about, let me just share some of the color.","So, first around currency. Currency, we expect on a full-year to be pretty de minimis between 0 point and 1 point of a headwind, a little bit different what we've been challenged with the last [few years], but most of that's going to be here in the first half and in the first quarter at current spot rates.","Second, we've done a lot of work around our portfolio optimization, divest the non-core assets, that is going to be about 1-point impact on the year and a 2-point impact in the first half, very similar to what we just finished in second half of the year. Three, we're continuing to deal with the deferred revenue impairment and we were very transparent on Investor Day, we gave you the four-quarter roll out, and that's predominantly a first half statement, second half it's lessened. And four, embedded in our results as we talked about in prepared remarks, we'll go through.","In GTS, we are going to take aggressive structural actions to reposition the business overall. I would tell you, if you look at the last few years, that will probably be on the high-end of that. And when you take a look at our guidance on tax, which again to be fully transparent 7% to 9%, that is all-in including discretes, we expect a tax discrete benefit in the first quarter that will pretty much offset the charge, and on a full-year basis be immaterial. So, that's some of the color behind the overall.","Now, when you talk about the full-year, I mean, you look at our guidance in the full-year, we will grow revenue, we will grow operating earnings per share, we will grow free cash flow, and we will continue to expand margins nicely. And embedded in that, will be continued acceleration of our cloud business and continued good growth out of the IBM plus Red Hat together.","Patricia Murphy","Okay, Wamsi. Let's go to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hi, thanks, good afternoon to you guys. Just \u2013 I guess I'm also intrigued by the revenue growth outlook for 2020. And again, I know you can't get too much on segment thoughts, but with GTS signings down, the short cycle stuff was an issue last quarter. I'm curious, just your visibility or confidence in delivering the revenue growth against that what you see with GTS, again recognizing that you also have some structural actions to do.","Jim Kavanaugh","Yes, well, let's talk about since we got asked twice, and again, Tien-tsin, thank you for the question. Overall, as I said, at the IBM level, we expect to grow revenue, operating earnings per share, free cash flow and continue to expand margins. Within that, when you look at it by segment, let me give you some of the colors from a segment.","Number one, we continue to have a very strong portfolio and offering line-up in our software base of business, complementing now with the Red Hat acquisition, you're seeing in our results the synergistic value we're bringing to our clients, bringing IBM and Red Hat together, and we see consistent performance in that segment.","GBS overall, we actually finished pretty strong in GBS, very strong signings in the quarter. We returned that business for the first time in years back to backlog growth and we're pretty optimistic about accelerated growth in 2020. GTS, to your question, we talked about 90 days ago, fourth quarter played out pretty consistent with the guidance we gave 90 days ago.","And when you look at our backlog position where we ended, and you look into 2020, we are going to take actions around high-value portfolio optimization, around offerings, around go-to-market models, around incentives and changing our operating model in light of what we're seeing in the marketplace, and I would see an improving trend in GTS as we move through the year predominantly in the second half.","And then if you look at Systems, we're off to a very good start. That segment has always been predicated based on bringing new innovation and value to market. Our z15 and new high-end storage, which we brought the market, both grew nicely. Value proposition resonating. We expect a very strong first half in both of those, and we'll see as we get into the second half, how this cycle plays out.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Tien-tsin, for the question. Sheila, can we please go to the next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Matt Cabral","Yes. Thank you. Wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the performance in GBS, and in particular dig into what's driving the divergence between consulting and apps management. And then related to that, just if you can walk through what drove the pressure on PTI margins for the segment in the fourth quarter and how we should think about profitability there going forward?","Jim Kavanaugh","Sure. Thanks, Matt. I appreciate the question. GBS overall, first of all, we talked about 90 days ago, we were facing a very difficult compare. When you look at fourth quarter last year, I think I'm going off memory, we grew high single-digit overall, we were double-digit consulting growth, we returned application management to mid-single-digit growth. And we talked at that time that we had done a lot of work about improving the quality of our delivery and we had achieved significant milestones that were contributing to fourth quarter last year. And by the way, if I remember correctly, our pre-tax income was up 30% to 40% fourth quarter last year.","So, we knew what we were entering here in the fourth quarter, but I'll tell you, overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the GBS space of business for the full-year, second year in a row, consistent revenue growth. We grew operating gross profit margins by 90 basis points. We continue to reposition this business to capture the growth in our clients' digital reinventions and journey to cloud, we're seeing nice acceleration in both.","And as I just said on the prior question, we finished the year pretty strong in GBS with regards to signings growth, returning to overall backlog back to growth and we see an accelerated GBS positioning going into 2020. And to your question, that's really led by, you know we've talked about the rationale of Chapter 2 around hybrid cloud, around a large portion of mission critical workloads that are going to move to the cloud as we move forward and hybrid is going to be that destination.","I think what you're seeing is the natural early innings of that playing out, and that is represented more so in project-based businesses around cloud advisory, cloud application, migration, and advisory services. So, consulting is leading the way, but to me, that's the tip of the arrow that's going to lead then AMS, and then eventually as that matures, our GTS managed services going forward.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Matt. Can we please go to the next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes, thank you for the question. You talked a lot about the very strong transactional performance in the quarter, I think better than your expectations. Is there a risk that that pulled forward any revenue from 2020? And I think you talked about 4% to 5% revenue growth on your August call for 2020. Is that something we should still be thinking about? And then on cash flow, I know a number of people have asked, but maybe you can just draw a bridge between this year and next year. You're up about $0.5 billion. I think you've said Red Hat alone will contribute $0.5 billion. That implies that everything ex-Red Hat is flat despite the fact that margins appear to be going up and you seem quite confident in some of the businesses. So, maybe you can also just help with that bridge as well. Thanks so much.","Jim Kavanaugh","Thanks, Tony. Appreciate the questions overall. Let me try to take each of these, and piece parts. First of all, fourth quarter, yes. If you dial back 90 days ago, we talked about our seasonality in our business and we were looking for a transactional quarter that would take our sequential growth up about $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, and we achieved above that high-end. Now, truth be told all transparency, currency got a little bit better in the quarter, but even with that, we still beat the high-end of our guidance overall, and most importantly returned IBM back to revenue growth.","Now, when you look underneath the transactional performance, I would tell you, one, our mainframe, we're off to a normal cycle here in the quarter. We had a very good start. Our first full-quarter, grown 63%, highest MIPS ship in history. So, I would tell you that less about a pull-forward from 2020, that's kind of normal cycle. And when you get underneath software, we've got good momentum.","We spent a lot to invest and modernize our software portfolio, containerized our offerings, make them cloud-native, and optimized and OpenShift with Red Hat to play out the synergistic value of IBM plus Red Hat, and I think we're seeing very good momentum in adoption in our Cloud Paks here in the fourth quarter. The only area I would call out, and we've talked about this many times, and that is our transaction processing platforms.","We've run mission critical workloads on our systems for our clients, it's high value for our clients, it's high value for IBM. And there\u2019s always volatility in that portfolio on when clients choose to commit to our platform for the long-term. And you saw in the fourth quarter, we actually did better than our internal expectation. So, we're taking a prudent view of that in 2020, but I think that's another instantiation of the innovative value we bring to the marketplace with our systems offerings overall.","So that's what I would say with regards to your first question, I'm trying to remember all of them. Let me go to free cash flow. Very important. We said approximately $12.5 billion, and when you look underneath that, yes, during the Investor Day, we said over the next two years, Red Hat and IBM will deliver $1.5 billion of free cash flow. By the way, that Red Hat will be free cash flow accretive in year one, and we are well on our path for that.","So, when you look at the dynamics of our free cash flow, it's really in a couple of different buckets. A couple of headwinds. A couple of tailwinds. On the tailwind side, we're going to have operational profit and we're going to have Red Hat contribution, all-in, net of incremental interest expense, retention, etc., will be accretive in year one. On the headwind side, we are going to invest.","In 2019, our capital we were driving a balanced capital allocation process, driving efficiencies out of that, that will wrap in 2019 and we will have a headwind in CapEx and the investing in our business, and we will also have a headwind in cash tax overall. And when you take a look to your last question around revenue, I would tell you right now, we said it in August that Red Hat \u2013 IBM plus Red Hat together would deliver 4 points to 5 points.","When I look at where the current estimate is in consensus in the Street, I think the Street is pretty reasonable. It's 3% overall, you add at constant currency, with the headwind on the currency to stronger dollar, and you look at our divestitures, we're at mid-single-digit growth. So, I think the current estimates out there are reasonable.","Patricia Murphy","Great, thanks. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess, Jim, when I look at the calendar 2020 EPS guide, in the past, you kind of talked about how does the contribution fall out for Q1 and the first half broadly on an EPS on rate basis. I was wondering if you could just touch on \u2013 does Q1 account for 17%, 18% of full year's EPS again, or does that now change a little bit with Red Hat? And then secondly, on the tax rate, just so I get this clear, the delta between the 8% tax rate that you're guiding for versus the 11% and 12% that people had in the models, that's essentially all the discrete benefit we get in Q1. Is that fair?","Jim Kavanaugh","Yes. Thanks, Amit. I appreciate the question. And let me take each of them. Just quickly, net, you're right. On color of first quarter, it is a little different, just given the Red Hat. And if you go back to how we were transparent and hopefully everyone appreciates this as I go out and talk to investors, we've given you the deferred revenue impairment charge for the first four quarters after the closure of the Red Hat transaction, but really when you look at our first quarter, first on EPS.","We expect EPS from SKU perspective to be between 14% and 15% of the full-year. Underneath that, that is basically on our historical trajectory, less the Red Hat deferred revenue impairment, which as we told you is about $400 million. So, pretty normal SKU, taking into account the Red Hat deferred element.","In terms of revenue, we look at revenue and we see \u2013 again, can't predict currency. We're calling currency between a small impact to about 1-point impact right now, all that varies depending on our geographic and product mix, but we're seeing right now at a constant currency level, accelerated growth of about half-a-point here from fourth quarter to first quarter at constant currency.","And when you take a look at tax rate, very good question. We printed in 2019, 8.5% all-in. We guided pretty much right between that, 7% to 9% overall. That does include discretes as we're trying to give you increased transparency and what's in our expectation, but very important to note, is I talked about we will be taking structural actions to reposition our GTS business from a cost competitiveness perspective in light of what we're seeing in the marketplace. And unlike last year where we had a funding event with regards to a gain that offset a charge, this year we're taking a charge and we're going to absorb that through the return of that. So, we really don't see a benefit overall, as we go forward.","Patricia Murphy","Great. Thanks, Amit. Let's go to the next question please.","Operator","Next, we will hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty","Yes, thank you. Two quick questions. First, Jim, you mentioned the possibility of taking structural actions in GTS this year. What might that entail? And then back in August, you had outlined about $1.65 billion of potential revenue synergies post Red Hat. Any context around how much of that you have captured? Should we think about the 4-point acceleration in Red Hat pro forma growth as signaling the type of revenue synergies that you've been able to capture? Thank you.","Jim Kavanaugh","Yes, so let me take the second one first, and we'll talk about synergies. So, obviously as I stated upfront, we're very pleased with the first six months here of bringing IBM and Red Hat together, and I think you could see based on the performance in the acceleration that we are truly better together. We're delivering the synergistic value to our clients overall. The best way, when I look at it, first of all, the accelerated revenue in Red Hat, up 24% year-over-year is one instantiation.","The second, and I know many of you out there have been writing and have different models of trying to figure out what's IBM's organic revenue number and so forth, and I've been spent a lot of time with our investors. And let me give you the way we look at it and how we're managing to ensure that we drive the synergistic value of the technology architecture decisions we're making and the go-to-market leverage of our scale and large enterprise presence, which gets at your $1.6 billion-plus of synergistic effect.","When we look at our business overall, we're looking for the lift in the growth in the acceleration of our overall software business. And when we look at the operational performance of this segment, we look at it on an all-in historical normalized basis. And at that level, our software growth accelerated all-in to 3%. Now, what does this reflect to your question? It reflects in my opinion, the true demand of our software demand from our clients, including Red Hat. Then adjusting out the deferred revenue impairment impact and Red Hat's stand-alone revenue last year.","So, when you look at what we talked about in Investor Day, we talked about sell more Blue IBM and we talked about sell more Red. The sell more Red was our global presence and our scale to accelerate Red Hat overall. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing a great progress. We had 21 deals above $10 million, up 2x year-over-year, and over half of those deals were large IBM enterprise clients.","So, we are seeing the instantiation of the leverage of the IBM side. And around sell more IBM, I just told you about accelerating software revenue. We have now over 2,000 clients on OpenShift and Cloud Paks, and around services, we've signed hundreds of services Red Hat engagement deals overall, including several design wins in network cloud providers around 5G that will play out as we go through 2020.","Patricia Murphy","Great, thanks. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","David Grossman","Thank you. Good afternoon. Jim, can you give us a little better insight into the specific issues that are impacting GTS, including the bookings performance? And what underlies your confidence that growth should improve as the year progresses given that the GTS turnaround really, truth be told, is probably eight or nine quarters in already and taking longer than you anticipated?","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay. David, thank you very much for the question. And let me start with providing some overall context, because I think it's important to share what are we seeing in the market and then how that informs our actions. As you heard in the prepared remarks, we printed down 4%, consistent with our expectations and what we talked about 90 days ago as we're experienced lower client base business volumes, but it's important to note, GTS, one, has the industry-leading market share position, two, has the global footprint and scale, and three, most importantly has a very integral role into the integrated value proposition of IBM overall as we run the mission critical workloads for many of our clients overall.","And by the way, you see that playing out in our cloud-based performance in GTS, where over the trailing 12 months, we got over $8.5 billion book of business that's growing double-digits, and you heard the significant wins we had in the quarter, Broadridge, Banco Sabadell, Bank of America public cloud, in addition to several Red Hat wins, including what I just said about some design wins with network providers, but I'll tell you what we're seeing in the marketplace, David, to your point is clients are making architectural choices. ","They are embarking on application-led transformation. And we see this opportunity really playing out as I said earlier, in project-based services, the advice, the build, the migrate, which is very aligned to our GBS business. And by the way, that's why we feel pretty confident in where we ended 2019 and our opportunity in 2020 around GTS.","Now, if you look at \u2013 as client adoption matures and it moves through the advisory phase and the application modernization phase, this will naturally extend to our GTS aligned managed services phase, which should scale up over time. And that's why I said, more of a second-half play as we go forward. So, in-light of that, what we're seeing in the marketplace, we are going to take aggressive actions around our GTS business model.","We are going to reposition this business for hybrid cloud investing jointly, integrating GTS and GBS offerings around advise, build, move and manage, we are creating a building skills and investing, and where we see the growth right in front of us, that's starting to scale around cybersecurity management, trust and compliance services, multi-cloud management, and of course managed services around OpenShift. ","And second, we are going to integrate our go-to-market with GBS and our global account teams at the large enterprise level. We're going to take these integrated offerings, leverage now the integrated value and breadth of IBM that can play across the continuum as clients move to journey to the cloud. And we're going to go drive that hard. And in addition, I would tell you, we are going to improve the cost competitive structure of this business with the actions we're going to take here early in 2020.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, David. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Next, we will hear from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. Everything you talked about totally makes sense and [jives]. And I have one question and it's probably because I'm just definitely not the smartest one out there. And that's on the signing\u2019s numbers. That number appears, if my number looks right in the calculations, that it was down year-over-year. Are there some features going on, like maybe larger contracts rolling off, or something with timing we should be aware of, or at some point, shouldn't that revert to be positive or if not, why? Kind of what's going on about why everything else is going so well, but the signings number just looks like it just didn't materialize to be up?","Jim Kavanaugh","Sure, Jim. Thanks for your question. I appreciate it. And no, you got the numbers right. So, let me talk a little bit about signings overall, and more importantly, as I've always said before, signings vary, they're not all equal, how they impact backlog, how they impact realization. But if you look at our signings overall, we delivered $14.4 billion. I would tell you internally, that was actually above our expectations. Why? To your point, we were coming off of a very difficult compare last year.","Signings are down 9% overall. And when you look underneath it to my point about all signings are not equal, and you break out large deals from smaller deals, and let me just use $100 million as I've been for the last few quarters here, our large deal signings greater than $100 million were down 34%. That was coming off of last year where we had 19 deals above $100 million, predominantly in our GTS base of business, of which many of those were natural extensions and not new logos.","That's the point about signings not being equal, but our smaller deals, less than $100 million by the way, which is still big, were up double digits, both for the quarter and for the half, and across both businesses, GTS and GBS. Back to David Grossman's question, I think you're seeing the natural evolution of the early innings of this journey to cloud as we move forward.","Now the interesting thing is, underneath, we posted over $112 billion worth of backlog, and that backlog was actually up $5 billion quarter-to-quarter. That's one of our largest sequential 3Q to 4Q backlog increase, by the way, with and without currency that we've had in quite some time.","So, I would tell you, net answer, tough compare, large deal focus, but the health of the underlying portfolio growing substantially double digits both GTS, GBS, in less than $100 million.","Patricia Murphy","Okay, great. Thanks. Sheila, let's take one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Jeffrey Kvaal with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Kvaal","Yes, thanks very much. I would like to clarify a prior point and then throw out a broader one. And the clarification is, if you could go once again through the delta on EPS given the tax rate, it does seem as though many of us had expected 3-or-so points higher on the tax and that works out to be $0.40. So, that's a big increase in OpEx. I just want to make sure I've tied that correctly. And then a bigger picture, to what extent do you think any of the \u2013 or how much of the changes in the macroeconomic picture affected your outlook for 2020 and that could include trade or what have you? Thank you.","Jim Kavanaugh","Thank you, Jeffrey. Appreciate the question. On the 2020 guidance, reiterate it just to make sure there is absolute clarity here for everyone. When you look at our tax rate, our tax rate in 2019, 8.5%. Our tax rate in 2020, we said 7% to 9%, pretty much right in the middle. So, tax year-to-year is not a benefit. We're growing operating EPS year-over-year. When you look at that tax rate \u2013 and I'm not going to talk to what each of you have in your own model, but underneath that we, as we said, are going to take structural actions to reposition our GTS business for the hybrid cloud world.","Those structural actions are going to flow through to profit. And when I said those structural actions upfront, I said, if you look at the last few years, we are going to be at the high-end of that range, of that total charge. There is no coverage for that charge. We are going to absorb the return in our fiscal 2020 and still grow operating earnings per share to at least $13.35 coming off of what we just finished at $12.81. So, that's the first question.","Was there a part two? Macro environment. I would tell you, Jeffrey, if you ask me from 90 days ago to today, we've obviously had some clarity around some of the uncertainty was out there with regards to at least Phase 1 on trade, around Brexit, and a few other areas. I have always said, when you have high value innovative technology that you can bring to market that creates differentiated competitive advantage for your clients, spending will occur.","If anything \u2013 and by the way, I don't think this is a change we've seen throughout 2019, CFOs that I talked to, everyone is focused on more so productivity, ROI, and predictability of spend. Everyone is trying to lock in what their spend rates are as they move forward, but when you have strong technology like the mainframe that brings differentiated value, people are buying that to actually deliver differentiation for them in the marketplace to win.","So, as always, let me make a few comments to wrap up the call. 2019 was an important year for IBM. We had a good end to the year and we're pleased with the strength and the positioning exiting the year. The acceleration in Red Hat, strong adoption of our Cloud Paks, growth in our cloud-based services, all validate the actions we've taken to position us for growth in 2020. So, I want to thank all of you for joining us today and we look forward to continuing the dialog.","Patricia Murphy","Sheila, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.","Operator","Thank you.

I'm here today with Martin Schroeter, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I want to welcome you to our Third Quarter Earnings Presentation. Prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I'll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

You'll find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Martin Schroeter.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks, Patricia. For some time, we've been talking about the tremendous changes in our industry as our clients move to new areas, get great in value from their data and IT environments and implement new business models.","So as we transform our business, we invest where we see higher value over the longer term. We drive growth in the areas where we're investing, while other areas decline as we shift the business and we expect to expand margins in our move to higher value. This is how we transform from one era to the next.","Our third quarter results reflect the progress we're making in that transformation. We continued strong growth in our strategic imperatives. We expanded gross and net margins. We generated substantial free cash flow and we continue to high level of investment while returning value to shareholders.","We always said this would play out over time, though this quarter we fell a little short of the revenue expectations we set for ourselves. The GBS transformation is taking longer as the market shifts away from some of the more traditional application areas and our storage disc business was weaker as more of the demand moves to our flash.","And while our software performance for the quarter was consistent with what we seen all year we did have some weakness in transactions at the end of the quarter. In addition, our revenue trajectory continues to reflect significant impacts from currency movements in our divested businesses, in fact over 12 points of growth in total.","Put it altogether and the progress we're making demonstrates that we're on the right strategy as we help our clients move their businesses to the future. We see a lot of opportunity and with this momentum and strategic imperatives; we're going to continue to invest at a very high level to accelerate the shift in our business.","At the same time, we considered the pace of the GBS progress and applied the trajectory and transactions we saw at the end of the quarter to the larger fourth quarter transaction base which reduces our view of the year.","Taking all of this into consideration, we believe it is prudent to update our expectations for full year operating earnings per share to $14.75 to $15.75 while our view of free cash flow remains relatively flat year-to-year. I'll come back to this after going through the results of the quarter.","Let me start by providing a little more color on the strategic imperatives performance. Our revenue and cloud, analytics, social, mobile and security was up 27% in the third quarter which puts us up over 30% year-to-date. This is without the impact of currency and divestitures and throughout this presentation I'll focus on that view.","Our cloud revenue was up over 65% through three quarters with strong year-to-year performance across both our private foundations revenue and our as a service offerings. Over the last 12 months, our cloud revenue was $9.4 billion and we exited the third quarter with an annualize of service run rate of $4.5 billion.","Analytics revenue is up nearly 20% year-to-date and in the area of engagement, the revenue from these businesses nearly doubled over last year. Our security business was up 12%, social up about 40%, and our mobile business quadrupled.","Looking at the transformation or shift to strategic imperatives from a segment perspective, in Global Technology Services, we're bringing in more cloud, mobility and security to infrastructure services both to new clients and to help existing clients move to the future.","Our GTS results reflect growth in revenue and in the backlog. And when you look at high end servers, we've repositioned the portfolio and delivered innovation as these systems run the most contemporary workloads.","Throughout this year, we've had strong growth in our Z Systems and continued success in POWER. These are just two examples of what that shift looks like. We're continuing to invest and add capabilities to accelerate this shift. And in the last 90 days, we've committed more capital including the acquisitions of Merge Healthcare to give Watson the ability to see millions of medical images, along with Cleversafe, Compose, Strongloop and Meteorix, each bolstering our cloud capabilities.","We also just launched the industry's first consulting practice dedicated to cognitive business. These actions all advance our transformation of the IBM Company. Our approach is to integrate acquired content with our own organic capabilities and leverage partnerships and a broader ecosystem to build new high value platforms like Watson, SoftLayer, Bluemix and OpenPOWER.","Last quarter, I talked about the creation of Watson Health which incorporated our Watson capabilities, the acquisitions of Phytel and Explorys, partnerships with leading healthcare companies and creation of a compliant cloud.","We've continued to announce new partnerships and new cloud services. The acquisition of Merge Healthcare brings together Watson's advanced analytics and cognitive capabilities with data and images from Merge's medical imaging platform to help doctors make sense of one patient's medical images in the context of the massive related images.","We're creating similar platforms for other industries and areas such as internet-of-things. For example, we're working with a major global airline on how to apply cognitive thinking to understand all of the variables impacting fuel demands of any given flight.","They're looking a structured and unstructured data, included predicted taxi time, weather conditions, air traffic control delays, and in flight mechanical issues so as to optimize fuel load and we're working with the European Hospitality Company on how to apply cognitive thinking to understand how to maximize revenue from new high-end kiosk-based coffee shops.","They are looking at structured data such as frequency and timing of credit card purchases, combined with unstructured data including social chatter on Twitter and real-time weather.","They use Watson cognitive APIs to make sense of the data. This requires a platform approach that integrates industry expertise, analytic software, cognitive APIs, cloud, Bluemix, and multiple data streams, very powerful.","As I said earlier this is a longer term play. We're creating new platforms and building ecosystems and much of this is an as a service model. We're continuing to invest at a high level as we shift our spending to our strategic imperatives.","Let me now turn to the financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue of $19.3 billion was down 1%, reflecting transition we've been describing. We expanded gross margin, driven by our portfolio actions and the relative strength of Z Systems' revenue, in other words driven by our shift to higher value.","As we said last quarter, our PTI trajectory in the third quarter would be similar to the second, reflecting continued high level of investments across the business and currency impacts and our PTI margin was flat year-to-year.","Our ongoing effective tax rate remains at 20% while the third quarter rate reflects discrete period items. And so bottom-line, we delivered $3.34 of operating earnings per share. We generated over $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and over the last 12 months, we've generated $13.6 billion of free cash flow with a realization of GAAP net income over 90%. Over that same period, we reduced our share count by 2% and increased our dividend returning about two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders.","Now turning to the revenue by geography. Our performance varied across the major markets. Our U.S. revenue was down 4%, a decline in traditional enterprise app implementations is impacting our consulting business and in the month of September, we had a slowdown in our software transactions.","That said, we did have another quarter of strong Z Systems performance in the you U.S. By contrast, two of our other largest countries, Japan and Germany posted the strongest growth. In fact this is the 12th consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Japan and this quarter, we had growth across services, software and hardware. We also had improved performance in the U.K., France, and Canada.","The growth markets in total were down 3%, a two point sequential improvement from last quarter. From a regional perspective, growth in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa was offset by declines in Asia-Pacific.","You'll recall last quarter I talked about the weakness in the BRICs which were down 18%. This quarter the BRICs were down 7% with sequential improvement in the year-to-year performance of all four countries.","Brazil was down 4% off a strong double-digit growth last year. Russia was also down at a single-digit rate. China was down 17% with fewer large transactions in the quarter and the bright spot, again, was India which grew for the third consecutive quarter. In fact this quarter, India was up double-digits leveraging growth in the services backlog and an improvement in the hardware business.","Turning to the segment perspective, our total revenue was down 1% and gross margin improved 80 basis points. Our Global Technology Services revenue grew and is now up in six of the last seven quarters as we deliver value to new clients and help existing clients move to the future.","In Global Business Services, we've been shifting resources and investing to drive growth in the strategic imperatives, the weakness in consulting specifically around enterprise apps is impacting our overall performance.","In our Systems business, as I mentioned we had strong performance in our Z Systems and POWER once again grew as we capture both the Unix and Linux opportunity. The hardware decline was driven by storage which continues to be a tough market.","Software revenue performance was consistent with what we've seen over the past year, with growth across our solution areas of security, analytics and social, offset by a headwind from operating systems and a decline in transactional revenue.","Our total margin improvement continues to be driven by a shift to higher value, primarily through portfolio actions and the relative strength of Z Systems, mitigated by investments and contract mix in our services business.","The reported operating expense and other income is down 12%. At this level of spend, our expense to revenue ratio was up 80 basis points. The expense dynamics have been very consistent all year. We're driving significant shifts within our large operational expense base driving productivity and efficiency in some areas while increasing investment in support of our strategic imperatives.","You'll recall that at the beginning of the year, we said we would shift an incremental $4 billion of spend across cost, expense, and capital expenditures to our strategic imperatives and we're on track to do that.","The reported decline in expense this quarter is again driven by currency and the divestiture of system x. We also had a higher level of workforce rebalancing and lower amount of performance based compensation.","Nine points of the decline was driven by currency between the translation of non-dollar spending and hedging gains that are reported in other income and SG&A. Two points of the decline are due to the fact that we no longer have the expense of the system x business in our run rate.","We'll wrap on this in the fourth quarter, but recall we did have a gain associated with that transaction in the fourth quarter of last year and in the third quarter, we took a charge for workforce rebalancing with essentially no activity last year this was up nearly $100 million year-to-year contributing two points to expense growth.","Now, let's turn to the segments and we'll start with services. Global Technology Services delivered $7.9 billion of revenue which is up 1%. Our outsourcing business is based on long-term partnerships, where our clients entrust us with the most important elements of their business and look to us to deliver innovation to help them transform their enterprises.","We've been reinventing our portfolio, providing the most modern IT services that connect our clients to the cloud-based mobile world and it's showing up in the business we're signing.","For example, we recently signed a 10-year, $700 million agreement with Abu Dhabi based Etihad Airways to deliver a range of efficient technology allowing the airline and its equity partners to transition their IT infrastructure into a globally integrated hybrid cloud-based platform.","Etihad Airways will use IBM's mobile solutions developed under the Apple-IBM alliance to provide enhanced mobile capabilities to its employees and guests. The agreement also includes plans for a new cloud data center in Abu Dhabi as well as a joint technology innovation council to develop more personalized travel solutions.","And earlier this month we signed a $1 billion long-term partnership with EVRY, one of the leading IT services companies in the Nordics, using our innovative cloud technology and global scale, we'll provide a foundation for EVRY to build solutions that create business value and business outcomes for their customers.","This allows EVRY to accelerate the ongoing transformation of their infrastructure business through access to hybrid cloud solutions, based on our SoftLayer platform. These are examples of clients that chose to partner with IBM because we can move their operations into the future. We take over their IT systems and move them to cloud while insuring integration with their existing infrastructure.","We make them more efficient and ultimately drive competitive advantages. Our capabilities and industry expertise give us the ability to address changes in their industry demand and help them compete in markets where data is the new natural resource.","Looking at Integrated Technology Service, revenue was up 4% driven by our cloud solutions. SoftLayer grew strong double-digits this quarter as we continue to increase our capacity.","In September, we opened our second cloud data center in Brazil which offers a full range of SoftLayer infrastructure services including bare metal and virtual servers, storage, security services, and networking.","This past week we just opened a cloud data center in India as we continue to enable local companies to build in-country cloud solutions and we're partnering with NASSCOM to create a platform for thousands of start-ups.","Maintenance revenue grew 1% with continued strength in our third-party hardware maintenance offerings which allows clients to leverage our global reach and inventory capabilities.","Our GTS margin improved quarter-to-quarter, but is down year-to-year, largely reflecting investments we've been making. We continue to invest to bring the most contemporary offerings that are built with cloud, analytics, mobile, security and cognitive technologies enabling us to transform our clients' enterprises and we're investing to expand our global delivery and increase delivery efficiency through automation.","This also requires we continue to rebalance our workforce and we took a charge in the quarter essentially all of which is a year-to-year impact on profit. Finally, currency remains the largest year-to-year impact on profit growth given the strong dollar currency environment.","Turning to Global Business Services, revenue of $4.2 billion is down 5%. Outsourcing was up with growth in both process outsourcing and application outsourcing offset by a decline in consulting and systems integration.","As we talked about in the past, in the enterprise application space, we are seeing a shift away from traditional large ERP implementation projects to smaller initiatives that are built around cloud, mobility, security and analytics.","We're continuing to grow in these high value services, but we're still being impacted by larger contracts that are reaching their maturity. Our decline in consulting and systems integration reflects this shift in market demand.","In GBS, we had strong double-digit growth in our strategic imperatives. Cloud and analytic services were both up double-digits this quarter and our mobile practice grew nearly five times.","Earlier this month, we launched the industry's first consulting practice dedicated to helping clients realize the transformative value of cognitive business. The new practice draws on the expertise of more than 2,000 consulting professionals who will help our clients leverage cognitive computing to unlock new possibilities for their business.","Let me give you an example of where we already have work under way with one retailer. When you look back at history, they've been using data for a long time, but even the best retailers would forecast demand based on what happened in the prior year. They would look at what was sold, what season and at what price.","Over time these forecast models became more sophisticated and will include other variables such as location and climate, various market differences. Accuracy improved as more historical data was built up but insight was limited to what was able to be tracked and programmed into their IT systems.","This worked in the past, but let's fast forward to today where much of the new data is unstructured and not able to be understood by traditional systems or traditional programming approaches. Companies that can somehow gain insights from this data will have a competitive advantage.","Today, we're working with this client to build the cognitive solution that harnesses all this unstructured data. The solution will combine the client\u2019s internal data with all kinds of external real-time data sources such as current weather patterns, local events and social commentary.","We are laying the ground work for a Supply Chain that can evaluate the immediate situation, sense anomalies and learn as it goes. This is the potential we\u2019re unlocking with our cognitive capabilities integrating Watson along with the data scientists and industry experts of the GBS cognitive practice.","To further add to our GBS capabilities, at the end of September, we announced plans to acquire Meteorix, a premier Workday services partner. This will expand our reach as Meteorix is cultivated deep expertise and best practices for maximizing returns from these cloud-based HR applications.","Our profit in GBS was down and reflects the market shift that I talk about earlier. In parts of our portfolio, where the market is declining we're seeing price and profit pressure. We continue to shift away from these areas into our high value services around cloud and engagement, but we need to move faster.","Workforce rebalancing charges are up modestly year-to-year as we continue to remix our skills to these strategic imperatives. We also remain focused on our cost competitiveness through alternate labor models and enhancing our global delivery capabilities.","To wrap-up on services, we've built capabilities to deliver the most contemporary offerings to our clients that transform their operations and help them become data driven enterprises. You can see that in our consistent revenue growth in GTS and you can see that in our total services backlog which again grew this quarter.","Our software revenue of 5.1 billion was down 3% which is in line with the trajectory we've seen all year. When you look under the total, we continue to have a headwind from Operating Systems which were down 7% in the quarter and our other middleware which is also down.","Revenue in our key branded middleware which represents about two-thirds of the total was down 1%. We've said in the past that many of our large clients are utilizing the flexibility we've provided in deployment of their software as they build out their environments. This is reflected in our results with growth in our annuity revenue offset by a decline in transactional revenue.","As I just mentioned our software revenue trajectory didn't change from the second to the third quarter, but we did have a slowdown in the transactional revenue at the end of the quarter, predominantly in the U.S. This quarter we again had growth across the solution areas including security, analytics and social and within that, we saw strong growth in our software as a service offerings.","Security software grew to double digit rate. Our security solutions are built on the platform of intelligence, integration, and expertise which in the world of connected devises and an era of hybrid cloud is a key differentiation we bring to the marketplace.","Our solutions are based on platforms, leveraging hybrid environments with an industry dimension. I'll give you an update on two of our platforms, Watson and Bluemix. Last quarter, I talked about how we're building an ecosystem around Watson.","Today, I want to focus on how far along we've come on another dimension when Watson played jeopardy in 2011, Watson just did one service, question-and-answer, underpinned by five technologies like machine learning and natural language processing. Today we have more than 25 different services or APIs, underpinned by more than 50 different technologies like dialogue framing, knowledge validation, voice synthesis, language modeling and visual analysis.","As I discussed earlier, we're also bringing an industry dimension to the Watson platform starting with Watson Health. I'll comment also on progress in our Bluemix platform as a service. The addition of strong loop helps developers connect enterprise apps to mobile IOT and web applications in the Cloud and compose expands Cloud Data Service.","Our Bluemix platform now offers over 130 IBM and third-party services. Security, reliability, and scalability are important in this hybrid environment and to address this, starting this month, Bluemix is now also available on premise behind our customer's firewall.","Clients are taking advantage of our hybrid capabilities, connecting new Cloud and mobile apps to their existing IT infrastructures. This year we've added more than a thousand new customers on our systems middleware like WebSphere which is a reflection of the continued need for clients to support hybrid IT environments.","When you look at our profit performance and software it's driven by the overall revenue trajectory and higher level of investments in areas like Watson and Bluemix and an impact from currency translation.","Turning to our systems hardware segment, revenue of 1.5 billion was down 2% driven by decline in storage. This quarter, z Systems revenue was up 20% since the launch of z13 in the first quarter we've delivered growth of over 40%. Building on the success of Linux on z Systems in the third quarter we introduced the Linux 1 family of products which embraces open source based technologies that are the industry\u2019s most powerful and secure enterprise servers designed for the Hybrid Cloud environment.","These innovations continue to resonate with our customers and we continue to add new customers to the platform across several different industries and countries including Japan, Australia, Singapore, Germany and the U.S.","As we contemporize the platform many of our customers select Linux based z Systems not only to consolidate existing systems to Linux on z to drive operational efficiency, but also to leverage scalability and security that these systems offer.","Power revenue grew 2% which is the third consecutive quarter of growth for the platform. This reflects the kind of revenue performance we would expect from power in a product cycle year. We saw growth in both entry level and the high end systems including strong growth and continued customer adoption in Linux based systems. Our open power initiative continues to progress as we both integrate innovation from the broader ecosystem into our own products and license IP to support third-party power based offerings.","The announcement of our LC line of power based Linux servers and recent collaboration agreement with GENCI, the high performance computing agency in France and our third such large high performance computing national partnership are two examples of how we're bringing innovation from open power partnerships to IBM zone offerings. These power results continue to reflect the progress we're making to transform the platform to align around data and cloud while embracing an open ecosystem.","The growth in our high end servers was more than offset by a double-digit decline in storage hardware driven by weakness in the high end disc and tape. This market is shifting rapidly to flash where we again had very strong growth.","When we set out this year, we saw leverage in the business through the z Systems and power platforms. Our results confirm the progress we've made in the first three quarters and our profit is up 600 million compared to the first three quarters of last year.","Moving on to cash flow. We generated 3.5 billion of cash from operations excluding our global financing receivables. We invested another 900 million in CapEx with a good portion of our spend to build our cloud capacity. And so we generated 2.6 billion of free cash flow which is up 400 million year-to-year. Through the first three quarters of the year, our free cash flow of 7 billion is up over a billion dollars year-to-year.","The primary drivers are lower tax payments and continued improvements in our sales cycle working capital. This was mitigated by the remaining working capital impact to cash flow from our System x divestiture payments for performance based comp which were accrued last year and year-to-year profit performance.","Looking at uses of cash, we spent over 800 million on acquisitions. We've acquired seven companies this year including two in the third quarter which further extend our cloud capabilities and industry expertise. In addition, merge closed last week and we expect Cleversafe to close by the end of the year, so the spend will be included in our fourth quarter results.","In the last nine months, we've returned $7.5 billion to shareholders with dividends of 3.6 billion and 3.8 billion in gross share repurchases to buyback over 24 million shares. Our share count at the end of September was 970 million shares and we had $2.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.6 billion up over a $1 billion from December and flat year-to-year. Total debt was 39.7 billion of which 26 billion was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7 to 1.","Our non-financing debt of 13.7 billion is 3.4 billion lower than a year ago. Our non-financing debt-to-cap was 58%, a point lower than December and the 3.5 points lower than last year. At these levels, we continue to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term.","So now let me wrap up. When you look at our results through the first three quarters of this year, we've expanded margins on a fairly stable revenue base, while we're reinventing our business. We've maintained high levels of investment as we shift our spending to our strategic imperatives.","We're creating new platforms and are building ecosystems including Watson, Watson Health, SoftLayer and Bluemix. And we've been getting returns on our investments, with growth in the strategic imperatives over 30%.","At the same time, the core is declining in a declining market as we deliver productivity to our clients so they can reinvest in the new areas. We've always said this takes time. Especially because much of the new content is delivered as a service and our progression wouldn't be a straight line, but our execution over the sustained period is a proof point that we're on the right path.","So let me come back to our view of the full year. When we look at the transformation we're driving we've made a lot of progress but the GBS transformation is taking longer which is putting some pressure on revenue and profit. And we had a weaker transaction performance at the end of the quarter, which one applied to the larger transaction base in the fourth quarter as a more significant impact.","At the same time, we're going to continue to put a lot of investment into these strategic imperatives where we see tremendous opportunity to accelerate the transformation. Taking all of this into consideration, we've updated our view of the year to $14.75 to $15.75.","Let me put the low end in perspective. 14.75 not only reflect our transaction trajectory at end of the quarter, but is also in line with the typical third quarter to fourth quarter skew. So we're comfortable at that 14.75 level. The change in our view of profit has less impact on free cash flow for the year as most of the transactions would occur late in the quarter anyway and so we still expect free cash flow to be roughly flat for the year.","Let me close with what remains constant. We certainly expect to continue strong growth in our strategic imperatives. We will continue to invest at a high level to drive our transformation while returning value to shareholders and importantly we're continuing to manage the business for the long term. Now Patricia and I will take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to mention the couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from multi part question. Chris, can you please open it up for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","The first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Katy Huberty","Yes, thanks good afternoon. You mentioned that the weaker transaction trajectory going into the fourth quarter would not have a meaningful impact on free cash flow this year due to the late timing of those deals, but does that have a negative influence on 2016 and I appreciate it's too early to give guidance, but what are some of the high level gives and takes on free cash flows as you go into next year? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, thanks, Katy. A few things. As we noted, in the call because of the late nature we don't expect it to have a profound impact in 2015. Now we'll see obviously we have a range in our guidance as you know so we'll see where we finish and if we were to start at a lower point in terms of transactional content coming out of 2015 then there would be an early year impact I would call it but at this point, as you said it's a bit early to call guidance and then we've got 12 months next year to figure out what the macro environment and what the sales cycle looks like, so it is too early to decide if that has a meaningful impact on next year.","And as we go into next year, then we also have a tax impact potentially next year, we're working through cash taxes now so there may be a small cash tax impacted if not the same magnitude as it was in 2014, but there may be a small cash tax impact.","And then we have some things that are going our way. We've been quite efficient at improving our sales cycle working capital this year again and we think there's some momentum there. We also will wrap on the divestiture of our System x business in the first half of next year which was a headwind in this year\u2019s cash flow. So there are a few headwinds and tailwinds which we'll be able to better describe as we get into next year but it's too early to declare that this particular element is going to be an impact next year.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Katie. Chris, can we take the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes, thank you. It sounds like the message that you're providing to investors is the strategy of moving to higher value is correct and that it will take time going forward. That said, it feels like you have been surprised or the results would suggest that you've been surprised at the pace at which this stabilization and migration in the business is taking. You've guided down four out of the last five quarters and against an easier comp the last two quarters, your revenue has gotten fractionally weaker.","So I wanted to get your perspective on what has really been different from your forecast and as we look forward, if I just think about 2016, you have currency hedges rolling off, you have very tough mainframe and you power comps because of the product cycles this year, your backlog is down $10 billion in nominal terms which is what you have to deal with for next year. And you've stated that you're going to continue to aggressively invest and so to the timing point I guess, should we be thinking that things actually continue to get worse in the near-term before they get better and I guess the question would be why not and what if any changes are you making?","Martin Schroeter","Okay, well we've -- I think I've gotten all of the questions in so let me try to address them, Toni because there's a lot in there and let me try to address them kind of piece-by-piece. So, we put our guidance in place for 2015 back in January and we said that the trajectory -- the difference between the high and the low was primarily the software trajectory and as we talked about in our prepared remarks and we came out of third we've given the trajectory we would have said we're pointed right at that 15.75 level, but we did observe some longer sales cycle-times particularly in software which we think it's prudent to reflect that experience in our updated guidance, along with what we put in our prepared remarks around transitioning our GBS business into these new areas.","By the way, that transformation which I would characterize is well under way is going well. It's just not going at the speed we'd like it to go. So, we know we have to drive that a bit harder.","When we get to next year, a few comments I think that's important and you brought up currency and I think currency is an important discussion, so we have -- in the third quarter results, we have a pretty substantial headwind from -- in the revenue line and quite a substantial EPS impact in currency in the third quarter. And in fact, when we look at the fourth, there is still a significant impact in the fourth quarter in currency.","So, if we look at the high end and the low end of our guidance and just in the context of currency, at the low end of guidance, EPS at this level would be down 11% and at the high end it's down about 3%.","The currency impact within that in the low end is about half of the year and I'm going to put that now in context of next year because I think it's important. At the low end of guidance, we would actually be growing EPS and that is as we transform the business and we've ramped up our investment.","So, yes, currency is clearly an impact. We don't know when the currency environment will be different. But as we head into next year, what's really important from a currency impact, yes, there will at least at this point based on where the spots are today, there will be an additional impact because we will wrap on hedges, but importantly, we are not losing competitiveness in the marketplace because of currency.","We have a global delivery platform that allows us to make sure we can be competitive in our services business and we have a high margin strategy which allows us to make sure we can be competitive in local marketplaces for our hardware and software.","Now that translation impact or the effect of having that high value and being able to maintain your competitiveness is this issue around how it translates back to profit. And as I mentioned earlier, the impact this year is pretty profound and I would expect that we'll have a currency impact next year that we'll start to talk about when we see where the spots are in January when we provide guidance.","So, in the context of -- again ex-currency or ex-currency, ex-divestitures, revenues down about one for the year so far we'll see where we finish fourth quarter, margins have been expanding and again we'll see where we are for the -- in the fourth, but I would expect margins will expand for the full year and with a currency kind of defining anywhere from half to more than the year-to-year EPS decline, then I think this transformation is making very solid progress and as you said yes, the investments we're making are driving that strategic imperative growth and we're pleased with those results and it's the right thing for us to do to keep these investment levels high.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Toni. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hi, thanks. Just want to build on Toni's question within GBS and consulting and systems integration. I know that took a step back, I heard the transitioning is slower than you expected, but should we expect this to get worse before it gets better? What are you making in the fourth quarter? I know you've been doing a lot of hiring and workforce rebalancing and it's a people business, just trying to get a sense of where we are in that transition.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Tien-tsin. So, it is -- as you said, it is a labor-based business and it's important that everyone I think recognize that in the labor-based business particularly when you have the kind of deep client relationships and you're doing the important kind of work that our clients rely on us it's a business that takes time to shift.","So, when we look at that GBS business today, there is absolutely a high value strategy for this business and when we look at the strategic in imperatives and we look at the margins we're getting on that part of the business in GBS, they are actually higher than the average GBS business and as you know, we announced the creation of the first Cognitive Consulting Group for the enterprise and that's another example of us moving where we see tremendous amount of value, so we will transition this business.","I don't know that I'd characterize where in the process we are. I can say that within our guidance, at the low end, we've not assumed a dramatic improvement and at the high end, we would assume that we make a bit more progress, but we aren't counting or relying on dramatic improvement in the GBS business at this level of guidance.","But again, it is a business that where we get to the other side and we do see high value. It is has a lot of appeal and quite frankly it's what part of what differentiates us in the marketplace. We bring a lot of industry skill into our clients' environments and that's done through GBS, so we're going to keep driving that transformation, we're going to keep remixing those skills, we\u2019re going to keep that team focused on moving where the high value is and again, Cognitive like I said is a good example of that.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Tien-tsin. Can we take the next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Brian White with Drexel. You may ask your question.","Brian White","Yeah, Martin, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing with your top 250 clients in this software business and where that's headed? And also I'm just curious the week is in the transactional business at the end of September; do you think that's more macro or that the industry will see or more IBM-specific? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Brian. Thanks, so a couple things and we've talked for the last year or so about the large client impact if you will within our transactional software business and remember the transactional part of our software business is only about 30% of the total, but it does have a profound impact on the trajectory of that business. And in the third quarter as you saw, we printed down three for the segment, we were down three in the second, so no real change to the trajectory and that's the way I'd characterize also that large client activity. No dramatic change in trajectory between second and third quarter and the phenomenon continues.","We continue to provide our clients with flexibility for them to deploy the broadest possible part of the IBM portfolio and I think that's the right thing to do. We think that's the right thing to do and we think it's a way to keep our clients moving toward the future of hybrid.","Within the month if you will, I think we'll have to see how the quarter plays out, but there are I think two important elements to keep in mind. One, enterprise technology as you know is a very complex area, so our clients are dealing in very complex environments and they're asking us to help them get to hybrid which means we have to embed our as a service content into the structures they already have and that includes not only the technical aspects of that, but there are business aspects to doing that as well and how they can align their consumption patterns to the way we are able to contract with them. So, there's complexity in the environment, that's a technology statement as well as a business statement and unfortunately, I guess the reality is that not every one of those discussions aligns really, really well with a 90-day reporting period.","And at the same time, the other thing to keep in mind is that every CIO, every enterprise is dealing with its own environment and it would be too soon to tell how that plays out for the quarter, but I do think there is always a reality that our CIOs and others are dealing with around how they navigate their own circumstances. So, we'll see how the quarter plays out.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Brian. Chris, can we take the next question, please?","Operator","Next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you. Martin could you break down the 9 billion of cloud revenue a more granular way, how much comes from maybe hardware, software of services what the growth rates of those pieces might be?","Martin Schroeter","Steve, sure. A couple things. So we had very good cloud performance again in our business and now this is up 50% in the third quarter on trajectory to be up more than 60 on a year-to-date basis and when we look at the content that we're signing in the new deals for instance we just announced Etihad Airways, we just -- we saw that the elements of those, the things that Etihad is looking for us to do is to bring them into the cloud, so a big component of that is that services element moving into the cloud.","They are also asking, by the way, to help us build a mobile platform that will scale with them and have the global presence they need and that's not dissimilar to what we're seeing in the Lufthansa contracts and the EVRY contract that we just signed.","So, within services we're seeing very good performance, but as you know, not only do we have an as a service business that performed pretty well. We also do a lot of on-prem work where our clients want the agility if you will of the cloud, but their economics suggest that they are better off if they build it themselves.","And so we have a pretty big private cloud business and they build those on our hardware and software content. So, clearly there's some element of the premier Z-platform and the power platform that's sitting within that cloud business. But the hardware performance within the overall trajectory is not having a profound impact on the growth rates. It really is the software business and the services business that's driving the bulk of that growth.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Steve. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.","Keith Bachman","Hi. I also wanted to drill down on the software business. It seems like mix is going against you in two ways. First, you have about 34% of your revenue wrapped up in operating systems and other which is in sector of the client and also key brand in middlewear which you said is a little over two-thirds decline this quarter, 1% in constant currency, so I was hoping you could answer two questions.","First is as investors think about a decline of 3% in constant currency, is that the right frame of reference that investors should be thinking about as they look at calendar year 2016?","And as part of that, the second question would be could you give us an update on where you are in terms of business model? In other words IBM has traditionally been license and maintenance and you talk about moving more to consumption or subscription-based model but I would imagine it's a very small part of your business and probably a headwind as we look out at future revenue growth and a source of deceleration. Could you give us any percentages on where you are in terms of that business mix as it relates to your customers? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, so Keith a few things. So, first, we will I think address -- we should address operating systems. Operating systems are about a point headwind to us now and quite frankly, I don't think that point headwind is going to go away in the near-term. In fact we have some of our models suggest it's sort of ever present if you will, so on a segment basis, I think we'll be dealing with a one point headwind from our operating system business.","Now, it will round up to a point. Right now it rounds down to a point, so it's a bigger impact now than it will be, but I think that it's safe to model that business as sort of an ongoing headwind. That's a pretty small part of the business by the way.","So, if we take that part of the system, of the software out and we just talk about the recurring nature of the software business and as I mentioned earlier on a question about 70%, now that includes the operating system, but 70% of our software business is that annuity kind of structure, so think of it as our SAS portfolio which is showing terrific growth rates, but we've got to drive more content into that SAS platform.","Now, that's also by the way newer kind of content for us and so it's a new space and so even though the GP in that area is a little bit lower than what we see in our on-prem business because it's net new content, it's accretive to our margins overall at the IBM level.","So we've got a SAS business that sits within that 70%. We have our monthly license charge business which is the bulk of both our mainframe software as well as our distributed platform software.","Remember our software runs across all platforms and so we've got a pretty powerful monthly license charge business across our hardware platforms and others hardware platforms that's really driving the bulk of the software revenue.","There is a subscription support part of this in the software business as well but you put those all those together again ex Operating Systems because it is a long term headwind we see the rest of those are all growing. That part of the business grows and then in the transactional side as we talked about with Brian a few moments ago, the large client transactional business is being impacted by the consumption if you will and the flexibility we're providing our clients.","Outside the large clients on a year-to-date basis the transactional business is also growing. It's just that it's kind of overshadowed at this point by the larger transactional business, so as we move into 16\u2019, similar to the prior discussions on 16\u2019, we're a bit early to talk about where we are going to be here but our software business I guess what we do know about the software business is one, small headwind from the Operating Systems.","We know that our SAS portfolio will both continue to grow and continue to expand so that will be a positive and we know that we've got some momentum in other parts of the business across our MLC space and across on a year-to-date base -- again getting our software into smaller clients. Clients who haven't absorbed it all I should say, and so I think again we'll see where we go into 2016 but this is not a business that has the characteristics of some long secular decline in it. It is actually made up of a few piece only one of which I think has a long term secular decline and that's a small part it's that Operating System piece. ","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Keith. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. You may ask your question.","David Grossman","Excuse me. Thank you. I'm just wondering, Martin, I haven't gone through this technology transition and the corresponding impact on your growth rate. Are you or is the Company thinking any differently about the scale of the overall business and the need to have as far reaching of a business as you historically have?","Martin Schroeter","You know, it's a good question, David, and it is one that we think about not from the perspective of size or scale because as you know, we're not trying to be the largest of something. What we are though is trying to be the highest value, so as we move to value, that has, that plays a large influence in how we think about deploying capital and where we think about putting our dollars to work and so at this point, when we look at our businesses and the way they work together and I would argue that the world is moving more toward bringing solutions together in front of a client.","The world is working moving more toward having industry expertise that can apply across a pretty broad platform. We see each of the elements that we have today bringing or adding to that context and so even in businesses where we know we're in transition like our storage business, you know, we said as we said in the prepared remarks our demand is moving to our flash products which is terrific, the right thing to do for our clients and our business is moving to the software side of storage. That's high value and at the same time, while our acquisition of Cleversafe is really about the cloud, it will also help dramatically our storage business as we put objects storage technologies into our storage business, so that makes that part of the business relevant to the way the world's going in cloud.","The future in storage is flash. It's software and it's cloud capable if you will which means object store so what I didn't say in there was we want to be the biggest in storage for instance because we're again on a high value model and you can look across our business and across our segments and we do have that perspective of where we do we think the value is going to be, not is so much of what's going to be the biggest element of that. ","Patricia Murphy","Thanks David. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","James Schneider","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Martin I was wondering if you could address the trends within the consulting and systems integration part of GBS this quarter down 7% versus prior quarter down four. How much of that worsening in the rate of growth is down for pricing versus just macro weakness and what are the prospects of that improving at any point in the future, can you see a point at which that could possibly get out of this negative mid-single digits rate that we're at now and what will be the factors that would drive that or is it simply just a function of the secular decline of that ERP slice of business?","Martin Schroeter","So sure, James and welcome to the call. I think you just picked up coverage on us so welcome to the call. On our GBS business as I noted earlier, we do see where we're making the shift to the most contemporary areas, and digitizing for instance our client\u2019s front offices. We're seeing terrific results. Now they are overshadowed at this point by some of the price pressure we're seeing in other areas of the market but it really is on us here to shift those resources as we can free them up from doing the work they are doing for our clients.","This is not a business that is in long term secular decline. This is a business that relies on us to drive the shift as quickly as possible and I think when you have a business that is so powerful in our clients with such industry expertise that it gives you two things it gives you the visibility to how powerful that model can be but it also says that it's going to take a little while, so some of this is clearly the pricing environment we're in.","I don't think that no there is any reason we shouldn't be able to shift this business and again, the results we see when we do shift are better margins and we see a real ability to influence and to lead our clients into new areas so those are pretty powerful part of our overall model and it is really up to us to keep driving that transformation but it's a big labor based business so it's going to take some time. ","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Jim. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Maynard Um","Hi, thank you. Can you just talk a little bit about the pressures driving the declines in the storage? You talked about that little bit but maybe be a little bit more specific in terms of what you're seeing in terms of the competitive landscape and what I guess if you can sort of clearly layout your strategy to stabilize or turn that around? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure thanks, Maynard. So on storage I think this is the most we've talked about storage by the way on this call in over a year but I'm glad because this is an important part of the business and we see a lot of opportunity in storage. The storage environment and the pricing environment that we were noting in terms of pressure is really in that high end spinning disc environment, so I don't see that changing dramatically given the industry landscape.","In fact our view has been continues to be that the faster we can move to flash and the faster we can continue to build out our high value software defined storage platforms, and we've had some pretty exciting announcements this year as you know, the sooner we'll see a return to growth in storage.","Now as I noted the storage market is being, is part of the cloud and part of the future of cloud but it\u2019s got to be around objects store because that plays such a critical role in the kinds of use cases that clouds are using, so we'll take as I mentioned the Cleversafe technologies and embed it within our storage, so when we look at the future of the storage business we see terrific growth in flash up again more than 50% in each of the last three quarters, so all this year.","We introduced as I mentioned spectrum software which is around our software storage product and we\u2019ve also announced intentions to continue to invest and to drive our investment where we're seeing those returns and those look quite positive and then as I mentioned the other part of our strategy here is to be I have a more cloud-based offering and that means hybrid and that for us means Cleversafe and embedding our objects store so a lot of price pressure and the spinning disc business but there is a future in storage and it's all about flash. It's all about software defined and it's all about object store.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Maynard. Chris, why don't we take one last question?","Operator","The last question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks, for squeezing me in guys: Martin, I just want to understand are you talking about a weaker transactional business especially at the September quarter and as you go into the next few quarters your mainframe cycle starts to get fairly difficult, I mean do you envision a scenario where assuming FX and macro static you could see some of the revenue stability it of growth in the next quarter?","Martin Schroeter","Well I think I heard the question. You cut out at the end but I'll answer what I think you asked so first of all, boy, I'd love to assume a static currency environment. I'd be thrilled and we know that's not true so we'll be facing a currency headwind over at least the next nine or 10 months but that wasn't your question.","Your question was around how do we wrap and what do we look like, how do we wrap on the mainframe and what do we look like when we come out of the next few quarters and I think a few things we'll have to see how the year plays out in terms of what eventuates from this weaker transactional performance we saw right at the end of the quarter. It's too soon at this point to determine if this is something that's going to persist all the way through the fourth or it's going to persist into the first we don't know.","That's why we gave a range by the way because as we head into the fourth quarter which is as you know our largest transactional quarter, that phenomenon against the much larger transactional quarter says that it's prudent to guide the way we did. Now we will wrap on a mainframe cycle at some point, but the mainframe cycle is not going to have a profound impact on the overall IBM.","It does have obviously it does provide a good bit of revenue tailwind when we're in that cycle but remember that the margins start to expand in the mainframe business as we get toward the later parts of the cycle, so we'll see how we put together 2016 based on how we come out of this year but our guidance right now reflects at the low end a slowdown if you will in the revenue trajectory on a year-to-year basis and the high end reflects a slight improvement so in the trajectory so again, too soon to tell how this plays out for next year.","Martin Schroeter","Let me make a few final comments to wrap up the call. So as we've been talking about on these calls frequently, we are going through a significant transformation and where we've been investing we've been driving tremendous growth and that obviously gives us tremendous confidence that the strategy is right.","The offerings we're delivering into that marketplace are right on and resonating with customers and we're seeing returns. Now as everyone knows, some of the investments we're making have much longer tails, so we're investing heavily in Watson. We're investing heavily in Watson Health. Those returns aren't even in our revenue streams yet but they are the right things to do because those have tremendous futures to them.","Within the current transformation though we're also improving margins as we continue to manage the portfolio and we're expanding margins on what year-to-date has been a fairly stable revenue base and that also includes some pretty aggressive investments that we think is important to drive and as I mentioned we're seeing results so we want to keep driving those investments but we also did say from the beginning of this that it would take time and we also said that we're going to manage for the long term and we're confident in our strategy and confident we're on track to get to the long term trajectory. So thanks again for joining us today. ","Patricia Murphy","Okay, Chris I'll turn it back to you to close out the call.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

I'm here today with Martin Schroeter, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I want to welcome you to our Fourth Quarter Earnings Presentation. Prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I'll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Today I will start with a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year performance, review the details of the quarter and wrap up with a discussion of 2014 and expectations for 2015.","Our strategy is focused on leading in the areas where we see the most value in enterprise IT and in 2014 we made tremendous progress in repositioning the portfolio and making investment to shift into these areas. Our results reflect all of that.","In the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $24.1 billion, net income of $5.8 billion, free cash flow of $6.6 billion and operating earnings per share of $5.81. Our total revenue performance reflects the divestitures of System x and Customer Care, which together had $1.6 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013 and we had about a $1.2 billion impact from currency movements. So combined, this represents about $2.8 billion of revenue or a 10 point impact to the reported revenue growth rate.","That currency impact was even greater than spot rates suggested 90 days ago, excluding the impact of currency and divestitures, our total revenue was in line with our expectations.","We once again had strong performance in our strategic imperatives that address the market shifts in data, cloud and engagement. Together, they posted double-digit growth as they did in every quarter of 2014.","We had solid improvement in gross and pretax margin as we drive our overall business to higher value. That will certainly continue into this year as we benefit from the recent portfolio actions and we are continuing to shift our investments and resources to our strategic imperatives and solutions that address our clients most critical issues.","Looking at the full year from a financial perspective, we delivered $21 billion of pretax income and operating earnings per share of $16.53. We generated about $12.5 billion of free cash flow, paid out over $4 billion in dividends and reduced our average share count by over 8%, while reducing our core debt by $0.5 billion.","Our strategic imperatives continue to drive strong growth, up 16% in 2014 and that includes an impact from currency. Together, cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security generated $25 billion in revenue, which is 27% of IBM.","Analytics was up 7% on a large base and with 60% revenue growth, our cloud business is substantial. It's now $7 billion in revenue and we exited the year with an annual as a service run rate of $3.5 billion. That's up from $2.2 billion a year ago.","During the year, we once again spent 6% of our revenue in research and development, and invested about $4 billion on capital, supporting actions in a number of areas that will yield financial benefits in future years. Let me mention a few.","We introduced our cloud platform-as-a-service Bluemix and are shifting capital to globally expand our SoftLayer Cloud Data Centers. We're bringing Watson\u2019s capabilities to the enterprise and building a partner ecosystem, effectively creating a market for cognitive computing.","We introduced cloud application innovations around Watson Analytics and Verse. We launched POWER8 and are building the OpenPOWER consortium. We formed a partnership with Apple for enterprise mobility with twitter for big data and with SAP and Tencent for cloud. Clearly, we are the go-to platform for the enterprise.","In 2014, we divested large businesses that no longer fit our strategic profile, System x and customer care BPO and announced the divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing business. These three businesses drove $7 billion of revenue in 2013 but lost about $0.5 billion of pretax profit.","While we certainly have a smaller business in terms of revenue and of course, the divestitures reduced the number of employees, it is a higher value, higher margin business.","Within that, we are continuing to remix our skills and as an example, we had over 45,000 hires in 2014 adding to our capabilities in our strategic areas. So we got a lot done in 2014 that positions us for the longer term, I will talk more about the full year and what it means for 2015 after going through the details of the quarter.","But now let me get into the fourth quarter results. These are all operating results, which are based on continuing operations. We delivered $5.8 billion of operating net income on revenue of $24.1 billion.","Revenue was down 12%, but as I just said, that includes about 10 points of impact from currency and divestitures. So we were down 2% at constant currency excluding the divested businesses. On net basis, services revenue was flat, our software segment declined 3% and systems and technology revenue was down 12%.","We have seen significant strengthening of the dollars since September. Currency impacted our revenue performance by about 4.5 points or $1.2 billion. This is a 1.5 of growth or $400 million more than anticipated based on spot rates 90 days ago.","Our gross margin was up 60 basis points driven by improvements in GBS and a mix away from the low-margin System x business. Pretax margin was up 3 points this quarter. PTI includes the gain from the sale of System x, which net of related transaction and performance-based costs was $1.1 billion, as well as nearly $600 million of workforce rebalancing charges.","We had a substantial tax headwind in the fourth quarter. Last year, our rate included the benefit associated with the settlement of the U.S. tax audit and as a result, our tax rate is up nearly 10 points over last year.","On the bottomline, we reported operating EPS of $5.81. Looking at our free cash flow, we generated $6.6 billion in the quarter, which is more than half of the full year. We ended the year with $8.5 billion of cash on hand.","Now turning to the revenue by geography because of the geography mix of the System x business, the divestiture impacted major markets growth by 4 points and growth markets by 9 points. So I\u2019ll focus on year-to-year performance at constant currency and adjusting for the divested businesses in all periods. On this basis, both major markets and growth markets were down 2%.","Within major markets, we had growth in Japan while North America and Europe declined. Europe\u2019s performance improved from last quarter with improvements in the U.K. and Italy and continued growth in Spain. Our North America revenue was down driven by declines in global business services, the signings grew for the second consecutive quarter.","Our growth markets year-to-year performance improved nearly 2 points from last quarter. This was driven by China which was down 1% this quarter. The improvement in the year-to-year trajectory was driven by strong software performance and several large mainframe transactions. In fact, four of our five largest banking clients in China added substantial new mainframe capacity. Overall BRIC performance was consistent with last quarter with the improvement in China offset by weaker performance in Brazil.","Turning to the segment perspective, our total services revenue was flat at constant currency, adjusting for the divested businesses. On that base, GTS was up 2% and we had growth across all business lines, outsourcing, integrated technology services and maintenance.","Global Business Services revenue was down with significant growth in the strategic imperatives offset by weakness in some of the more traditional application areas. In software, we had good growth in key areas like security, cloud and mobile but our software customers continue to utilize the flexibility we\u2019ve provided impacting transaction revenue growth and weakness in operating systems. System\u2019s performance reflects the end-of-the-product cycle in our System z mainframe, and declines in power and storage though both had modest sequential improvement in year-to-year performance.","Our gross profit margin was nearly 54%, that\u2019s up 60 basis points from last year. We had solid improvement in GBS as we mixed toward the higher-margin strategic imperatives. The GTS margin is relatively flat even with an impact from the divestiture of System x maintenance.","Software continued to have a very strong margin at 90%. And we had significant margin improvement in systems, driven by the divestiture of the lower margin System x business so our focus on moving to higher value spaces is showing up in our gross margin.","The reported total operating expense and other income reflects not only the ongoing run rate of the business but also the impact of the System x divestiture and the charge for workforce rebalancing. In total, the reported level of expense is down 20% though the entire decline is driven by the combination of the System x gain and the fact that we no longer have the expense for the System x business in our run rate.","Normalizing for the System x divestiture, our expense and other income would have been up about 2% or about 6% adjusted for currency and acquisitions. You'll recall last October I told you that we expected to take a charge for workforce rebalancing in the fourth quarter. SG&A includes the workforce rebalancing charge of about $580 million, nearly all of which is a year-to-year increase. Within our base expense, we\u2019re continuing to shift resources in spending to areas where we see the most opportunity, including Watson, SoftLayer, BlueMix and in support of our Apple partnership.","Finally, I want to spend a minute on the impact of currency. The dramatic dollar strengthening started in September and has continued at a rapid pace. In addition, the currencies have nearly all moved in an unfavorable direction for our business profile. The result is an impact to our revenue and our earnings.","We hedge a portion of our cross border cash flows, which defers the impact of the currency movement but it doesn't eliminate it. Our hedges are designed to provide the stability around the receipt of cash. But there is no year-to-year benefit in the income statement when a currency's direction is sustained over a longer period and that\u2019s what we've been dealing with.","Looking at the fourth quarter, we estimate the impact to our profit growth was nearly $300 million. At current spot rates, we would expect a significant impact to revenue and profit in 2015. The chart at the back of our presentation sizes the revenue impact at current spot rates.","Now let\u2019s turn to the segments and we'll start with services. Our total services backlog was $128 billion when adjusted for currency and the customer care and System x divestitures, it was flat year-to-year. This is an improvement from the 2% decline we reported in the third quarter on that same basis.","The sequential backlog improvement was driven by several significant new outsourcing contracts closed in the period. As a result, outsourcing backlog returned to growth and was up 1% at constant currency, adjusted for the customer care divestiture.","The combined services revenue was $13.5 billion dollars, which is flat year-to-year at constant currency adjusting for the divestitures. Revenue for Global Technology Services was $9.2 billion, up 2% at constant currency adjusted for the divestitures. GTS outsourcing was up 1% at constant currency for the quarter and for the year adjusted for the customer care divestiture.","Clients are continuing to sign large outsourcing engagements that leverage our cloud, business analytics and mobile solutions. Clients are using these outsourcing engagements as ways to optimize their IT infrastructure while at the same time, enabling new services to their customers. Lufthansa and ABN AMRO, both of which were over a $1 billion in contract value are great recent examples of this.","ITS revenue was up 4% at constant currency, driven largely by our high-value security, mobility and resiliency offerings. SoftLayer continues to attract new workloads to the platform. And in October, we announced IBM was selected by SAP to be their global cloud provider for their enterprise cloud solution.","IBM's ability to integrate public and private workloads within our hybrid cloud was a critical differentiator for SAP. We continue to expand our data center footprint. And in the fourth quarter, we opened cloud centers in Melbourne, Paris, Mexico City, Tokyo and Frankfurt.","Maintenance was up 1% when adjusted for currency and the impact from the System x divestiture. GTS pretax profit was down significantly in the quarter. Year-to-year performance was driven by several key factors.","First, we have the loss of year-to-year profit resulting from the customer care and System x divestitures. Second, we took a workforce rebalancing charge in the quarter, which impacts profit. Finally we\u2019re continuing to invest in both offerings and operational capabilities that includes targeted investments in mobility, security and cloud which complement our client systems of record as well as operational improvements such as the savings yield from the rebalancing action we took earlier this year and more broadly deployed automation in the delivery centers.","Overall the profit performance in GTS reflects the actions we've taken to transform the business this year. We've invested in our strategic imperatives to accelerate growth. We\u2019ve continued to optimize our delivery platform through the workforce rebalancing and broader use of automation and we\u2019ve divested businesses, impacting our year-to-year results.","While those actions all have near-term impacts to profit, they better position us going forward and enable us to deliver more value to clients. Global Business Services revenue was $4.3 billion, down 3% at constant currency. Consulting and Systems Integration declined 3% at constant currency.","Revenue was down in our traditional back-office implementations, particularly in North America. We again had strong double-digit growth in our practices that address cloud, analytics, mobile and social.","Through our Apple partnership, we released the first 10 MobileFirst for iOS solutions in the fourth quarter, with more to come by the end of this quarter focused in Healthcare, Energy and Utilities. We\u2019ve seen strong customer interest and this partnership is another example of how we're helping enterprise clients to transform their business models and sources of value.","Application outsourcing was down 2% at constant currency, reflecting sequential year-to-year improvement but we still see a challenging pricing environment.","GBS gross margin expanded roughly 1.5 year-to-year which is a good indicator of the value our offerings deliver. Pretax profit declined, including a 15-point impact from the workforce rebalancing charge which will pay back in 2015.","We continue to see a slowdown in back-office implementations in the traditional parts of the portfolio. We are investing in strategic partnerships and those will pay off in 2015 as well.","To wrap up GBS, we've integrated Global Process Services, our BPO business, with GBS to create a seamless end-to-end business transformation capability for our clients. Starting in the first quarter, our reporting will reflect this shift of GPS from our Global Technology Services segment to GBS.","Software revenue of $7.6 billion was down 3% at constant currency. After the third quarter, we said we didn't expect a change in trajectory in the fourth and our fourth quarter performance was fairly similar to the third. Total software growth reflects a headwind from operating systems, driven by the divestiture of System x and our Power results.","It also reflects business model changes, which impacted our transaction revenue growth as our customers continue to use the flexibility we have provided in the deployment of software purchased through enterprise licensing agreements. The flexibility enables clients to optimize their capacity on our platform for the long-term.","We had solid growth in many of our solution areas, including security, mobile and cloud. Our security software once again grew at a double-digit rate. In fact, this was the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Cybersecurity threats are one of the key issues that all our customers are facing. We have brought our analytics, big data, research IP, mobile and cloud capabilities to create security offerings to address this market opportunity.","Our software mobile offerings more than doubled in the quarter, as we leveraged our integrated MobileFirst portfolio, and our Software-As-A-Service offerings are up nearly 50%. Across software, we continue to drive innovation and capture growth areas. We are integrating analytics and security capabilities that are needed to operate seamlessly in a hybrid environment.","For example, we are introducing several new offerings that further enable our analytics portfolio in a cloud environment. And we recently announced IBM Verse, a cloud-based email and collaboration offering that integrates Watson capabilities. This type of continued innovation in our offerings, together with expanding services on our Bluemix platform-as-a-service, will allow our customers to move to a hybrid environment.","Systems and Technology revenue of $2.4 billion was down 12% at constant currency, adjusting for the divestiture of our System x business. Last January, our Systems and Technology business had just reported a $1.7 billion year-to-year profit decline for 2013 and we said we\u2019d stabilize the profit on a go-forward basis. I'm pleased to say that after a lot of work to reposition the business, we have stabilized the profit.","Looking at our fourth quarter results, Systems z revenue was down 23% at constant currency, reflecting the fact that we are in the tenth and final quarter of this product cycle. Our last 10-quarter cycle was z10. Comparing the current cycle to that of z10, program-to-date System z revenue and gross profit is right on top of that cycle.","We continue to innovate on the platform and last week, we announced z13, the new generation of the IBM Mainframe. The z13 system culminates a billion dollar investment, five years of development, exploits the innovation of more than 500 new patents and represents a collaboration with more than 60 clients. The result of this innovation is a Mainframe that has the world's fastest processor that can execute two and a half billion transactions a day.","With this generation of Mainframe, we've dramatically enhanced the capabilities around analytics, mobile, security and cloud to address the needs our clients see in their businesses. These capabilities span from real-time insights to real-time fraud detection in a system that can consistently run at 100% utilization with 100% uptime. IBM continues to innovate on the platform to address client needs and extend its leadership in high-end systems, a core franchise that has nearly doubled in installed capacity over the last five years.","Power revenue declined 11% at constant currency, which is a modest sequential improvement in year-to-year performance. We have repositioned Power, which is now a systems business, as well as an open chip processor and an IP opportunity through the OpenPOWER foundation.","We saw double-digit growth in the low-end, driven by entry-level POWER8-based system. And in the fourth quarter, we introduced our high-end Power 8 enterprise systems. OpenPOWER foundation membership continues to expand, which started in 2014 with five members and now stands at over 80, 14 of which are in Greater China.","Since the establishment of the consortium a year ago, several products have been introduced. For example, on the scale out systems, Tyan launched the first OpenPOWER customer references and on the high-end, the U.S. Department of Energy recently awarded IBM a $350 million contract to create future super-computers based on OpenPOWER technology.","In addition, we've initiated a strategic partnership with Suzhou PowerCore, which intends to use POWER architecture to develop and market processors for servers in China. Our Storage hardware revenue was down 5% at constant currency, a modest sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter. We again saw strong growth in our FlashSystems and Storwize portfolio.","This growth was offset by the wind down of our legacy OEM business and continued weakness in high-end disk. Recently IDC reported that IBM was the leader in all-flash systems shipped capacity during the first half of 2014, outpacing the number two and number three competitors combined.","Over the course of the year, we took significant actions to reposition our Systems and Technology business for higher value and reinforced our commitment to driving innovation in our high-end systems and storage. We repositioned Power through creation of our Power 8 systems which are built for cloud and big data and made available the POWER8 architecture through the OpenPOWER consortium to build an open ecosystem and an IP play.","We are divesting our microelectronics manufacturing, with future chip supply coming from an at-scale provider. And we committed $3 billion of investment in the next era of chip technology, as we strengthen our semiconductor R&D and systems innovation. We also divested System x, our low-end server business.","And as I mentioned, just last week we announced z13, the new generation of the mainframe. Our Systems and Technology segment grew profit in the fourth quarter and was profitable for the year. With our portfolio repositioned and introduction of the new mainframe, we should now see profit leverage.","Moving on to cash flow in the quarter, we generated $7.6 billion of cash from operations, excluding our Global Financing receivables. We invested a billion dollars in capital expenditures and we generated $6.6 billion in free cash flow, which was up $4.4 billion quarter-to quarter but down $1.8 billion year-to-year.","As I said earlier, we generated more than half of our annual cash flow in the fourth quarter, in line with our average over the last five years. For the full year, our cash from operations excluding GF receivables was $16.2 billion. We invested almost $4 billion in capital expenditures, with consistent spend throughout the year. And within that we shifted significant spend to strategic areas such as SoftLayer and Watson.","So, our free cash flow was $12.4 billion, down $2.6 billion year-to-year. The bulk of that was driven by an increase in cash tax payments and working capital impacts associated with the System x divestiture. While not in free cash flow, we received proceeds of $2.4 billion from divestitures, including the System x and Customer Care business.","As for the uses of free cash flow for the year, we acquired six companies. We paid $4.3 billion in dividends and bought back almost 72 million shares, reducing our average share count by 8%.","Let me comment on our share repurchase activity over time. Since the beginning of our share repurchase program in 1995, we've taken or share count from roughly 2.35 billion shares to fewer than 1 billion shares, that\u2019s reduction of 58% program to date at an average purchase price of less than $100 per share. At the end of the year, we had $6.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of $8.5 billion. Our total assets reflect a year-to-year reduction associated with the semiconductor transaction, as well as a reduction in our pension assets. We had strong returns on our pension assets, above the long-term expected return assumption. The asset decline was driven by a year-end re-measurement of liability. I will address that in a minute.","Total debt was $40.8 billion, of which $29.1 billion was in support of our financing business. The global financing leverage at year end was 7.2 to 1, consistent with last December. Our total debt was down almost $5 billion since September and up $1.1 billion in the last year. Our non-financing debt drove the quarter-to-quarter decline. At $11.7 billion, it was down $5.4 billion since September and down $0.5 billion year to year.","Let me put our current non-financing, or our core debt level in perspective. In May of 2007, we re-introduced debt to our core capital structure and in June of that year, we had $11.8 billion of core debt. So while our debt level has varied over time, it's at the same level as when we introduced debt to our structure.","Looking at debt-to-cap, we improved our ratio since September, though not as much as expected. We reduced debt levels and profit performance increased equity, both as we expected. However, our debt-to-cap ratio was impacted by a $7 billion reduction in equity since September due to currency and pension.","A $1 billion of the equity hit was due to currency translation, and over $6 billion for pension re-measurement driven by a reduction in the discount rates, and taking into account the recently released U.S. mortality tables. Our pension funding levels remain solid despite the impacts from rates and mortality. The U.S. and worldwide tax-qualified plans were 102% and 97% respectively.","Our balance sheet continues to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the longer term.","So now let me wrap up 2014, and I want to put our revenue and profit performance in the context of the framework we provided at our Investor Day back in May. The strategic imperatives are focused on the market shifts of data, cloud, and engagement. The model for these combined strategic imperatives is to deliver double-digit growth, with high contribution from Software, which obviously drives a more profitable business mix.","In 2014, revenue from our cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security solutions together, was up 16%. And that includes the impact of currency as well as the divested System x business. In total, the strategic imperatives generated $25 billion in revenue, which is about 27% of IBM's total. And our software content is well above the level for overall IBM.","Business analytics revenue for the year was $17 billion, up 7% over last year. Growth was led by our consulting business, as we help our clients extract value from their data. Our cloud revenue in 2014 was up 60% to $7 billion, as we see growing client demands for higher-value cloud solutions across public, private, and hybrid. Revenue from our as-a-Service offerings increased about 75% to $3 billion for the year, and we exited 2014 with an annual run rate for our as-a-Service business of $3.5 billion. The $7 billion also includes revenue from our foundational offerings, where we provide software, hardware and services to clients to build private clouds.","Turning to engagement, our mobile business more than tripled. We had strong growth in MobileFirst driven by an integrated portfolio of offerings, and a great start to our partnership with Apple. Social was up 3% and Security was up 19%. So very good growth in these businesses in line with the double-digit objective. These are also the areas where we are launching initiatives and targeting investment. Earlier I mentioned investments to build out Bluemix, SoftLayer, Watson and the partnerships with Apple, Twitter, SAP and Tencent. These investments and actions support growth into the future.","Now, our Recurring Core Franchises includes our annuity businesses and highly recurring portions of our transactions business, such as mainframe revenue from our largest clients. Most have annuity characteristics, and in many cases, these support mission critical processes for our clients. The model, or signpost, is for these combined businesses to have stable revenue, with improving margin. This year, revenue was down about 3%, with a modest decline in margin. The decline was driven by mainframe cycle and by currency.","We also have high value transactional businesses, which include project-based work in services, transactional software, and Power and Storage, in areas other than our strategic imperatives. The objective here is to optimize our business model, and maintain margins. We've been clear that some parts of our hardware business have had secular challenges. I talked earlier about all of the actions we've taken to reposition our hardware business for high value.","While revenue is down as we work through these transitions, our gross margin remains attractive at over 40%. And of course, we've divested businesses that don't fit our strategic profile, Customer Care, System x, and microelectronics manufacturing. Together these businesses were about $7 billion of revenue in 2013, but lost $500 million of profit. So the divestitures reduce our revenue, but improve our profit profile, clearly in line with our shift to higher value.","Our strategic direction is clear and compelling, and we have made a lot of progress. We have been successful in shifting to the higher value areas of enterprise IT. The strong revenue growth in our strategic imperatives confirms that, as does the overall profitability of our business. We expect the industry to continue to shift, and I want to spend a minute on what we see over the longer term, not in terms of an absolute end point or multi-year objective, but rather in terms of a long term growth trajectory.","We have $25 billion of revenue in our strategic imperatives, and we continue to expect to grow this revenue at a double-digit rate. Keep in mind these areas are as high value as other parts of our business, which continue to manage our clients' most critical business processes. As we get our cloud business to scale, and drive ongoing productivity improvements across our business, we see opportunity to continue to expand margin. And we will continue to allocate capital to investments, and to return value to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","So over the longer term, when we look at the opportunities we will continue to develop, we see the ability to generate low-single digit revenue growth, and with a higher value mix, high-single digit operating earnings per share growth, with free cash flow realization in the 90's. Of course we will spend more time on the rate and pace of achieving that trajectory at our investor meeting next month.","Now in the near term, there are a few dynamics that are inconsistent with that trajectory. For 2015 specifically, we are dealing with some transitions in our business. For example, while we are fully participating in the shift to cloud, margins are impacted by the level of investment we are making, and the fact that the business is not yet at scale. We will see some year-to-year benefit to margins in 2015 as the business ramps, but we won't yet be at scale. And I talked about the impact to our software transaction revenue growth as customers utilize the flexibility we've provided, as they commit to our platform for the longer term.","And then there are cyclical considerations. Given the geographic breadth of our business, we have seen challenges in some markets, most notably many of the growth markets. We firmly believe these are important markets over time, and we've been investing to capture the opportunity, but we're not counting on a robust demand environment in many geographies in 2015. And then of course, there is the impact from currency. The impact to our revenue growth is obvious as we translate results back to U.S. dollars. But as with all companies with a similar business profile, with the dollar strengthening, currency will have a significant translation impact on our profit growth.","Now, we do have some cyclical benefits, like a tailwind from the new mainframe cycle, and we will have a full year of Power 8. Now when you step back and look at the business, and take into account everything I have just told you about 2015, we will continue to grow in a lot of areas. We will continue to deliver strong growth in our strategic imperatives, we will continue to expand margins, and we will continue a high level of investment and hiring, shifting to areas where we see the best opportunity.","Now in this currency environment, and with the divestitures we've completed, our total revenue as reported will not grow in 2015. I expect less spending in workforce rebalancing, and while we always have gains, we won\u2019t replicate the $1.6 billion of gains we had in 2014, so that will be a net impact to our profit.","When we put it all together for 2014, we expect operating EPS in the range of $15.75 to $16.50. And at that level of profit, we expect free cash flow to be relatively flat. More importantly, we will exit 2015 with a higher value, higher margin business.","Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to mention a few items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and the year. We also have provided historical data on continuing operations. And second, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.","Operator, can you please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Katy Huberty","Yes. Thank you. As it relates to the EPS guide, how are you expecting PTI in the hardware, software and services businesses to trend relative to the fourth quarter? And then also, should we expect the tax rate to continue to climb higher?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Katy. A few things. So first, on tax, we\u2019ll address that first, because that\u2019s probably the easiest. We\u2019re assuming a tax rate at 20% in the full year, so a slight decline from where we finished 2014.","Now on the guidance in terms of what we saw coming out of the fourth, I think there are a few things that I would mention relative to the trajectories in some of our businesses. We do expect that the launch of the mainframe, along with the success in Power 8 that we\u2019re seeing, that will generate some momentum. And so we would expect to see growth in our systems in kind of the mid-single digit range of growth coming out of '14 when we didn't have the cycle.","In services, we\u2019ve not built a revenue trajectory or assumed revenue trajectory that requires a lot of growth within our EPS. And then the most important I think from a guidance perspective is software. So we have, as you know, a range in our EPS.","And I think the way to characterize the bottom of the guidance and the top of the guidance is that at the bottom of the guidance, we're not assuming that we see an improvement in the trajectory of our software business. And I would characterize the top of the guidance as sort of a stabilization of the software business relative to 2014.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Katy. Can we please go to the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes. Thank you. I\u2019m wondering if you could elaborate a little bit further on cash flow for 2015. Looks like you're guiding for it to be flat, which is under 80% of net income if I sort of work back or it\u2019s from the midpoint of your range.","Can you help us understand what the forces at work are that create the significant discrepancy between free cash flow and net income? And can you also help us understand how we should be thinking about relative free cash flow spending on acquisitions versus dividend and stock repurchases relative to history?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Toni. A couple of things. So our free cash flow guidance is essentially flat year-to-year, given the range of profit we provided and a couple of things within that. And I\u2019ll try to address this sort of in the reverse order that you asked about it.","Relative to share repurchase, we've only assumed about a 2 to 3 point impact from share repurchase, which is obviously less than what we were able to do in the last year, so a reduced level of share repurchase.","I guess, the way to think about it is we entered 2015 with a bit over 6 billion of authorization remaining and we've just assumed that we used the authorization now. There obviously, timing will impact that's impact on EPS, but think about our share repurchase in the year as consuming the bulk of that authorization.","In terms of dividends, we have assumed that we would obviously, continue to pay the dividend and we\u2019d like to and will talk about the dividend with the Board. We\u2019d like to talk about how we might grow the dividend as well. We typically do that, as you know, in April. So those discussions will start soon.","From a realization perspective, we printed a 79% realization in 2014 and we see that improving to the mid 80's. Now there are a few elements of our free cash flow relative to realization that I think are important to keep in mind. We\u2019ll start it, call it a 100% just for simplicity. We get a 5, 6 point impact just because we have a pension in terms of realization now.","Sometimes that is not as steep as that and sometimes it can be more depending on what the markets due to the pension. But right now in 2014, we saw about a 5-point impact in realization. We also saw in 2014 a substantial impact in realization from our cash taxes, that was about a 10-point impact last year. So pretty substantial impacts in realization. ","We do see that, as I mentioned, improving to the mid 80's in 2015 based on our guidance.","Now there are some unique items within our guidance as well for 2015 that I think it's important to realize. One, we assumed or we are assuming a further increase in our capital acquisitions, our capital expenditures of over $0.5 billion year-to-year, as we continue to build out our cloud platform as we continue to invest in software.","We grew -- excuse me, we grew SoftLayer investment pretty aggressively in 2014. And we\u2019ll continue to do that into 2015. We also have a year-to-year impact in cash flow in our guidance to recognize the timing of the payments for the restructuring actions we've taken. And then finally, as we had in 2014, we also have in 2015.","There is a year-to-year impact from the x series business being out of our results but because of the structure of that there is a working capital impact. So overall guidance that we provided has a profit decline embedded within it and again those -- that combined with the year-to-year impact we see in terms of CapEx restructuring and x series being out, delivers that essentially, flat year-to-year free cash flow.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Toni. Kristine, can we go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.","Patricia Murphy","David, you are on mute?","Operator","It looks like he has disconnected. Would you like to move on?","Patricia Murphy","Yes, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you. Philosophically, Martin, how did you approach this guidance, even at the low end, you\u2019re only down about 5% in EPS from what you did in \u201814. And given how currencies moved against you and so forth, do you feel you're being conservative enough particularly, given that, it doesn\u2019t sound like the share counts going to come down too aggressively. And maybe you talk about what you're assuming for restructuring since restructuring is part of your reported EPS?","Martin Schroeter","Sure. Sure. Steve, so first thing I\u2019d say, the guidance is only about an hour and 15 minutes old. So I\u2019m not going to recharacterize what we\u2019ve already provided. Now having said that and we talked -- I talked a little bit about it in response to Katy\u2019s question, at the low and the high end of the range, I think the primary difference is the software trajectory that you assume. One assumes no change in trajectory at the low-end and one assumes in software stabilization if you will.","And as you said, we\u2019re not going to get the same year-to-year improvement from our share repurchase program that we got last year. But at the same time, we've taken a lot of action to position our business coming out of 2014 that we feel very, very good about.","So that $25 billion of strategic imperatives revenue growing at 16% a year is a very powerful part of the portfolio now. And in fact those deliver gross profit margins that are better than the IBM portal on average I should say because they have a higher software mix in them. So we are not going to get the same level of EPS at a share repurchase I\u2019ve shared. Again the dynamics on software and then the other part that you asked about was restructuring. We are not going to replicate the same level of restructuring that we had last year. It will be a lower mountain.","Now we will continue to remix our skills. It\u2019s part of our business. As you said, we include it in the way we report. So its part of our business, but we will not spend at the same rate. And we will get obviously some of the rollover benefits from what we\u2019ve done this year. So parts of our business continue to do very well, and the elements of the business that don't have that same level of growth remain very high margin, very profitable, very high value for us.","Now I should remind you that currency is a big impact for us. We've included in the backup charts the impact to revenue. It\u2019s about 5 to 6 points based on spot, that's just a revenue impact. As we saw in the fourth quarter, it was nearly a $300 million impact to us in the fourth. And a $300 million on our base that is really the difference between growing pretax income and not growing pretax income in the fourth quarter for us.","So it will be a big impact and despite that, we will grow margins next year or this year as well. So a few, I guess, I\u2019d say puts and takes on this but again I'm not going to re-characterize the guidance, which is now an hour and eighteen minutes old.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Steve. Can we go to our next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Bill Shope","Okay, thank you. I wanted to see if you could get a bit more detail on the cash flow comments that you made earlier. At the other elements, you mentioned that sustained the gap between cash flow and earnings for this year, which specifically are likely to be less of a factor beyond 2015. And I guess what specifically should allow you to get to that 90% conversion goal overtime?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, a couple of things. So again if I worked down from the 100, we do see an increased allocation of capital to the investments we are making. As I mentioned, we've included in our \u201815 guidance about a more than $0.5 billion of increase.","Now we don't see that rate and pace continuing forever. So yes we see increased capital expenditure requirements overtime as we continue to invest in things like our cloud, but not at the same rate and pace. So that will slow a bit.","At the same time, as we see markets perform or differently, we don't assume that the pension impact, it will not be a year-to-year impact I should say, continuing into the future. So slower CapEx spending growth, reduced impact from the pension on a year-to-year base.","And then, we do see as we go through this transition, as we\u2019ve talked about in our longer-term trajectory, we see profit growth in the high single-digits. And that profit growth has been the primary driver of our free cash flow growth over the year, as we talked a bit about this in Investor Day. The primary driver over the past 10 years of our free cash flow has been profit growth and as we get back to that profit growth, we see most of that converting back into free cash flow as well.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Bill. Christine, can we please take the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Benjamin Reitzes","Yeah. Thank you. Hey, Martin. You mind talking about acquisitions. Do you feel like you may need to acquire more to recapture a growth trajectory and\/or will that be, or will you use the same tuck-in model that you guys have been using previously? I guess my question is do you see a need for bigger bets? And what is the acquisition budget within your guidance for this year? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. A couple of things, Ben. One, the way we approach acquisitions, which has worked very, very well for us is the way to complement the organically developed innovations we can create and then to build around what we view as the future of enterprise IT. So over the last few years with that as sort of an approach, we've been pretty aggressive in acquiring analytics companies. We\u2019ve been pretty aggressive in acquiring -- we bought SoftLayer. We've been building out our cloud platform. We've been aggressive in acquiring new ways for clients to engage with their customers.","So our acquisition model again has been built around our view of the future of enterprise IT and how we supplement the technologies and the innovations we are bringing to market. I think that model works really, really well. Now, I do think that we see two differences, as we move into the future on our acquisition policy or our acquisition approach. One is more of our acquisitions will probably be on an as a service basis as opposed to say an on-premise model. And that\u2019s kind of the nature of the market and that's also where we have a lot of opportunity because we don't really play in some of those areas today.","So, we have over 100 as-a-service offerings, our as-a-service business in total, finished at $3.5 billion on an exit run rate. But we still see a lot of opportunity to expand, if you will in that as a service base. So one is more as-a-service acquisition content and then secondly, we've been more active and been very successful in partnering with leading companies in order to help transform industries and in order to help transform professions. And I think there is a great example in Apple and what we're working on with them and there's a great example in Twitter.","So those partnership models obviously require investment and we investment in them heavily. But we don't have to own all the technology in order to bring it to our clients. And one of the things our clients also went over again is that they look to us to help bring some of these things together so they can they can use it in the most effective enterprise class way. So, you'll see also more partnerships, if you will as opposed to acquisitions. But from an acquisitions standpoint, more as-a-service I would think as opposed to on-prem.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Ben. Let\u2019s go the next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Brian White ","Yeah. Hi, Martin. I am wondering if you could talk about how you are thinking of cloud growth in 2015. You talked about 60% growth in 2014. How are you thinking about 2015 in the cloud and net-net, if you could just give us a view on the impact the cloud is having on IBM? Obviously this business is growing, but it\u2019s impacting other parts of the IBM business. Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. So, cloud for us, a $7 billion business. I think that kind of puts us at the forefront of cloud in the cloud industry, in the cloud space if you will, so $7 billion growing 60%. We are delighted with the investments we've made and we see a very powerful opportunity in the cloud. That cloud business for us is made up not only of as-a-service business, which as I mentioned was a $3.5 billion dollar run rate at the end of the year. It also has our foundational offerings in it, where clients are building private clouds and deploying hybrid environments and we've been talking about hybrid for many years now.","We think that the hybrid environment is the way that we see most enterprises getting the benefit of the agility of the cloud linked in with their systems of record. So our foundational offerings are deploying private clouds and hybrid clouds and we see that trend continuing as well. So, $7 billion, we see continued strong double-digit growth in that for us.","Cloud for us remains a terrific opportunity for all aspects of our business. When we sign as an example these large services deals that you\u2019ve seen for instance coming out of Europe, big element of those outsourcing transactions is also to embed and include the cloud environment for those clients as well.","So cloud is sort of permeating a lot of the elements that that we are bringing to market and as part of why we brought all that together into a cloud organization just in January this year, something we mentioned we would do back in October and we announced the cloud unit in January, which will bring all that together for our client. So very powerful opportunity, very substantial business opportunity for us now at $7 billion last year and we see continued strong growth.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Brian. Can we go to the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang. You may ask your question.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Geography and outlook there, it look like Asia plays nicely in the fourth quarter.","Patricia Murphy","Tien-Tsin, can you start again.","Martin Schroeter","Yeah. Can you start again? You cut off in the beginning.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Is this little better?","Martin Schroeter","Yeah. Great. Thank you.","Patricia Murphy","Okay.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Yeah. Just want to ask on geography and the outlook there. I was just saying that Asia look like got a little bit better, Japan and China on the better place. So, any calls out on growth guidance by geography overall for the year? Thanks?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Tien-Tsin. A couple of things, Japan, again had a very good quarter, very consistent growth now and boy we are delighted with the progress that Japan team has made and the way they are bringing innovation to their clients. So I think it's a terrific story for us.","When we look at the other growth markets, the other highlight I\u2019d point out is China, as I said on the prepared remarks, down 1% in the quarter at constant currency, now that\u2019s without the divestiture of the System x business, but we had seen some pretty dramatic declines in that business prior to that.","So with our top banking customers deploying substantial new mainframe capacity in the quarter, we are pleased to see that that business is starting to stabilize. Again X currency, X divestitures, we are pleased to see that business is stabilizing and quite frankly, China has been a substantial business for us and it was again in the fourth and continues to be. We will continue to be a very important part of our business.","And the other geographies in Latin America, I think it's probably worth talking a little bit about because in Latin America, what we had -- in the fourth quarter was an impact from our transactional business as it wrapped on some very strong prior year.","So more annuity like businesses in Brazil and LA, in Brazil in particular, in LA we are fairly stable with good growth and our transactional businesses, which had been growing in the first nine months of the year hit a tough compare and so we are down. So LA finishes the year with growth, very good growth at about 8%, but down in the fourth quarter.","And then in Asia-Pacific, you we did not see a dramatic change in trajectory here going into the fourth in the third and the fourth and even the full year kind of 6% to 7% declines in Asia-Pacific. And fairly consistent even when we look across some of the constituents in the geography, Australia did not get any better, Asian did not get any better. So we are seeing some challenging growth environment in Asia-Pacific.","The one driver, I would say that's going to permute across all these organizations though is that the shift to the cloud, the shift to big data and analytics, and the shift to new systems of engagement is a key source of growth within all these geographies and we see that fairly consistently in our business, that phenomenon is consistent across the geographies.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. You may ask your question.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. I was wondering if we could get a little bit more color around the margin profile for cloud and the timeframe for improving those margins and any targets for the strategic initiatives as a percentage of revenue over the long-term? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. First, I will talk about the margin profile. So what we see across all of our strategic imperatives. We see on that $25 billion base is the gross profit margin that is greater than the IBM average. So we're actually seeing very good margin performance in gross margin on that strategic imperative content and again growing very rapidly.","Now we are investing heavily. So net margins are not -- they don't have that same dynamic. They are not yet greater. But we will see in that as a service business now as we talked a bit about on the call, we will see an improvement in scale, we are not yet at scale, but we will see an improvement in scale as that business from $3.5 billion on a negative run rate continues to grow. So we see good margin opportunity in our strategic imperatives as we deliver high value.","And then in terms of revenue target for strategic imperatives over the long run. I wouldn\u2019t pick a number of percentage per se, what I would say is that, a $25 billion growing solid double-digit just on a trajectory basis, the math would say, you continue to make pretty good progress i.e. continues to represent a bigger and bigger percentage of your revenue. But bear in mind that the recurring core franchise business to us, which is fairly stable and we expect it to continued to be fairly stable, remains very high margin as well as very high value. So those strategic imperatives will continue to grow, very good performance over the long run. They will represent a larger percentage of our business. Obviously, a sheer math would suggest that. But those other Recurring Core Franchises are delivering very high value to clients as well.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Joe. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.","David Grossman","Thank you. Sorry I dropped. So if this has been answered, feel free to take it offline. But I wanted to ask a quick question about software, information management and WebSphere are probably the segments with the most noticeable and perhaps impactful deceleration. And you\u2019ve outlined the issues related to the structuring of the ELAs. Can you provide for us some framework that would help us better understand when you would expect growth to return to more normalized levels and why you would expect that?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, David. And no, it hasn\u2019t been asked yet. So, I\u2019m glad you got back in. Couple things on software. First, we have to remove from a growth trajectory perspective, I'll take the currency impact out and I will talk about it, excluding currency. Full year growth in our software business was -- clearly our software segment was clearly impacted by the operating system content. So that was about a point and a half of impact over the years. So total software group, as you saw at constant currency was down about 1%. That includes just under 1%. That includes the impact of the operating system content. So the difference between the total segment is really the total middleware. Our total middleware business did grow, grew about 1%, excluding the currency.","Now as we\u2019ve said, there is a software-as-a-service business in there that's doing very well, growing 50%. We have elements of our middleware that are doing quite well. And in the prepared remarks, we talked about the flexibility we provided within that growth rate and we saw that in the fourth quarter as well.","The elements of that, the flexibility that we provided to our larger customers, as they deploy, as I mentioned earlier, things like hybrid cloud environments and private cloud environments. Their commitment to the platform over the long-term comes with our giving them some flexibility on how they deploy. So it's an impact of the growth, as I mentioned, total middleware was up a bit in 2014 on a full year basis.","And then within that content, if you look at the more transactional elements of our business, we still signed 350 or so ELAs in the fourth quarter. So the ELA structure still continues to be highly valued by clients. They really are just looking for this flexibility and how they deploy. The other way to look at it or in other way that we think about it, those large clients use flexibility to deploy outside of those large clients.","We actually saw growth in our middleware business, very good growth in our middleware business. So part of way we set the guidance the way we did was really reflective of the question that you asked.","And I guess, the way I\u2019d answer it is for our guidance, we\u2019re not relying on an improvement in trajectory in -- at the low end of guidance. And we are -- we would need a stabilization if you will in order to see the high-end of guidance.","But the phenomenon here is middleware is growing. Total middleware is growing. Different deployment rates in our larger customers than the growth we\u2019re seeing in the rest of our customers.","Patricia Murphy","Okay, Christine, let\u2019s take one last question please.","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. Martin, I guess my question is regarding the transition IBM is undergoing. It looks like 2015 will be another year of EPS decline as we shift revenues towards the strategic imperatives. I\u2019m curious when do you think the business model gets an optimal level where you see the target you outlined of low single-digit sales, high single-digit EPS growth. Is 2016 the year we get there or do you see that happening at a later point?","Martin Schroeter","Well, Amit, we\u2019re going to talk more about the longer term at Investor Day in February. So I'm going to limit my guidance today to talk about 2015 in what we just provided. And I think we characterized it pretty well for what we\u2019re expecting and what is implied if you will in that guidance.","But we look at 2014 and we look at how much we got done in positioning our business for the longer term. Again $25 billion business growing at 16%, including the impacts of currency. We look at the investments we made in our cloud business, including building out our software platform across 15 countries now including things and by the way, we will see the impact of that and the uptake of that capacity going forward.","We look at the relationships we are building and now executing on with again partners like Apple and Twitter and that's not yet in the 2014 obviously because we just did them that has a lot of good growth coming up. We look at the analytics business, the substantial business, $17 billion last year with reasonable growth. And importantly, we\u2019re really pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in commercializing Watson.","I would not characterize the $17 billion as reflective of a substantial revenue impact, if you will, from Watson, certainly a big investment for us but it's absolutely a right investment. And we\u2019ll see all that growth still coming to us. And then we look at other elements of our portfolio like mobile tripling and security up solid double-digit.","So from a growth and investment standpoint, we feel terrific about what we got done in 2014. And then we also undertook a lot of difficult decisions to position our business over the long term for other elements. So we stabilized our STG business in terms of its profitability. We completed the divestiture of our lower value x series business as well as the divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing, which is not going to be a payoff in 2015 or 2016. There's a payoff down the road for that but it is the right thing to do for us to remain the leaders in high-performance computing.","So I think 2014 we\u2019ve got a lot done. We feel very good about the progress we made in building out those strategic imperatives to $25 billion business. We feel very good about the overall high-value strategy. We did deliver $21 billion across the corporation of pretax income. And so we feel great about how we\u2019re exiting 2014 and then when we exit 2015, we\u2019ll have again a higher margin business than we did in 2014.","So let me make a few final comments to wrap up the call. So as I just covered kind of it within that, we did get a lot done in 2014. We've got a lot of proof points as I just went through. For 2015, as we indicated we see EPS, operating EPS in the range of $15.75 to $16.50. And within that -- excuse me, within that, we\u2019d see mid single-digit EPS growth in the first quarter.","Now keep in mind, we had large charge last year. So that growth in 1Q is off a low base because it has the charge in it. But again as I finish with Amit, we will exit 2015 with a higher value and the higher margin business. So thank you for joining the call. We look forward to seeing you at Investor Day.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Christine.

Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. Good afternoon, good evening, good morning, depending on where you are. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM. I\u2019m here today with Martin Schroeter, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our fourth quarter earnings presentation. The prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours, and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I\u2019ll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from us in Investor Relations.","Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to their related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You will find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation, and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Martin Schroeter.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks Patricia. As is typical in January, I\u2019ll start out with some top-level comments on the quarter and the year, discuss the details of the quarter, and then conclude with our view of 2017.","In the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $21.8 billion, operating net income of $4.8 billion, and operating earnings per share of $5.01, which is up 3.5%. There are significant opportunities and shifts in our industry, and we believe that to be successful with enterprise clients, you need to bring together cognitive technologies on cloud platforms, that create industry-based solutions to solve real-world problems.","So with that very brief context around our point of view, let me comment on what we achieved in the full-year of 2016. We made progress in building new businesses and creating new markets and continued to deliver strong results in our strategic imperatives. We invested at a high-level, and remixed our skills to address these new opportunity areas. We also continued to innovate in the businesses that we have traditionally provided to our clients.","We returned capital to our shareholders and we achieved the earnings and free cash flow expectations we set last January, with $13.59 of operating earnings per share, and free cash flow of $11.6 billion, which is 97% of GAAP net income. So we did what we said we\u2019d do, in a year not only with a lot of change in the industry, but also a year with a number of macro conditions and events, particularly in countries that are meaningful to our results. I\u2019ll cover our expectations shortly, but right up front I\u2019ll say that we are exiting 2016 in a stronger position than we entered it and that is reflected in our 2017 guidance.","Looking at some of the highlights of the fourth quarter, we had terrific growth in cloud, with revenue up 33%. We also had good growth in our analytics, security, and mobile solutions. We\u2019re continuing to grow our substantial technology services business, reflecting the work our clients are demanding to help modernize and transform their infrastructures. And we had really good performance in our z Systems business, reflecting the value of differentiated, high-value solutions running important parts of our client\u2019s infrastructure.","There were some macro challenges in the quarter in certain countries like Brazil, the UK and Germany, as well as the impact of a stronger dollar. As always my comments throughout will be based on constant currency. Our results for the quarter and the year reflect the success we\u2019re having in our strategic areas, and the investments we\u2019ve been making to drive that shift.","We delivered 14% revenue growth in our strategic imperatives for the year, led by cloud. We finished the year with $13.7 billion of cloud revenue, which was 17% of IBM\u2019s revenues. Our strategic imperatives, together generated $33 billion of revenue in 2016, and now represent 41% of our revenue. To put this in perspective, when we first established the strategic imperatives, we said they\u2019d grow to $40 billion, and represent over 40% of our revenue by 2018. The growth we achieved in 2016 keeps us ahead of track to the $40 billion. In fact, a growth rate of 10% to 11% from here gets us to the $40 billion in 2018.","We\u2019re moving into a new phase. The debate about whether artificial intelligence is real is over, and we\u2019re getting to work to solve real business problems. As we move into this new era, it\u2019s important to understand what enterprise clients are looking for. They need a cognitive platform that turns vast amounts of data into insights, and allows them to use it for competitive advantage. They need access to a cloud platform not only for the capability, but for speed and agility. And they need a partner they trust, and who understands their industry work and process flows.","This is where we\u2019re clear and confident about our point of view. Yes, we have world-class cognitive technology, but that\u2019s table stakes. We are building datasets by industry that we either own, or we partner for. Importantly, we\u2019ve designed Watson on the IBM Cloud to allow our clients to retain control of their data and their insights, rather than using client data to educate a central knowledge graph. And we\u2019re using our tremendous industry expertise to build vertical solutions and train Watson on specific industry domains.","We are amassing these capabilities, because you need more than public data and automation algorithms to solve real problems like improving healthcare outcomes or navigating the banking regulatory environment. So in this new phase, data and the business model around data matters, industry matters and time matters and that\u2019s why Watson is the AI platform for business.","Let me give you a couple of examples of the progress we made in 2016, bringing together cognitive, the IBM Cloud and our industry expertise. Watson Health provides cognitive insights on our enterprise-grade Watson Health Cloud, and leverages broad datasets that we own, including 100 million electronic health records, 200 million claims records, and 30 billion images. We now have 7,000 Watson Health employees, including doctors, nurses, health policy experts and 1,000 data scientists. We brought this together because you can\u2019t change the way healthcare works, or work on curing cancer with public data alone. You need clinical data, payer data, images, all of which is private. You need the expertise of the leading oncologists and geneticists. And you need to do this work within a quality management system that is HIPAA-compliant.","So Watson Health was our first vertical. Late in the year, we launched Watson Financial Services, to provide targeted solutions, bringing together cloud, cognitive, industry and ecosystem capabilities. In the fourth quarter, we acquired Promontory, a leader in regulatory compliance and risk management consulting. We acquired Promontory because you can\u2019t help banks navigate regulatory environments by scraping the web or automating keystrokes. You need top industry specialists that understand the complexity and can train Watson to deal with risk management requirements that are specific to financial services, because who trains your AI platform matters.","So bringing together cognitive technology, private data, a cloud platform and industry expertise is what you need to do real work in the enterprise. What is also becoming very clear is that as IT moves to the cloud and as business processes are delivered as digital services, it is essential they are enterprise-strength and that the transactions are trusted by all parties involved. That\u2019s where the blockchain comes in. It\u2019s a technology that brings together shared ledgers with smart contracts, to allow the transfer of any asset, whether a physical asset like a shipping container, a financial asset like a bond, or a digital asset like music, across any business network.","Blockchain increases transparency, auditability and trust. It reduces risk, and it can drive tremendous efficiencies. Bottom line, blockchain will help to fundamentally reengineer business processes and improve outcomes. We\u2019re building a complete blockchain platform and we have already worked with over 300 clients to pioneer blockchain for business. Many are in financial services, to handle foreign exchange settlement, smart contracts, identity management and trade finance. Just last week, we announced securities clearing and settlement with DTCC.","But the application for blockchain is well beyond financial services. For example, we\u2019re collaborating with Walmart to improve the way food is tracked, transported and sold to consumers across China, and with Everledger, who is using a cloud-based blockchain to track the provenance of diamonds and other high value goods as they move through the supply chain. Here too, the data needed to improve food safety or track diamonds isn\u2019t on the web. It\u2019s private data, owned by enterprises, who want to work with a partner they trust.","So in 2016 we built blockchain platforms and services, and in 2017 we expect to start scaling blockchain networks. I\u2019ll touch on a few more examples in the segment discussions, but first I\u2019ll walk through our financial metrics for the quarter.","Our revenue for the quarter was $21.8 billion, which is down 70 basis points. Over the course of the year, we\u2019ve had growth in our annuity businesses, and some growth pressure in the transactional content. In the fourth quarter, even with a seasonally higher transactional content and a little less contribution from acquisitions, our constant currency revenue performance was similar to third quarter. With the strengthening of the dollar, currency returned to a headwind. In fact, with the change in rates since mid-October and the seasonal skew of our business toward the back end of the quarter, revenue was impacted by nearly $300 million.","On a geographic basis, we had sequential improvements in both the Americas and Asia Pacific, while EMEA decelerated. Performance by country would generally be what you\u2019d expect, based on macro and geo-political trends. We\u2019ve all read about various issues in countries such as the UK, Germany, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, and so our performance in these countries reflects that reality. Some of these countries, UK, Germany, and Brazil for instance, have a meaningful impact to our results. Collectively, these 3 countries had over a one point impact on our revenue performance in the quarter. Others, like Russia, Turkey and Egypt were also a drag on our growth, though less of an impact given their size.","We had really good results in China. In fact, China grew strong double-digits in the fourth, which resulted in revenue growth for the full year. This strength was in the banking sector, where our largest clients are upgrading to our latest technology to continue to run their infrastructure. I should mention that we also had good revenue performance in the U.S., where we returned to growth.","Our gross margin reflects the impact of our investments, including the acquisitions we\u2019ve made, and the mix to as-a-Service businesses that aren\u2019t yet at scale. Our expense overall is down 7% versus last year, and our expense-to-revenue ratio was down about a point and a half. This includes a 5 point year-to-year impact from the acquisitions we\u2019ve closed over the last year, and a modest impact from currency.","Since early 2015, we\u2019ve been talking about ramping the level of investment in the business in areas like cognitive and cloud. Our year-to-year expense dynamics reflect the fact that we\u2019ve wrapped on that higher level of investment. We\u2019re also seeing the yield from some of the workforce rebalancing actions earlier in the year. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, some of this is being reinvested in other areas, including cost.","Our expense dynamics also reflect the success we\u2019ve had in rebuilding our intellectual property income base through IP partnerships. This is a model we\u2019ve developed for some of our high value technologies that are more mature, but not necessarily in a priority investment area for us. So it made sense to work with partners who will invest and build businesses around some of these software assets. It\u2019s good for them and it\u2019s good for IBM.","We license the intellectual property to these partners, resulting in IP income for us. They take on the development mission, drive future innovation, and ultimately expand the client base as they take the product to market. As we generate revenue from our own sales, we pay our partner a royalty for the development mission they\u2019ve assumed. As the partner expands their client base, they pay us a royalty because we retain ownership of the IP.","So with this model, we continue to own the product and our revenue stream, but shift our spending profile to a more variable cost structure, while extending the life of these assets. This is another way of monetizing our research and innovation, while allocating our resources to where we see our best opportunities. This quarter, our IP income reflects licenses for several software products and we have a pipeline that will continue into 2017.","Our pre-tax margin in the quarter was down 20 basis points. Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing effective tax rate just under 16% for the year. This is in line with the expectation we discussed at the beginning of the year, of 18%, plus or minus a couple of points.","We generated $4.8 billion of operating net income in the quarter, which is up 1.5% and net income margin expanded by 60 basis points. With a share reduction of 2%, our EPS of $5.01 was better by 3.5%. We generated $4.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $11.6 billion for the year, which is 97% of our GAAP net income. We returned three-quarters of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","So summing up the metrics for the quarter, we had strength in our strategic areas with a growing annuity base, an improving expense trajectory, PTI margin that was essentially flat, and net margin that was up, modest growth in operating earnings per share, and free cash flow realization and shareholder return for the year that was in line with our longer-term model.","Moving to our segments, Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 2%, and pre-tax income was up 1%. Our Solutions Software revenue was up, while Transaction Processing Software declined. Within Solutions Software, growth was again led by Analytics, including our Watson offerings such as Health, and Security. We continue to innovate the Watson Platform and extend cognitive across our solution offerings. We saw strong SaaS performance, with double-digit growth again this quarter. Our Cognitive Solutions margin profile reflects our continued investment into strategic areas, including acquisition content, and the ramp in our SaaS business.","Let me talk about the progress we\u2019re making in parts of the portfolio. In Analytics, we are helping clients move data to the cloud and deliver actionable insights from the data with our cognitive capabilities. This quarter we introduced new offerings, like the Watson Data Platform, Watson Discovery Service and trade surveillance for Financial Services, spanning our core analytics platform, Watson platform, and industry platforms.","Our Watson platform, which underpins our cognitive strategy, continues to gain momentum in the marketplace. Natural language processing has long been at the core of Watson. Last quarter, we added new cognitive capabilities for conversation and the demand has been strong. We\u2019ve seen significant growth in our API calls this year, especially around conversational services, where API calls increased 50 fold year to year.","Let me give you an example. In Latin America, Bradesco deployed a Portuguese solution based on Watson across more than 5,500 branches to assist employees in answering customers\u2019 questions. Watson had already learned over 300,000 words in the Portuguese language, more than twice the number linguists say is necessary to be fluent. But this isn\u2019t just about language translation \u2013 this is about understanding business. ","Watson was trained to answer questions on over 50 of Bradesco\u2019s retail products. And since going live in October, Watson is now helping to answer nearly 9 out of every 10 questions every day. ","As I mentioned, we\u2019re combining cloud and cognitive with industry expertise. In Watson Health, we are building scale and bringing real-world benefits to researchers and clinicians. With our offerings across five areas, including oncology and genomics, government, life sciences, value based care and imaging, Watson is helping over 45 million people globally.","Our oncology clients alone span more than 35 hospital systems. And with our acquisitions of Explorys, Phytel, Truven, and Merge, we have over 10,000 clients and partners. ","Genomics is another area where we\u2019re building scale. We announced partnerships with both Quest Diagnostics and Illumina, where both companies will leverage IBM Watson for Genomics, a new service that integrates Watson\u2019s cognitive services into genomic sequencing applications. Through partners, we will make Watson\u2019s genomic analysis available to oncologists who treat 70% of cancer patients in the United States.","In the area of Life Sciences, Barrow Neurological Institute is an example of where we\u2019re seeing real-world benefits today. Barrow reported using Watson for Drug Discovery to help identify five never-before linked genes associated with ALS, or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. This work gives researchers new insights that will pave the way for the development of new drug targets and therapies to combat ALS. ","Without Watson, researchers predicted the discovery would have taken years, rather than only a few months. We had growth in our Watson IoT this quarter where our clients are putting the power of Watson to work across the immense data pool created by the Internet of Things. We launched new industry solutions targeting manufacturing and insurance and new collaborations with clients, like BMW. We more than doubled both the number of new clients and the number of developers on our IoT platform.","We also had good results from our Weather platform. Here too, we\u2019ve demonstrated our tremendous scale this quarter. During Hurricane Matthew, our platform served as a critical resource for over 100 million people. Our platform delivered 350 million video streams over that week. Roughly 1.6 petabytes of data were delivered through a total of 141 billion API calls. With weather information, you have to be able to deliver that kind of scale, particularly when recognized as the most accurate forecaster.","Security also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven by areas such as data security and security intelligence. We announced a major expansion of our incident response capabilities, including the industry\u2019s first Cyber Range for the commercial sector, at our new Security headquarters in Boston. Cyber Range uses live malware, ransomware and other real-world hacker tools culled from the dark web to deliver realistic cyber attack experiences. Clients learn how to prepare for and handle cyber attacks.","And Watson for Cyber Security is providing insights on live cyber attacks to 40 clients, including as you would expect several large financial institutions and universities, who are participating in our beta program. So for the Cognitive Solutions segment, we grew revenue and profit in the quarter, while we continued to embed cognitive into our offerings, scale our platforms, and build industry verticals.","Turning to Global Business Services, our performance reflects continued declines in the businesses we are shifting away from, such as large ERP engagements. From a line of business perspective, our consulting results were fairly consistent with our performance throughout the year, while application management decelerated.","We continue to aggressively shift our investments and resources to our digital practices, and growth in our strategic imperatives accelerated to 19% this quarter. Our cloud practice was up over 70%, mobile nearly 30%, and analytics was up 10%.","On a global basis, we continue to build out our digital design agency, the IBM Interactive Experience, which now has more than 30 global studios. In the fourth quarter, we announced a partnership with General Motors to bring the power of Onstar and Watson together to create the auto industry\u2019s first cognitive mobility platform. ","Watson will learn the driver\u2019s preferences, apply machine learning and sift through data to recognize patterns in their decisions and habits. This information will allow brand and marketing professionals working with Onstar to deliver personalized interactions that directly impact their target audiences. This solution brings together our cognitive technology with IBM differentiated data such as the rich weather data and IBM iX\u2019s industry expertise in experience and mobile design.","As clients are looking to create new business models with our cognitive technologies, our industry experts in GBS are helping them scale. This quarter we announced a new global Watson IoT consulting practice to help clients introduce IoT innovation into their businesses. This will include 1,500 consultants, data scientists, and security experts with deep domain and industry expertise. We also announced that IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps can now be integrated with a broad set of Watson capabilities to increase the productivity and improve decision making for enterprise employees.","Turning to profit, GBS profit and margin were down. In the more traditional engagements, we continue to have some price and profit pressure. We continue to shift away from these areas to our digital businesses, adding nearly 8,000 resources to these practices in 2016. This impacts productivity in the near term. ","We\u2019re investing in enablement, hiring top talent, and bringing in new skills through acquisitions. Profit this quarter also continues to reflect additional spending in some accounts to deliver on our client commitments. So for Global Business Services, we accelerated the growth in our digital practices, while managing a shift from the more traditional businesses, and we\u2019re continuing to invest to build out capabilities and deliver on client commitments.","Technology Services and Cloud Platforms revenue was up 2% year-to-year, and pre-tax income was up 4%. Within this segment, our GTS revenue and backlog continues to grow. And this quarter we signed 16 deals greater than $100 million.","We are modernizing our offerings and helping our clients move to the cloud. Our strategic imperatives for this segment were up over 35%, with cloud up 50%. We continue to invest to build out our cloud infrastructure and we now have more than 50 cloud centers globally. ","In the fourth quarter, we acquired Sanovi Technologies, a cloud-native company that will enable us to deliver disaster recovery as a Service to clients undergoing digital and hybrid cloud transformation. This adds to our leading resiliency capabilities.","Looking at the lines of business, Infrastructure Services grew 3%. We built the IBM Cloud for the enterprise. Clients can mix bare metal servers, virtual servers, storage and networking to find the right balance for their workloads. Our enterprise workloads on our public cloud continue to scale, contributing to growth in our as-a-Service content. ","Clients continue to turn to us for enablement of their new digital businesses. These digital businesses require IT infrastructure that is always-on, available-everywhere, and of course secure. Clients often struggle with the complexity of sourcing and integrating IT services such as multiple cloud platforms, on premise data centers, and mobile environments. ","As a Services Integrator, we help clients navigate the complexity of their hybrid cloud environment and deliver the needed end-to-end infrastructure services solutions in an integrated and unified way.","For example, at a large Australian bank, we partnered with the client to build an IT architecture for the future. We are helping the bank design, build and manage a flexible hybrid cloud infrastructure. This solution automatically brokers, deploys, integrates and orchestrates across multiple environments and services. When the bank has a business need such as a new digital banking service, their IT is ready to support it immediately with a secure, integrated and optimized solution. ","We are the premier partner when it comes to hybrid cloud services integration. Our depth of capability and experience is unmatched in the industry. Technical Support Services was flat year-to-year and continues to generate substantial revenue and profit for our model. We are seeing growth in multi-vendor services, leveraging our global scale and deep technical skills.","We\u2019ve expanded our multi-vendor services into industries like banking, retail and healthcare, and into technologies including ATMs, mobile, point of sale, and Internet of Things. Think of this as providing wall-to-wall support for our clients.","Integration Software grew again this quarter as we continue to see momentum in our hybrid cloud integration capabilities and WebSphere Application Server, which grew double digits. We continue to scale our Bluemix platform, which has grown rapidly to become one of the largest open public cloud deployments globally. ","Based on open standards, it features a robust set of high value services including our cognitive, weather and blockchain APIs. American Airlines named IBM as its cloud provider for greater enterprise flexibility and scale. As part of the partnership, they will move enterprise applications to the IBM Cloud, leveraging a wide range of application development capabilities through Bluemix.","At Majesco, the global provider of core insurance software and services, we announced a five year partnership where we\u2019ll contribute cognitive APIs, that will allow insurance companies to better analyze, price, and understand business risk using new data sources such as the weather and social media. We\u2019ll also add an engaging and personalized cognitive interface to their services.","And one of the largest banks in Thailand tapped Bluemix to build a new secure blockchain network to transform their credit approval process. ","Turning to profit, gross margin is down 1.4 points. Infrastructure Services margins were flat year to year, but Technical Support Services and Integration Software margins declined. In TSS we are shifting more of the business into multi-vendor services and in Integration Software we are shifting more capability to SaaS. This is impacting margins in the near term.","The IP partnerships are a headwind to gross profit margins in Integration Software, though a tailwind to pre-tax margin this quarter. Pre-tax profit for the segment is up, with margins expanding 40 basis points. We continue to focus on investing in our strategic areas, while innovating and driving productivity in our more traditional businesses.","So for Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, we grew backlog, revenue and profit in the quarter, with continued strength in our hybrid cloud capabilities across services and software. These results reflect our success in modernizing the services that we provide to our clients.","Our Systems revenue reflects growth in z Systems, offset by declines in Power and storage as we continue to address shifting markets. Systems gross margin was up year to year due to both improvement in z margins, and the relative strength in that higher margin business.","In z Systems, we delivered 4% revenue growth, double-digit growth in MIPs, and we expanded our margins. These results reflect our continued success in driving innovation in our core systems. The mainframe is optimized for mobile and security, and is constantly being redesigned to drive new workloads, including instant payments and the","emerging blockchain. ","Eight quarters into the cycle, we added 8 new clients in the quarter, 29 for the year and 80 since inception. New client adoption at this stage in our cycle further validates our clients\u2019 perceived value and their ongoing commitment to the IBM platform. Clients are investing heavily to meet the demands for future growth. ","I mentioned earlier the strength we had in China. We closed significant z Systems deals in the quarter, including two large Chinese banks migrating their mainframe install base to our latest z13 technology. And in Europe we are helping our clients manage new requirements in the rapidly evolving area of financial services modernization. We had four wins in the quarter on instant payments. ","Given the critical nature of the European financial services backbone, TARGET2-Securities, or T2S, has been deployed on IBM z Systems to provide the necessary reliability, scalability and IT security. ","Overall, the mainframe continues to deliver a high value, secure and scalable platform that is critical in managing our clients\u2019 complex environments. Our Power performance reflects our ongoing shift to a growing Linux market while continuing to serve a high value, but declining, UNIX market. Linux workloads continued double-digit growth, and faster than the market, while the traditional UNIX base declined. ","We have been shifting our platform to address Linux, and with fully expanded Linux offerings, our Power-on-Linux represents over 15% of our overall portfolio. Supporting this is our success in HANA on Power. The Power platform is critical to the workloads a cognitive world will demand. ","And in the fourth quarter we saw this in the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s deployment of hundreds of IBM\u2019s OpenPOWER servers. When complete, these two supercomputers will be among the world\u2019s largest scientific and AI computing systems.","Storage hardware was down 10% this quarter, which reflects the shift in value towards software-defined environments. Storage revenue declines were mainly driven by midrange and high-end disk. However, we are now benefitting from a full suite of all flash array offerings and this portfolio grew double digits in the fourth quarter. We also continued to see double-digit revenue growth in Software-Defined Storage, particularly in our Spectrum Suite and Cloud Object Storage offerings, which is not reported in our Systems segment. Storage gross margins are down, as hardware continues to be impacted by both volume and price pressure.","So for Systems, our revenue and gross profit performance were driven by growth in z Systems, offset by Power and Storage declines. These results reflect the reinvention of our core systems for work in a new era of computing. We have optimized our systems to drive new types of workloads like blockchain and instant payments. We\u2019re expanding our footprint, building new capabilities, and solving new types of problems for our clients. And though we are facing some shifting market dynamics and product transitions in both Power and Storage, our portfolio overall remains optimized to address the demands of an era of cognitive and cloud computing.","So now let me touch on our software performance across our segments. Our total software revenue was over $7 billion, up 1%. Software was up 1% for the year as well.","From a business area perspective this quarter, we had growth in Cognitive Solutions and Integration Software, while Operating Systems continued to be a drag, in line with the longer-term secular trend. Software annuity revenue was up mid-single digits, led by our SaaS offerings. Our software transaction revenue declined mid-single digits, which is a significant improvement from the performance in the first half. Given the seasonality in our software business, transactional revenue has a bigger impact on our total software performance in the fourth quarter.","So moving on to cash flow, in the quarter, we generated $5.6 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. We invested $900 million in CapEx, and generated $4.7 billion of free cash flow.","For the full year, we generated $15.3 billion of cash from operations. We invested $3.7 billion in CapEx this year, with over a $1 billion in support of our cloud and Solutions businesses, as well as a significant portion going to support our services backlog and our upcoming hardware cycles. And so we generated free cash flow of $11.6 billion, and as I mentioned earlier, our cash realization remained strong at just over 97% of GAAP net income, consistent with our longer-term model of realization in the 90\u2019s.","So, our cash performance is right in line with our profit levels as we talked about all year, and includes significant cash payments related to the workforce rebalancing charge taken earlier in the year, as well as lower cash taxes. We did see an uptick in our working capital as we closed the year, which we attribute to timing and mix of substantial transactions in December.","Looking at uses of cash, we continued to strengthen our portfolio by investing $5.7 billion in acquisitions. We\u2019ve acquired 15 companies in 2016, including three in the fourth quarter. The acquisitions added to our capabilities in cognitive and analytics, cloud and security, and significant transactions included The Weather Company, Truven Health, Promontory, and three digital marketing agencies.","Over the course of the year we\u2019ve returned almost $9 billion to shareholders including dividends of over $5 billion and 3.5 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back over 23 million shares, reducing our average share count by just under 2.5%, which is in line with our longer-term model. At the end of the year, we had $5.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.5 billion. Total debt was just over $42 billion, of which about two-thirds was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business is seven to one and the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 52% investment grade, a point better than September. I will come back to a change we\u2019ll be making to the structure of our financing business starting in 2017.","Our non-financing debt of $14.3 billion was $2 billion lower than September, resulting in a non-financing debt-to-cap of just under 50%, five points lower than September, and more importantly five points lower than a year ago. Our debt-to-cap ratio was impacted again this year by a reduction in equity due to pension re-measurement, a $1.6 billion reduction to equity, or about three points to the ratio.","Looking at our pension plans, as you know the U.S. plan has been frozen for some time, and the asset mix reflects that, with a relatively low risk, low return profile. The result of that is low odds of any required funding in the U.S. regardless of the interest rate environment. Our funding levels remain solid with the U.S. and worldwide tax-qualified plans at 102% and 98% respectively, a modest increase from last year. Information on the performance of our retirement-related assets, and return and discount rate assumptions at year-end are in our supplemental charts.","Importantly, our balance sheet continues to have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long term.","So now let me spend just a minute on our financing business. As part of our own transformation, we saw an opportunity to drive some operational benefits by changing the structure of our financing business.","First, let me say that the structure of the Global Financing segment that we report is unchanged. We have reorganized our client and commercial financing business as a wholly owned subsidiary, IBM Credit LLC. This combined corporate structure will, over time, meet its funding requirements by issuing debt directly to the market. This will drive operational benefits by consolidating the operations of our financing business. We will issue debt directly out of the new entity, and expect the entity to be able to access the capital markets later this year. And, we will increase our financing business leverage from seven to one to nine to one, which represents an increase of about $600 million in Global Financing debt.","But as I said, our Global Financing segment is unchanged, and will continue to include our client and commercial financing business as well as our hardware remanufacturing and remarketing business.","So let me wrap this up. We have a very clear point of view on what it takes to be successful with enterprise clients in this new era. I\u2019ll shorthand it as cognitive, plus cloud, plus industry. And what differentiates IBM is the ability to bring all three together, to change real business processes and outcomes. Enterprise clients rely on us to help them run their processes. We have the relationships, we know their process and workflows, and importantly, we have their trust. This incumbency positions us very well to take our clients to the new era.","In 2016 we continued to make a lot of progress in the transformation of our own business. We had strong growth in our strategic imperatives, cloud, analytics, security and mobile. These offerings generated $33 billion in revenue, and now represent over 40% of our revenue. And they\u2019re high value offerings, with a gross margin that raises overall IBM.","We also invested at a high level, through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships. In 2016 we spent nearly $6 billion in R&D, nearly $4 billion in capital expenditures, and nearly $6 billion to acquire 15 companies. We\u2019re amassing a unique set of assets to build our cognitive solutions and cloud platforms, like the digital assets of The Weather Company, healthcare datasets from Truven and risk and compliance experts of Promontory. In 2016 we continued to remix our skills to new opportunities, while continuing to deliver innovation in our more traditional areas, like positioning z Systems as the ideal platform for blockchain, or Power for cognitive, or utilizing our intellectual property partnerships to extend some of our software assets.","So we\u2019ll take all of these capabilities into 2017. Even recognizing the shifts in our industry, some country-specific challenges and opportunities, and some macro effects of currency and potential tax reform, as I said up front, we feel that we\u2019re exiting 2016 in a stronger position than we entered it.","This confidence is reflected in our view of 2017. To simplify, we expect to stay on track in our strategic imperatives. We\u2019ll continue to invest at a high level, though as you saw in the fourth quarter, after ramping investment from 2015 through late 2016, we\u2019ve wrapped on that higher level. And we expect to grow our pre-tax income, and while there are a number of scenarios for tax, in all cases we expect tax to be a year-to-year headwind to our book rate in 2017. Put it all together, and we expect to deliver Operating EPS of at least $13.80 in 2017.","If you remember the first quarter of last year, we had a few larger items in our earnings, but they offset at the net income level. That first quarter was about 17% of our 2016 operating EPS. We expect a benefit from discrete tax again in the first quarter of this year, though smaller in size. And like last year, other actions will offset some portion of the benefit. With this, we expect a similar skew for 2017, with about 17% of the full year expectation of $13.80 in the first quarter.","Looking at cash flow for the year, we expect free cash flow realization in excess of 90% of GAAP net income, and we\u2019ll return 70% to 80% of our cash flow to shareholders, both in line with our longer term model.","Bottom line, we feel good about the progress we made in 2016, and our prospects for 2017. And now, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and the full year. And second, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.","So let\u2019s please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Katy Huberty","Thank you, good afternoon. Just quick clarification and then I have question. The clarification is just it would helpful if you gave a little more insight as to what you\u2019re expecting in terms of the range of outcomes for the tax rate both normalized rate and how much discrete items could be in the year and then similar for IP income just because those were so significant in 2016?","And then as it relates to my question which is on Watson, from the outside it seems this business gets pretty significant share of the press, but not contributing to revenue. Do you have visibility at as to when we should expect an inflection in revenue recognition from Watson, or should we just not think about this as a contributing factor or moving the needle in our models over the next couple of years?","Martin Schroeter","Okay, thanks Katy. A couple of things, on tax when we look at, as I in the prepared remarks, we do see tax as a headwind year-to-year, but remember we had last year a $1 billion, we won a tax case in Japan, so over $1 billion, which was in last year. That drives, by the way the bulk of the year-to-year headwind.","On a rate basis we finished this year we said 18 plus or minus 2, and we finished kind of at the bottom end of that range for the full year on an operating base obviously with on all in base with that Japan benefit from the first quarter and there it\u2019s much lower, but we finished at the bottom end of that range. When we look at 2017, as I said in the prepared remarks all the scenarios point to a headwind. We\u2019re right now thinking it\u2019s about 15 plus or minus 3, and the reason we widened the range is because we are getting ready for tax reform here in the U.S. We don\u2019t know yet what that looks like, we read the same things you do, but we are going to start now to prepare for tax reform, so we\u2019ve widened the range this year to 15 plus or minus 3. That doesn\u2019t have discretes in it.","On IP income as we said a number times we are trying to rebuild that base of business, it\u2019s always been part of our income stream, it is a business where we\u2019ve now had fair bit of success in rebuilding it and while we\u2019re not relying on a big growth year-to-year, we do have in that particular line. A lot of this is already done quite frankly because we have these agreements in place that pay us royalties. And then we have a pretty good pool of opportunities that could get this back to again the same level that we printed this year. Again we\u2019re not relying on that to within our guidance. Within our guidance I\u2019d say we could be down year-to-year little bit. But again a lot of this is already done and we have a good pool of opportunities to drive IP again for what will be what 18 or 19 years of doing this. So we got, I think, a pretty good track record.","And then on Watson, Watson is in and you can see it in the Solutions Software business which accelerated. Again Watson, our Solutions Software is what\u2019s being \u2013 or Watson is what\u2019s driving that. Now Watson is a silver thread, it runs through the platform, it runs through Watson Health, it runs through Watson IoT, it\u2019s in security now, right Watson is embedded in security.","And as we announced at the end of last year at Watson Financial Services, we will now embed the regulatory expertise of Promontory into Watson, so Watson will be part of that Financial Services industry solution content as well. So Watson is firmly, firmly established as the silver thread that runs through those cognitive solutions and you can see all of that in the solution software performance.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Katy let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. Martin, your free cash flow conversion of 90% plus in 2017 leads to about $10.2 billion at least in free cash flow, which is substantially down year-on-year. Can you help bridge the puts and takes here or what are the largest moving pieces to that conversion rate\u2026","Martin Schroeter","No, I mean. Thanks, Wamsi. I guess the way I look at free cash flow conversion. As you know we guide on a conversion metric. But we see free cash flow basically flat year-to-year in 2017, not down. Now again, we give a range and that\u2019s consistent with the model we have of being north of 90%, 90% to 100%. But we see free cash flow for the year to be flat. Now within that, as you know again we got our money back from Japan last year when we won our tax case so we\u2019ve got that as a headwind. And within that and we\u2019ll overcome that with the rest of the operations. But the other side of this is, we also holding if you will an ability to grow our capital investments within that flat as well. So it was not I mean you shouldn\u2019t interpret that 90% is down, we see free cash flow flat with a tax headwind which will overcome and room to grow CapEx.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Wamsi. Sam. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess my question broadly and we give this a fair amount is IBM\u2019s gross margin profile over the last several quarters. Especially across the cognitive segment specifically, but broadly has degraded pretty consistently. I realize you guys have a lot of investments but also is it organic but just talk about when do you think gross margins start to stabilize. And at what point do you think at least on the cognitive side the acts as-a-service business start to become more in line to the cognitive segment margin profile.","Martin Schroeter","Yes, thanks. Okay, sure. So on cognitive solutions, its been a year that you really have to go back to understand where we finished in the fourth. And I\u2019m going to talk specifically about the fourth in a moment but you have to go back to what we\u2019ve been talking about within cognitive solutions all year. So in the first quarter we saw the steepest year-to-year decline in margins, driven by a heavily by our investments \u2013 heavily by our need to remix our skills. And also by we had acquisitions and while currency was a big headwind in dollars for us last year was also an impact to our margin.","So as we progressed through the year when we get the fourth. On a gross profit margin basis we were down about three points which I would put in currency and acquisitions is all of that three. And so on a PTI margin basis in the fourth we were down about less about half, little bit less than half about 1.4 points. And within that again currency and acquisitions drove three points so everything else in cognitive solutions within the PTI margin.","The mix of the annuity business the ramp of our as-a-service business, the benefit we get from our licensing our IP and the offsetting royalties that are coming. And everything else improved operating PTI margin in the fourth quarter. And so what you saw in 2016 in cognitive segment margins on PTI was an operating margin that went up pretty dramatically as we went quarter-to-quarter like 17 points, right from first all the way to fourth.","And next year, I don\u2019t know when currency is going to ramp but we do know it\u2019s much less of a headwind next year than it was this year at least at current rates. And we also know that we ramp on the acquisitions. So those things that have dragged us dragged our margins down are starting to go away and while gross profit. We don\u2019t see that I don\u2019t see that deteriorating by three points like it did in the fourth anymore. And in fact PTI margins I think are much, much more stable going forward, which is what we\u2019re assuming. Now they don\u2019t have to be flat, we\u2019re still going to drive our as-a-service performance we are going to continue to drive these IP deals, which throw a little bit of royalty into the GP stream but I see a much improved cognitive segment PTI margin from what we experienced in the fourth. And again you saw in the fourth we ramped on our heavy investment levels here as well.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Amit. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Thank you so much. Just wanted to \u2013 I guess better understand this global financing change and what\u2019s driving that. Are you increasing your leverage to support clients and anything needs in 2017 or is it just a tool to lie [ph] to increase your debt overall leverage and efficiencies just want to better understand that.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. Thanks Tien-tsin. So there are some really important benefits here as we align kind of the legal and the capital structure of our financing business that just by itself will drive pretty substantial operational benefits. It gives us better capital structure flexibility in each of the countries in which IGF operates. IGF by the way doesn\u2019t operate in 172 like all of IBM does its more like 45 but it allows for better capital structure in that more limited set of countries in which they operate. It gives us better efficiency of cash allocation.","So what \u2013 we are really doing here as we are taking the interest earning part of IGF, the client financing and the commercial financing, we put those into a subsidiary. We will provide \u2013 be providing more information externally. So you can see everyone can see what the capacity for them to borrow and that\u2019s really the borrowing capacity of IGF the remarketing business does not support a borrowing capacity its a very high margin, it\u2019s a very high return but the interest bearing portion of IGF is really what supports the debt. ","And so we\u2019re going to issue debt directly out of that entity. It\u2019ll allow us to add $600 million or so of debt because that portfolio was high enough quality that it can run at higher leverage. That\u2019s by the way more consistent with what we see in other entities of this nature. So we\u2019ll run it slightly higher leverage that will improve the ROE, that will free up basically some equity if you will that we have in IGF it will free up some equity in mainline. But it\u2019s not a change to necessary to the overall debt levels it\u2019s really a change to IGF and its efficiency the operational benefits we get and our ability then to pull a little bit of capital out of idea. But also manage it better in which in the countries in which it operates. But again importantly the segment that you see won\u2019t change. So this really is a change in how we access the capital markets externally.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Tien-tsin. Sam, can we take the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes, thank you. Martin if I think about 2016 in total relative to your guidance at the beginning of the year it benefited about $1.20 in EPS from IP gains and lower tax rate not including the Japanese tax settlement. So on a fundamental basis, earnings went from about $14.02 in 2015 to about $12.50 in 2016. So as we look to 2017, you\u2019re guiding for an improvement in earnings from $13.50 to $13.80. And you said tax is going to be a headwind, you\u2019ve said IP income is not going to help if anything it might hurt. So the last three years you\u2019ve actually had fundamental erosion if we take out tax and IP in your business.","And you\u2019re calling for an inflection point in 2017. So I\u2019m wondering if you can talk through what are the key things that drive that improvement and perhaps you could also be explicit about what your expectation for acquisitions and their contribution for restructuring expense and whether that will be a net, we\u2019ll have any net impact on results and what your assumption is for cash tax versus accrue tax in 2017 as well? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Okay, sure. Thanks Toni. So a couple of things when we entered 2016 as I said earlier on a prior question, we said tax would be 18 plus or minus two and we came in again at the bottom of the range. And so now when we look at tax, yes, we had $1 billion improvement from Japan, which we are not \u2013 obviously we\u2019re not going to win another tax case in Japan by the way. But we do have discrete this year.","When we look at where we finished, we finished at the bottom of that range. And as I said with us going into now 2015 into 2017 at a 15 rate plus or minus three we have to overcome if you will the headwind from the Japan. But we\u2019re going to as we plan for tax reform we don\u2019t see a fundamentally different operating tax picture than we saw last year in our I&E. We saw an inflection point it\u2019s probably you know maybe that\u2019s the right way to think about it. We saw an inflection point in intellectual property income this year. And I can tell you that yes, we see an inflection point in profitability our PTI we expect to improve that\u2019s embedded within our earnings.","So we saw an inflection point in IP income but then you get to the engineer and you want to take it all out. So that we hit an inflection point in IP last year, we did better than we had the prior year. And it\u2019s always been a part of our model and again we see while it may not continue exactly we\u2019re not relying on all of that for the year. We will have IP income a substantial amount of IP income as we always have for the last I don\u2019t know 18, 19 years you have the history as well.","So we do see an inflection point in our margin profile remember that we have gotten a lot done this year in terms of getting margins stabilized. We see that for instance in our infrastructure services business which drew margins for the year. We did get wrapped if you will on the higher levels of investment and spending and you see that in our cognitive solutions and I talked about that earlier. So and you see it on in our E2R [ph] performance on SG&A for instance in the fourth quarter alone. So as we get into now \u2013 as we get into 2017 and all of the work we got done plus we\u2019ve got a better base on which our as-a-service margins are still continuing to grow because we\u2019re not where we wants to be yet but we did improve throughout the year.","We have a momentum if you will in our cognitive solutions business and again those are high value. And we\u2019ll get all the \u2013 whatever savings if we have from workforce rebalancing both as we continue to remix our workforce. So yes, I am saying that PTI margin and PTI growth this year is what is implied in our guidance now with the tax headwind it doesn\u2019t translate as much to EPS growth but we do see the inflection points in parts of our business and including our margin profile.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. Can we go to the next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Your line is now open.","Lou Miscioscia","Okay, great. Thank you. You maybe go into more detail in GBS like the last quarter you had said that over 50% of the revenue has transitioned into the digital practice area and that was growing in double-digits. So looking at this quarter obviously it seems like it\u2019s fallen back a little bit, many others are growing application management just if you can help us out what\u2019s going on under the coverage there why it seems that which should have improved in \u2013 obviously it didn\u2019t and what you think about that going forward.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. Thanks, Lou. So the dynamics in GBS were similar to what we talked about in prior quarters we said a couple of things. One we are continuing to remix their skills and while we have a good performance in our strategic imperatives and that those digitized offerings. We still do have a pretty large book of business that\u2019s in our part of the marketplace that has very heavy price pressure as all of us are competing to get kind of that foothold if you will or competing for certain kinds of opportunities and some of these accounts. So we\u2019ve got price pressure in parts of the business and again we\u2019re remixing our skills which as we said will have an impact the shorter term impact on productivity.","Now shorter term we invest in businesses for a long, long periods of time. So I don\u2019t define shorter term is every 90 days. Although this business this business should start to improve when we \u2013 as we\u2019ve talked about last time when we see a couple of things. So the backlog in GBS is down and so our first focus has to be to take the skills we\u2019re building and get a good signings, a good consistent signings performance in order to grow the backlog once you grow the backlog then obviously you deliver in an efficient and effective way. And you start to improve your margins and we still view GBS is being able to get that done in fact. We\u2019d say we will grow signings in the first quarter this year. So maybe we\u2019ll start that position now but we still see this business and these skills at such a key differentiator in the marketplace that. We\u2019re unwilling if you will to reduce our capacity or our capabilities in the marketplace. We really this is the third leg if you will between cognitive and a robust cloud. Industry skills are going to \u2013 what brings it all together so GBS is in a similar dynamic. I do think will grow signings in the first which will be the start to having that business improve. But it\u2019s going to take a little while longer to get through these same dynamics, our remixing skills and moving our skills away from these heavily priced pressured opportunities.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Lou. Sam, can we please take the next question?","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Brian White with Drexel Hamilton. You may ask your question.","Brian White","Hey, Martin. So it sounds like the PTI margin will expand in the 2017, maybe just look at gross margins. You think gross margins will expand and if you can just give us a view on \u2013 the major business segments where should we expect improvement in the PTI margin in 2017? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. Thanks Brian. So a couple of things, we have is as we always, do we have a bunch of scenarios on how a year might fold out, roll out, right. So I would say that as you pointed out PTI margin expansion is in every scenario. That\u2019s evidenced by the fact that profit is growing, it\u2019s implied to grow with the tax headwind and then EPS obviously with a little bit of growth. So PTI margin growth is in each of the scenarios.","GP margin is not necessarily required for us to grow PTI margin and that\u2019s for a couple. Now I\u2019m not saying that peak that GP is necessarily going to go down but we can maintain our GP margins, we can even erode a little bit if we want to accelerate our move into as-a-service even faster. As you saw we had very good growth in our \u2013 as-a-service business in the fourth.","Overall those margins are below our IBM margin, so there\u2019s a little bit of margin pressure as you make that shift, but we can deliver 2017 push as-a-service margins it\u2019s really hard either maintain or you can even contract GP margins a little bit and still grow PTI margins given that we\u2019ve ramped on, again this heavy level of investment and we\u2019ve gotten a lot done on structure both the overall IBM structure, the infrastructure of what runs IBM, as well as each of the business have taken another good look at structure.","So from a segment perspective we saw good performance in our global technology services business. When you look at the infrastructure services piece growth and margins for the full year and I\u2019d say that we can see opportunity to continue to grow margins there. The technical support services, the TSS business is where the margin pressure was in 2016, but I think we have a way to stabilize that margin performance, a very much is a mix shift from as we drive the multi vendor services business in TSS.","So margin improvements in the infrastructure services business I see relatively flat profit margins and systems. Now we\u2019re coming off of a high point in the mainframe. At the end of the cycle margins tend to be higher. As you go into a new cycle they tend to be a little bit lower. But we also have an opportunity to improve in the other businesses. So systems margins relatively flat and we see again an opportunity to improve margins in GBS. As we get some of the work that I\u2019ve described they are done and get kind of the power to shift through the way, we can see improvements in GBS.","And I talked earlier about cognitive solutions, so I won\u2019t cover that again. So again PTI we do see growing. GP not necessarily, we don\u2019t need GP to grow in order to produce PTI margin growth.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Brian. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is now open.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you very much. Martin, I think you talked about $2 billion of savings from the workforce rebalancing and so forth a year ago. I was curious how much of that did you see last year, how much of it is going to be seen in 2017, and how much of that in 2017 May you take to the bottom line because that strikes me, that\u2019s a big part of this PTI improvements.","And also just wanted to ask and you might want to actually respond to this that where are you in the innings in your transformation. It\u2019s been a number of years now. How far into it are you? And then just qualitatively what surprised you positively and what\u2019s been very difficult to change in terms of changing IBM.","Martin Schroeter","Okay. Well, that\u2019s a lot there Steve. So first on the workforce rebalancing savings, we said for last year, for 2016 that we would see a bit more than $500 million and we absolutely got that. And we said we would free up then $2 billion of total spend, some of which will get reinvested, some of which will go to the bottom line. You saw from our view of 2017 now that we\u2019ve ramped, we\u2019re not obviously reinvesting all of that although we ramped on our higher levels of spending, so obviously some of that\u2019s going to wind up in the profit. And with mid single-digit profit growth it\u2019s a fair bit drives that profit growth in 2017.","In the innings, you know what, IBM is always transforming. So I don\u2019t know how to pick an inning other than to say that we have established a few years ago, we established this idea that the strategic imperatives were the path for revenue growth to resume and those continue to grow quite well. Then last year we changed the segment structure and said, look, we\u2019re going to now report not only more detail on the strategic imperatives, but we\u2019re going to talk to you about cognitive solutions which has all the Watson content. We\u2019re going to talk to you about a cloud platform business and we\u2019re going to talk to you obviously about the industry dimension.","And so that part of the transformation continuous and I don\u2019t think that that transformation of IBM ever ends quite frankly. We are back now as we put in our guidance; we are back to our model level of pre-tax income growth as we have in our model right now. Now if you say that pre-tax income growth \u2013 if for the model \u2013 achieving the model is the definition of when the transformation is done, then I\u2019d say that we see that this year for pre-tax income.","Now we\u2019ve got a lot of other elements of our financial model as well. We\u2019ve been returning cash to our shareholders consistently, we have generated our free cash flow as a percentage of our net income has been on model. So we\u2019ve had a number of elements that are on model. Pre-tax income growth I think is a good one that says this structure, the strategy is working and it will drive the financial model we set out to achieve, at least on the pre-tax income growth which had been missing.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Steve. Can we please go to the next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Joe Foresi","Hi, I thought I\u2019d ask that progress question a little bit differently. Can you give us some thoughts on your expectations for growth in the strategic imperatives and the decline in the core business in 2017? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Sure Joe. So, we said a few years ago that strategic imperatives would be $40 billion and 40% by 2018 and as you just saw we finished 2016 when they\u2019re 41%. So obviously we made the mix piece of this early. But from here if we grow, say, 10% to 11% we get to 40% by 2018. And so with such a substantial part now of our business at $30 billion plus with such a substantial part of our business to grow that at that continued double-digit says that we have the right offerings in the right spaces with the right skills to deliver them and they are robust powerful solutions. And so we see that kind of growth in order to get to the 40%. We still think we\u2019re quite confident; we\u2019re ahead actually of track, but we\u2019re quite confident in getting to the 40% still.","The core business or the rest of the business if you will is always has a few components in it. One, at our very core, remember, that we are delivering productivity to our clients, and so they use that that productivity that we deliver to reinvest. And as we said before that\u2019s the dynamic you see in our revenue stream. We deliver productivity through parts of our business and they reinvest and that\u2019s how you get the revenue dynamic that we have.","The core was down double-digit two years ago and down 9% in the fourth, if you do the math roughly down 9%. And when we get into this year, I\u2019d say that we\u2019ll see a kind of a similar dynamic but that\u2019s what we are \u2013 that\u2019s what is sort of embedded within our guidance for 2017. So continued good performance in strategic imperatives, continued focus on delivering productivity for our clients and we\u2019ll have that revenue dynamic into 2017.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Sam. Why don\u2019t we take one last question?","Operator","Certainly. Our last question is from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.","David Grossman","Thanks. Actually Martin if I could just ask two questions really quickly. One is just into your last answer. So if you are growing at 11% in the strategic and you are pretty close to 50-50, I think you\u2019re at 44% in the fourth quarter and the core is declining 9%. I mean wouldn\u2019t that imply that we\u2019re reasonably close to getting to a crossover on the top line.","Martin Schroeter","Did you want to ask your second question first, or do you want me to answer that one?","David Grossman","Well, the second \u2013 Why do you answer that first and then I will go to the second one.","Martin Schroeter","Okay. So when you say we were down on a constant currency basis, we were down 70 basis points in the fourth. So I think we are reasonably close in the third. Yes, this is the structure we are in. And we are focused on driving value in those strategic imperatives not just grabbing a little bit of revenue to have some math work out differently.","And our margins in the strategic imperatives continue to be higher than overall IBM and higher obviously than the core, so our focus on delivering value hasn\u2019t changed. And whenever that crossover point happens to be, yes, we\u2019re already close. So when you say wouldn\u2019t it imply, yes, we\u2019re close, we were close in the fourth. But we\u2019re focused on delivering value, and for 2017 we\u2019re focused on obviously PTI margin expansion.","David Grossman","Right. And the second piece is, if historical trend repeats itself, you\u2019re due for a mainframe product cycle in the back half of the year. I believe the way you break it out at least some of that mainframe revenue is in strategic imperatives. So that said how should we be thinking of the potential financial impact of the next mainframe cycle vis-a-vis prior cycles, particularly given some of the secular shifts that you\u2019ve talked about in your prepared remarks and in response to some of the other question?","Martin Schroeter","Sure. So, yes, I mean, we \u2013 if you follow a mainframe cycle then it would say sometime late this year we\u2019d have another mainframe. But again, we wouldn\u2019t see the impact of that until late in the year. What drives the mainframe as it always has is our ability to make it relevant to the workloads that our clients need.","So when we were together when we announced the last mainframe, and two years ago we talked a lot about this shift to mobile. We talked a lot about security. We talked within those two elements and there\u2019s a lot more to it. But within those two elements we talked about how the mainframe was built particularly with those two kinds of workloads in mind and that drove the growth we saw in the mainframe through the cycle. That\u2019s still by the way part of the growth we see in the mainframe and it\u2019s still why \u2013 that\u2019s why big enterprises continue to put their most important work on mainframes.","Now the set of workloads that are going to drive the next incantation of the mainframe are going to be things like Blockchain, and so all of that is still ahead of us. We added and we said in the prepared remarks, we added a number of new clients throughout the cycle but we added more again in the fourth quarter as well.","And while I haven\u2019t talked to every one of them, I think what they\u2019re thinking, what many of them are thinking is yes, I need mobile, and yes, security is more important than ever, but I also need to be ready for the next workload drivers. And Blockchain is a good example of a workload driver that is ideally suited for the most robust enterprise platform there is. So I think that if I had to pick just one that drives the mainframe is Blockchain. It would be my first top of my list for what drives the next mainframe cycle.","So let me wrap up the call by saying again that we\u2019re really pleased with the progress we made in 2016 and how we\u2019re positioned for 2017. Of course there\u2019s plenty for us to work on, we\u2019re not confused by that. But we are looking forward to continuing this dialogue at our investor briefing later in the quarter.","So with that, thank you for joining the call.","Patricia Murphy","Sam, can I have you close up the call please?","Operator","Absolutely. Thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time."],"11977":["International Business Machines Corporation.

I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter earnings presentation.","The prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I'll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC.

All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to their related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the form 8-K submitted to the SEC today.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin Schroeter.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks, Patricia. In the third quarter, we generated $19.2 billion in revenues, $3.7 billion in pre-tax income and $3.29 of operating earnings per share. As we think back to the discussion 90 days ago, it was around Brexit and its impact on Europe, global spending and sectors like banking and the attractiveness of investment in the emerging markets, all of these topics have the capacity to drive some volatility and results, but what you see in our third quarter results is stability in our revenue with continued strong growth and strategic imperatives and a top and bottom line consistent with what we expected.","Our revenue was essentially flat relative to last year. Looking at the revenue dynamics, I want to point out a few things. Our clients are focussed on becoming digital businesses and have strong growth in cloud, security, mobile, and across our analytics portfolio reflects this. In total, we continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our strategic imperatives led by our cloud business.","Cloud delivered as-a-service is part of a solid recurring revenue base across software and services, and our annuity revenue continued to grow. Of course, the acquisitions we made in the last 12 months contributed to growth about the same amount as last quarter and for the first time in quite a while currency was a modest tailwind to revenue growth. I\u2019ll talk to our revenue at constant currency going forward.","Looking at revenue from a segment perspective, we had very good performance in both cognitive solutions and technology services and cloud platforms. Cognitive solutions were up 5% and within that solution software was up 8%. Technology services and cloud platforms revenue also grew with continued strength in our infrastructure services and growth in integration software as we help our clients build hybrid cloud capabilities. And with another quarter of signings growth our GTS backlog is up year-to-year.","Global business services made some progress this quarter in revenue trajectory as we continue to shift and mix to a digital offerings. Our systems revenue was down this quarter. The z Systems performance reflects the fact that we are seven quarters into the product cycle where POWER reflects the secular decline in UNIX mitigated by growth in Linux. There is a tremendous amount of change in our industry and we are continuing to invest where we see the best opportunities.","With this, we are addressing new opportunity areas and building new markets as well as delivering innovation in our existing businesses. We are investing organically and we are acquiring key capabilities. We are remixing their skills, and we\u2019ve had success in rebuilding our IP income base, utilizing partnerships that enable us to continue to innovate in some of the more traditional high value areas of the business.","With all of that, we continue to have a very high margin business and we generate a lot of profit in cash. Our results reflect the success we are having and helping our clients to leverage cloud for speed and innovation and become cognitive businesses. You see this in the growth in our strategic imperatives which were up 15%.","Over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered nearly $32 billion in revenue and now represent 40% of IBM. We had strong performance in our cloud offerings which were up over 40% led by our as-a-service offerings. We exited the third quarter with an as-a-service run rate of $7.5 billion. That\u2019s up from $6.7 billion last quarter and the bulk of the increases organic. So we are building scale in these businesses.","We also had strong revenue performance in security and in mobile and we had strong growth in our analytic offerings which were up 14% this quarter with contribution from the core analytics platform to cognitive offerings including Watson platform, Watson Health and Watson IoT.","We are building the industry\u2019s broadest and deepest cognitive solutions and cloud platform portfolio and we are extending our capabilities. For example, this quarter we continued the global expansion of our cloud footprint and we now have 49 cloud centers. We formed a partnership with Workday, where IBM cloud will become the foundation for Workday\u2019s development and testing environment. And we extended our partnership with VMware to enable easy hybrid cloud adoption.","As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, cognitive is about using data and adding intelligence into products and services to help clients make better decisions. It\u2019s about augmenting human intelligence. This quarter, we introduced and expanded Watson platform offerings including Watson conversation service and Watson virtual agent for customer service. We are training Watson for cyber security, expanding the amount of security data Watson is injecting. In Watson Health, we launched Watson for drug discovery and Watson Health core and in Watson IoT we added new capabilities around block chain and security to draw insights from billions of sensors embedded in everything from machines to cars, to drones to ball bearings to buildings and even to hospitals.","Where we are seeing real value is in providing cognitive capabilities in the IBM cloud, the third critical element of our strategy is our industry focus, and in the third quarter we introduced an industry platforms business that integrates cloud, cognitive industry and ecosystems capabilities to provide targeted solutions in specific industries. Initially industry platforms will address two substantial opportunity areas, once in financial services and block chain solutions. We believe block chain has the potential to do for trusted transactions what the internet did for information. We are building a complete block chain platform and are now working with over 300 clients to pioneer block chain for business, including CLS, who settles $5 trillion per day in the currency markets to implement a distributed ledger in support of its payment netting service and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi for smart contracts to manage service level agreements and automate multi party transactions.","And in the third quarter, we opened the block chain innovation center in Singapore to accelerate block chain adoption for finance and trade and we now have block chain garages opened in New York, London, Tokyo, Singapore and San Francisco.","In Watson Financial Services just a couple of weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Promontory Financial Group, a leader in regulatory compliance and a risk management consulting. So just as we trained Watson on clinical research and medical guidelines to work with doctors treating cancer, we will apply the expertise of Promontory to train Watson to directly address escalating regulations, their risk management requirements in financial services.","I\u2019ll expand on some of these solutions and go into more detail on our strategic imperatives performance in the segment discussions, but first let me walk through our financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue for the quarter was $19.2 billion. As I just mentioned currency was a modest tail wind to growth, about 80 basis points this quarter.","On a geographic basis, we had sequential improvements in both the Americas and Europe. The Americas revenue was flat as compared to last year and the U.S. was also flat. Latin America was up 5% led by Brazil. While the environment remains uncertain, double-digit growth of Brazil this quarter reflects the importance of our z Systems platform to the banking sector.","Europe performance improved four points sequentially, driven by the U.K. Germany, France and the Nordics. Asia Pacific decelerated including a decline in Japan and weaker performance in China. India continued to post strong results. Our gross margin was down this quarter, across the business the decline is driven by higher level of investments including the acquisitions we have made and the mix to as-a-service businesses that aren\u2019t yet at scale. I\u2019ll address the margin dynamics that are segment specific within the segment discussions.","Our expense overall is down versus last year. I want to spend a minute on a few of the expense drivers. We\u2019ve been investing at a higher level, both in organic capabilities like cognitive, security, cloud and block chain but also through acquisitions. When we look at the acquisitions we have done over the last 12 months, this drove about five points of expense growth.","As we look at our investment levels, we want to allocate our skills to where we see the most opportunity in growth. Some of our assets are high value, but not necessarily in growing markets, so we are licensing not selling our intellectual property to partners who are allocating their skills to extend the value of these assets.","This quarter, we signed three such agreements resulting in a higher level of IP income. Licensing as a part of a broader partnership to drive future innovation is a relatively new model for us. It allows us to retain and potentially grow the revenue stream while shifting our spending profile to a more variable cost structure. IP income is just one way that we monetize our technology, sometimes selling our intellectual property, other times licensing IP.","The last thing I want to mention relative to expense is that we continue to have a year-to-year impact from currency, not only from the translation, but also as we wrap on last years\u2019 hedging gains. This drove a three point impact to expense, so while currency is a modest help to the top line, we continue to have a meaningful impact to our year-to-year profit. Put it all together, and our reported expense is better 2% versus last year.","Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing effective tax rate of 18% for the year which is in line with the expectation we discussed at the beginning of the year of 18% plus or minus a couple of points. It also includes a discreet benefit for closure of our foreign tax audit which lowered the tax rate in the quarter by two points.","From a cash perspective, we generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and nearly $13 billion over the last 12 months. This was over 100% of our GAAP net income and over the same period we returned about two thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Now turning to our segments, our cognitive solutions revenue was up 5% which is a sequential improvement from the second quarter\u2019s rate. Our solutions software revenue was up 8% while transaction processing software was down 2%. Analytics was a growth driver and we grew revenue in all spectrums of Watson. We saw strong SAS performance with double digit growth in revenue. Overall, gross margin was down due to the mix shift to SAS and the acquisition content.","Our pre tax income performance also reflects ongoing higher levels of investment in strategic growth areas like our Watson businesses. Our Analytics business which is the largest portion of the solution software portfolio grew again in key areas such as information integration, big data and Watson.","Watson underpins our cognitive strategy and continues to gain momentum. Watson\u2019s conversation service launched in July provides developers a simple and easy entry into the next generation of engagement, through quick set up and tooling developers without deep machine expertise can leverage the science of Watson to develop engagement experiences across multiple channels. We introduced our Watson virtual agent for customer service building on our conversational capability to provide a cognitive repeatable application trained for customer service.","For example, we recently announced that the Royal Bank of Scotland will begin using a Watson Powered Chatbot for customer service. The Chatbot will help seamlessly route customer service request through the correct channels and answer specific banking queries.","Turning to our vertical plays, we are focussed on scaling our Watson Health business. We have over 7000 employees and target four major areas, life sciences, oncology, imaging and value based care. We launched new offerings, such as Watson for drug discovery which is a cloud based scalable platform that helps life science researchers discover new disease pathways, new drug targets and additional drug indications. We had several major client wins, including UPMC and Best Doctors.","And earlier this month, we announced a strategic alliance with Siemens, to help health care providers deliver value based care-to-patients with chronic conditions such as heart disease and cancer. With Siemens, we\u2019ll focus on accelerating U.S. adoption of Watson\u2019s population health management offerings. Siemens will use the Watson Health Cloud as its preferred global technology platform. We\u2019ve also been growing our geographic footprint, expanding it to China, South Korea, Finland and the United Kingdom this quarter alone.","Hospitals in both China and South Korea announced plans to adopt Watson for our oncology. And in Finland, we announced a partnership with the Finnish government that will utilize Watson cognitive computing to help doctors improve the health of its citizens. Their vision is to build an open health care ecosystem based on compliant and efficient utilization of healthcare data, so Finland will put their healthcare data on our Watson Health Cloud.","When you think about an entire country and trusting us with its healthcare data, this should give you some perspective as to how clients believe we have the right technology and consider us a trusted partner to drive healthcare innovation. This builds on a similar announcement we made with the government of Italy earlier this year.","We also made great progress in Watson IoT. We opened our German location where we will co-create with our clients. We added new capabilities to our offerings. So now you can share IoT data from connected devices on a block chain, proactively identify potential security risks and protect devices, and tap the Watson IoT platform to develop new voice interfaces for customers all by leveraging these capabilities. IBMs leadership in IoT was recently highlighted by IDC. We more than doubled the number of new clients on our IoT platform in the quarter including Schaeffler and Thomas Jefferson University hospital.","Schaeffler, one of the world\u2019s leading automotive suppliers based in Germany is using Watson IoT to transform its business from its supply chain through to manufacturing and sales. This is a good example of how deeply embedded into our clients businesses we are becoming down to the ball bearing themselves. We are seeing exponential growth in both devices and developers and now we are expanding our industry differentiation and our reach with Watson Financial services.","As I mentioned last month, we announced plans to acquire Promontory. Together, we will create cognitive solutions for risk and compliance. Global business services delivered $4.2 billion of revenue with a one point improvement in growth trajectory from last quarter. Our digital practises which now make up more than half of GBS were up double digits with strong growth in cloud analytics and mobile. Our cloud practise was up nearly 70% this quarter as we build and implement digital strategies to move our clients to the cloud.","By line of business, we grew 2% in application management driven by growth in our digital foundation and mobile platforms. This was offset by a decline in consulting revenue as some larger contracts went down and clients continue to move away from on-premise enterprise application work to new business models focused on digital and cloud.","Enterprises are looking for new ways to reach their customers and empower their employees to make faster decisions. We continue to see strong double digit growth in our enterprise mobility that are helping clients redesign work flows with specific industry context. Our growing collection of mobile first for our IoS applications are delivered on the cloud and can connect back to their core systems and infrastructure. This is reinventing the way employees make real time decisions by putting the POWER of the enterprise in their hands. We continue to bring new customers onto the platform, including VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, RIMAC Insurance in Peru, and Amica Insurance here in the U.S.","We also opened a new IBM mobile first garage in Bangalore, part of the network of centers that helps clients around the world achieve mobile-led digital transformations, at speed and at scale.","Turning to profit, GBS gross profit margin was down 90 basis points. We expanded margins and application management as we mixed a new cloud in digital platforms. And with the benefit from our work force rebalancing actions, we are driving productivity in our delivery model. Consulting gross profit margin was down reflecting the investments we are making to grow our digital practises. Also, there were some accounts that required additional spending to deliver on important commitments; these dynamics are also reflected in our PTI margin. We are continuing to shift the business as we\u2019ve added nearly 10,000 resources over the past year to our strategic imperatives. The acquisitions we have done over the last year impact our near term profit but add important capabilities, like cloud consulting skills around workday in salesforce.com. We\u2019ve also expanded the IBM Interactive experience in our digital design capabilities. We are focussed on integrating and scaling these new skills as we continue to expand our digital practises.","Technology services and cloud platforms delivered $8.7 billion of revenue and grew 1% year-to-year. Global technology services again grew signings and backlog and has now grown revenue for six consecutive quarters. As we shift from systems integration to services integration we continue to see momentum in our new offerings. Across the segment our strategic imperatives were up over 40% with cloud up over 50% and the as-of-service runrate up over 60%.","Looking at the lines of business, infrastructure services was up 2% as our hybrid cloud strategy continues to resonate with our clients. We provide enterprise grade cloud solutions that are secure, agile and leverage the data and investment in their core systems. We continue to expand our cloud infrastructure announcing the opening of new cloud centers in South Korea and Norway this quarter. We now have 49 centers around the world enabling low latency connectivity to cloud infrastructure.","And moving to the cloud, our clients need to be sure that data is secure. Those in regulated industries need to know where their data is and many need to keep it in country. Our cloud infrastructure allows clients automatically to provision virtual with bare metal service while meeting their data sovereignty and regulatory requirements.","At JFE Steel, one of the largest steel manufacturers in the world, we announced the five year outsourcing agreement that will migrate core systems to the IBM cloud through a hybrid solution that will consolidate their infrastructure and streamline business operations. This will allow the company to speed up system development and services deployment, strengthen IT governance and reduce cost.","And last week, we announced a new cloud object storage service that will enable clients to scale large unstructured data volumes across hybrid cloud environments. Italy has adopted this new object storage service to more quickly and easily analyse data that\u2019s being produced by the more than the 10 million clicks it processes each month.","Looking at the software component of our hybrid cloud solutions, integration software grew 4%. We saw a continued strength in our connect products that integrate applications, data and processes for on-premise and cloud environments. We also grew in some of our mission critical offerings such as Webster application server. We continued to shift more of our portfolio to another service model to our bluemix cloud platform which continues to scale across a broad catalog of high value services including cognitive, weather, internet of things and block chain APIs.","We continue to build our partnerships and eco systems to help clients move to the IBM cloud, through our partnership with VMware nearly a 1000 clients have begun moving their VMware environments to the IBM cloud including Marriott International, Clarient Global and Monitise. We are helping organisations extend existing workloads to the cloud in hours versus weeks or months.","Turning to profit, our gross margin for technology services and cloud platforms was about flat year-to-year. We expanded margins and infrastructure services as we see the benefit from productivity actions we\u2019ve taken and continue to streamline our processes. We are investing in our technology and using our cognitive capabilities to shift to a more automated delivery model to improve performance and drive efficiencies.","Our technical support services margin declined, driven by the mix to our multi vendor support offerings. Our PTI margin also reflects these dynamics as well as the continued investments we are making to build out our cloud platforms.","Turning to our systems segment, there are some important market shifts in this business like spinning disc to flash, the rising importance of the hyperscale data market and new opportunities in block chain. We are shifting our business, delivering innovation in our offerings and introducing significant new capabilities. As always, our performance in the period is based on product cycle dynamics and portfolio transitions, and given where we are in the transitions and POWER and storage and in product cycles more broadly our revenue and profit is down after a strong 2015.","Our z Systems results reflect a product cycle dynamics, seven quarters into the z13 cycle; revenue was down while margins continue to expand. We continue to add new clients to the platform and we are introducing new technologies like block chain. We announced new services to make it easier to build and test block chain networks in a secure environment as we build our block chain platform it\u2019s been engineered to run on multiple platforms but is optimized for scale, security and resilience on both the IBM mainframe and the IBM cloud.","As z Systems are well suited for these new workloads, due to its advanced security features that help protect data and ensure the integrity of the overall block chain networks. We are currently working with over 40 clients on pilot block chain used cases running on z.","Our POWER performance reflects both our performance in a declining UNIX market as well as our growth in a growing Linux market. While our margins were relatively stable at the high end of POWER, mid and low end margins were down, driving a decline in overall POWER margins.","We\u2019ve been shifting our platform to address Linux and in the third quarter Linux grew at a double digit rate and faster than the market. It now comprises over 15% of our POWER revenue. Supporting that is their success with HANA where we are bringing in new clients and were replicating this strategy with others. This quarter, we expanded our Linux only server portfolio leveraging OpenPOWER partnerships to deliver a new high performance computing chip and system with NVIDIA GPU acceleration and new data optimized servers.","And our POWER architecture had another win, this time for a major hyperscale data center with one of the world\u2019s largest internet providers based in China. And finally at the end of September, we introduced new POWER midrange in high end systems designed for hybrid cloud computing and flexible consumption models to transform on-premise IT to the cloud.","So in POWER, we are shifting to Linux while continuing to serve the high value UNIX base, but this is a long transition. In the near term we are focussed on stabilizing the margin base.","Storage hardware was down 9% this quarter reflecting the ongoing shift in value towards software. Gross margin is down reflecting both volume and price pressure. The hardware decline was mainly driven by low end and mid range traditional disc storage. Our high end disc storage grew this quarter. All flash array revenue grew as we have expanded our flash technology across our product portfolio. We recently rolled out new products and transition to a full suite of flash offerings making us competitively positioned, and while now in our system segment we also continue to see double digit revenue growth in software-defined storage, so across system, we're facing product cycle headwinds and some transitions in POWER and storage, while continuing to deliver important technologies and capabilities to address cognitive and cloud.","So now let me wrap up the segment discussion with the performance of software across our segments. Our total software revenue was $5.7 billion, up 3%. This is the third consecutive quarter of improvement in our software revenue growth trajectory.","We've got a broad software portfolio from solutions that provide cognitive, analytics and security solutions to core transaction processing, to connecting on-prem data and processes to private and public cloud environment, our software is open, running on IBM and non-IBM environments.","From a business area perspective this quarter, we had solid growth in cognitive solutions and integration software, while operating systems continue to be a drag in line with a longer term secular trend, across software, software annuity revenue was up mid single digits led by our SAS offerings.","Acquisitions contributed to our SAS growth, but SAS was up organically as well. Our transaction revenue decline mid-single digits which is a significant improvement in the trajectory as compared to the last several quarters, as its typically in the third quarter our transactional software content was less than 20% of our software revenue, but remember in the fourth quarter due to seasonality transactions represent a larger portion of the software revenue.","Moving on cash flow and the balance sheet, we generated $3.3 billion in cash from operations excluding our financing receivables. After $850 million of CapEx spend, we generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.","Through the first three quarters of the year, our free cash of $6.9 billion was a little lower than last year with lower tax payments largely offsetting the year to year operational performance. Through September our CapEx spending is consistent with last year.","As I mentioned earlier on a trailing 12 months basis our free cash flow was over 100% of our GAAP net income. This performance continues to support our expectation that we will deliver the high end of the full year free cash flow guidance range we provided earlier this years.","This includes the expected cash payments related to workforce rebalancing charge taken earlier in the year, as well as the expected tax payments in the fourth quarter. Looking at the uses of cash, so far this year we've invested nearly $5.5 billion in acquisitions.","We've acquired 12 companies, the largest being the digital assets of the Weather Company and Truven Health Analytics. In the last nine months we've return $6.6 billion shareholders including nearly $4 billion in dividends and we bought back almost 18 million shares. We ended September with just over 950 million shares outstand and $3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended September with $10 billion in cash and $42.5 billion in total debt, about $26 billion of our debt was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at about 7:1 and the portfolio remains strong at 51% investment grade.","Our non-financing debt to cap was about 54.5% which is essentially unchanged from December and down about four points from year ago. Our balance sheet continues to be well-positioned to support our business over the long term.","As I said upfront in an environment where there are lot of open questions our business is showing a lot of stability, that stability is driven by the kind of work we do for our clients. We're applying deep industry skills and innovative technologies to change real business processes and outcomes. This supports our ability to invest, to create new offerings in markets and our ability to find new ways to monetize our intellectual property.","In the third quarter, we made progress across our business with continued strong growth in our strategic imperatives, some moderation and declines in our core businesses, remixing our skills and adding new capabilities through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships.","You'll recall in July we said that we expected our second half EPS dynamics to be improved over the first and we laid out a half a dozen or so areas where we expected to drive that. Now based on our third quarter performance and view with the fourth we'd say the second half improvement is pretty much in line with our view 90 days ago.","While we may see a little less improvement from software revenue mix, we're more successful in monetizing our software through IP income. So bringing it all together and as we look at the full year we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.50 of operating EPS and free cash flow at the high end of the range we provided at the beginning of the year.","And so with that, we'll take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I'd ask you to reframe from multi-part question. So let's please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may proceed with your question.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes. Thank you. Martin, I have hopefully straightforward clarification and then a question please. Just on the clarification the year-over-year IP gains were about $340 million or $0.30. And I appreciate that your licensing real software IP to get that, but how do we think about this has been sort of more one off rather than ongoing IP and should we be thinking of IP income increasing on an ongoing basis?","And similar, if you could just clarify the tax rate, I had 14:2 [ph] as your tax rate. You talked about two points being helped from a discrete tax item. Was there something else that was impacting the tax rate that appear to get it down to at least by my model something that's closer to 14%. So if you could clarify those two that would help.","And then the question is around free cash flow and how to think about it. This year you're going to be at the very high end into your range, probably free cash being a 100% or more than a 100% of GAAP net income. As we look forward next year given your guidance, is typically lower than that. Should we not be thinking about free cash flow declining in an absolute -- on an absolute basis in 2017?","Martin Schroeter","Okay. Well, I think I got them all, Toni. So, we'll do the clarifications first and we won't count that as a multi-part question, we'll count that as a multi-part clarification, and then we'll talk about free cash flow. So couple of things on IP and this is actually a really important point I think Toni, our IP income, our IP income has been flat to down over the last say three, four, five years and we've been thinking about how do we continue to drive IP income?","If you look back, and I'm sure you have all the data as well. If you back 15 years ago, we had as much as a $1.07 billion of IP income, now a lot of that was driven from the fact that we developed really good semiconductor manufacturers and really good semiconductor manufacturer processing technology and our ability to license that technology drove a lot of income. We have been thinking about how do we reinvigorate if you will the IP income business and part of it is what you'll see now as we're realizing some of these.","So, the clarification that you asked about, is it about 340 million year to year? Yes, that's right. That's about 340 million year to year. But more importantly, we are going to continue to drive IP income. Now, we got a good third quarter on a year to-date basis where about 1.01 billion, so we're kind of flat. I don't think that we have enough to set a new annual record when we look back at the $1.7 billion that we printed 15 years ago or so, but it is certainly a focus, and keep in mind I think that these are relationships, they are long term relationships, right. So, they are not all public as some of our partners don't want to talk about what they are doing. Those that our public, though their multi, multi year relationship where they can drive now some of the value that they see, they can capture within the marketplace.","We again, we license it to them, we don't sell it to them, so we have an interest going forward as well and can get some of the upside here. So this is a really -- it\u2019s a terrific model, it's got a lot of legs. We see an opportunity for this over the next few years to continue doing this. So, I think that handles your clarification on tax. There are two points, your notes were right, two points were from the discrete piece of its. And then we are -- our view of the year now, because of the mix of our business has an operating ongoing effective rate of 18 plus or minus, which is where we were at the beginning of the year.","So, it's really a kind of a view of where the mix of our businesses looks for the rest of this year. On free cash flow your question, we have been running at a realization which is above our model. Now keep in mind we got \u2013 we won a tax case earlier in the year and that means we got our money back, right. So that was a pretty substantial inflow. But we also had some pretty substantial outflows in terms of our workforce rebalancing payments and things through the year. So, as we said in our guidance, we would expect to finish at the high of the guidance. We said that already 180 days ago. We still feel confident about our ability to generate cash.","As we start to look at next year, we don't see anything that fundamentally changes our realization from where we are in our model, so our model as you know is in the 90, so somewhere between 90% and 100% realization, and we don't see anything, knowing again everything we have now, everything we have now year to-date plus what's coming in the fourth, we don't see anything that would say our free cash flow realization is going to change. And so, when we get through now the fourth and we see where we are for 2017 and 90 days then we'll talk more about the absolutes, but we don't see anything in the realization that's going to drive our realization to be anything other than again 90% to 100% for next year.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Toni. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","And our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kathryn Huberty","Thanks. Good afternoon. You didn't close any major acquisitions this quarter and yet cognitive growth margin sell 400 basis points year on year, 200 basis points sequentially. Should we not expect to see improving margins as-a-service revenue scale on the fixed cost base of data centers? And then Martin just connected to that you mentioned that the one variance to your plan for the year is that the software business, margins are tracking the plan, can you maybe touch on why that it is? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure. So, I'll address actually the second one first, Katy, so when we talked about first half to second half and we laid out where saw the business in the second half, one of those elements we had on that chart last quarter was the idea of software mix and as-a-service -- software mix and as-a-service margins and it would go \u2013 it would turn into a modest positive. And I would say that's more neutral now. So not a dramatic change and it really has to do with the mix of business, you know, we're getting the kind of growth rates we would expect. You saw third quarter we had software up 3, which is an acceleration from the prior quarter, but it really is that we're also seeing good momentum in our cloud platforms business, so it\u2019s really a mix statement that is driving that as oppose to something happening within our software margins.","On the cognitive margin component the phenomena you described is absolutely accurate. As we slowdown those investments we'll see the as-a-service margin scale, we're starting to see the as-a-service business scale, but we still see so much opportunity we're going to keep driving the investments. And so we haven't gone to that point yet where the scale overtakes the investment levels in that as-a-service business.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Katy. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great, thanks. Good afternoon. Just on the transactional sales down 5% in the third quarter, curious if there's any the line of sight here into this fourth quarter and what you might expect there in relationship to \u2013 in relation to which is on the third quarter maybe this is a question. Do we start to think about transactional sales and for the IP income, maybe together, I don't know if there is any correlation between the two in any way? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks, Tien-tsin, so a couple of things. The transactional business as we noted in the third, down five was an improvement from where we were in the second. So, we had reasonable transaction closing rates. Now, the thing to keep in mind as we go into the fourth, it is a much bigger transactional quarter for us and so while we have, what I would call a good opportunity pipeline, we have got now 85 days or a 75 days to see how the environment holds up and that will obviously drive the fourth quarter and drive the full year.","When we look at \u2013 when I look at the revenue streams in the fourth, our annuity business which again smaller pieces in the fourth. Our annuity business has been growing pretty consistently quarter, to quarter, to quarter and I would expect that growth to continue into the fourth that transactional business which is again much larger tends to get a pretty good quarter to quarter sequential bump if you will about $1.5 billion. And based on our opportunity pull, we'd say that looks about like what we'll get done in the fourth as well, but there is some uncertainty in environment and here in the U.S. we've got an election to get through, but right now I'd say that my line of sight into 4Q says, that quarter to quarter impact in third to fourth is about $2.5 billion as we had \u2013 just for that transactional business.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Tien-tsin. Sam, can we can take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is open.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you. You talked quite bit about Watson. You've been running many Watson ads. I just wonder if you can give any updates from the Analyst Day on Watson. How much revenue are you generating? The revenue you do generate is it in the software or consulting buckets kind of relatively speaking that you expect going forward? You mentioned I think four, five ways, you're looking to monetize Watson at that meeting, I guess which ones are working. And you talked about it as a platform as well and I'm wondered if you consider running Watson on someone else's platform like on AWS?","Martin Schroeter","Okay. Steve, I'll start with the last question first and last answer to that question is no, Watson runs on our cloud and our technology and Watson will run on the IBM cloud. With regard to the progress we're seeing, we've talked a bit about and you've seen many of our announcement around where Watson is showing up and the kind of work it\u2019s doing, all of that as you know gets reported within our strategic imperatives and all of it goes into the cognitive solutions space that's where our Watson Health business is, that's where our IoT business is, and that\u2019s where the Watson platform is.","So, I'd say that with the cognitive solutions business we talked about it in total at plus five, the sub-segment of that where the Watson content shows up which we also provide is up eight, so good growth in that software solutions space. But keep in mind that we're also building new markets here and it's going to take some time for us to take the technologies and the processes that we bought for instant in our Watson Health business and now layer on the Watson technologies to get the ramp in growth that we expect to get out of some of them. So, yes, good progress, yes, it\u2019s a long term investment, and all within that cognitive solutions segment and no, it's not going to run on anything but the IBM cloud.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Steve. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Your line is open.","Patricia Murphy","Lou, we can't hear you. You are on mute.","Lou Miscioscia","Hello.","Martin Schroeter","Well, there you are. Now we can hear you.","Lou Miscioscia","Okay. I hope it\u2019s coming through okay. So on the software area which was up 3%, maybe can you go in there and just share with us what is organic, and would you say that we've actually gotten passed with flexible pricing situation that you've been obviously dealing with from negative growth standpoint for a couple of quarters or actually maybe about two years now?","Martin Schroeter","So, a couple of things, Lou on organic, as you said software up 3 and acceleration for where this -- there is across IBM, the acquisition impact was about the same as it was last quarter, about 2 points across all of the businesses. Now lot of those businesses are software, so obviously an impact in software in the quarter, but not dramatically different again from what we saw in the second. We have \u2013 we continue to have good annuity content performance, so our annuity business continues to grow.","The phenomena that we've talked about with regard to our largest customers is still part of the discussion with every large customer, it\u2019s a question of how do they best view the deployment of their licenses. How do they best view the use of our technologies in order to make sure they are optimizing their own workloads, they make sure they are optimizing the projects they have going on.","One of the things and important thing to us is are they, to make sure that they're still using our software and are they still \u2013 are they still, for instance, paying us in [Indiscernible] and are they renewing that, and our renewal rates have stayed very high and very consistent through the third quarter as well, and so we're confident that our software business has the right appeal if you will to our clients, because they continue to use it, they continue to deploy it on any large customer basis, any large customer, the discussion could be a little bit different, but again good software performance in the quarter, some benefit from acquisitions, but I would expect that our annuity base will continue to keep growing as well.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Lou. Sam, can we go to next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. I have a quick clarification and a question as well. So, Martin when you alluded to sort of moving into this high transactional quarter in the fourth quarter, I think you alluded to about 2.5 billion sequential improvement quarter on quarter in that business, is that the baseline that is needed to achieve the 2013 and 2015 in guidance, that's my clarification. And for my question, if you think about sort of the unique one-time benefits in 2016 you had tax which was the big driver for first quarter. I know you had associated investments and then now you look at the third quarter there are some significant IP other income and I appreciate your comments around the increasing nature and sustainability of this.","And I know you're not guiding it to 2017, but conceptually these elements make it seemingly tougher to grow earnings in 2017 especially at a time when base of buybacks are moderating at sub 1 billion for the last four quarters and gross margins continue to compress, so maybe you can help us taking through at a high level maybe some puts and takes and what potentially will be positive drivers are offsetting some of these headwinds in 2017?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Wamsi, and again the multi-part clarification with the question is an interesting approach, but \u2013 so first on the revenue quarter to quarter, yes, so when we look at our third to fourth as I said, we typically get about $2.5 billion in transactional revenue in the quarter and that's sort of build in one-off, I mean, we got a different \u2013 we have a lot of different scenarios on what the year might look like, but that is certainly the predominant if you will scenario on how the fourth comes in.","On the view of 2017 which I'll come back to you in moment, again, I know you \u2013 and you said it I think, you did listen to my answer on IP, but this is not a onetime thing, right again, IBM has had as much as $1.07 billion of IP in our income statement, it is one of ways we monetize all of our intellectual property, it\u2019s only one, right, we also obviously sell a lot too, but we license their IP is part of our business model. I don't think about it is one-time. We're going to continue to drive this and hopefully grow it. We've got a reasonable pull in the fourth of clients and partners who want to license our technology, so you shouldn't think of it is one-time at all.","Now, as we go into 2017, with our big transactional quarter coming up obviously and 90 days we'll talk about what we saw in the environment and what that position us for 2017, but I do think we know, we know a few things as we head into next year already today, so we know for instance we've got good momentum in our strategic imperatives and we continue to see with our investments and our view of the market, how that resonates with clients and I think we would expect to continue to see good strategic imperatives performance which also by the way will drive some investments but keep in mind that with everything we got done this year, the bulk of the spending, the bulk of the investment dollars we freed up next year, that's a much bigger number next year, so we have a freedom and an ability to invest more heavily given what we've got and done so far this year. So that's one thing we know.","Secondly, we're seeing good sign ins and backlog performance in our GTS business, that was sign-ins and backlog up again and within that GTS business, the biggest part of that our infrastructure services business which drives by the way that backlog also expanded margins in the quarter, so that's a big deal for us obviously. We also saw expanding margins in our \u2013 in parts of our GBS business and our application management business, again as we drive productivity. So, we know again good performance and momentum in strategic imperatives.","We have good sign-ins and backlog growth in our GTS business with margin expansion in some of services businesses. And then at this point we'll see where currency winds up in the next 75 days. At this point, it\u2019s kind of neutral shift you will, it certainly not the billion plus impact we took this year as we wrapped on all the hedging from last year, so its far more neutral next year. Now, at the same time as you said we don't another tax case that we're going to close next year, but at the same time most of that was reinvested if you will or consumes elsewhere, it didn't show up on the bottom line.","So, yet too soon to tell, we'll get through the fourth, we'll talk about the 90 days when we see, but there is some -- there's momentum here in parts of this business that we'll be spending more time on.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Wamsi. Can we please take the next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.","David Grossman","Thank you. So, Martin, if we look at organic growth rate of the imperatives, it looks like that began decelerating in the fourth quarter of last year and through the second quarter of this year. And then they looks at least, if my math right, they bounce back this quarter, and you did a good job of telegraphing that last year's growth was not sustainable. That said, the number are seems to be a little bit more volatile than expected. Is there any way you can help us parse this disclosure and just help us better understand what drove the deceleration and then what drove the subsequent rebound this quarter?","Martin Schroeter","Sure. I think the best thing to do, David, is to look at all of this on a trailing 12 months basis. You know, we recently started giving this on a quarterly basis. It\u2019s a good disclosure and the sense that everyone ask for it and we try to provide the components of our strategic imperatives within each of our new segments. And I think in general people appreciated having that level of detail, but to your point, if you're looking for my advice and how best to interpret this I had interpreted on a 12 months trailing basis.","Our clients aren't making big, big investment decisions like who do I trust with my data and what cloud am I going to move on to? That's a decision that is going to last much longer than say, a 90 day reporting cycle. So, in any given reporting cycle there will be volatility. My advice look at it on a trailing 12 months basis and you can see the trend.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, David. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman with BMO. Your line is open.","Keith Bachman","Hi. Thank you very much. I also want to ask about cognitive solutions, you mentioned that the rollout of SAS if you will or software service is impacting the margins, yet you had still a very small part of the total, it's perhaps 100% of the current revenue base. As that ramp what that continue to place pressure on your margin structure? Or to say it different way, could you characterize that we look at 2017 would margins and cognitive solutions be at a minimum flattish. How are you thinking about that? And one clarification also just, did you mentioned what the total revenues in organic sources were or was M&A about two points I hope this quarter as well?","Martin Schroeter","Yes. So in total Keith, our acquisitions contributed about two points a growth, same as second quarter.","Keith Bachman","Okay. Yes.","Martin Schroeter","So, on our cognitive solutions and our margins, so first keep in mind, this is our highest margin business, it is primarily software and within that it's got very heavy high value content in the on-premise category if you will, right. And so these margins which are very high, we want to and we're moving some of this business and investing in the as-a-service, so as that moves into the margin profile, the cognitive solutions could it see a little bit of margin pressure over the long term. Yes, but it\u2019s coming from a very, very high base.","And as-a-service component that's going in, it still better margin than all of the other segments in general. So, yes, the as-a-service component of cognitive solutions may have a bit of an impact just on that segment but overall it will still help IBM and again this is a very, very high margin segment at north of 80% here so. ","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Keith. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James [Indiscernible] with SPE [ph]. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much. And Martin thanks for the explanation about the additional investments you're doing that impacts gross margin. Can you help us understand incrementally going forward, so not say, year-over-year but kind of incrementally going forward, the efforts you been doing kind of this year. Should we expect the same type or incrementally do you feel like you're going to have to incrementally do more investments forward or just kind of at this level? Thank you very much.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Jim. I'd say that given, yes, we'll continue to invest. Do I think the rate of growth of investment has to continue? Well, the short answer is it may, but again remember how much we got done this year in terms of making room in the overall IBM equation and the productivity we are driving in parts of our services businesses, I know that we are seeing margin expansion in some of those.","So yes, we will continue to invest and infact I think that some of these markets require this level or the markets require this level of investment in order to be at the leading edge with our clients, but we do make a lot more room if you will in the overall IBM equation given everything we got done this year. And we\u2019ll spend more time in 90 days on how all of that plays out for 2017, but again we made a lot of room for investments for ourselves for next year.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. Can we please take one last question?","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks. [Indiscernible] I\u2019ll keep to one clarification and one question up. I guess you know the question really is when I look at your free cash flow usage over the last four quarters; it\u2019s been you know more skewed towards acquisition versus what one would have thought in the past. As you look at 2017, do you think it optimizes more i.e. buybacks to be much more than you know the $1billion run rate you guys are running at and acquisitions could be small, just help us on this on the mix as you go forward. And then just to clarify when you talk about 90% to 100% conversion of net income to free cash flow in 2017 is that of a GAAP or non-GAAP number?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, sure I\u2019ll do the clarification first Amit. So that\u2019s our GAAP net income realization. We\u2019ve just kept it consistent in terms of GAAP net income. It was the most straightforward for we think for everyone to understand. So the free cash flow realization data is GAAP net income.","On how free cash flow, skews next year and the application of our capital, I\u2019d say first you know you can be assured that we are going to put all of our money to work as we have. We don\u2019t tend to -- we don\u2019t keep capital here to the extent its excess, after we\u2019ve invested in organically and after we\u2019ve purchased what we think we need through acquisitions and after we\u2019ve paid the dividend we do return capital to shareholders.","Over the long term in the form of share repurchase, we over the long term as we said now pretty consistently, we think over the long term we can reduce our share count by 2% to 3% and that obviously recognizes that we will continue to be acquisitive. So, I would say that Amit what -- again we\u2019ll talk more about what we have assumed when we get to 2017 but we will absolutely continue to invest organically, we\u2019ll absolutely continue to be acquisitive. We\u2019ll absolutely continue to grow the dividend and then to the extent that we have access capital to return we will return it on over the long term that number from a share repurchase would be a 2% to 3% reduction.","So, let me conclude, let me conclude by reminding you that we are running a highly differentiated play here. We are building obviously cognitive capabilities well beyond what others are doing with individual AI services if you will and we are building the platforms to help deliver that and we are making all of that available on another platform, the IBM cloud.","And it came up as you heard on the call, will Watson run on someone else\u2019s cloud? No, it won\u2019t, it will run on the IBM cloud. And we are doing all of that with deep industry expertise and that\u2019s what our clients are looking for, that cognitive capability on the IBM cloud with deep industry expertise and you can see that in our health, you can see that in our IoT and you can see now in financial services which we just announced a couple of weeks ago.","So we are very excited about what we are doing and we are very excited about the businesses we are building and of course we are very excited with the help and what are allowing and enabling our clients to become which is cognitive businesses. So as we do that, we\u2019ll continue to be deeply embedded in the fabric of how they run their businesses and the most important work they do. They trust us with their data, they trust us to be their partner and becoming cognitive businesses and quite frankly that\u2019s how we make sure that we are successful over the long term. So thank you for joining our call today.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Sam. Can I turn it back to you to close up the call?","Operator","Thank you for participating on today\u2019s call.

Ma'am, you may begin.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM. I'm here today with Martin Schroeter, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter earnings presentation. The prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.","I'll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM Web site or from us in Investor Relations.","Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You will find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Martin Schroeter.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks, Patricia. In the second quarter, we delivered 20.8 billion of revenue and operating EPS of $3.84. With that, our revenue for the first half was over $40 billion. Operating net income was 6.7 billion and operating EPS was $6.75. Our revenue was down less than 1% in the quarter and essentially flat for the first half excluding the impact of currency and the divested businesses. Our overall revenue performance includes the continued translation impact from a strong dollar and the impact of divested businesses. Together, these reduced our reported revenue growth by 12 to 13 points, both for the quarter and the half.","I will focus on our revenue performance excluding the impact of currency and divestitures for the balance of the presentation.","Let me give you a quick overview of different parts of our business. Revenue in our strategic imperatives, those that address the market trends in data, cloud and engagement is again up more than 30% in the second quarter and so up over 30% for the first half. This is an acceleration from roughly 20% growth last year. As we\u2019ve said before, we are able to grow at a rate significantly faster than the market because of the industry perspective and deep insight we have from working with our clients on their core businesses to help move them to the strategic areas. We are clearing seeing this in analytics where our revenue is up more than 20% in the first half, well above market rates. This is terrific growth on a large revenue base. Recall we generated $17 billion of analytics revenue last year. The growth is led by GBS and by systems hardware, reflecting the new z13 and POWER8 systems where they specifically address analytics workloads. And we are developing new markets with the advanced cognitive capabilities of Watson.","Our cloud revenue was up over 70% year-to-year in the first half. And over the last 12 months, our cloud revenue was $8.7 billion. We had strong growth in both our private foundations revenue and our as a service offering, and we exited the second quarter with an annual as a service run rate of $4.5 billion. Our cloud business is substantial and growing rapidly. The market continues to evolve beyond pure infrastructure towards higher value process, data and analytics as a service engagements. In the same way the Internet evolved from browsing to a full transactional business platform.","Our clients are finding value in the combination of public, private and hybrid implementations we're able to provide. Our security business was up 10% for the half, social more than 40% while our mobile business quadrupled. From a segment perspective, we saw an increase in demand in our services business with 22 deals over a $100 million this quarter the highest number in over two years, this contributed to a backlog that is up year-to-year for the first time since the end of 2013 which is certainly an encouraging data point.","In our systems business, we have been delivering innovations and repositioning the portfolio and this quarter we again had solid revenue in profit performance. Our System z revenue was up about 50% year-to-date and the z13 performance is in line with previous cycles.","Power grew in the first and second quarters led by strong growth in scale out systems which were capturing both the Unix and Linux opportunity and return to growth in the high end this quarter. Then there were parts of the business that are impacting our second quarter performance but the transformation will pay off over the longer term. Parts of our services business aren't delivering sufficient productivity in the base to fund the investments we're making and to offset the impact of currency.","Now we'll get return on the investments over time but it\u2019s impacting profit growth now. We're making the shift in our offerings as evidenced by our signings and backlog growth, but we need to drive more productivity to improve the profit profile. And some of the geographic regions specifically the BRIC countries are impacting our overall performance. I will expand on that when we discuss the geo performance.","Our first half performance also reflects major portfolio actions we've taken to continue to shift to higher value. Late last year we sold our x86 business; you can see the benefit in our 50 basis point improvement in gross margin and we recently completed the divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing business while we continue to focus on advanced semiconductor research. In fact just two weeks ago we announced that an IBM Research led alliance produced the industry's first 7 nanometer chip, another milestone in our contributions to semiconductor innovation. At the same time, we're making significant investments in our strategic imperatives. For example we've created Watson healthcare, we're continuing to build out cloud data centers and we've launched important new partnerships in analytics, mobile, social and cloud.","So to sum it up, our second quarter and first half results are a reflection of the transformation in our business as we move to where we see the longer term value in enterprise IT. The actions and investments are delivering strong growth in our strategic imperatives and continued innovation across our portfolio and we're able to drive overall margin improvement on a fairly stable revenue base. I will move onto the financial metrics but first let me remind you some of the items we've mentioned in our call back in April. We said we grow out pretax income by $1 billion quarter-to-quarter. We said that we'd have more work-force rebalancing than last year and we said we'd have lower gains in our I&E since last year we had gain associated with the sale of our customer care business, and we expect that the stronger dollar would continue to have a significant impact to our revenue and profit. As always we've included a view of the currency translation impact to our revenue in a chart in the back up and you will see that at current spot rates its impact continues to be substantial.","Now turning to the results for the quarter, we delivered 4.6 billion of operating PTI which is up $1 billion from the first quarter. The year-to-year performance in PTI reflects the impact of currency, higher levels of investment and higher workforce rebalancing than last year although the workforce rebalancing charge wasn't as large as we had initially expected. We also had lower divestiture gains year-to-year. Looking at our margins, we had a 20 basis point improvement in gross margin driven by our portfolio actions and a relative performance of System z. Our pretax and net margins benefited from the shift to the higher value as well but they also reflect the dynamics I just mentioned in investments workforce rebalancing and gains which impacted expense.","Our ongoing effective tax rate remains at 20% but we did benefit from a few discrete items. On the bottom line, we reported operating EPS of $3.84. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter which is up 400 million from last year. Over the last 12 months, we've generated $13.2 billion of free cash flow though our realization of GAAP net income is in the high 80s. Over the last 12 months, we've reduced our share count by over 2% and increased our dividend returning about two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders.","Now turning to the revenue by geography in total our performance in the major markets was consistent with last quarter while the growth markets decelerated driven by the BRIC countries. To put it in perspective, the BRICs impacted IBM's overall revenue growth rate by 2 points in the second quarter or said another way our revenue excluding the BRICs would have been up 1%. So let me start there, within the BRICS only India had modest growth building on improved operational performance and services. The other three countries were down at a double-digit rate. Brazil was down 16% though our revenue in Brazil last year was up over 20%, so was a very tough compare. The volatility of our results in Russia continued and our revenue in China was down 25% with fewer large transactions in the quarter.","Outside of the BRICs many countries improved their performance sequentially in fact outside of the BRICS our growth markets revenue was up 5%, a 4 point improvement from last quarter. Looking at the major markets, revenue was flat year-to-year. The year-to-year performance in many of the major market countries also improved sequentially including Canada, Germany, Italy, France and Japan. Two of our largest countries Japan and Germany posted the strongest growth. In the U.S. overall revenue was down low single-digit but we once again had good Systems z performance and we've signed substantial new services business.","Turning to the segment perspective, our total revenue was down less than 1% and gross margin improved 20 basis points. I'll spend more time on the revenue and profit drivers in the segment discussions. But let me just make a couple of top level comments, revenue in three of our five segments grew this quarter including our largest segment GTS. This quarter systems hardware posted solid growth with double-digit growth in Z and mid single-digit growth in Power and our Global Financing revenue was up driven by equipment sales and the other two segments GBS and Software our year-to-year performance was fairly consistent with the last few quarters. Our total margin improvement was driven by a shift to higher value. Remember the last quarter, the shift was driven but portfolio actions and the relative strength of System Z.","The reported operating expense and other income is down 9% to this level of spend our expense to revenue ratio was up a 0.5 year-to-year. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past within our large operational expense base we\u2019ve got a shift going on, driving productivity in some areas while significantly increasing our investment in the strategic imperatives. This investment is to build capabilities much of which will be consumed as the service in areas like Watson, Watson Health and Bluemix. And so we\u2019ll see the benefits over the longer term.","The reported decline in expense this quarter is again driven by currency and the divestiture System x. This quarter we also had a higher level of workforce rebalancing and lower divestiture gains, I\u2019ll comment on each. 11 points of the decline was driven by currency between the translation of non-dollar spending and the hedging gains that reported another income in SG&A. Two points of the decline are due to the fact that we no longer have the expense of the System x business in our run rate. And this quarter we took a charge of nearly $200 million for workforce rebalancing, nearly all of which is an increase year-to-year, this drove expense higher by three points. And then divestiture gains were down a 100 million year-to-year driven by last year\u2019s gain associated with the sale of our customer care business, just added about 0.5 to expense growth.","Now let's turn to the segments and we\u2019ll start with Services. Combined service revenue was $12.4 billion, with the year-to-year revenue trajectory a little better than in the first quarter. We closed 22 deals greater than $100 million balance between renewals and new scope or clients. This is the third consecutive quarter signings growth and with it our total backlog was up more than 1% year-to-year. Global Technology Services revenue of 8.1 billion was up 1% with growth in all three lines of business. This is a two point improvement from the first quarter year-to-year performance driven by combination of revenue from backlog in period revenue.","GTS outsourcing return to growth, improving three points sequentially due to several large deals signed last year that are now completing transition. We\u2019re seeing good traction in the contracts that combine traditional IT outsourcing with the integration of mobility, hybrid cloud and analytics workloads. Integrated technology services also return to growth this quarter with strong performance in our cloud, security and business resiliency services.","Growth in SoftLayer accelerated as we\u2019ve significantly increased capacity in new data centers since the beginning of last year and we\u2019re now 41 cloud data centers on five continents. Maintenance grew 2% driven by growth in our multi vendor support services. This is our hardware maintenance offering for third-party platforms which leverages our global distribution and inventory capabilities. Our pre-tax profit in GTS was down, let me spend a minute on this. Currency drove the largest year-to-year impact given the strengthening dollar. We continue to generate significant profits in cash flow in local currencies, but the translation of those currencies back to U.S. dollars significantly effects our reported profit growth.","The divestiture of the System x business impacted our maintenance profit and margin and we took the workforce rebalancing charge in the quarter essentially all of which resulted in the year-to-year impact. We continue to invest for growth for in our strategic imperatives offering such as bringing additional SoftLayer capacity online and increasing our security and mobility go-to-market skills. We\u2019re also opening new resiliency data centers and expanding our global delivery capabilities.","As you would expect, we look to productivity as a way to fund our investments, we didn\u2019t drive that productivity this quarter as we\u2019re always balancing the timing of our transformation with the dynamics of running our clients most critical processes. Global Business Services revenue was 4.3 billion, down 3%. Revenue declined in the practices focused on traditional back office implementations. Customers are migrating away from large ERP projects toward smaller initiatives with cloud, mobility and analytics as their main focus, which was often contracted in and as of service model. We\u2019ve been shifting skills and work from these declining practices to the new opportunity areas, we've had strong growth rates in our strategic imperatives, but we need to shift more aggressively to improve our overall GBS business results. We\u2019re also seeing that long-term application management is becoming more important to enterprise clients as the IT environment grows more complex. Clients are integrating public and private cloud networks; deploy new mobile capabilities into their employ and customer base and deploying analytics around these solutions.","These ongoing changes in clients needs drive both shorter term systems integration as well as long-term management requirements and performance improved across our application management services in the second quarter. Looking at GBS profit, there were few drives of the decline. The largest impact was from the customer care divestiture which drove nine points of the year-to-year decline in profit, due to the sizeable gain in last year\u2019s results. Also we increased the level of investments to further enable our partnerships and we hired a rescaled additional go-to-market and delivery practitioner resources for our fast growing strategic imperative offerings.","For example, we've hired over 2,000 incremental resources into our mobility practices and shifted almost 1,000 to analytics projects. The remaining profit decline was driven by the lower revenue on what is a relatively fixed cost base in the short-term. We remain focused on our cost competitiveness through alternate labor models, more aggressively shifting resources to higher value offerings and enhancing our global delivery capabilities. Our software revenue of 5.8 billion was down 3% with that our first half revenue was down 2% which is consistent with the performance in the second half of last year. Key branded middleware was flat but total software performance reflects the headwind from operating systems and other middleware.","Profit performance in software is a reflection of the overall revenue performance, a higher level of investments in areas like Watson and Bluemix and an impacting currency translation. We had growth across the solution areas including security, commerce and social and within that we saw strong growth in our Software-as-a-Service offering. As security software revenue returned to double-digit growth. Our security solutions bring together intelligence, integration and expertise that are essential in the world of advanced threat. As an example, one of the top 10 global energy firms was looking for an analytics based approach to protect tens of thousands of systems and devices globally from advanced threats.","IBM brought together a security solutions and services expertise to establish a security operation center to monitor billions of logs and events on a daily basis. This intelligent approach to threat management has allowed them to focus their resources on only the handful of high priority threats that want further investigation. And another of our solution areas our commerce software grew. Our commerce solutions are allowing client to get unique insights about their customers. Nine of the top 10 U.S. retailers and each of the top 10 global banks run an IBM\u2019s commerce solutions. IBM commerce now powers 30,000 organizations globally. Our social solutions again grew double-digits driven by strong performance in both Kenexa and advanced collaboration offerings.","We\u2019re continuing to bring innovations to our solutions areas and deepen our industry focus. Watson as an example where we\u2019re creating a market around cognitive computing and building an as a service business. Last quarter I talked about expanding the Watson ecosystem, this quarter I want to focus on another aspect of our progress. Watson\u2019s being deployed across nearly 30 countries and in 20 industries. We are currently working on 100s of projects to expand industry domain knowledge as well as teaching the system new languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and Arabic. We continue to expand Watson\u2019s reach by forging additional partnerships and just last week we announced a formation of a joint venture with Mubadala to bring IBM Watson to the Middle East and North Africa with focus on healthcare, retail, education, banking and finance. Our focus in software continues to be innovation, partnership and aligning to the needs of our customers in the industries in which they operate.","Turning to our systems hardware segment. Revenue of 2.1 billion was up 5% and pretax income was up 26%. These results are reflection of both our ability to continue to deliver innovation across our high end systems and the significant actions we\u2019ve taken. This quarter\u2019s Z Systems revenue was up 15% and through the first half we grew about 50%. Power revenue grew 5% this quarter. We saw growth in both the low end and the high end where we\u2019ve introduced new POWER8 based systems. The capabilities of both mainframe and power systems are resonating well with our customers and we continue to add new customers to the platforms.","During our investor briefing earlier this year I talked about the mission critical nature and expansion of banking transactions that our mainframe supports. Our Z System offers the most secure, reliable and scalable platform with the best price performance. So when a leading managed service provider in Europe was looking to create a cloud platform for independent software vendors serving financial services clients they opted from mainframe. This is another new IBM mainframe customer.","In that same Investor Day presentation, we talked about the explosion of data and transaction volumes in the telecommunications industry. So when a leading telco solutions provider in China was looking to offer a customer experience solutions to its global clients it selected power on Linux over X86. The power platform provides both higher capacity and better performance on X86, allowing them to incrementally scale out their solution.","Our open power strategy continues to take hold globally. In June, the UK government joined the United States as the second major government to turn to open power for its high performance computing priorities. The UK government will utilize IBM\u2019s latest open power high performance computing and Watson based cognitive technologies to obtain valuable insights from a variety of data sources to boost productivity and drive growth. This is a similar class of IBM open power system that the United States Department of Energy selected for the Lawrence Livermore Oak Ridge National Laboratories. I believe our power results through the first half show that the power strategy is working.","Our storage hardware revenue was down 4%. We again saw strong growth in our flash system with our new generation offerings introduced in the first half. This growth was once again offset by the wind down of our OEM business and continued weakness in high end disk. Our systems hardware segment revenue growth and profitability improvement is a clear result of the actions we\u2019ve taken to position our systems business for the future.","Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow which is up 400 million year-to-year. Of course this is after nearly $1 billion spend in CapEx consistent with last quarter and with last year. Through the first half, our free cash flow of $4.5 billion is up over 800 million year-to-year. The primary drivers were lower cash tax payments and an improvement in our sales cycle working capital. This was partially offset by the remaining working capital impact to cash flow from our system x divestiture payments for performance based compensation which were accrued last year and operational performance. As you know our annual free cash flow generation is skewed to the end of the year, and our first half results are in line with that skew. Do remember we said that we'd improve our free cash flow realization from 2014 to 2015 and earlier this year we expected realization in the mid to high 80s we now expect the full year to be about 90% but even at the low end of the profit guidance this reflects a modest year-to-year improvement and free cash flow for the year.","Looking at uses of cash we spent 700 million on acquisitions. We've acquired five companies in the first half. These add to our capabilities and cloud and analytics and deepen our industry domain expertise to further differentiate our solutions. For example the two acquisitions made by Watson Health strengthen IBM's leadership and healthcare analytics and to support our effort to apply cogon of computing to drive healthier patient outcomes.","In the last six months we've returned to $4.7 billion to shareholders, this includes 2.4 billion in dividends and 2.3 in gross share repurchases the buyback over 14 million shares. At the end of June we had 987 million shares outstanding and $3.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.8 billion, up 300 million from December, but down from a year ago. Total debt was $38.7 billion, of which just over $26 billion was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7:1.","Our non-financing debt of $12.6 billion is down $4.5 billion from a year ago. Our non-financing debt-to-cap was 55% which is down four points from December and almost a point lower than a year ago. We continue to be well positioned to support our long-term growth strategy. But now let me wrap it up and talk about our expectations for the full year. It's been us move aggressively and decisively to reshape our business to best address the long term value in IT. We've been shifting investments in resources building partnerships and ecosystems and introducing key innovations. Since the beginning of the second quarter we launched Watson Health acquiring Phytel and Explorys and partnering with the other leading healthcare companies. We finalized the divestiture of our semi-conductor manufacturing business to global foundries while we introduce the breakthrough in seven nanometer technology.","We announced that we had embedded spark into our analytics and commerce platforms and formed an innovative new cloud partnership with Box.","Each one of these actions contributes to our transformation and improves our hand for the long-term. So let's talk about what it means for 2015. In the first half our revenue in the strategic imperatives grew more than 30%. Those markets were also growing, but with our performance we're clearly gaining share. The core portfolio continued to decline in a declining market. So together the strategic imperatives and core delivered revenue at an IBM level that was roughly flat. But for the full year we continue to expect to deliver operating EPS of $15.75 to $16.50 and even at the low end of the range we now expect the modest year-to-year improvement and free cash flow for the year. We said from the beginning of the year the primary variable between the high end and low end of the guidance is our software revenue trajectory. From a margin perspective for the full year, we continue to expect to expand margin driven by portfolio actions. We also said we'll continue a high level of investment and we'll continue to return value to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends.","For the third quarter if you look back over the last few years we typically see about a billion dollar decrease in revenue from second quarter to third quarter. There is no reason to think this year will be different than our typical seasonality so with the billion dollars last quarter-to-quarter third quarter revenue would be about the same size as the first quarter. Now what is different is the mix of business relative to what we've seen historically. But even with that will continue to expand margin in the third quarter driven by our portfolio actions. When you look at some of the other dynamics and the third form a year-to-year perspective currency impact investments, workforce rebalancing, the third quarter profit trajectory looks a lot like the second. Now there are some differences like we don\u2019t have a gain in last year's third quarter results but on balance the year-to-year profit would be pretty similar to 2Q. This is true for the EPS trajectory as well.","Through the first half relative to the low end of our guidance we are at the same point as last year, and ahead of the year before. In the third quarter given the profit trajectory I just described we expect to finish the third quarter with 63% to 64% of our low end EPS guidance achieved consistent with prior years. And then where we finish within the range for the full year really depends primarily on whether we have a change in trajectory and our software business. Importantly as we progress in our transformation we\u2019ll exit the year a higher-value business.","Now Patricia and I will take your questions","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.","Operator, can you please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Toni Sacconaghi","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about software, the business was down 3% at constant currency, I think other than the financial crisis in '09 that's the lowest software growth rate in the last 15 years. You also had a significant pressure, accompanying pressure on margins. And I am wondering if you can kind of step back. At the beginning of the year you were hoping for an improvement and talking about the guidance, it looked like perhaps you are not as confident, you were saying we could end up at the low end of the range if we don\u2019t improve, maybe we'll do better than that if we do improve.","But I am wondering if you can kind of step back now that you are half way through the year. The results seem to suggest that there is something structural impacting your software business. Now whether that\u2019s the decline that we've seen in UNIX over the last couple of years or whether it's the migration to as a service, there seems to be an inflection point over the last four quarters in your software business for the worst. And I am wondering if you can step back and tell us if you agree with that and what you think is driving this and do you have confidence like the same level of confidence as you did six months ago that the software business will improve throughout the year?","Martin Schroeter","A few comments I think on software and some of these themes are going to be consistent with what we've talked about and then some of them will be I guess observations and we go through the year. So relative to, first relative to guidance as we said since the beginning, the difference, the primary difference in our guidance range for the year is driven by the trajectory of software. And so when we went through in the prepared remarks and pegged third quarter to the low end I wasn\u2019t suggesting that we don\u2019t see that difference still, in fact we do still see software driving the difference between the low and the high end but we do have to when you have a range you do have to pick one side to anchor your analysis. So we chose in this case to anchor to the low side.","With regard to software there are some consistent themes here that we've been observing now for a while. We do still have in our overall growth rate a headwind from the operating system element of our business, so it was about a point. Additionally, what we saw in the BRIC countries' impact on IBM and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks even though the BRICs are relatively small, only about 7% of our revenue, they had a two point impact on the growth. That same phenomena translated into key branded middleware.","So ex the BRICs our key branded middleware segment, software segment would have had 2 points of growth as well. So when we look underneath that I think the consistency here is that we have two phenomena. Within our top 250 clients and we've talked about the substantial both investment and commitment those clients made to the software platform, within that client base we continue to offer and they continue to utilize flexibility so that they can fully deploy middleware across their environments. And that phenomena hasn\u2019t changed.","Now outside of that top 250 clients we do see growth. We have seen growth, we have been growing there and we continue to grow. So it really is this flexibility that we are providing to our clients which we still think for the long-term as the right thing to do as they commit to the platform.","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMC. You may ask your question.","Tien-tsin Huang","Just on the strategic imperatives I guess up 30% again, so up 30% I guess for the first half. I am curious if that growth rate is sustainable into the second half. Martin I know you suggested it could come down to the 20% level of last year, but checking to see if that's still the case for the second half of the year?","Martin Schroeter","So it was quite a good acceleration as we mentioned in the last call from the fourth into the first and as you note and as we just talked about in our prepared remarks, we were able to maintain that trajectory into the second quarter. So we finished first half in a very strong position in strategic imperatives. And given our growth rates and where we think that market growth rate is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think we're growing share across that space as well. When we look forward in those strategic imperatives and we look forward at the overall revenue trajectory of IBM, we don\u2019t have assumed, we have not assumed a dramatic improvement if you will in the overall revenue trajectory at the low end of our guidance. At the high end obviously as we just talked about in the last question and in prepared remarks, the high end we assume an improvement in the software trajectory, some of which will be in the strategic imperatives obviously. In fact the weighting of our software business and strategic imperatives is larger than the overall business. So I would expect that we would see an improvement in that. But again our current guidance at the low end does not assume a dramatic improvement in the overall revenue trajectory. And so within that the mix between the strategic imperatives again which has a lot of momentum versus the core, we're not suggesting that we have to grow or we have to change the trajectory at the low end.","Patricia Murphy","Christine, can we take the next question please?","Operator","Next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. You may ask your question.","David Grossman","Last quarter Martin we discussed cash taxes as a tailwind this year but offset by other headwinds. And then as of April it appeared the cash taxes would be actually free cash flow headwind in 2016. Is that still the case and if so are there known tailwinds next year that would offset that and allow the free cash flow conversion rate to remain in that 90% plus range that you've talked about for this year.","Martin Schroeter","A few things, so and there are a number of metrics here I want to make sure that we triangulate to the right answer and that we don't confuse or we don't mix some of the data points, so cash taxes as you know last year were substantial year-over-year headwind and this year they're not a year-to-year headwind and the amount of cash tax tailwind that we're getting this year is the same as we thought it was going to be at the beginning there, so no change to that.","Now let's switch for a second to the realization metrics, so cash taxes were about a 10-point headwind to realization to last year, very dramatic headwind to our realization. This year they're still a headwind although much reduced, so the realization impact is only about a point or two, so when you think about the relationship of what's going on our cash tax rate will still be a little hit higher than our book rate although not as high as it was last year. So this year cash taxes will be a little bit higher than the book rates so there still a realization impact but there is a year-to-year tailwind in terms of payments.","Now next year we still have a lot of work to do and a lot of planning to do and while we have a small headwind in realization this year, we do see a headwind in realization next year and how that translates to a year-to-year I think we have to spend the next six months trying to figure that out and then we'll have more guidance in January for you, but again there are different elements here. So from the realization cash taxes are still a headwind this year although smaller than last year and next year we expect them to be a headwind but we'll have to translate as we get closer and to what that means on a year-to-year base for 2016, but as we just mentioned in our prepared remarks we do see now a modest improvement in free cash flow for this year.","Patricia Murphy","Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. You may ask your question.","Lou Miscioscia","So can we step a back to the services side in the sense that consulting system integration was weak again and you had talked about having to shift some of your resources maybe you can go in and say the cloud or ERP deployments are going down or being replaced by SaaS developments maybe you're not winning as many products they're giving that others are growing actually consulting pretty well here in beginning of 2015?","Martin Schroeter","So a few things, our GBS and when we talk about consulting systems integration, I'll just focus the answer on our global business services segment. GBS was as you noted down again in the quarter although quarter-to-quarter we had about 1 point improvement in the trajectory still down but a bit better than the first and the dynamics within that I think are similar to what we saw in the first which is the shift that we're undertaking and what you've noted in your question, the shift that we're undertaking is pretty dramatic and we're seeing very strong double-digit revenue growth within the strategic imperatives within the GBS business alone.","Now that we also have a pretty substantial -- think about it as a traditional ERP implementation kind of consulting business and the net of the shift to the shift of those strategic imperatives and obviously the reduction in our resources applied to those larger implementations the engineered shift is not yet at the point where the revenue growth coming from those imperative is offsetting if you will our reduction in those the areas that address those traditional ERP. So the course is still the largest part of the portfolio that was traditional parts of ERP implementations and while we engineer that shift we're going to see declines in that part of the business, but as I mentioned that shift is driving growth in the strategic imperatives we just have to continue to be as fast as we can to get those areas so we can see growth overall for the GBS business.","Patricia Murphy","Could we take the next question please, Christine?","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steve Milunovich","A couple of non-operating items, Martin, last quarter you suggested currency could hit EPS about $0.80 for the year I was curious if that's still the number and it looks like your expectations for the next few quarters on currency at similar to a little worse than in the April quarter and I am little surprise given the move in the Euro than also was curious about the 17% tax rate, should we carry that forward does that go back to 20?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, thanks, Steve. Few things so first on tax, we'll start at the back on tax. So we still see a 20% rate for IBM that's the right operating rate if you will for us, we did have as I noted in the call a couple of discrete items in the quarter but those were discretes in the quarter. Now we do have discrete throughout the year but 20% is the right number for tax.","On currency impacts, I'll come back to earnings in a moment the first part of the question, currency impact is now a little bit worse for the year relative to what we expected just 90 days ago. So you may remember we include as we always do we include a supplemental chart on the impact of currency and we had on that chart in April that the third quarter would be about an 8-point impact and the fourth quarter would be about 5 year-to-year and now we see 8 to 9 and 5 to 6 in terms of the currency impact and that data again is in the supplemental chart. And so we are seeing an increased -- a slight increased currency impact for the second half of the year.","Now our view of currency and its impact on profit is and can be, as you would imagine the translation impact can be quiet substantial. So we did say that the impact to earnings would be about $0.80 for the year and we still see, while it's gotten a little bit worse we still think that\u2019s probably little bit worse as well, but we can hold that within the guidance we\u2019ve given. So, yes the impact to EPS is probably a little bit worse than what we had assumed. We do have actions underway to try to navigate through whatever currency environment we\u2019re in, but the year-to-year impact is still fairly substantial in our guidance.","Now of notes -- of note is that the guidance as you know reflects a EPS of flat to downsize and the currency impact is five points, roughly in terms of earnings. So if we were in benign currency environment, we\u2019ll discard the idea of it being an actual tailwind at some point. But if we were in a benign currency environment, our guidance would reflect flat to up five and that\u2019s the kind of impact I think that you would expect to see in a company that has more than 60% of its revenues, and cash flows and profits, dramatic part of this profits operating in currencies other than the dollar.","So the short answers to your questions tax 20 is still the right thing in terms of operating, the currency impact is a little worse than what we assumed from 90 days ago and it is a dramatic year-to-year impact on our profitability.","Patricia Murphy","Let's go to the next question please Christine.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Brian White","Martin it sounds like services you got from bigger deals in the quarter, minor services in aggregate beat our number. When can we start to see margins improve back to levels that we saw two, three years ago in the services business?","Martin Schroeter","Yes, we did see as you saw a very strong signings quarter which as we noted in the prepared remarks drove our backlog to 1%, ex-currency is the first time we\u2019ve had backlog both in a couple of year. So obviously very encouraging to get the services backlog growing, so we can start to see a more consistent delivery of revenue growth. Obviously within that revenue growth in that business does drive profit leverage, but keep in mind that we continue to invest quite heavily as well in order to make sure we\u2019re building the right cloud platforms, the right skills around that services business.","So while the single largest impact year-to-year and our services profitability not on margins, but services profitability is the translation of those profits back to dollars given the dollar strength. We do see an opportunity to continue to invest quite heavily in our services business. We do see opportunities to continue to move not only the GTS business, but the GBS business to higher value and over time that will drive margin improvements.","But for now, we\u2019re not relying on margin improvements in our guidance for this year. But again the single largest impact on a year-to-year basis is currency. So as we continue to invest while that revenue grow -- if we were to grow we continue to grow revenue in GTS for instance that will drive some leverage in the profit model, we\u2019re going to continue to invest pretty heavily going forward.","Patricia Murphy","Can we take the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.","Keith Bachman","Martin, I want to follow-up on that last point, I understand currency impact on the Services segment. But as you look out beyond the next quarter or two. Won't you need to A: continue to invest in these businesses on both GBS and GTS? And B: as you make that adjustment to the higher growth areas is there a mix impact that will continue to weigh in on margins even as you look out a bit further than the near-term quarter. So both the investment side and the mix side as you think about both sides of services please?","Martin Schroeter","So couple of things Keith; first, we will continue to invest. So let's assume we\u2019ll get through at some point, the year-to-year impact of currency and we\u2019ll just take currency out of the equation for a second. When we look at our model, we see a few elements that will continue to drive profit growth within services while at the same time continuing to invest. So first we will continue to drive capacity utilization into our cloud business, so remember we\u2019re investing pretty heavily in cloud and I would say that those businesses are not yet at scale. So as we get those and utilize that capacity and get to scale then we\u2019ll see margin improvements in the services business. Secondly we continue to shift that overall portfolio to the most contemporary highest value offerings that our clients are demanding and I think you can see that both in the signings we had for instance in our services business and the backlog growth you can see it and the strategic imperative performance within GBS.","So we continue to shift those offerings to higher value. And then underpinning that the delivery side of this, the delivery elements of this including much broader deployment of intellectual property leveraging our software and research ability to put automation into our delivery content. So, we do still see opportunities to keep a balance between we\u2019ll keep investing but we\u2019ll also be able to drive a more efficient delivery platform as we go through -- as we get out of this currency environment.","And then finally, I think it\u2019s important to note that while we do make use pretty heavy use in some countries like the U.S. we have a pretty good global delivery platform within the U.S. that\u2019s not the same everywhere in the world. So, in some regions in the world our use of global delivery is still under 30%, so we still have opportunities in those regions to move more of our delivery into a global delivery format. So I still see between the shift to higher value between getting cloud to scale and the move to automation and getting more of our regions into the global delivery environment. We still have room to improve margins and services.","Patricia Murphy","Christine can we please take the next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citibank. You may ask your question.","Jim Suva","In your prepared comments you mentioned a little bit about operating expenses as a percent of sales have increased due to the mix shift and my belief is understandable and I assume you\u2019re referring to the mix shift in more strategic imperatives and it can\u2019t -- and so that manifesting itself a nice growth I think you said up 30% year-over-year which is good. Can you help us understand the timeframe or the milestones for judging and assessing the strategic imperatives and the investment in them of when we start to really start to see leverage to the model of leveraging that growth into a lot more profitability? Or in other words how much longer do you have to keep really investing a lot more ahead of all that?","Martin Schroeter","So a few things, in the prepared remarks on expense what we talked about was a slightly higher E to R in the quarter and we wanted to go through make sure everyone understood that the 9% year-to-year improvement in expense was driven heavily by just the translation the currency impact which is actually 11 points a year so currency obviously has an impact on the expense side as well. We also talked a bit about the impact of having the expense from our system ex-divestiture now out of our run rate so that was a couple of points.","So we wanted to make sure that everyone understood, our investors understood that we continue to invest and that\u2019s why E to R is up in terms of the second quarter. Now when do we get through that? Boy, we see an industry where innovation where industry skills and knowledge are the differentiators in many of our engagements. And so a lot our investments are focused on yes the strategic imperatives as you said which is a combination of shifting out of things that we were doing into new things it's also part of growing that overall investment pool but within those investments yes there\u2019re strategic imperatives but it\u2019s also a lot of investments around building industry skills, industry talent because more and more our clients are looking for that industry point of view.","So I don\u2019t know that we get through if you will the bow to shift through the wave in terms of expense in terms of investments when do they slow-down. Now I do think they\u2019re paying off. We had tremendous growth in cloud again we have tremendous growth all across the strategic imperatives. So, shifting this expense as we\u2019ve talked about in the beginning of the year is absolutely the right thing for us to do for the long-term. We can see that pay off in terms of the market share we\u2019re growing in those strategic imperatives. Now those will continue to pay dividends for a long-long time within that as you know we\u2019re building a number of as a services businesses including Watson, so I think that those investment levels are important I think we\u2019ll continue to maintain those investments because we\u2019re building some very appealing businesses underneath those strategic imperatives.","Patricia Murphy","Christine can we please take the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. You may ask your question.","Joseph Foresi","I was wondering if we could get some sense of what percentage of revenue the strategic imperatives are and how do they impact your visibility on the business? And then just one last one have we had a positive inflection point on the services backlog?","Martin Schroeter","Sure. So a couple of things that we hit a positive inflection on the services backlog we\u2019ll start with that. So, the backlog is $120 billion plus, so it\u2019s hard to make it move if you will. We had a very good signings quarter as we talked about 22 deals greater than 100 million we still see a lot of opportunity in terms of additional services opportunity. But getting that substantial backlog to move it takes a lot of services, signings of our consistent period of time. So while we see very good demand it\u2019s tough to predict on a 90 day basis where the backlog is going to be again given it\u2019s a 122 billion that we\u2019re trying to move.","Now as a percentage of revenue we've talked about last year in Investor Day we talked about it on a full year basis had about 27% and we said in Investor Day that we\u2019re going to grow that to about 40, be more than 40 billion about 40% of our revenue by 2018. Now I think even there is seasonality in this number I would say we are certainly ahead of the 27 given the growth and we're making tremendous progress toward that 2018 goal of 40% of our business but given the seasonality I'm not sure that whether where we are within that range is all that insightful. We will take our temperature again on this at the end of the year so that get a data point without much seasonality or that any seasonality but again from 27 last year we are on our way to 40 and I'd say the two data points that we have of 30 plus first quarter and second quarter are in very good shape remember that we showed at Investor Day we show the chart that said these have been growing at about 19% fairly consistently over the last few year. So you should assume and I think we're comfortable that we are making very good progress on that longer term goal.","Patricia Murphy","Christine, can we please take one last question.","Operator","The last question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Amit Daryanani","Just wanted to get back to the software segment. Can you just talk about -- do you think the business performed in the June quarter inline to your plan or was it ahead of the low and then when you look at the PTI margin decline you saw in software is that reflects to the flexibility you are providing to your customer when they move to strategic imperative and it should get back to more normalize level once you get beyond that I guess initial transition or does that really reflect more of the reality that some of these strategic imperative revenues maybe at a lower margin than your legacy revenues are?","Martin Schroeter","Sure. You made a couple of things. So, in terms of in line with the plan we've said since the beginning of the of the year that the at the low end of guidance we don\u2019t assume a change in trajectory and at the high end we do and that's to by the way to over simplify up nearly 100 billion corporation but will over simplify for the purpose for this question and right now given that the change the trajectory in software has not changed I'd say that we are right in line with our plan but we are right in line with that low end of guidance. I don\u2019t think that would surprise anybody.","With regard to the margin a couple of things one software is very high margin element and can continue to be a very high margin component of our overall mix. Now when we look at margin if I think there are two things I would disaggregate on a gross profit level margin the only real shift we see is a slight shift to our SaaS properties. And so while they are coming at slightly lower margins than our traditional on plunders business they are still highly accretive to the overall IBM model because bear in mind these are new spaces for us were not taking and converting the non-prem business to it and as a service business we are building new revenue streams and spaces where in spaces where we are not today.","So slightly lower gross margins on the SaaS business but all accretive to the IBM model and then the net margin in our software business reflect a lot of the investments that we've talked about both in strategic imperatives and remember we continue to invest in our core businesses because as we talked about it at Investor Day in other venues that contemporary nature of those while they are products that have been in our client sites for many-many years and they are committed to this products those products evolve into the latest most contemporary needs as well. So those products now have to live in and support our clients in a mobile world in a social world and they have to have analytics capabilities as well so the old products are also part of that investment and so.","From an investment standpoint I would say that you're seeing the investments in our software business on the net margin line.","Martin Schroeter","So let me take a few minutes to wrap up the call. We're half way through now of transformation here and you can see in our results that the investments and of course the shift in our business we're seeing good progress as we move more of our business into the strategic imperatives, we've been very active in reinventing our hardware business and I think that's paying off and the investments and the added focus we've put on the solutions areas are contributing to some pretty strong growth in those strategic imperatives.","So, with six months behind us we've maintained our full year of EPS even though as I mentioned in the remarks and in the Q&A that currency is probably little worse than it was at the beginning of the year but will maintain our EPS guidance and as we talked about in the prepared remarks we've taken up our view of our free cash flow modestly, so modest growth free cash flow for the year. We said from the beginning that this will take some time, we continue to manage the business for the long-term and we're confident that we're on track to that longer term trajectory.","So thanks very much everyone for joining us today.","Patricia Murphy","Christine we'll turn it back to you to close out the call.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today's call.

You will find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation, and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin Schroeter.","Martin Schroeter","Thanks, Patricia. In the second quarter, we delivered $19.3 billion of revenue, operating pretax income of over $3 billion, operating earnings per share of $2.97, and free cash flow of over $2.5 billion. The quarter played out as we expected with continued solid growth in our strategic imperatives which now really reflects organic growth. We wrapped on the acquisitive content and we're at the stage where we can start to get some efficiency as a result of bringing them into IBM while we build on the new content.","Our gross margin is up over 2.5 point sequentially and positions us for the continued improvement over the course of the year we talked about 90 days ago. And we had good free cash flow performance all again as we expected. In the second quarter we signed a number of large contracts in global technology services and again, grew our global business services signings, both of which will start to contribute in the second half. And since the quarter ended, we announced our new IBM Z system which will be available later this quarter. With all of this we expect improved performance in revenue and gross margin in the second half and we continue to expect at least $13.80 of operating EPS and free cash flow consistent with last year.","I'll spend time on the first to second half dynamics a little later and you will see it's very similar to what we talked about in April. We've been focused on helping our enterprise clients transform their businesses to leverage their data for competitive advantage and to improve the efficiency and agility of their IT environments. Our strategic imperatives performance has been an indication of our progress in moving to these areas. As you know, our strategic imperatives are in separate businesses but signpost that represent the revenue across our business lines that work together to address demand for analytics, cloud security, mobile and social. Our clients are taking the productivity savings we're delivering to them in the more traditional areas of IT and reinvesting those savings to move into these new areas; these are the dynamics you've seen in our revenue.","In the quarter, our strategic imperatives revenue was up 7% at constant currency which as I said is pretty much all organic growth. Over the last twelve months, revenue from our strategic imperatives was up 12% to over $34 billion and now represents 43% of IBM. As is typical, I'll focus on constant currency growth rates throughout. A large part of our strategic imperatives are delivered as a service. Our as a service revenue was up over 30% in the second, and we exited the quarter with an $8.8 billion annual run rate. IBM's cloud revenue on a trailing twelve month basis is now over $15 billion, that's nearly 20% of IBM's revenue. Let me spend a minute underscoring how we've been able to build cloud to a $15 billion business, and why enterprises are increasingly moving to the IBM cloud.","In the second quarter we added more leading companies to the IBM cloud. For example, Lloyds Bank has chosen the IBM cloud. Lloyds is one of the most advanced digital banks in the world and they expect to become even more agile by leveraging IBM's unique combination of private and public cloud capabilities. American Airlines is also using the IBM cloud as the foundation for this broadbased cloud transformation. Clients are choosing the IBM cloud for a number of reasons. First, our cloud is hybrid, built for the enterprise, that's public and private, and integrated with on-prime [ph] data and workloads. Second, they want to leverage our expertise in industry and their existing business processes and systems, and we know how to migrate them from one era to the next. Third, they trust IBM and the IBM cloud to protect and preserve not only their data but also their insights and AI training engines to ensure all of the value from their data accrues to them versus going to educative central knowledge graph.","And of course, we continue to add state-of-the-art tools and technologies to exploit enterprise data in the cloud; this includes Watson and blockchain. You see this last point cloud as companies deploy IBM blockchain and Watson solutions in the cloud. Recently, we announced an agreement with a consortium of seven of Europe's top banks to create a new blockchain service for trade finance for the small and medium business market. And in Australia, we're working with banks to launch new commercial property leasing services based on blockchain. And remember, we're already working with many others including DTCC, CLS and Northern Trust. Beyond financial services we're working with industry leaders like Walmart and Food Safety and Maersk in shipping. It's still early but we see a lot of opportunity leveraging block chain in the cloud and across multiple industries.","Similarly in the second quarter we saw Watson deployments continue to expand globally. The cognitive opportunity is a global one, it's not centered in New York or Boston or Silicon Valley; but you can't just look and listen in those places. In healthcare alone, you'd miss that this quarter the first healthcare provider in Latin America is deploying Watson for oncology, and Baheal Pharmaceutical Group is bringing Watson for genomics to clinicians across China. In fact, 80% of the hospitals who've adopted Watson for oncology are outside of the U.S., and that's just healthcare, we have Watson deployed with other leaders like Berdasco [ph], Honda and Vodafone as well. So across industries and around the world our clients realize that data, in fact their own data is the route of competitive advantage for all companies.","Remember, 80% of the worlds data is owned by enterprises, it's not searchable on the worldwide web, it's customer data, and patient data, clinical data, supply chain data, transaction data and companies want to unlock and exploit that data; and so that's why enterprises will move to cognitive on the cloud with someone they trust who has leading tools and industry expertise and a data model and business model consistent with their goals, that is the IBM cloud plus Watson.","I want to also remind you of the importance of the underlying technology stack. We've continued to reinvent the mainframe and our power platform to address the most contemporary enterprise workloads. Our new z14 mainframe is a great example. With a breakthrough in data encryption, IBM Z is capable of encrypting all data associated with any application, service or database all of the time and with no application change and no performance impact. Think about what that means for addressing global data breaches, the increase in government regulations and block chain opportunities. It's the biggest reinvention of our mainframe technology since the reinvention for Linux and open source software 15 years ago.","I'll touch on additional progress and examples of where we're winning in these areas and more details on our new mainframe capabilities as I go through the segment discussions. But first, I'll walk through our financial metrics.","Our revenue for the quarter was $19.3 billion, which is down 3% at constant currency. As expected, we had a larger currency headwind to revenue growth, it was about twice the impact of the first quarter. I mentioned earlier that we ramped on the acquisitions we completed in early 2016. We had two points of benefit in the first quarter from acquisitions and only about 40 basis points in the second. So excluding the acquisitive content, our year-to-year revenue performance was a modest improvement over last quarters rate. When you look at our revenue performance by geography, in the Americas, revenue in the U.S. was down while we had solid growth in Canada and Latin America. Our overall performance in Europe declined centered in Germany and the UK.","You will recall, last quarter I talked about the impact of the conclusion of services contracts in those countries which will continue through the year that will get some benefit from the new deals we signed in the second half. We had sequential improvement in Asia Pacific with growth in several markets including Japan which is our second largest country. I'll come back to the revenue trajectory later in the call.","When you look at our gross profit, our margin was down year-to-year but significantly better than the first quarter year-to-year performance. The year-to-year margin decline reflects both the mix and invests. From first to second quarter we got substantial leverage from our high value model. We added $1 billion gross profit from first to second with $1.1 billion of additional revenue, while last year we had similar gross profit improvement from first to second but we needed more revenue to do it. So that of course resulted in improved trajectory in the year-to-year margin dynamics; in fact, we had sequential improvement in the year-to-year gross margin performance in each of our five segments. We'll talk more about the drivers and trends in the segment discussions.","Our expense was down 6% versus last year with about half of that due to currency and the balance reflects an increased focus on driving efficiency in our spend base. As I said, we've been shifting and adding resources as we invest to build solutions and platforms. In fact, in the first half of this year we hired 20,000 people into the business; so our cost and expense profile reflects a balance between investing in key areas and driving efficiency across the spend base. Our operating pretax profit was nearly $3.1 billion which is up about a $1 billion from the first quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing operating effective tax rate of just under 15% consistent with last quarter.","We also had discrete tax benefits in the second quarter of about $170 million or $0.18 of operating EPS. We generated $2.8 billion of operating net income in the quarter and net income margin of 14.5% which is up 50 basis points year-to-year. On the bottom line, our operating EPS was $2.97. We generated over $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter which is up year-to-year, and over the last twelve months our free cash flow is 94% of our GAAP net income.","So now turning to our segments, cognitive solutions had $4.6 billion of revenue, continued growth in annuity content led by SaaS and an improved margin profile. Our annuity content which represents 80% of cognitive was up 2% year-to-year driven by roughly 4.5% growth in solution software. We had strong SaaS performance with strong double-digit growth in signings and revenue again this quarter. Revenue was up nearly 30%. As our SaaS business grows, we continue to invest to build scale. The software transaction revenue was down double-digits due to declines in some of our license based offerings and as you know, this was a larger impact in the second quarter given the seasonality of our transactions. As we've said before, many of our license-based offerings are high value but in declining markets.","We also wrapped on most of our acquisitions and are focused on investing to combine organic and acquired content to build cloud-based cognitive offerings. Let me talk about the progress we're making in parts of the solution software portfolio.","In analytics, we saw good growth in Watson health and Watson financial services and in BI and data discovery lead by Cognos. We announced the partnership with Hortonworks to combine our data science experience in machine learning with Hortonworks data platform to allow developers to access data science and cognitive tools and create intelligent apps. We also had strong growth in our Watson platform which underpins our enterprise AI strategy as we build scale. Conversation API usage and the number of active users are up strong double-digits quarter-to-quarter as we helped clients embed cognitive into their workflows. For example, credit mutual is live with multiple used cases including virtual systems for insurance and savings.","These cognitive applications were rolled out to over 20,000 agents across France enhancing their quality of service for 12 million customers. In this quarter we added new partners like LivePerson which provides a conversational platform used for the customer care needs of over 18,000 businesses. Given the growing relevance of AI in digital channels, they announced a new offering called LiveEngage with Watson to transform the customer care space. LiveEngage can offer intelligent personalized digital support to each customer; this is an appealing market, the value Watson provides depends on the complexity of the conversation, so the number of API calls can vary but we have the potential to deliver value from every digital conversation. This will scale as more of today's 270 billion customer support phone call shift to digital interactions.","Within our vertical strategy, Watson Health had strong growth, particularly in the areas of state and local government agencies and oncology as we continue scaling. While market uncertainty persists, government agencies still face the realities of having to deliver services more efficiently; and our analytics and social program management offerings can help clients make better informed decisions to reduce healthcare costs and reduce outcomes. Both offerings drove strong growth this quarter; oncology is also scaling and is now in over 50 hospitals on five continents. Through the first half Watson has worked with nearly 40,000 patients and doctors and this will grow to approximately 100,000 by year end and many of these have life-threatening diseases such as cancer.","Watson for oncology alone has a potential to reach millions around the world based just on the hospital systems we've engaged to date. So we're just at the beginning of scaling, we continue to add new cancer types so our patient reach continues to grow. We're not just scaling our business into new areas but also improving deployment; for example, we implemented Watson for oncology at Baheal Pharmaceutical Group in less than a month. This quarter as I mentioned earlier, we expanded with Baheal into genomics. We also announced the new collaboration with Hackensack Meridian Health, a prominent U.S. provider to combine Watson for Oncology with their real world data to help oncologists improve cancer treatment and reduce costs.","For another industry example, Watson for Financial Services which includes the [indiscernible] acquisition, also contributed to growth this quarter. We launched industry expert trained AI risk and compliance solutions including anti-money laundering and know your customer. Beyond verticals, security, including security services which is reported in technology services and cloud platforms grew again this quarter. Offerings like QRadar and Resilient had strong growth as customers look to strengthen their ability to both the tax and respond to security threats. This quarter we announced the partnership with Cisco to address this growing threat of cyber crime. We will collaborate on threat intelligence research by sharing data, integrating our offerings and coordinating on major cyber security incidence.","Turning to profit, cognitive solutions gross margin is down year-to-year though improving sequentially driven by the continued investment into strategic areas including acquisitions and the mix towards SaaS. Cognitive pretax income is up year-to-year and this segment has very high PTI margins which expanded again this quarter, even with a high level of investment as we continue to embed cognitive into offerings, build and scale platforms and drive vertical solutions. In global business services, we grew signings for the second consecutive quarter and had modest improvement in the year-to-year revenue performance as compared to first.","As we've talked about, we've realigned our practice model to improve productivity and focus our strategy around three growth platforms. The first platform is where we help our clients build and execute digital strategies. Next is where we help our clients re-engineer their core processes. And the third platform is where we modernize our clients applications and move them to the cloud. This differentiated strategy is beginning to take hold as we accelerated our signings growth in GBS this quarter. Our cloud, mobile and analytics practices delivered strong revenue growth. Though consulting revenue was down 1%, our trajectory improved again this quarter with strong growth in our digital offerings. We continue to decline in traditional enterprise application work as we shift resources away from these areas to new areas such as SAP HANA, Workday and Salesforce.","We've talked about the path to improvement in GBS which starts with consistent signings growth which adds to the backlog and then ultimately revenue. Our consulting backlog this quarter was nearly flat year-to-year after several quarters of declines. We expect the consulting trajectory improvement to continue in the second half. Our mobile practice continues to expand with a portfolio of cognitive enabled enterprise iOS apps that can redesign our clients workflows. This quarter we announced new initiatives at several different clients including Lufthansa Group and Singapore Airlines. Application management was down 1%, that's been relatively stable over the past several quarters. Clients continue to look to us to manage the lifecycle of their critical applications. We help them move to new cloud architectures that improve the speed and agility of their operations by leveraging the value of their current systems and data.","Turning to profit; GBS gross profit margin was up over a point sequentially. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we added more gross profit dollars than we did a year ago, and we were able to do this on less incremental revenue. This was evidenced for the turnaround that we expect in GBS as we move forward. We continue to shift to higher value work while focusing on improving productivity. We yield at savings from workforce actions and continue to invest to remix our skills. While we're seeing pricing pressure in the areas that are not as differentiated, we continue to focus on capturing the value of our new offerings. We've streamlined our practice infrastructure and are driving efficiencies in our delivery model for new methods and project management approaches.","In summary, in GBS this quarter we continued many of the improving trends that started in the first quarter. As we've said before, the starts with consistent signings growth and we grew signings for the second consecutive quarter. We continue to shift to our high value strategic imperative and we're starting to see the benefits from a redesign practice model and refocused growth strategy. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities; put all this together, and we expect to see continued improvement in GBS in the second half.","In technology services and cloud platforms, we delivered a $8.4 billion of revenue. While revenue performance decelerated, our margin profile improved compared to last quarter and we signed a number of contracts that will contribute to improved performance in the second half. The deceleration was driven by infrastructure services as we ramped on some acquisitive content and shifted away from lower value work. While this shift impacted our revenue, it contributed to the improved gross margin trajectory. We also continue to be impacted by some large contracts that concluded, particularly in Europe, which we talked about last quarter.","Our business model and infrastructure services is one where we're constantly delivering productivity to our clients. Our clients trust us with their most critical IT operations as we continue to leave this space. The way that we expand our footprint is by helping clients move to cloud and drive new workloads by acquiring new scope and new clients. This quarter we were able to close some substantial new transactions including a six-year $700 million agreement with Bombardier; we'll move them to the IBM cloud and help integrate their operations globally. This will drive productivity, improve their agility and ultimately provide competitive advantage.","I mentioned Lloyds where we signed a 10-year cloud agreement valued at around $1.5 billion. We'll move the bank to the IBM cloud and migrate their application suites to this infrastructure. And earlier this quarter, we entered into a definitive agreement for the large Telco to acquire it's cloud and managed hosting business. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2017. We're working with them on a number of other strategic initiatives including networking and cloud services. These transactions will help improve our revenue trajectory in the second half. Technical support services revenue was down 1%, a point better than last quarter's rate.","We continue to grow in our multi-vendor support services where we provide wall-to-wall support for our clients IT operations. Integration software revenue was down 1% which is nearly two points better than the first quarters rate. Our annuity base remains stable with strong growth in SaaS across our offerings including webs for your application server and our hybrid transformation and connect the cloud offerings. Transactional revenue within integration software declined as more of this portfolio shifts to the IBM cloud which will benefit us overtime. Across the segment we delivered strong growth in cloud analytics, mobile and security. The service run rate for the segment increased to $5.8 billion.","Clients are moving to the IBM cloud because it's built for the enterprise and can optimize workloads across hybrid environments. The underline architecture protects our clients data and insights and is optimized for cognitive workloads to help our clients create new business models. The American Airlines example I referenced earlier is a great example where we're building on the partnership we signed last year. American Airlines announced this quarter they will move to the IBM cloud and use it as the foundation for their digital transformation. They will migrate critical applications including AA.com, their customer facing mobility app and their global network of kiosks.","Looking at profit, gross profit margin for the segment was down year-to-year but up a point sequentially. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we added about the same gross profit dollars we did a year ago on less than half of the incremental revenue, so you can see the leverage you can get in this business. We drove efficiencies and services delivery and yielded savings from workforce actions. We've been investing in our automation capabilities and launched the IBM services platform with Watson last week. This platform offers next-generation enterprise IT services using cognitive technology and will drive operational efficiencies and improve delivery performance for our clients.","We also continue to invest in our IBM cloud capabilities. We announced the opening of four new cloud centers in the U.S. extending our capacity with centers in key local markets across 19 different countries. This provides enterprises with the ability to run their data and applications locally and meet regulatory requirements. Clients can provision cloud infrastructure when in where they needed.","In summary, for technology services in cloud platforms, infrastructure services revenue decelerated given the ramp on some acquisitive content and the shift away from lower value work given some of the significant transactions we closed this quarter and strong demand for our cloud services, we expect our revenue trajectory to improve in the second half. We also expect the improved trends in profit to continue.","In systems this quarter we had a significant improvement in our year-to-year revenue trajectory and an improved margin profile quarter-to-quarter. This is the second quarter in a row with growth in storage. Our power declines moderated and our mainframe business is consistent with what you would expect at the end of the cycle. Mainframe and storage margins grew year-to-year and power margins improved sequentially. Our overall systems margin was down year-to-year reflecting mix largely due to product transitions.","In Z systems as I mentioned, our results are reflective of being in the tenth and final quarter of the z13 product cycle. Revenue declined year-to-year, gross margin expanded and we added four new clients this quarter for a total of 91 since the launch of z13. We continue to deliver innovation on the platform in support of our clients evolving workload needs. For example, a large bank in Europe selected Linux One as the strategic platform for their BPM deployments which will help the bank achieve significant savings over the next five years. Few large government clients expanded their mainframe capacity helping them drive down the operating cost for these agencies.","In the areas of new workloads, we had wins in both blockchain and instant payments. The blockchain wins were geographically disperse as we help our clients around the world tackle business challenges with the emerging blockchain technology. We closed three instant payment deals in Europe to help our banking clients comply with the EU payment modernization initiative.","I want to spend a minute on our new z14 mainframe that we announced yesterday. After three years of development and working with more than 150 clients, this is the world's most powerful transaction system capable of running more than 12 billion encrypted transactions per day and provides breakthrough pervasive encryption. This data encryption engine encrypts all data associated with any application, cloud service or database all of the time without the possibility of human intervention, and that's with no application change and no performance impact.","We took on this challenge to address both the global data breach epidemic and the need to operate within government regulations. In fact, of the 9 billion records breached in the past five years, only 4% were encrypted. Even with the rise of cloud data centers, little real progress have been made encrypting data at any scale because it's hard, expensive and it impacts performance, that is until now. Our new z14 system encrypts data 18 times faster than x86 platforms and the x86 platforms are 20 times more expensive. The reason why 92 of the worlds Top 100 banks rely on the mainframe is for it's high value, secure and scalable platform.","The reason they stay on it is because of it's appeal in new workloads and the advances we continue to make in the underlying technologies to address these. Like the new z14 with this unprecendented encryption capabilities, and we do this with increased performance at lower cost which is really valuable to our enterprise clients. So we can deliver all of this within an economic equation that works at the scale required by our clients. The power growth rate improved sequentially but was still down, the improvement reflects our transition to our growing Linux market while continuing to serve a high value but declining Unix market. Our Linux on power revenue grew and we gained share. We again had double-digit growth in Linux workloads. HANA on Power continues to play an important role in that success.","By contrast in Unix, the clients were driven by our low end and mid-range systems, high-end systems grew. Our power portfolio is focused on cognitive and cloud opportunities and we continue to expand capabilities and partnerships. During the second quarter we announced new integrated offerings with Hortonworks designed to help everyone from data scientists to business leaders better analyze and manage their data and accelerate decision-making. And we announced integrated offerings with new 10X [ph] to deliver hyper-converted solutions targeting critical workloads in large enterprises.","We also announced the new version of Power AI which paired with IBM Linux HPC servers reduces training of deep learning from weeks to hours. I'll remind you that will bring the next-generation Power 9 to market in the fourth quarter starting with two U.S. department of energy funded national labs. There are three labs of this type but no vendor can win more than two, so we won over-aloud [ph]. These will be the worlds most advanced data-centric supercomputing systems and we'll rollout Power 9 across the power portfolio throughout 2018.","Storage hardware was up again this quarter increasing 8% led by strong double-digit growth and our all-flash array offerings. Flash was the growth catalyst in our storage mid-range and high-end offerings. Storage hardware margins increased both, year-to-year and sequentially. So to summarize systems, our year-to-year revenue and gross margin trajectory improved with consecutive quarters of revenue growth in storage offset by the expected cycle driven declines in Z systems and Power. While we face some shifting market dynamics and product transitions, our portfolio remains optimized for cognitive and cloud, and we continue to expand our footprint and add new capabilities. Our recent z14 launch and the upcoming Power refresh beginning later in the year, will drive further improvements in second half performance.","Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, in the second quarter we generated $3.3 billion of cash from operations excluding our financing receivables. We invested about three quarters of $1 billion in capital expenditures focused in our Watson and cloud platform areas, as well as in support of our services and systems businesses. And so we generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow which is up almost $350 million year-to-year; this reflects continued strong collections performance for the second consecutive quarter. For the first half our free cash flow was $3.6 billion and over the last 12 months our cash realization rate is 94%, four points higher than last quarters trailing 12 months rate.","The first half free cash flow of $3.6 billion is down $900 million year-to-year. However, you will recall in the first half of last year we had a $1.2 billion Japan tax refund. As we look forward to the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be roughly flat with last year with the first half year-to-year headwind switching to a tailwind in the second half from taxes and workforce rebalancing payments. And of course, this reflects the level of profit consistent with our full year view of earnings per share.","Looking at uses of cash in the half, our acquisition spend was relatively light after a significant number of acquisitions in 2015 and early 2016. We're focused on investing and integrating these acquisitions as we expand our solutions and cloud capabilities. In the last six months, we've returned $5.5 billion to shareholders, including $2.7 billion in dividends. In April, we again raised our dividend and with that we've more than doubled our dividends since 2010. In the first half we bought back over 60 million shares and we ended June with 932 million shares outstanding and $2.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended June with $12.3 billion in cash and $45.7 billion in total debt. Both of these are up from year-end, primarily driven by the timing of this years term debt issuances and maturities. $29 billion of our total debt was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 9:1 [ph] and the portfolio remains strong at 53% investment grade. We've got more in our financing business and our supplemental charts at the back of the presentation. Our balance sheet remains strong and with our newly reorganized financing entity, we're even better positioned to support our business over the long-term.","Let me start to wrap up by putting some additional perspective on our revenue trajectory, and we'll look at it by segment because our businesses are at different stages of transformation. In global business services, we've said for sometime that the progression is driven by improvement in signings leading to backlog and then ultimately revenue. I plant the flag to mark the beginning of an improvement and the revenue growth trajectory for GBS back in the fourth quarter of last year. And we've now had two consecutive quarters of signings growth, substantial improvements in the consulting backlog and a modest 20 basis point improvement in GBS revenue performance from first to second. This is what improving momentum in the services business looks like. So now with this momentum and a more focused set of offerings and improvements in execution, we've seen improved trajectory in GBS in the second half.","In global technology services with decelerating performance over the last two quarters, we're planning to flag now at the end of the second quarter. With the ramp in some of our new contracts, we do expect improved performance in the second half but we're not counting on a return to revenue growth this year, just an improved revenue trajectory. And at systems, storage had been declining but you will remember we plant the flag as we got all flash into the product line towards the end of last year and we've now had two consecutive quarters of revenue growth. Power, I'd similarly plant the flag back at the end of last year; and for systems Z mainframe, growth is tied more to the nine to ten quarter product cycle which will refresh later this quarter.","Finally, in cognitive solutions, we've now wrapped on our acquisitions. Our annuity content continues to grow, this was driven in large part by our SaaS offerings and as we've talked about in the past, they ramp and build scale over a longer timeframe. Put it all together and we expect improvement in the constant currency growth rate through the rest of the year.","Now when we look at gross margin, I mentioned three drivers of our year-to-year performance in the first half. We've seen some moderations in the headwinds from mix and investments already from first to second and I'd expect that to continue. We're always driving productivity in the business and much of that gets returned to our clients in the form of price, or it offset cyclical impacts or it goes to the bottom line. In the first half, the net of these factors was an impact to our margin but as we move to the second half with new product introduction and improved services dynamics, I'd expect this to be a benefit to our margin.","With that altogether, and just as we expect improvement in our revenue trajectory, we also expect an improved gross margin profile in the second half as compared to the first. So in total, those drivers of our first to second half performance improvements are consistent with what we talked about 90 days ago. We'll have a new IBM Z product out by the end of the quarter which will drive an improvement in gross profit from first to second half. Related to that, we'll also benefit from lower systems development spending.","The new services contracts and global technology services will start to contribute and with the cost savings we're driving, we'll have better performance in GTS. In global business services we expect the momentum to deliver a better second half. We've essentially wrapped on last year's larger acquisitions which are dilutive to profit and we're not at the stage where we can start to yield more benefits from operational synergies. Our ongoing operational tax rate assumption continues to be 15% plus or minus three points driven by our anticipated mix.","As always, this is without discrete items but the rate is dependant on the mix of business because just like every dollar of revenue doesn't result in the same amount of gross profit, every dollar of gross profit doesn't drive the same amount of after-tax profit. But at the bottom-line, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for 2017 and free cash flow that is consistent with last year.","And with that, we'll take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So operator, lets please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Katy Huberty","Yes, thank you, good afternoon. I appreciate the second half versus first half color but if you can comment more specifically on the third quarter because of the mainframe launch; consensus is modeling both better revenue and better EPS growth sequentially than last year. Are you comfortable with those boggies? And maybe in regard of that just talk about how you think this mainframe cycle will compare to past cycles? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure Katy, thanks, and thanks for joining the call. I guess a couple of things, I'll start actually where you finished on mainframe because we have in the past said that the economics for the mainframe for us, what we're looking for is that the overall economic equation cycle-to-cycle kind of holds and we saw for the last four mainframes, including the one that we just finished and now we expect the overall economic equation to be fairly stable, that doesn't map to a calendar period of it because we announced them at different times but we would expect the overall economics of the mainframe to hold cycle-to-cycle the cycle amount to the fifth cycle, we could have gone back further but let's just say that mainframe is roughly consistent with the past.","In terms of third and fourth quarter, I guess there are couple of things. I think you're interested in revenue and we'll talk about EPS as well and then where does the mainframe fit. On the revenue side of that typically we see about -- for seasonal reasons, we see about $1 billion 2Q to 3Q reduction for seasonality. Now we're only going to have a month or less of the new mainframe, we're going to have a month of some of these new contracts, not the full quarter, those will come in the fourth and so that typical $1 billion impact will be helped a little bit, $200 million to $300 million by mainframe or the services contract but that's about it for the third and then obviously the rest will be in the fourth.","And then from an earnings perspective, given the power of the mainframe and the profit equation, how it helps mix plus our typical -- you know, typically we have a lot of our transaction business in the fourth. When you look at our EPS guidance, we're up a little bit for the year; we're up even less than the full year now through the first half. And then third quarter I wouldn't expect to drive much growth at all. I think most of the growth rate is going to be in the fourth, again, given the cycle dynamics and quite frankly, given the fact that the benefit really is only a month now and three months of the fourth. Thanks, Katy.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Katy. Can we take the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. Martin, your cognitive solutions, pretax margins were up nicely, both on a quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year basis despite some continued weakness on the transactional business. Can you address what the main drivers there were for cognitive margins and PTI specifically was at lower drag from M&A, better contribution from the SaaS assets and do you see that sustained continued sort of year-on-year improvement in the second half for cognitive PTI margins? Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","Yes, thanks Wamsi. Well, you've kind of answered your question, so well done. No it is -- it really is a reflection of a few things. One is sequentially we've got a benefit from scale, now that's annual, that's year-to-year as well as sequential, but we're getting a benefit from scale as we build those service businesses. And then just like when we wrap on an acquisition and the revenue benefit, at the same time that allows us -- not allows us but what we start to do is we start to build the consolidation if you will and the efficiency in getting those acquisitions onto our own platform; so we get kind of local expense savings if you will from doing things once as opposed to a number of times around a unit. So better scale, ramping acquisitions, not only on the growth but then we get an opportunity to get a bit more productivity out of them. And yes, those -- I would expect that margins in cognitive solutions while on a year-to-year basis we still see -- because of mix we still see a year-to-year decline, sequentially we'll continue to improve on those things, the things I identified; the scale will last forever and then the wrap on the acquisitions will start to deteriorate in another three or four quarters.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Wamsi. Can we please take the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you. Martin you made a number of positive comments about the trajectory of services but the supplemental slides, the signings overall are down 14% year-over-year and the backlog is now down to 4% year-over-year. What's going on there and why do you think that's going to improve?","Martin Schroeter","Yes, couple of things Steve. First, let's pull signings, we'll talk about backlog because the impact of signings on backlog, as you know we've talked about it is different when it's a renewal versus when it's new business and siginings, they don't playout as we said in the past on a 90-day period, obviously the longer you get, the more it looks like your backlog but you got to get over a pretty long timeframe in order to have the signings translate directly into backlog. So in the first half of this year we had one of the biggest new contract signings we've had for any six month period as big as it was; last year it was bigger than the year before. So what happens in our backlog is those new contracts come on once we go through the transition period, as I mentioned earlier and that for us it will start to be September, once you get through that transition period, all of that translates to revenue rather quickly, that's different from a backlog or signing that goes into backlog as an extension of a contract that's ten years old and is about to expire because that is not going to drive any incremental growth.","So yes, on GTS the backlog is down, the new signings go in though at a rate that will drive revenue in the near-term and so the backlog being down is something we obviously have to work on a few years out because those contracts are going to come due and we have to get them renewed because it's not going to drive any growth but we need the backlog. And on GBS, we had second quarter in a row of good signings, performance, in fact an acceleration from the first and within their backlog now, as we noted in our prepared remarks, our consulting business now has gotten itself back to kind of a flat backlog which in the near-term that tends to yield pretty quickly as we deliver; so they were battling double-digit declines in backlog for a while, they worked their way out of that spiral; and so we'll see a near-term yield on the consulting side as well.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Steve. Operator, can we please take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Ingin Wang with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Ingin Wang","Hi, thanks for the update. Just on the strategic comparative, it's up 7%; is high single digit a good proxy for organic growth and strategic comparative for the year because you hired the efficiency I think. Martin, [indiscernible] and the focus was due more towards maybe margin, then revenue acceleration within strategic comparatives?","Martin Schroeter","Thanks, Ingin. A couple of things I think worth noting. Yes, we certainly ramped on the acquisitions and so this is a pretty good proxy for the organic piece and it is mostly as a service, right, so it's not going to drive the same impact on our big base of business as it would if you ramped on an on-prime business because it didn't have the same impact to begin with. Now -- by the way we're not out of the acquisition business, right, we're still active acquirers, we just happen to ramp on and are getting our feet under us on everything we did in the past 18 months but we are still active acquirer. So that will drive some of the growth but when we think about strategic imperatives, going forward I would expect that we get a bit of an acceleration from the new mainframe, power will drive a bit and quite frankly, the services contracts, particularly the new ones that we signed and we talked about, they are cloud contracts, they are to help our clients build and run clouds and move them onto the cloud.","So just like we've encouraged everyone to look at the strategic imperatives on a trailing 12 month basis which they we're at 11% on a trailing 12 month basis; with the acceleration now through the back half of the year, when we get to the end of this year, I'd expect us to be still on that same trailing 12 months, so the whole calendar year I'd expect us to be in that 10% to 11% range on strategic imperatives as well.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Ingin. Can we go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes, thank you. Martin, I was wondering if you could just quickly clarify, I think you said you didn't expect EPS growth in Q3. Consensus is looking for $0.09 year-over-year improvement in Q3; are you suggesting that's not something that's appropriate? And then more specifically, my question -- for strategic imperatives, it sounds like you feel organic growth is 7%, are you still confident overall growth will be 10% plus which is something you articulated at your investment day? And if you are, is the proper implication to think about three points of strategic imperative growth coming from acquisitions which is about $1 billion a year in acquisition revenue; is that sort of the framework by which we should think? And are you still confident in that double-digit sustained growth for strategic imperatives? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, thanks Toni. So first on the non-question clarifying piece; look, we've got a base $3 plus on a base, we're roughly flat, I think we're at a level now where it's just too fine a number in order to say am I talking about $0.09 on a three -- almost mid-three, anyway, it's a big base, $0.09, too fine for me. On strategic imperatives, again, you know, I do expect us to accelerate in the second half for the year for the reasons we've talked about, right; we get new mainframe, a lot of the new contracts are coming on. And then the other elements within this and you can actually see it in the segment charts, we've got good growth in technology services and cloud platforms on the strategic imperative base, that is organic. We have good growth in GBS, that is by large organic. We have slower growth in the cognitive solutions but that's a massive base.","And then obviously what -- where we'll accelerate the most in the second half is the systems business which was down dramatically in the quarter but again, we're at the part of the cycle here where we would expect it to be down, so we gave the segment view already when we changed the segment reporting, we gave the segment view so you could try to put together now where we see that shift of business coming from. And as we go into second half, I think the most profound shifts are going to be in the systems business, we'll see continued good growth in the technology services cloud platforms unit, we could see continued good growth in GBS.","And then cognitive; you know, we have made investments, we're getting growth out of that part of the business, it is as a service primarily and therefore it's impact on the overall is more muted but if we were to acquire something it would go -- it would likely go back in there. But again, it's more muted because it's via the service business.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Toni. Can we go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is open.","David Grossman","Thank you. And perhaps Martin you addressed some of this in the last question but I was hoping you could help us better understand the growth dynamics in the cognitive and GBS segments. It looks like the strategic imperatives are well over 50% of the revenue mix in both of those units but they both are experiencing revenue declines; so if I've got that math right, can you help us better understand that dynamic and what that implies for the overall mix as strategic imperatives increase the greater percent of IBM's overall revenue mix?","Martin Schroeter","Sure, David. So we'll do it kind of piece by piece and I'll give you two words trying to describe both of them. One is magnitude, and I'm going to put that against cognitive; we've got -- it's a big, big business and obviously the service that we're building, it has a smaller impact and so we see growth but it's going to take -- and we're getting growth and they as a service portfolio but it's going to take time to build that and part of that portfolio, TPS, our transaction processing business as we have on the slide is down four, so that's a very high value business but it's a big on-prem [ph] business that it's going to take a while to outbuild if you will from as a service perspective.","And then on GBS, the word I'd give you is the transition. So I described a bit on our consulting business where we got the backlog back and back to flat and the consulting business has accelerated, the signings in consulting are good, the things that the growth is quite strong, the things that we're engaging with our clients on digital offering, those are resonating. So the consulting business comes back pretty well than the application management business; it's a fairly stable business and yes, we're helping our clients move those into clouds, we're helping them contemporize if you will, the way those applications work but that's not a big growth engine, it really is kind of a very stable base.","And then in GPS, in our global processing systems business, that's not high content of strategic imperatives but it is important work for our client and it's quite valuable to us. So in GBS as we make this transition, you know, the overall will be lifted and as we said we planted the flag on revenue growth back in the fourth quarter, now we've seen a moderately improving trajectory now and we would expect -- as I said the prepared remarks that third and fourth would be better again in terms of trajectory and revenue.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, David. Let's take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect, thanks a lot, good afternoon guys. I guess just trying to understand the gross margin discussion Martin, I realize 180 basis points decline in June is much better than the 300 basis points decline you had in the March quarter; but at what point do you see gross margins from a year-over-year perspective starting to stabilize and does stability in gross margin have to come in-line with strategic revenues essentially decelerating a little bit?","Martin Schroeter","Well, we do see as we said in the prepared remarks that we do see continued improvement in the trajectory, right. So down three in the first, down 18 in the second and then second half, driven by both mix and driven by the work we have underway in delivering productivity across our services platform, the work we have in improving our GBS margins which is now starting to come -- to show up in the ledger. So we see both, a mix of kind of structural benefits from productivity, we see a mix of execution benefits from realizing if you will the higher value of the solutions we're selling and we see a mix from just the fact that we're in high value systems business which is going to mix more strongly. So yes, we do see continued gross margin improvement on a sequential basis and improvement on a year-to-year basis sequentially, and that would position us pretty well I think then for 2018 but we've got work to do here in the second half to put that on the table but we do see it in the third and the fourth.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Amit. Let's go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Brain White [ph] with [indiscernible]. You may ask your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Martin on the z14, it sounds like it will have an impact, a positive impact in the second half of the year; do you think it will have a more favorable impact in 2018? And if you could give us just some guide post around the attach rate of the z14 or any mainframe cycle to both sales and profits of IBM, obviously it's a small direct percent of IBM's total sales and profits but if you look at the overall portfolio and the software and services that it ranks through that would be great. Thanks.","Martin Schroeter","So first, I think what you started by saying was z14 not much impact in second half and I think what we're saying is that it's going to have quite an impact in the second half, right. It was announced yesterday, it will become publicly available in September and so we'll get a month in the quarter but we'll get three months of it in the fourth quarter. So just to make sure we're clear, we do see a pretty good impact here in the second half from Z. Now the timing that impact will be most profound in the systems space because the hardware is what obviously goes out first. We also provide as you know, we provide maintenance for that but the warranty period is on, so that's not going to be sold for until after the warranty period expires, that's in 12 months plus. There is a software that goes with it but that tends to be driven by usage, not by a placement of hardware and so that also isn't going to be in the second half. We financed these, right, that happens overtime and so we get that money back overtime.","So the -- and then we sell storage, there is a little bit of tailwind in the hardware side but again a lot of it is software defined storage, so the benefit in the second half is systems driven, the rest of the platform if you will, will continue to drive profit overtime and a lot of that will been dependant on the workloads that it can attract and the workload is running [ph] now and how people scale which we feel quite good about. You know, one of the things we haven't spend a lot of time on, on the mainframe because the interest has been around security, the interest has been around in-line machine learning but one of the elements of the new mainframe is new software model which will allow our clients to partition off parts of the mainframe and run new workloads and test new workloads in a much more economic way so they will attract new workloads onto the platform again.","So in overtime, again, we're not relying on the mainframe as a platform to be anymore valuable it has in the past but I'll tell you what this mainframe solves a lot of problems at clients who don't use it today, have; and it provides a lot of new on-ramps for other workloads.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Brian. Can we please take the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. You may ask your question.","Jim Suva","Thanks very much, it's Jim Suva from Citi. Martin, you had mentioned [indiscernible] several times in different parts of the businesses which is greatly appreciated. The question I have for you is, is there any correlation to cash flow and cash flow generation regarding those black [ph]. Like for example, if signings result from positive services growth, is there any impact of future cash flow as they start [ph] and how should we think about the cash flow with your sign-post or flag-post comment? Thank you.","Martin Schroeter","Sure, Jim. I think I heard it but you are -- you must be on mobile, so it was little bit hard to hear it. But I think the question was is there a correlation between planting the flag on some of the revenue trajectories and cash flow. So broadly speaking, the answer is obviously yes but it's kind of at the margin if you will. So as we turn our GPS business and we start to bring on all these new clients that we have and put them on the IBM cloud, of course, we expand the capacity of the cloud but that's already in our plans, right. So at the relationship level, everything that has to do with driving revenue is going to have an impact with cash but the way we have planned and talked about our cash flow all year has been flat year-to-year, we've recognized already that we're driving capacity into the cloud that we have to build the capacity in the scale we need and so it doesn't have an impact into the way we've guided it but obviously there is a correlation between what kind of growth we get and the cash demands if you will of the business but not different from what we've talked about all year.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Jim. Let's take one more question please.","Operator","Our last question is from Meena [ph] with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks. If you look historically at sort of the make up of the different quarters for the full, the last six years you generated roughly about 23.5% of your earnings for the full year in the third quarter. Is that based on your comments about the mainframe and the fourth quarter; is that still the right way to think about the third quarter and then you get the bulk of the benefit from the mainframe really driving the fourth quarter earnings profit?","Martin Schroeter","Well, again, I think we talked a bit about the EPS Q [ph] and we talked where I think we're going to land. But as we said for the third -- but as I said, in the fourth is where we see most of the growth begin because the mainframe in the fourth is where the bulk of it is going to sit. So you do the SKU math in terms of percentage in the third but yes, the answer is yes, we're going to see the bulk of the growth from the mainframe in the full quarter mainframe in the fourth, as well as the services signings that will have a full quarter impact. And then obviously as we go through time and we talked a bit about this on the prepared remarks and you've seen some of our announcements about for instance the cognitive delivery platform that we're building; those build as you go through time as well, and so all of that will have more of an impact in the fourth quarter.","So just to wrap up, again, quickly; we finished the first half kind of spot-on where we said we would, we've positioned ourselves now to have the second half, that we're confident we'll deliver. The path from here though as we said is pretty -- at a high level, it's an improved revenue trajectory, it's an improved GP margin trajectory, and it's an improved expense trajectory and we have now I think in the second quarter shown that the GP margin trajectory is there; we've obviously got the ability and we've showed good expense management and disciplined investments. And then on the revenue we've going to go through it piece by piece to talk about where we planted the flag and the most recent again, second quarter we'll plant the flag on GTS, so we'll drive an improved revenue trajectory.","So thank you for joining the call. We look forward to talking to you in 90 days.","Patricia Murphy","Operator, let me turn it back to you to close up the call.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today's call.

Thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings presentation.","The prepared remarks will be available in roughly an hour, and a replay of this webcast will be posted to our Investor Relations website by this time tomorrow. Our presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules.

In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue, expanded growth, pretax and net margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $4.71, up 11% year-to-year. For the full year, we delivered revenue of almost $107 billion, which was up 7%, operating pretax income of $21.6 billion, up 9%, and operating EPS of $13.44, up 15%.","Our 2011 results put us well on track to our 2015 roadmap objective. Looking at the fourth quarter by segment, we continued to build our momentum in software, our performance reflecting both strong demand for our offerings and leadership sales execution. Our software revenue was up 9%, driven by aggressive growth in our focus areas like Smarter Commerce, business analytics and storage solutions. Our software profit was up 12%.","Our Services business delivered powerful margin and profit growth, with combined pretax income of 17%. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, which were up 13% at constant currency. Our total services backlog ended the year at $141 billion. At constant currency, that's flat year-to-year and up $5 billion since September.","Within Hardware, Power Systems was up 6% as we continue to drive competitive displacements. We've now had 15 consecutive quarters of share gain in UNIX. In fact, with the exception of mainframe, which was coming off of the biggest quarter in its history last year, each of our 16 brands across the company gained or held share.","Turning to profit, our ongoing focus and productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance. Our operating gross margin was up 1.1 points to over 50%. We expanded operating pretax margins almost a full point and grew pretax income 6%. And while our tax rate was up year-to-year, we still expanded net margin above our model rate.","When you put this all together, we delivered operating EPS of $4.71, which was up 11% and $13.44 for the year, up 15%, making this our ninth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. Our strong earnings performance drove $9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $16.6 billion for the year. With that cash, we continue to invest in capital and acquisitions and we delivered significant returns to shareholders with over $18 billion in share repurchase and dividends this year.","Looking forward, we're confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand margin, grow profit, generate cash and return value to shareholders. And in 2012, we expect to deliver at least $14.85 of operating earnings per share for the year.","For the fourth quarter, revenue at constant currency was in line with our expectations. While currency provided a benefit to revenue growth of about 25 basis points in the quarter, currency movement, since we announced our third quarter earnings in October, impacted our revenue by about 1 point of growth or $300 million.","Looking at the geographies on a constant currency basis, revenue in our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. In the Americas, Canada had terrific performance, up 13%. The U.S. grew 1% off of last year's very strong growth of 10%.","In Europe, our growth rate improved compared to the third quarter. Germany returned to growth, up 4%, and once again, we had good growth in the U.K. and Spain, which were each up 9%. We've now had 9 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth in the U.K. and Spain has now grown 5 consecutive quarters, leveraging its global relationships.","Our growth markets outpaced the major markets by 8 points of revenue growth. The BRICS had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. And with nearly 2\/3 of our growth markets business outside the BRICS, all together, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth market countries, so our performance was broad based.","We're continuing to expand into new countries and territories to build out IT infrastructures in support of economic growth and to take a leadership position in key industries. This year, to drive market expansion, we opened 92 new branches and we added over 1,500 new sales reps. We gained 4 points of share in the quarter and 4 points for the year. In 2011, our growth markets grew 11%, which outpaced the majors by 10 points, and growth markets now make up 22% of our geographic revenue.","Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment, Global Technology Services constant currency revenue growth rate was consistent with the third quarter, while our Global Business Services growth rate improved. In both segments, we had great year-to-year performance in the growth markets, with double-digit constant currency revenue growth and expanding margins.","Our software business had another fantastic quarter, with strength across the portfolio, WebSphere, Information Management and Tivoli all had very good growth and gained share. In Systems and Technology, last year, we had a great fourth quarter with over 20% growth driven by a new mainframe that had almost 70% revenue growth. This quarter, we wrapped around that performance. And we had strength in POWER as we continued to extend our share gains.","Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margins improved 1.1 points to over 50%, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both Services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength of software. The services margin improvement was driven by a number of factors, including productivity improvements and mix to higher value offerings and markets. For hardware, our product mix negatively impacted margin.","Finally, our Global Financing business, which is better measured by return on equity, this quarter delivered return on equity of 42%. Now that's impressive. So now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was up 2%, in line with our revenue growth.","Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed a point of growth. And our base expense was up 1%. There was effectively no year-to-year impact from the combination of currency translation and hedging dynamics. I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. As you can see from our income statement, IP income was down $65 million year-to-year.","Second, we had an increase of about $55 million in our accounts receivable provisions, though our reserve coverage is down 30 basis points from a year ago and down 20 points since September. Typically, we talk about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense. However, this quarter was effectively no year-to-year impact on expense due to our hedging programs, consistent with the fact that currency ended up being fairly neutral on a year-to-year basis.","So now let me get into the segments. The 2 Services segments delivered $15.3 billion in revenue, up 3%. The combined Services segments grew pretax profits 17%, and pretax margin was up 2.1 points. Total outsourcing revenue was $7.2 billion, up 4%, and total transactional revenue was $6.2 billion, up 3%. Overall growth was driven by the growth markets, with constant currency revenue up double digits in the outsourcing, transactional and maintenance businesses. Total backlog in the quarter was $141 billion. At constant currency, that is flat year-to-year and up $5 billion quarter-to-quarter.","Moving on to the 2 segments in Global Technology Services, revenue was $10.5 billion, up 3%. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 3% and we gained share in the quarter and full year. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 5%. We had great performance in the growth markets where we're seeing the benefits of geographic expansion in offerings like business continuity and resiliency services.","Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter, with pretax income up 18% and pretax margin up 2.3 points to 18%. This margin expansion was driven by productivity and cost management, along with a mix into higher-margin growth markets. We had gross margin improvement in all lines of business, outsourcing, ITS and maintenance.","Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.9 billion, up 3%. Application Outsourcing revenue was up 5%, led by strong performance in the growth markets. Consulting and Systems Integration, which includes consulting, AMS systems integration and the U.S. federal business, grew 2%. At constant currency, our growth rate improved over last quarter.","Overall GBS revenue continued to be impacted by Japan and public sector. So total GBS revenue, excluding Japan and public sector, was up 9% at constant currency and up 8% for the year. And although declines in Japan and public sector continued, we did see some improved performance in public sector. Global Business Services delivered very strong profit and margin performance again this quarter. Pretax profit was up 14% year-to-year, with pretax margin up 1.8 points to 16.6%.","Now I want to spend a minute on backlog and runout as we begin 2012. Last year, in the fourth quarter, we took you through an analysis of the key drivers of Services revenue. We focused the discussion around outsourcing, and in particular, the revenue generated by the runout of the outsourcing backlog.","This year, we have expanded that analysis to give a view of the Total Services backlog runout. This view is more comprehensive and more indicative of the Total Services business as we start the year.","There are 3 primary drivers of Total Services revenue: backlog, sales into our existing contract base and new client signings. A very high percentage of services revenue, roughly 70%, comes from the runout of the backlog we start the year with. In 2012, we expect about 3% revenue growth from that backlog. This gives us a very solid base of revenue to begin the year, with the remaining revenue coming from sales into our existing accounts, which have been on a good trajectory, and new client signings.","So with that, let me wrap up the year in Services. We had very consistent revenue performance in the year driven by stability in the backlog. We continue to build out our services within the growth markets, with Total Services revenue up double digits in those markets and strong margins, with gross margin 2 points higher than that in the majors.","We continue to get good traction in the growth initiatives, cloud, business analytics and Smarter Planet. And we had great profit and margin performance in both Services segments, with GTS pretax profit up 14% and GBS up 18% as we mixed a higher value offerings and markets and continued to drive productivity.","Software had another great quarter, with revenue of $7.6 billion, up 9%. Key Branded Middleware grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter and gained share for the 17th straight quarter as we continue to extend our lead in the middleware market.","Turning to brand performance, WebSphere was up 21% and continues to gain share. Each of WebSphere's 5 product areas grew 10% or better, including our Smarter Commerce offerings, which were up over 25%. This contributed to IBM's performance in the retail industry where we have grown in each of the last 9 quarters. Information Management grew 9% and again gained share. Our distributed database grew double digits, led by strong performances from our Netezza offerings, which were up nearly 70%. This appliance complements and extends our Business Analytics portfolio with a rapidly deployed low-cost of ownership solution for high performance queries and analytics.","For the quarter, almost 1\/3 of the transactions were with new Netezza clients. Since acquiring Netezza, IBM has expanded its customer base by over 40%. And when we go head-to-head against competition in proof of concepts, we had a win rate of over 80% this quarter. Our Business Analytics software offerings, most of which are part of Information Management, continue to outpace the market with double-digit growth. IBM's acquisition of Algorithmics in the fourth quarter further strengthens our business analytics and optimization offerings by providing risk analytics capabilities that help customers make informed business decisions.","Tivoli software was up 14% and gained share, driven by storage software growth of 30%. Security solutions also delivered strong growth. With the recent acquisition of Q1 Labs, we can now offer clients a new level of intelligence around security to enable them to better predict, prevent and detect all types of security threats. Rational grew 4% and gained share, driven by strong performance in Telelogic. The fourth quarter wrapped up another powerful year for our software business.","In 2011, software revenue grew 11%, gross margin expanded by 0.5 point and software delivered nearly $10 billion of pretax profit. Systems and Technology revenue of $5.8 billion was down 8%. This performance reflects very strong growth last year, driven by mainframe growth of almost 70%. Gross profit margin was down 3 points year-to-year, with a significant impact from product mix.","Now let me take you through the brands. System z revenue declined 31% as we wrapped on the successful launch of our zEnterprise 196 last year. MIPS declined 4% this quarter. System z gross profit margin was up, reflecting a higher proportion of microcode upgrades, which is typical at this point of the product cycle. POWER grew 6%. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.","We continued our success in competitive takeouts. In the fourth quarter, we had over 350 competitive displacements which resulted in over $350 million of business. This is our strongest quarter in terms of competitive displacements since we started tracking this in 2006. Roughly 60% of this business came from HP, with most of the balance coming from Oracle\/Sun.","2011 was the second year in a row we had over 1,000 competitive displacements, which this year generated over $1 billion of business. System x revenue declined 2%. We anticipate this is in line with the market. Storage hardware revenue was down 1%. When combined with the storage software growth of 30%, the total grew 5%. Retail Store Solutions had a great quarter, up 9%, and we continued to grow share.","When you look at the full year, Systems and Technology delivered solid performance, with revenue up 6%, gross margin up 1.6 points and $1.6 billion in pretax income, up 12% year-to-year.","Turning to cash flow on a full year basis, we generated $16.6 billion of free cash flow, which is up $300 million over last year. Excluding the impact of the income tax payments driven by audit settlement activity, which I discussed in prior quarters, full year free cash flow would have been up $1.1 billion, roughly in line with our net income growth.","We continue to invest in our business, spending another $4 billion in capital expenditures. When I look at the uses of cash for the year, we returned $18.5 billion to shareholders, including $3.5 billion in dividends, and we bought back almost 89 million shares for $15 billion. At the end of the year, we had $8.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","In addition, we spent almost $2 billion to acquire 5 companies. Over the last 2 years, we spent almost $8 billion. In addition, we've announced several acquisitions that didn't close by year end, including Emptoris, DemandTec, Platform Computing and earlier this month, Green Hat. With $9 billion of free cash flow generation in the quarter and $16.6 billion for the year, we're positioned to continue to invest in innovation and return value to shareholders.","Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.9 billion, up $600 million from September. Total debt was $31.3 billion, of which $23.3 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at just over 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $8 billion, up $600 million from the third quarter and up $2.2 billion from a year ago.","Now let me spend a minute on our retirement-related plans and the impact to the balance sheet. Despite volatile market conditions in 2011, we had good returns on global assets. The discount rate environment was challenging, which resulted in an impact to equity at the end of the year. This took our debt-to-cap up to 32%. And we're comfortable operating in this range of 30% to 40%.","At the end of 2011, our defined benefits qualified plans were well funded and our cash requirements remained stable. We have supplemental charts that show the specific performance in rates, as well as a forward-looking view of the P&L and cash implications based on year-end 2011 assumptions with sensitivities. Suffice it to say that as we look forward, while changes in the return on assets and discount rate may drive some volatility in nonoperating elements of the P&L, there is little implication to our cash requirements.","So now let me start to wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance. Knowing that we faced a tough fourth quarter on revenue, we drove other elements of our model, productivity, mix and cash utilization to deliver our earnings performance. Our revenue growth contributed $0.07 to our earnings growth. Our solid gross margin expansion more than offset a higher level of expense and an increase in the tax rate.","Gross margin drove $0.19 of EPS growth, while we had a $0.02 impact from expense and a $0.04 impact from a higher tax rate. All in, margin expansion contributed $0.13. And a lower share count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed $0.26. Bottom line, we delivered 11% EPS growth in the quarter. And for the full year, we delivered 15% growth. Revenue growth was the largest contributor to our earnings growth, though we had good contribution from share repurchase and margin expansion.","So 2011 was another very good year for us, with solid revenue performance, continued margin expansion, strong profit and cash generation and effective use of cash. Our focus on key growth initiatives and investments in innovation are enabling us to expand into new markets and capitalize on trends like analytics and cloud.","Our growth market strategy to expand into new markets, build out IT infrastructures and lead in specific industries is driving powerful performance and share gains. These countries contributed almost 2\/3 of IBM's constant currency revenue growth and now represent 22% of IBM's geographic revenue.","Our Business Analytics solutions help our clients leverage massive amounts of data and content to gain insight and optimize results. This year, Business Analytics grew 16%. Our Smarter Planet initiatives generated close to 50% growth. Smarter Commerce, in particular, is gaining momentum by helping companies buy, market, sell and service their products and services. We're not just addressing an existing market, we're actually making markets. And in cloud, we're helping our clients improve the economics of IT.","This year, we continue to expand our offerings. And our cloud revenue in 2011 was more than 3x the prior year. With powerful contribution from these growth initiatives, we delivered 7% revenue growth. We said at the beginning of the year that we expect the growth in the first half of the year to be higher than the second half. By leveraging all of the elements of our model, productivity, mix and utilization of cash, we delivered operating pretax and net income growth of 9% and operating EPS growth of 15%, with double-digit growth in each of the 4 quarters.","So now, as we enter 2012, we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $14.85 for the year, with the growth rate more skewed to the second half. So we've just completed our centennial year. And as we reach this milestone, we've learned that you have to continually transform and reinvent yourself to be a leader in your industry. IBM's performance is the result of a transformation we started years ago.","We've been shifting our business to higher-value areas, improving productivity and investing to drive future growth. These changes contributed to 9 consecutive years of double-digit earnings per share growth. But more importantly, they strengthened our business and put us on track to achieve our 2015 roadmap objective of at least $20 of operating EPS.","Now Patricia and I will take your questions.","Patricia Murphy","[Operator Instructions]   Operator, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]   The first question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you comment on your perspective on customer budget activity throughout the quarter and what that may tell you about overall spending intention into 2012? And I guess related to that, outside of currency, how should we think about your overall revenue growth potential this year?","Mark Loughridge","Okay, if you look at our business equation, I mean, to be honest, Bill, we don't really judge that based on what our customers are doing with their budgets. To be honest, I don't know what they're doing with their budgets. I do know what we do with our budget, and it's very similar to the conversations that I have with other CFOs. They're looking for the best value to move their business and move their business rapidly. And so I think it's a measure of our ability to bring value to those clients. If you look at our business and evaluate that now and give us a report card on just those key investment priorities that we had, we did very, very well, I think. Business Analytics, up 16%; cloud computing, more than tripled; Smarter Planet, almost 50% growth. And you look -- now you look at the GMU, another very strong quarter from GMU, BRICS up 11%, GMU, 8 points faster than the majors. So obviously, we are satisfying value considerations within our customer set. You can see that, I think, in the surprising mix, in some respects, of our penetration within individual countries. So when you look at Europe. Europe at 1%, let's take it though and look at it by country, some pretty interesting statistics. Number one, we had Spain growing 9%. That's a fifth quarter of growth sequentially from Spain. We had the U.K. growing 9% for the 9th consecutive quarter. Germany returned to growth, up 4%. Let's look at North America. You look at the U.S., up 1%. That's on the back of that 10% growth last year, driven by our big mainframe announcement. If you look at that on a 2-year basis, that's a 5% compound growth rate, which is pretty strong performance. Canada, up 13%. Strong growth statistics on our growth markets, 40 countries at double-digit. So that's, I think, the best measure of our value, and you can see it in the individual countries. This isn't just a homogenous base across these individual geographies. You can also see it as you look at our overall share performance. So if you look at it and break down from a brand perspective into the 15, 16 composite brands in the business, I mean, we gained or held share in 15 of the 16. So we gained in ITS, Integrated Technology Services, we gained in global process services. We gained in AMS, both SO and SI. We gained in WebSphere, in Information Management, in Tivoli, in Rational, in POWER, Retail Store Solutions. The only brand that we lost share was in mainframe. Now who do you think we lost share to? We lost share to POWER series, our own product line. Every other brand held. So I think that's also a good view of how we're adding value really pretty consistently across the product line as we enter 2012. Now if you look at 2012, your second part of your question, we move into '12 starting with the software business. We had 9% growth in the quarter, about 12% profit growth, very strong performance out of our software base of business. And I\u2019d remind you that software now in 2011 is almost $10 billion of profit. That's up from the beginning of the decade when they were $2.8 billion. Big success, and we move into 2012 with a strong set of opportunities. So I would expect to see similar performance from our software business. When you look at the overall Services business, we gave you, I think, a much more comprehensive metric on revenue. This year, looking at the total backlog of $141 billion, and within that backlog, the runout of the total backlog should be up 3%, covering about 70% of the revenue we need in the year. And you look at our Hardware business, though the Hardware business was -- face a difficult compare in the first half of the year, with new announcement content by the time we get to the second half of the year, I'd expect them to generate mid-single digit growth. So once again, I think we entered the year on the value side, both brand and geographic, with a pretty strong hand.","Operator","The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.","A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the margin expansion you're seeing in the Services business. This quarter, revenues were up 3% and operating profit was up 17%. If I look at your operating margins, GTS is 18%, GBS is 14%. Those seem extremely high relative to non-Indian peers. I know you spoke to productivity enhancements, but I'd like to, a, better understand what that is. Is that just a code word for labor migration, off-shoring as a result of the headcount reductions you did at the beginning of the year, or what does it mean? And secondly, more importantly, given that you appear to be at best practice, how much room is there and how much confidence do you have that Services operating margins can continue to expand?","Mark Loughridge","Okay, first of all, very good question. Within Services, first of all, I think the Services business did a very, very good job in the year of driving towards higher value offerings and higher value content for their customer set that is able to bring in the other elements of the IBM equation from both software content and hardware business that our competitors are not able to bring to the table. So within the Services businesses, once again, they did a very good job on both the GBS side and the GTS side to continue to improve that value equation to their customer set. And as we look at the contracts that they're now moving and carrying into 2012, they've already done a very strong job on big contracts where we have more challenging financial dynamics that we know we're going to deliver in 2012. But the other point I'd make, Toni, we were very specific in the overall business model for both the 2010 roadmap and the 2015 roadmap of our attention to pull spend and drive productivity across the corporation as a global corporation. That's the $8 billion that we identified in the last Analyst Meeting. And we've done our first down payment on that right on track. Now, who do you think is a beneficiary of a lot of that structural takeout? The Services business. The Services business are a big beneficiary at that large corporate structural takeout. And to a large degree, I think a lot of that operating leverage that we get is unique to IBM and differentiated from our competition and is not given away necessarily in price. So that structure element is a big assist to our overall services margin, right on track for the objectives that we had set and a strong complement. As far as opportunity and headroom, let's look at it from the IBM equation. I mean, we\u2019re still not in the top quartile of the S&P in the tech universe. There's no reason, with the value that we bring to our customer base, that we shouldn't be in that top quartile. It's a very integrated part of our business model that we've integrated into our budgeting systems. And as I said, I do believe we ought to be able to achieve an overall economy of scale of a large corporation, and a lot of that displayed in our Services business. So as our game plan for IBM as a whole, we're going to drive that software mix within IBM, and you can see from the segment results that the PTI for our software business runs between 40% and 50%. We're going to continue to work to spend reductions and productivity, much of that delivering within our Services segment and drive value add in the customer engagement with assets, research and value-add approach.","Operator","The next question is from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, would you mind just talking a little bit more about your comment about EPS growth getting higher in the second half? What are the drivers? You grew 11% in the quarter, it would seem, then you decelerate for a few quarters and then reaccelerate to well above that in order to hit your targets. What are the drivers? Is it HDDs being alleviated? Currency cost-cutting or any product cycles that allow you to reaccelerate?","Mark Loughridge","Yes, sure. Let me now take that from the IBM level and then I'll go specifically to your question on kind of the skew in the drivers and the SKU. So as I had said in the earlier questions, if you look at the software-base of business, I think we've got real momentum going into 2012. You saw that in our fourth quarter achievement. Additionally, within that, I can tell you that our acquisition performance for the $6.2 billion of spend that we did in 2010, plus the $1.8 billion that we did, those business case and the performance of those acquisitions against the business case was about the best I've seen in years. Real traction. And I think we entered 2012 with traction on our software business. And I believe they ought to be able to generate double-digit profitability once again. I explained that in our Services business already, in the backlog runout, now against the total backlog for Services, that we already have about 3% in the backlog runout, which would comprise about 70% of our revenue. The balance of the revenue coming from new signings and base growth, even if that new signings base growth were flat, which I don't believe it will be, but even if it were, 70% of the 3 would drive 2% revenue growth in Services. And we showed last year that we could drive double-digit profitability on that base, and we will run the same plays to deliver against that again. So driving for double-digit profit growth in our Services business. The question you asked and the distinction between first half and second half, that's really the STG equation. So STG will have a tough compare in the first half compared to last year's announcement cycle on the high end. But when we get to the new announcements, we get into second half, I would expect that STG should return to mid-single digit revenue growth, and with that, double-digit profit growth. So that, all together, gives us a good handle. Now if you can compare that first half to second half, I'm talking about a couple of points difference between the growth rate that we would see in the first half and the second half. It's not like a major difference, but I do think it has a couple of points differentiation based on that hardware platform. This is, overall, very consistent, once again, with our model. Revenue growth, margin expansion on mix to software and productivity and improved usage of our cash to drive investments, acquisition and our balance sheet for share repurchase. Now like all years, we're going to acquire and we're going to divest businesses. We're going to invest in market opportunities and we're going to drive productivity wherever it's more challenging. We're going to rebalance our workforce to opportunities and skills aligned with our key investments and hire to drive in those growth initiatives. When you look at workforce rebalancing, I think it should be roughly consistent with what we've seen over the last 4 years. More specifically, I think, it would be more like 2010. Once again, if there's a charge associated to that, it would be offset above net income. But you put that all together, and I think we have a good hand as we enter 2012.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Marshall with ISI Group.","Patricia Murphy","Brian, are you there? [Technical Difficulty]","Operator","The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mark, you highlighted on this call a number of important areas that IBM is taking share, which highlights the expanding distribution and the focus on value-add offerings. You also commented that the return on recent acquisitions has been the best you've seen in some time. So I wonder why not be more aggressive on acquisitions in 2012 relative to what was a pretty quiet year in 2011 and, frankly, even potentially get more aggressive than you were in 2010 when valuations were high in some sectors.","Mark Loughridge","Well, I think that's a very fair question. I still think the best guide over the longer period, Katy, we had said that in the 2015 time frame that we saw about $20 billion of acquisition spend. In that specific calendar time frame, we've only done about $1.8 billion. I still think the $20 billion is a realistic number. We are pretty tough on the financial returns in the cases. We're very, very tough on that. If it doesn't make very strong financial sense then we're either going to hold or we're going to walk. And there have not been exceptions to that rule, at least since I've been in the job. Consequently, we're there to perform against those. Now when the market gets more reasonable on a price level, we'll move in, in a bigger way, and when it gets pricier, we\u2019ll peel back. In 2010, I thought prices were pretty reasonable. We had a lot of good candidates. We did 17 acquisitions, as I'll remind you. Things got a little frothier as we went into 2011. We did pull back, but we still had some very strong acquisitions. You've seen in the last -- in the fourth quarter, we had about 4 acquisitions. We've already done 3 this year. Within that, one aspect of that improving performance, I think, and I can't give you a precise variance analysis on it, but we've built a tool with research based on the analytic performance in all of the acquisitions that we've done since 2000. You've got to imagine that's a pretty rich database to drive that. So now when we go in and do due diligence in an acquisition, we use that analytical tool, this is called \"eating your own cooking,\" we use that analytical tool to improve our performance. So when you do an acquisition, you\u2019re going to put that team on the ground, we now know the 5 or 6 key elements that we have to actually -- absolutely nail to perform against that, and we can hit those very, very quickly. Analytics, I think, has really paid off for us. But I do think the acquisition play is a good one, and I do think the market\u2019s in a more reasonable position.","Operator","The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Mark, if I understood your commentary earlier about the backlog in Services, you've got about visibility on 2% growth in the Services business going into the year. And if that's true, the transactional business, I assume, on the margin is a big component of making up any difference over and above that. And now that we're anniversary-ing the issues that you were having in Japan, as well as public services, do we have some tailwinds in that transactional business as we get into 2012?","Mark Loughridge","Well, I -- when you look at the -- your view of tailwinds, I don't know if I would call them tailwinds. But against the way we kind of plumbed the plan, I do think they present some opportunities. So if you look at -- let's discuss that, kind of on the GBS base of business. On the GBS base of business, they were impacted in the year, and I think it was -- it would have been very difficult for them to offset this because about 1\/3 of their business is in public sector in Japan. And with the difficulties in both of those, if you airlift them out of their results, in the fourth quarter, GBS did about 9% growth. So a bit of an acceleration off the 8% that they would have done on that basis in the first, second and third quarter. So we exit the year, I think, with the balance of that business performing pretty well. As we go into 2012, we should start to wrap on the public sector performance. We should also start to wrap on the issues in Japan. And so I do think that gives us an opportunity to improve performance, but we haven't banked on that as we built our budgets and our structure.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Mark, considering the margin improvements in both Software and Services, I want to get a sense if you could help us understand the buckets of cloud, Smarter Planet and Business Analytics? You talked about or referenced a really nice growth there in terms of revenue. How are the 3 key components of hardware, services and software represented in those buckets? Are they similar to the corporate average? Are they below or above? Because I'm trying to get a sense of as those 3 initiatives continue to grow faster and faster, they're more service- and software-laden, are you going to get even a better margin momentum story down the road?","Mark Loughridge","Yes, well, that's a very, very good question because if you look at the construct underneath that, boy, I can't tell you how structured we are on those growth initiatives, GMU, Smarter Planet, Business Analytics, cloud computing. And within that, if you look at -- let's take consulting and consulting's role. Is consulting's role in those simply to provide consulting content and value add? That's part of it, but it\u2019s also to create the entr\u00e9e for our software value add and our hardware content as well. So if you look at that construct behind Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and cloud computing, more than half of that is software. And that's what we're looking for. More than half of it is software. Software, again, you can see this segment, as well as anybody, that's come in at very high PTI margins, very high value add to our customer set. Some of the plays we've called there on security, on commerce, commerce has been a very, very -- Smarter Commerce is very, very successful for us in that blend of our organic spend and the acquisitions that we've done. So that's the objective, good question. Big software mix within that, over half of the revenue, software revenue.","Operator","Next question comes from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Mark, I wanted to ask on services-related questions. Number one, at the end of 2012 -- the backlog runoff charge is helpful. At the end of 2012, would you anticipate that the backlog that you report will be higher or lower based on the runoff schedule? And I know that backs into some of the signings. And related to that, is -- the transaction businesses were a little bit weaker for IBM this quarter and I think have been weaker for all the service providers. And so to get back to a previous question, with the backlog runoff, can you do constant currency growth in services, more broadly if 2% to 3%, if there is a persistent weakness in the transactional side?","Mark Loughridge","Well, I think, actually, you look at the fourth quarter performance, I thought we did pretty well on the transactional content. I think to pick one, we entered 2012 with our stronger positions in our ITS transactional services as we go into the year. And actually our transactional backlog on a year-to-year basis was pretty strong. So one way to kind of look at that is if you look at that backlog runout that we described in the presentation, last year, had we analyzed that, more of the backlog runout would have been driven by our outsourcing business. This year, consistent with year-to-year dynamics in backlog, more of that backlog runout is driven by the transactional businesses. So I think it's part of -- it's reflected in both of those metrics, which are quite consistent. And once again, I think it does put us in a good position as we enter 2012.","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.","Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to go back to Bill's question earlier, Mark, and just ask you specifically whether you've seen any of the lengthening of sales cycles or additional levels of approval that one of your major competitors on the software side talked about during the December quarter. And then maybe just a comment about -- I think you've talked about this a little bit, but how you feel about the pipeline for Services and Software as we head into Q1?","Mark Loughridge","Sure. When you look at the overall -- let's start with the pipeline. When you look at the overall pipeline going into 1Q for Software and Services, I mean, I think they looked pretty good. The Software has a very strong set of offerings. And I think the strength and momentum we've seen in the offerings is most conservative. On the Services side, I mean, we've already had a very large win-back from one of our competitors that's driven pretty good quarter-to-date performance in our business. So I feel pretty good about those. As far as lengthening of the sales cycle and more approvals, I do think people and CFOs are cautious about their business, and they want to make sure they have the right processes engaged. And we did see that. But on the other hand, they're also looking for value to apply to the business equations. And I think if you can bring real value to apply to those business equations, it puts you in a stronger position. So that's why I think, in our fourth quarter, we saw a pretty good performance in our business, especially in those key investment categories and our software business.","Operator","Next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","Mark, in your prepared remarks, you talked about share gains in just about all the key software brands. And you specifically mentioned an 80% win rate in bake-off situations. Can you remind us what this had been in prior quarters? And specifically, can you share any details from your win-loss analysis versus Oracle and whether anything is changing there?","Mark Loughridge","Well, I mean if you look at -- let's look at this from a couple of perspectives. One way we can look at it is from the Netezza perspective. Now Netezza turned out to be a very, very strong acquisition for us. In fact, the revenue was up 70%. We were sold out. I mean, we could have done even better on Netezza but we sold out the box. Behind that, in each of the proof of concepts that we ran versus Oracle, we won 85% of the time. So that's a pretty strong statement. Now let's look at it from another dimension. Let's look at it from pSeries performance. If you look at the competitive displacements that we had in the quarter, we had 350 competitor displacements, driving $350 million. That's 1,000 for the year and $1 billion for the year. $350 million -- or 350, that's the best quarter we've had since we started tracking this in 2006. And if you look at the content between those competitive displacements, 60% came from Hewlett-Packard, and 40%, the balance, was primarily driven from Oracle.","Operator","The last question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I was hoping to ask a question on the premium growth from your growth markets in Q4, but also sort of within the context of your 2015 roadmap. And I guess 2 things, one is you\u2019re only 1\/5 of the way into that roadmap, but I'm wondering if you feel like ahead of that plan to reaching 30% of revenue. And then more specifically, is that dependent on kind of emerging market economies simply outgrowing mature economies? Or is there a lot of IBM specifics that go into it in terms of your investments there in footprint, OpEx, CapEx, et cetera?","Mark Loughridge","Okay. Well, if you look at the growth market performance for the quarter, as we said, 8 points better than the majors for the year or 10 points better. At 10 points better, we did 10 points better this year, we did 10 points better last year but the prior 2 years were both 8 points better. So that differential, it's hard to look at that differential and not conclude it's relatively improving for the last few years and driving our mix equation. So we do feel pretty good about that mix performance. What I really feel good about is the profit performance behind that growth because they are a big contributor. So if you look at the performance that we saw in the quarter, at their relative mix, they drove about 42% of the profit growth that we had on a growth -- so that was a very strong contributor. If you look at the dependencies there, number one, I think we bring a lot of value to those geographies. So if you look at that value construct, I mean, a play like Smarter Planet plays in a very big way in our growth markets. Secondly, we're able to roll out with our structural advantage on the back-office, the central structure of the business, we can move into new cities without recreating that back-office. It's as if you have a -- kind of a -- for lack of a better word, a branch in a box and you plug in the back-office. And the back-office is running the systems across the geographies. I think that gives us an advantage. And then third, not to be -- plus we have a very good reputation, very good reputation and very good brand image in our growth markets as well. So we feel pretty confident in that play. So a lot of good questions. Let me wrap up now, just make a few comments. We just delivered a great quarter to cap off what I think was a great 2011. For the year, we generated 7% revenue growth to almost $107 billion. We expanded margin in line with our model and delivered $13.44 of operating EPS, which is our ninth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. Looking forward to 2012, we see good opportunity in our growth markets and in our higher value solutions like analytics and Smarter Planet, where we believe our enterprise clients will continue to focus. And we'll leverage the strength and flexibility of our business model, driving productivity, improving mix and using our capital effectively. So this all supports our expectation of at least $14.85 of operating earnings per share for the year. That's up 10.5% and keeps us right on track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. So thanks for joining us, and now it's back to work.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended.

In the fourth quarter, we improved our year-to-year revenue growth rate, primarily in higher margin areas, driving significant margin expansion and profit growth. We delivered operating earnings per share of $5.39, which is up 14% year-to-year and generated $9.5 billion of free cash flow.For the full year, we delivered revenue of $104.5 billion and expanded gross pre-tax and net margins. Our operating EPS for the year was up 13% to $15.25 and we generated $18.2 billion of free cash flow. That\u2019s up over $1.5 billion year-to-year.Now let me put this full year EPS and cash flow performance in perspective. This is the tenth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. So a decade at a double-digit pace. And $18.2 billion of free cash flow is $12 billion higher than a decade ago. That\u2019s an increase in the cash flow we generate in a year, not accumulative increase.Looking at our fourth quarter by segment, our performance was led by continued momentum in our growth initiatives and successful product launches in our high end systems. Both of which drive a more profitable mix. We had another good quarter in software. The performance was broad-based driven by business analytics, smarter commerce and cloud, with strength in several of the emerging areas where we have been targeting our investments like social business, mobile and security. Our new hardware product introductions really performed in the quarter.We had excellent acceptance of our new mainframe and our System Z revenue was up 56% year-to-year. So it has been a very successful launch. Not only in major markets but in growth markets where we were up 65%. And we had significant growth in our mainframe specialty engines, led by Linux. This is a good indicator not only of new workloads moving on to the platform but also the value of a vertically integrated system.The year to year revenue performance on our total services business was fairly consistent with last quarter. Once again we had strength in all of our growth initiatives which are becoming a larger part of the business. While IBM\u2019s revenue was down 1% at actual rates, it was up 1% at constant currency adjusting for the divestiture of our retail store solutions business. That\u2019s a 2 point improvement from last quarter\u2019s constant currency growth rate. Consistent with our business model to move to higher value areas, we had revenue growth in our higher margin businesses.The improving business mix and our productivity initiatives drove 10% growth in operating pre-tax and net income. Now looking at the margin dynamics, we expanded operating gross margins by over two points with improvement across our major segments in a continued mix to software. With our ongoing focus on expense productivity, we improved operating PTI margin by 2.6 points. This quarter our operating tax rate was flat year to year and we continue to expect an operating effective tax rate in the range of 25% for 2013.Our net income margin was up almost two points and with 12 billion in gross share repurchase over the last 12 months, we reduced our share count by 4%. When you pull this all together, we delivered operating EPS of $5.39 which is up 14%. For the year, operating EPS was up 13% to $15.25. Our strong earnings performance drove $9.5 billion of free cash flow. Terrific performance for the quarter and for the year over $18 billion of free cash flow, a record for IBM.Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand our margins, grow profit, generate cash, and deliver shareholder value. And in 2013, we expect to deliver at least $16.70 operating earnings per share for the year, keeping us on track to our objective of at least $20 in 2015. Looking at the geographies on a constant currency basis, Americas revenue was up 1% led by terrific growth in Latin America. The U.S. revenue was down 1%, a 3 point improvement in the year-to-year growth rate compared to third quarter. Canada was down 9% off of last year\u2019s very strong growth of 13%.EMEA\u2019s revenue decline of 3% reflects the macroeconomic climate in the region. It was challenging this quarter in the UK and Germany though we did see an improvement in Italy. Asia Pacific growth improved to 5% led by Japan. Early in 2012, we said that we expected our performance in Japan to stabilize in the second half of the year. And in fact, we returned to growth this quarter. So we had great performance from the team in Japan. Across all of the geographies our growth markets delivered 7 points of outpacing major market by 9 points. The BRIC countries delivered 14% growth, the strongest quarter of the year. Brazil contributed to almost 20% growth in Latin America.We also had good performance in Africa, led by South Africa and the Middle East. In fact across all of our growth markets, we had double-digit growth in over 30 growth market countries reflecting ongoing broad-based strength.Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment, year-to-year revenue performance in our combined services businesses was fairly consistent with the third quarter. At constant currency, Global Business Services year-to-year performance improved modestly while Global Technology Services revenue growth slowed a bit. We had good results across our software business with growth in all of the key brands and particular strength and share gains in WebSphere, Lotus and Rational.In System Technology, we returned to growth adjusting for the divested RSS business. This was driven by powerful performance in System Z.Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 2.1 points to 52.3%, driven by a combination of the strong mainframe growth, good margin expansion in both services segments and improving segment mix due to the relative strength of software. Finally, our Global Financing Business delivered over 40% return on equity.So now let\u2019s take a look at our expense profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 2%. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. Year-to-year benefit from currency translation and hedging moderated this quarter, contributing about a point of expense decline. Consequently, our base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was better by 3 points.Turning to the expense items that have more significant year-to-year profit impact, I\u2019ll comment on just one item. Our accounts receivable provision was about $20 million in the quarter, an improvement of almost $70 million from last year when we increased the provisions to reflect the European credit environment. Typically, we talk about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense. However, this quarter, there was effectively no period or year-to-year impact on expense due to our hedging programs.So now let me get into the segments. In the quarter, the two services segments delivered $15 billion in revenue, grew pre-tax profit 4% and expanded pre-tax margin by 1 point. Total backlog was $140 billion, up $1 billion year-to-year of constant currency, driven by growth in the transactional businesses.From a geographic perspective, the growth markets backlog was up 15% at constant currency. For the year, the combined services business grew profit 10% and expanded margin by nearly 2 points, excluding workforce rebalancing charges in the third quarter.Turning to the two segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10.3 billion, down 2% as reported and flat at constant currency. There were two major categories within the major markets that affected revenue growth. First, we did a tremendous amount of work to address a number of low margin contracts to improve the profitability of the outsourcing portfolio. We see the benefits of that work in our profit and our margin performance, though it does have some impact on revenue. This quarter, the impact was 1 point of revenue growth to GTS and to services in total.Second, we saw a decline in revenue from sales and volumes into existing base accounts. This activity tends to be more transactional in nature and economically sensitive. You can see the impact of these in our GTS outsourcing revenue which was down 2% at constant currency.In outsourcing, we continued to have strong performance in growth markets with revenue up 8% and backlog up 9%, both at constant currency. This backlog growth reflects an ongoing trend as our clients are building out their infrastructures and scaling to meet the growth objectives of their businesses.In Integrated Technology Services, revenue was up 3% at constant currency with the growth markets up double digits at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered 5% pre-tax profit growth in the quarter and expanded pre-tax margin by over 1 point. This quarter, margin expansion resulted from increased efficiency and productivity from our focus on automation and processes, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives.Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, which is down 3% as reported and down 2% at constant currency. From a geographic perspective, the growth markets turned in solid performance and the recovery in Japan continued as they grew for the second consecutive quarter.Looking at the GBS businesses by offering, the growth initiatives continue to drive strong performance. We had solid double digit growth in Business Analytics, Smarter Planet and Cloud and for the year, these initiatives now represent over a third of our total GBS revenue. So as we retool the GBS business and mix to higher value work, these larger, more complex engagements are having a positive effect on GBS backlog. In fact GBS backlog has now grown for the fourth consecutive year at constant currency though mixing to longer duration engagements. And as I stated last quarter, we have been taking actions to address the more traditional package application work.We have added partners to this base and have increased sales capability. We have targeted and closed large transformation opportunities in the growth markets and we have already seen some success in building the backlog in those areas this quarter.Turning to profit, GBS pretax income was flat year-to-year and pretax margin expanded 0.5 point. Improved utilization and service delivery helped to overcome the impact from revenue. For total services, we are providing you with additional detail around the projected total services revenue run out from backlog in 2013. This includes the impact to revenue from the work we have done to restructure a number of lower margin contracts in our outsourcing business primarily in the U.S.Now keep in mind that revenue generated from backlog is approximately 70% of total revenue in any year, with the remainder coming from transactional signings in the year and sales and volumes in our existing client base. In 2013, the projected revenue generated from backlog is up 1%. This includes 2% growth from the backlog and 1% [hurt] from those restructured contracts. But despite the impact to revenue growth, these restructured contracts have lifted the profitability of the portfolio. They provide substantial year-to-year growth profit improvement in 2012 which carries through to 2013 and will contribute modest profit growth in 2013 off this higher profit base.So for total services, as we enter 2013, we will continue to drive our key plays and shift towards higher value content. We will continue to invest in the growth markets, which now represents over 20% of total services revenue and is where we see the most opportunity for growth. We will continue to be aggressive in transforming our portfolio to higher value content and away from the more commoditizing labor based content. Our profit and margin performance will continue to benefit from the work we are doing with research and software to infuse more and more IP into our offerings.In addition, Services is the primary beneficiary of our focus on enterprise productivity. Overall, we think we have a good set of opportunities to continue to drive profit growth and margin expansion in 2013. Software revenue of $7.9 billion was up 3% of 4% at constant currency. Key branded [middleware] grew 6% at constant currency and gained share as we continue to be the clear leader in the middleware market. We had continued momentum in our growth initiatives with strong performance in business analytics, smarter commerce and cloud. These initiatives cross all of our software brands.Our results reflect the sustained investments in our strategic branded software. In addition to our organic investments, acquisitions provide additional capabilities while leveraging the existing portfolio of offerings. For example, in the first quarter of 2012 we acquired Worklight, a provider of mobile software which enables enterprises to manage and secure mobile applications. Worklight is now an important addition to our mobile strategy and has accelerated from $1 million a year business when it was acquired, to generating tens of millions for the year. Worklight is just one example of our ability to leverage and grow acquired businesses.Looking across our software portfolio, we grew the pre-IBM transactional revenue of our 2012 acquisitions by nearly five times. Now let me take you through the revenue drivers from a brand perspective. WebSphere grew 11% and continued gain share. We continue to expand our portfolio to capture the emerging opportunity around mobile computing and saw significant uplift in some of our core WebSphere offerings, such as application servers and commerce. As a result, we are well positioned to continue to help enterprises build, connect, run and manage their mobile applications.Information management was up 3% at constant currency and held share. We had strong performance in information integration and predictive analytics, both driven by big data. Tivoli software was up 5% at constant currency and held share. Performance was led by our storage and our security offerings. Revenue from our storage portfolio was up 13% at constant currency reflecting the value of storage software. Tivoli Security was up 16% at constant currency, driven by Q1 Labs which provides next generation security intelligence.We continued to transform the Lotus portfolio to the faster growing social business offerings and consequently, we had 9% growth in Lotus revenue, gained share and had a great quarter. This was driven by strong performance from our existing social business offerings and the recent acquisition of Kenexa, which we closed in December. Kenexa, a leading provider of recruiting and talent management solutions, helps clients create a more efficient and effective workforce and brings a unique combination of Cloud based technology and consulting services to an already extensive portfolio of social business solutions.Rational posted double digit growth of 12% and gained share. Software had a solid quarter, with revenue up 4% at constant currency, pre-tax income up 8% and pre-tax margins up 2.4 points. The fourth quarter rounds out another good year for our software business.Systems and technology delivered revenue of $5.8 billion, up 4% adjusting for the divestiture of retail store solutions. This performance was driven by our new mainframe and momentum in PureSystems, our expert integrated system. In fact, in its introductory year, we have already sold more than 2300 PureSystems in more than 70 countries.System Z revenue grew 56%, driven by our first full quarter of our new mainframe. MIPS grew 66% year-to-year. This is the largest quarter of MIPS shipments in history. About half of these MIPS were specialty engines, which were up 80% year-to-year, driven by Linux workloads, a good indicator or new workloads moving to the platform. Growth in Z was up 50% in the major markets and up over 65% in the growth markets. In the growth markets, we had strong sales to our established as well as new mainframe customers. This performance reflects a technology leadership and value of our vertically integrated stack that IBM\u2019s new flagship server is delivering to our customers. It is simply the fastest and most capable enterprise system to date.Turning to Power where revenue was down 19%, our new P7 Plus midrange and high end Power servers performed well. We will continue the refresh of the Power portfolio in the first half of 2013.Our success in competitive take outs continued in the fourth quarter. We had over 350 competitive displacements, resulting in over $335 million of business, about half of which came from Oracle Sun and half from HP. For the year, we had nearly 1,200 competitive displacements resulting in over $1 billion of business.Our storage hardware revenue was down 5% driven by tape. Disc was flat. Within Disc, we announced the new high end DS8870 in October and it was sold out in the quarter. This will continue to ramp in the first quarter.Our systems and technology pretax income was up 23% year-to-year, driven by new product introductions in mainframe, power, storage and of course PureSystems.Across all of our segments, we\u2019re continuing the strong performance in our key growth initiatives. These are not standalone offerings but integrated into our client offerings and included within our segment results.In the growth markets, our revenue was up 7% at constant currency and these countries now represent 24% of IBM\u2019s geographic revenue. That\u2019s up 8 points since 2006 when we introduced our 2010 roadmap. So we\u2019ve been very successful in capturing the opportunity in these faster growing markets. We\u2019re doing this by continuing to expand into new countries and territories to build out IT infrastructures in support of economic growth and to take a leadership position in key industries. To drive market expansion in 2012, we accelerated our opening of new branch offices. This year we doubled the number of face to face branches, bringing the total number of face to face and virtual branches in the growth markets to almost 450. So this is tremendous growth.Our business analytics initiative continues to expand, allowing clients to make informed decisions everywhere in their organization to improve outcomes and to manage risk. We made significant strides and expanded our leadership position in a number of strategic areas, including risk management, price and promotion optimization and sales performance management, just to name a few. Our value proposition and business analytics uniquely leverages the integration between our software portfolio and GBS consulting expertise. This year business analytics grew 13% led by our GBS consulting practice.Our SmartCloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements. We have seen continued strong demand for our foundational offerings in hardware and software that help companies build and run their private clouds, as well as for cloud-based solutions like our SaaS offerings. With strong global growth, our cloud revenue for the year was up 80%. In 2012, we launched our family of PureSystems expert integrated systems as well as our SmartCloud Enterprise Plus public and managed private cloud offerings for large enterprises. These offerings further extend our cloud capabilities.We saw tremendous expansion of our Smarter Planet growth initiative over the last 12 months measured in terms of offerings, markets, customers, and revenue. Our clients are leveraging our growing capabilities in areas like smarter commerce or acquisitions such as Emptoris, DemandTec and Tealeaf helped fuel growth in new market segments. Social business for our industry leading social platform and Kenexa, come together in a powerful combination to allow our clients to engage a smarter, more effective workforce.Smarter cities which includes a portfolio of solutions ranging from public safety to social services to intelligent water systems. And finally, our next generation analytics systems like Watson which are helping tackle some of the most complex challenges facing our customers. For the year, our Smarter Planet solutions generated more than 25% revenue growth. When you look at our offerings in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of our revenue is software. So as these offerings become larger parts of the IBM business, they are driving a higher quality revenue stream, improving our mix and our margin.Turning to cash flow, we generated $9.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That\u2019s up almost $600 million year-to-year. In line with past year, is about half of our annual cash flow was generated in the fourth quarter. And on a full year basis, we generated $18.2 billion of free cash flow which is up $1.6 billion over last year. Within our strong free cash flow performance, our capital investments are up by almost $250 million. The year-to-year improvement in free cash flow reflects our growth in net income and as you will recall the fact that our 2011 cash flow was impacted by income tax payments for audit settlement activity in the first quarter of last year.When I look at the uses of cash for the year, we continue to return significant value to shareholders including $3.8 billion in dividends and we bought back $61 million for $12 billion. Net of the cash we received from options and employee stock related transactions, our cash outflow for share repurchases was $10.5 billion. At the end of the year, we had $8.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. In addition, we spent $3.7 billion to acquire 11 companies. In the fourth quarter we acquired Kenexa. Over the course we acquired DemandTec, Emptoris, Platform Computing, Tealeaf and Texas Memory Systems, to name a few to add to our capabilities in analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet.We also acquired Vivisimo, which expands the breadth of IBM\u2019s big data capabilities and creates the most complete end to end big data solution for our clients. Over the last three years we have spent $11.5 billion for acquisitions. To wrap up the cash dynamics for the year, we generated $18.2 billion of free cash flow and spent $18 billion on acquisitions, net share repurchase and dividends.Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.1 billion. Total debt was $33.3 billion of which $24.5 billion was in support of our financing business which is leveraged at 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $8.8 billion down $1.6 billion for the third quarter and up $800 million from a year ago. Now let me spend a minute on our retirement related plans and the impact to the balance sheet.Despite volatile market conditions in 2012, we had good returns on global assets exceeding our expected return on assets in the U.S. and on a global basis. But the discount rate environment remained challenging, resulting in $5 billion impact to equity at the end of the year due to the pension liability re-measurement. As a result, our debt to cap ended the year at 36%, up 4 points year-to-year, including a 6 point impact from the pension re-measurement.At the end of 2012, our defined benefit qualified plans continued to be well funded and our cash requirements remain stable. We have included supplemental charge to cover ongoing dynamics in our pension plans. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility.So now let me wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance. Our total revenue performance had little impact on our profit growth, but we did have good revenue growth in our higher margin areas which significantly contributed to margin expansion and profit growth. You see this in our margin expansion which was the largest contributor, driving $0.47 of EPS growth through a combination of gross margin improvements and expense productivity and a lower share count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed $0.24. Bottom line, we delivered 14% EPS growth in the quarter and 13% for the year. As you can see, the profile for the full year is very similar to the fourth quarter.Our results demonstrate the strength and flexibility of IBM\u2019s business model, which is designed to deliver profit in cash on a sustained basis. In 2012, we continued to deliver value to our clients and capitalize on key trends. We had strong performance in Analytics and Cloud and Smarter Planet, key initiatives that leverage our software portfolio and contribute to our margin expansion. We continue to expand our capabilities and build out infrastructures in emerging markets. This year, our growth markets revenue outpaced major markets by 8 points.We continue to invest for innovation. Our investments supported the introduction of our new System Z mainframe, our PureSystems offerings and our new storage and Power7 Plus products and we just were named number one in U.S patents for the 20th consecutive year, with many of the patents issued this year in key areas like analytics and big data, cyber security, Cloud, mobile, social networking and software environments.We invested almost $4 billion in 2012 to acquire 11 companies, adding significant capabilities to support our growth initiatives. At the same time, we divested our retail store solutions business as we focused our smarter commerce portfolio on the higher value IP based opportunities. So as you can see, in 2012 we continued the transformation of the business, shifting to higher value areas and improving our structure. This results in a higher quality revenue stream.So while our overall revenue performance was modest, we had 8% growth in our operating net income and expanded net income margin by 1.6 points, well above our model level and we delivered operating EPS growth of 13% for a decade of double digit EPS growth and over $18 billion of free cash flow, a record for IBM. This demonstrates a flexibly of the IBM business model.In 2013 we\u2019ll continue this transformation. We\u2019ll acquire key capabilities, divest the businesses, rebalance our workforce and invest in innovation. Bottom line, we\u2019re continuing to retool our skills and our offerings to shift to higher value and meet our clients\u2019 needs. We\u2019ve taken all of this account in our view of 2013. We expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $16.70 for the year, with the first half growth rates slightly higher than the second. And now, two years into our 2015 roadmap, we are well on track to our objective of at least $20 of operating earnings per share.Now Patricia and I will take your questions.Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multipart questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. Operator, please open it up for questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator(Operator instructions). The first question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.Bill Shope \u2013 Goldman SachsThank you. On your prior earnings call, you had mentioned that the month of September was more challenging than the first two months of the third quarter. Can you talk about how the broader demand environment and your execution evolved into the December quarter? And was there anything unusual this time around that you would call out in terms of linearity?Mark Loughridge","Good question, Bill. Really if you look at the monthly performance across the quarter, it was really pretty constant. We saw a good performance through the quarter. Obviously, within that we feel very, very good about the performance we saw in our software business with key branded middleware up 6%, a breakout performance from our Z Series content, revenue up 56%. Within that the growth markets up a, I think, spectacular 65%. MIPS up 66%, the biggest MIPS performance in the history of the IBM Corporation.And so ongoing contribution from our base businesses. And with all that, to generate half of our free cash flow in the quarter and a total of $18.2 billion, the largest ever, up $1.6 year-to-year. I think that was just a very, very strong quarter. But if you look across the months, it was fairly constant month-to-month.OperatorThe next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford BernsteinI was wondering if you could comment on your expectation for services revenue growth in 2013. The reason that I ask is, I think on the fourth quarter call last year you talked about getting about 3 points of revenue growth from your backlog driven businesses. And you ended up with services at constant currency about flat this year, suggesting that non-backlog revenue growth was down about 6% in the year. So if you are looking at backlog revenue growth or revenue from backlog only growing about 1% this year, and again you struggled and had weak current period revenue growth this year. Why shouldn\u2019t we be thinking about revenue growth being down in 2013 in the services business overall?Mark LoughridgeSo very good question. Let's start by looking at our GBS business. So the GBS business, if you look at the backlog over the last four years, they have actually been growing that backlog each year as they move into 2013. Now within that, as we explained in our third quarter call dynamics, you see a retooling if you will, or a mix shift, into these higher value initiatives that are so important to the IBM Corporation because those growth initiatives drive about 50% software in their mix and so they have a very high profit for the corporation. But if you look at that retooling from the GBS perspective, they tend to be longer duration.And so as we look at that duration and four years of backlog growth, both transactional and in total for GBS, we feel that as we enter 2013 GBS should once again return to revenue growth. If you look at the point that you had made on backlog run out, we included that very discrete chart for the following reason. If you look at the backlog content moving into the year, we were impacted to some degree by the contracts that we restructured as we went through the end of 2011 to 2012. And that magnitude was about a point.Now that\u2019s the point on revenue. How did that perform on a gross profit basis? The fact is, it was a substantial improvement in our growth profit dollars. In 2012 we had a lot of growth in our GTS business driven by that. But that improvement in gross profit dollars in the sense, Toni, it raises the waterline and continues into 2013. And that\u2019s a very big point. That improvement that we saw across those contracts because we maintained about 80% of the revenue within those contracts generally drove a much higher level of gross profit dollars in the ongoing base that we will enjoy this year. And in fact we will see some modest improvement in the year-to-year gross profit from those contracts moving into next year.So net-net, the gross profit dollars coming out of the backlog are much stronger because of that. So we expect the overall performance of the gross profit dollars coming out of the backlog to be more typical of say a 2% backlog growth and necessarily 1%. At 2%, very close to the dynamic we saw last year. And with that dynamic, the services businesses did a good job of driving to the model.And I think the last point that I would make in this roll-out, we had about $3 billion worth of very strong contracts roll-out off the fourth quarter into the first quarter. We have already closed $1 billion of this. And if you look at the complexion of those contracts, they come in the -- many of them in the growth markets where we\u2019re having real success on that operations \u2013 and the value-adds that we\u2019re showing our customer base. You see it reflected really in the backlog in our growth markets which for total services base, that backlog is up 15%. So, really strong performance on that basis. You put all that together, we feel very confident as we go into 2013 that the profit generation from our service business in total should meet our model expectations and frankly, if you look at the first quarter of 2013, we think that the services business to generate double digit profit growth.OperatorThe next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays","Hi. Mark, wanted to talk a little bit more about your roadmap. Your tone sounds a lot better than three months ago. You've grown EPS over the last three years in the mid-teens, maybe 14% average or so and 13.5% this year. And in order to make the roadmap, all you have to do is grow 9.5% the next three years to get there. So that would be slower than you've been doing. Can you talk about your confidence and overachievement and maybe preview some of the tone in what you may say at your Analyst Day coming up soon?Mark Loughridge","Sure. Well, I think when you look at it, that at least number for 2013 at $16.70; I would have said that, Ben that rounds to $10, but at any rate. At $16.70, that's the at least number for the beginning of year and I think if you look at that relative position, that\u2019s pretty consistent with what we've said the last couple of years. Additionally I\u2019d point out, when you look at the generation of value from the Corporation, I think it's worth stepping back and just recognizing that the performance that we saw in 2012 was in fact the 10th year of double-digit EPS growth out of this place. That is a pretty big number. So underneath it, to drive that, we've driven this business to big growth opportunities in the higher value, higher margin spaces.Stepping back again, you think about since 2010 alone, we've invested $19 billion in R&D, $12 billion in 34 acquisitions. If you look at the enterprise productivity initiatives that we're driving for $8 billion over the roadmap, fully about 60% of that is driven to reinvest in growth initiatives like GMU, Smarter Planet, cloud and Business Analytics. So from my perspective, to drive that level of performance we're plowing investments hand over fist, back into the business. Now what are the results? Are we seeing this? Well, let's look at Software. Since 2000, Software has gone from $2.4 billion annually. 2012 we did $4 billion in the fourth quarter alone and $11 billion for the year.Free cash flow, that $18.2 billion that we talked about, 2000 was $6.7 million and in fourth quarter of '12 we had the largest MIPS shipment in the history of the Corporation, with our GMU content going from 16% of our business mix to 24% since the 2006 initiation of the business model. So I think as we look forward those growth initiatives, the effect that they're having, their ability to continue to move that higher value content and continue that growth gives us a lot of confidence, not only in what we'd see in 2013, but our remaining roadmaps to 2015.Ben Reitzes \u2013 BarclaysOkay. Thanks a lot.OperatorThe next question comes from Steven Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.Steven Milunovich \u2013 UBS SecuritiesA question on the Power side. I guess the 90% decline, I was a little surprised there, particularly since you had indicated you had a new high-end product. Is this the UNIX business finally kind of turning over like everybody else's? And I was also curious, how much of your PureSystems, what's the hardware breakout there S86 versus Power?Mark LoughridgeWell, if you look at \u2013 for your first question, Steve, one thing that we've recognized in the rollout of the cycle of the product introduction, when we introduced new Z cycle product, it hits right with the announcement and you've seen that in the performance that we've generated in this fourth quarter. Frankly, in a Power systems announcement, many of those volumes go to our customers and product test evaluations before that customer goes to volume shipment.And so generally in a Power announcement, volume shipment, especially for mid-range and high-end which we had in our announcement, that will lag by a couple of quarters. So I wouldn\u2019t really expect to see the volume shipment again, those announcements, till we get into the second quarter of 2013. Now with that, Power once again had a very strong competitive replacement. You know 330 customers, over 300 million. And if you look at that mix, about half from HP and half from Oracle, Sun. But the effect of that overall volume shipment really we will see in about the second quarter of 2013.OperatorThe next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.David Grossman - Stifel NicolausMark, can we just follow-up a question I was asked earlier. Obviously the focus on margin impacts revenue growth, so how should we really think about this trade-off as we go forward through the road-map. As revenue growth accelerates, we prepared for margin expansion to moderate even though we are getting some benefits from mix.Mark LoughridgeWell, I guess I would look at it this way. First of all, let's look at the operational, model driven plays to drive margin. And if you looked at our -- maybe one way to look at it -- let's look at the fourth quarter. So fourth quarter PTI margin expanded by 2.1 points. That\u2019s about $2 billion. And I would attribute about half of that to the ongoing effect of the model driven initiatives from margin. And those two model driven initiatives are continuing to mix to higher margin categories like the software business. And then the second category would be all of this spend takeout that we see in kind of the support structures around the business that we call the globally integrated enterprise.Well, I don\u2019t think either of those impact your go-to-market pricing content that you see in your business. That go-to-market pricing content, it\u2019s really going to be dependent on the competitiveness of your offerings at the client, not the spend structure in your back office enterprise. Nor will that margin improvement impact revenue growth simply by mixing into those higher margin spaces like software. And I think if you looked at that 2.1 points of margin growth in the fourth quarter, I would attribute about half of that to those ongoing initiatives we have to drive performance in margin for the business units.The other half were unique items that we drove during the year. So a good example of unique item that did drive real profitability was the work we did on those contracts that we did in services. To restructure them with our customers we maintained about 80% of the revenue but the profit generation out of it was quite significant. And that play alone produced about a third of that balance of a point of margin growth in the billion dollars. That generation is going to continue into 2013 because once again I would describe that as if we raised the water level on the ongoing contract performance.OperatorThe next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners. You may ask your question.Rob Cihra - Evercore PartnersI was wondering with the software shortfall you had in Q3, a meaningful part of that at the time you had attributed to growth markets and it looks like obviously you closed that in Q4. I am just wondering if that\u2019s, you feel a function of growth markets environment getting better or were you simply able to close those and yet you are still looking at growth markets that maybe the environment is still weak. So I am just wondering how much of that is sort of improvement in the environment or simply you are booking those and the environment is still soft?Mark LoughridgeNo, I think we had performance in the fourth quarter from our software business. It was more consistent with the ongoing performance we are looking for in their business model. So I think they did a pretty strong job here as they went through the quarter. Let's just go through some of the elements. IDC now ranks them number one in bringing social software to the business environment. Tivoli grew 5% against strength in the overall storage offerings. Rational, 12%, gained share. WebSphere, 11%, gained share. Information Management, up 3%. So if you look across that base of business, we had very strong performance across the board. I thought they did a very nice job in transitioning from the third quarter and as we looked at 2013, we think we ought to be looking at revenue growth in the mid-single-digits and very strong profit performance once again.","Operator","The next question comes from Shaw Wu with Sterne, Agee. You may ask your question.","Shaw Wu \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach","Hi. When you look at the previous product cycle with Power7, you had approximately \u2013 basically lasted about 18 months. What do you see with Power7 Plus? Thanks.","Mark Loughridge","Well, I think we'll get a pretty strong product cycle out of it. As I had said earlier, the characteristic that I would focus on here is the couple of quarters it takes to get the volumes shipped, but we think we should have a very strong set of offerings with strength building as we go through the year. As I said, in the marketplace, it's performing quite well on a competitive basis.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan","Good afternoon. Mark, I had a question. As we think about 2013, you've done a great job in terms of optimizing the operating margin profile. How should we think about the various rates contribution for 2013 in terms of incremental contribution to margin in terms of A, is it going to really from a mix driven up to Software? Or B, is it going to be an increasing level of optimization of Software and less labor in Services? Or C, will it be more about just OpEx reductions in general?","Mark Loughridge","If you look at the overall performance basis, it's really those two very strong plays that we\u2019re driving through the model, both with good results in 2012 and we think we'll present good results in 2013 as well. First of all being the ongoing mix in the higher value, higher margin spaces. Again, the best example of that would be the tremendous progress I think we've made on our Software business. Again, I gave earlier the statistic, but I think it's kind of remarkable that in 2000 we were doing $2.4 billion. Last year we did $11 billion. So that ongoing mix to Software we think should continue. And then supplementing that will be all the work that we have ongoing in that $8 billion of focus spend that we talked about in our globally integrated enterprise initiative.","Now, one point I want to make clear in that $8 billion, we do work to drive about 40% of that to the bottom line, but the other 60% is firmly dedicated to remixing our spend profile and our resources. So there is higher growth, higher margin initiatives like Business Analytics, Smarter Planet, Cloud computing and if you look at the business mix within those, about 50% of the revenue mix within those initiatives is Software. So, much higher Software mix that we see in the base business. That too should help propel our mix into higher margin content.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.","Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thank you. Mark, you previously spoke to you thought Software would have mid-single digits as you look at calendar year '13. I want to see if you could specifically address then the services and the systems part of the business. I think to Tony's question you said you thought GBS would have positive revenue growth, but I didn't hear a GTS number. So if you could speak to both the services element if you think in constant currency dollars whether that will have positive revenue growth in any metrics and then the same question for the hardware system side please.","Mark Loughridge","Okay. Let's \u2013 I think the best framework I can give you on the services side \u2013 and I\u2019m not going to walk through each of these elements, but on the services side, we built that view of backlog run-out in the presentation and that covers about 70% of the revenue that we realize in a year. So another way to look at it, we already have 70% of revenue as we enter the year. But in that, the math would say, it's up 1%, but the point I was making, as we are more explicit about the dynamics, is really from a profit standpoint it should perform more like a business that has a backlog run out of closer to 2%. Now, the dynamics underneath that, just given the backlog growth that we have had in our GBS business should move GBS into positive revenue performance as we go through the year.But I think the more important aspect of that is that revenue performance, that better mix of contract profile within the business, closing out on those $3 billion of deals that were rolled across the dateline, that should generate model level profit performance at our services business and as I said earlier, we would think it would drive kind of double-digit profit as going to the first quarter.From a hardware standpoint as we go into 2013, that first half is really going to be defined by the Z Series momentum that we have going and we would expect that that would help us drive double-digit profit in the first half as well. And on the software base of business, with key branded middleware at 6% in the fourth quarter we'd expect, as we had said earlier, mid-single digit revenue performance and a very strong profit contribution as well. So, all those things put together give us confidence in the at least $16.70 of earnings per share that we pointed out for the year.OperatorThe last question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.Chris Whitmore - Deutsche BankJust to follow up on Keith's question. I believe in earlier comments you've indicated earnings will be a little bit more front half loaded than second half loaded. Can you talk through the dynamics that would drive that type of unusual seasonality in 2013?Mark Loughridge","Yeah, absolutely. So when you look at the seasonality -- and here I'd make a couple of comments. First of all, the year-to-year performance across the quarters is relatively similar but will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. And that's really driven by kind of Z Series content and the Z Series dynamic. Remember, by the time we get to fourth quarter of next year we'll be facing the big announcement in the rearview mirror. So, I do expect that the first half of the year should be better growth than we see in the second half but we still expect to have a good second half.Now, within the first quarter the additional comment I would make, is really we'd kind of expect to see a little better performance in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, and that comes down to Easter. This year, Easter falls in that last week of March and we've seen that in, especially in countries where Easter is a major holiday, that tends to move that business because you just have more difficulty getting hold of your clients and your customer base at the end of the quarter, and those contracts will generally roll to April. So, once again, a little stronger performance in the first half than the second half but a good second half at that. And within the first half, a little more strength in the second quarter than we would see in the first quarter based on the calendar date for Easter.So with that, let me take the opportunity to wrap up the call. Our 2012 results demonstrate the flexibility of IBM's business model. We had strong performance in our growth initiatives, especially in our higher value areas. We expanded our margins and had excellent profit growth which drove our 10th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. And we generated over $18 billion of free cash flow which is up $1.6 billion year-to-year and a record for IBM.So in 2013 we will continue to move our business forward, shifting to higher value and improving efficiency. We're going to buy businesses, we're going to sell business, we're going to rebalance our resources, align those to opportunities and continue to invest in innovation. Now, all of this is captured in our view of 2013. We are confident in our ability to deliver at least $16.70 for the year on our way to our objective of at least $20 in 2015. So, thank you again for joining us today and now as always it's back to work.OperatorThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

As a result our segment reporting structure has been updated to reflect our business structure. We provided two years of historical financial information by quarter on these segments a few weeks ago, this can be found in our investor website.","Today we'll be discussing first-quarter results in this new segment structure. In addition you'll see that we've updated our earnings presentation slides not only to address the new segment structure but also to provide additional disclosure on our strategic imperatives and to provide more commentary on the business drivers.","So with that, I'll turn the call to Martin Schroeter.","Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Patricia. Again, this quarter, we've made a lot of progress in transforming our business, and we got done what we set out to do to start the year. We delivered $18.7 billion in revenue, $2.3 billion in net income and operating earnings per share of $2.35. Importantly, we also made significant investments and took significant actions to accelerate our transformation and move our business into new areas. Our enterprise clients are looking to get greater value from their data and IT environment. They're not just focused on reducing cost and driving efficiency but using data to improve decision-making and outcomes. They're looking to become digital enterprises that are differentiated by Cognitive.","Our strategy is based on the point of view it this requires a solutions-focused industry expertise and innovative technology, all supported by leading-edge skills. And so to move our clients into the future, we've been making significant changes to our business. We're not only transforming our existing businesses but building new markets and addressing new opportunity areas. We're creating Cognitive Solutions that marry digital business with digital intelligence. We're bringing our industry expertise together with these cognitive solutions and we're building it all on cloud platforms. And because we're running our clients' most critical business processes today, we're in a unique position to move them to the future.","We've been shifting investments and, resources and as we move our business forward we've also changed the way we run our business to be more aligned with these opportunity areas. We have proof points that we're making progress. This quarter, we continued our pattern of strong double-digit growth in our strategic imperatives. This revenue was up 17% at constant currency, which is consistent with our performance on the fourth quarter and continues to be substantially faster than the markets growth. I'll talk about our revenue results on a constant-currency basis throughout the presentation.","So now, over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered $30 billion in revenue which represents 37% of our total revenue. That's two points ahead of where we were 90 days ago. In the quarter, our total cloud revenue grew 36% to $2.6 billion, with the as-a-service components growing 46%. Our annual run rate for the as-a-service revenue is now $5.4 billion. Our analytics revenue grew 9% on a locked base you'll recall as an $18 billion business for us last year. And mobile and security each posted strong double-digit growth.","As we transform our business and move into new areas we need to transform our workforce; not only the types of skills but how we operate. This quarter we took significant actions to transform our workforce and shift our skills base to new areas and to improve our structure primarily outside the U.S. This resulted in a pre-tax charge of just under $1.5 billion. As we discussed in late February, we also had a tax refund in the quarter of $1 billion plus interest. And so the amount of the tax benefit was essentially equivalent to the charges on an after-tax basis. It's important to recognize that these actions are impacting our profit and margins this quarter while improving our position for the future.","We're continuing to invest and add capabilities to build out our Cognitive and Cloud Platforms. I'll comment on a few items from the first quarter alone. We completed the acquisition of The Weather Company's digital assets. This is not only a source of valuable weather data but a high-volume, cloud-based, insight-driven platform. We're bringing this together with our organic Watson capabilities to form the basis of our Watson IoT platform.","This quarter we announced a number of partnerships with companies including VMware to accelerate the adoption of enterprise hybrid clouds, and GitHub to advance the development of next-gen cloud applications for enterprises. And we've brought Swift to the cloud, enabling mobile developers to build end-to-end mobile hybrid apps. We've integrated a portion of our software business into our cloud business, and all of IBM's relevant software is now in the IBM cloud.","We acquired Ustream and will bring it together with software and our object storage capabilities to extend our leadership in cloud video services. At the end of the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Bluewolf, a top Salesforce partner and leader in cloud consulting and implementation services.","GBS is already the largest digital design agency, and this quarter we extended our capabilities with the announcement of three acquisitions that will be integrated into IBM Interactive Experience.","We're continuing to expand our Watson ecosystem and reach. Over the last 12 months, the number of developers using Watson APIs is up over 300% and the number of enterprises we've engaged with has doubled. Watson solutions are being built, used, and deployed in more than 45 countries and across 20 different industries. And this quarter, we significantly added to our Watson Health platform with the acquisition of Truven, a leading provider of cloud-based healthcare data, analytics, and insights. This was announced in February and closed just over a week ago. I'll expand on these solutions and go into more detail on our strategic imperatives performance in the segment discussions.","But first, I'll turn to our financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue for the quarter was $18.7 billion. Currency continues to be a headwind to our reported revenue performance, over 2.5 points this quarter. This is 0.5 point better than the low end of the range we provided in mid-January, or about $90 million translation benefit. On a constant currency basis, our decline of 2% is consistent with last quarter. Now, within that 2% decline, when you consider the impact of the mainframe cycle and the additional content from acquisitions this quarter, our underlying revenue growth rate improved by 2 points versus the prior quarter.","From a geography perspective, our performance in the Americas was consistent with last quarter with improvement in the U.S. and a decline in Latin America driven by Brazil. We've built a strong business in Brazil over the years, though the last few quarters have been more volatile. This quarter Brazil was down, in part due to a tough compare but also an economic environment that looks uncertain. We've taken some action to refocus our business which impacts our growth in the short term. EMEA posted a modest decline while Asia-Pacific grew for the first time in quite a while.","Our gross margin performance reflects higher levels of investment and a mix impact within our segments. Our systems margin was up consistent with the product cycle dynamics in our z Systems as well as improvements in power and storage.","You can see our expense was up significantly, driven by charges for the actions to accelerate the transformation of our business. These charges impacted pre-tax income by $1.5 billion and pre-tax margin by 8 points in the quarter. I'll talk more about the charges and implications for the future later.","Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an underlying rate of 19% as well as the benefit from the resolution of a tax case outside the U.S. This was a discrete item and drove our tax rate negative.","From a cash perspective, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, about half of that coming from the tax benefit. Over the last 12 months, we've generated over $14 billion of free cash flow, and this is 110% of GAAP net income. Given the seasonality of our cash flow, it's best to look at realization on a trailing 12-month basis. And in the last year we returned about two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and gross share repurchases.","With the changes we've made to our management system and organizational structure, we've implemented a new segment structure. As Patricia mentioned, we provided historical information on this segment structure a few weeks ago. Before getting into results for this quarter, I want to spend a minute on the structure. Our segment discussions will also be a little longer than is typical to address the drivers and performance on this basis and the progress we're making in moving our business to the future.","So looking at the segments, Cognitive Solutions includes the solutions software addressing many of our strategic areas including analytics, security, and social as well as the transaction processing software. Many of these are new opportunity areas like Watson Health and Watson IoT, opening up revenue and profit pools beyond traditional IT. Because we're building new businesses in new markets, they'll ramp over time.","The scope of our Global Business Services segment overall is unchanged, though we're now providing our revenue results for consulting, global process services, and application management, which is aligned with the way we're now organized and going to market. GBS has been shifting its business towards the solution areas including creation of a cognitive consulting practice, and earlier this year GBS strengthened its industry capabilities.","As we bring the industry expertise together with Cognitive Solutions offerings, we'll put more focus on the combination of these two businesses, which we refer to as Cognitive Solutions and Industry Services.","Technology Services and Cloud Platforms includes our global technology services business and IBM's cloud infrastructure and platform capabilities. This business now includes WebSphere and related software products, reflecting the importance of integration software to the enterprise grade hybrid clouds.","Systems include our hardware offerings of z Systems, power and storage, and now also the related operating system software.","Global Financing is unchanged, consisting of client and commercial financing and used equipment sales.","Now, as we've said, the primary driver of the changes to our operating structure and subsequently our segments is the realignment of our software portfolio as software value shifts to new areas. Software is made up of our Cognitive Solutions segment, integration software, and operating system software. We've broken out the revenue and gross profit results within the segments, but as we transition to the new structure we'll also provide a perspective on total software. I'll talk about it after going through the four segment discussions, and we've also provided information in our supplemental charts. Given the solutions nature of our offerings, our strategic imperatives are included in each of our segments, and so going forward we're providing additional information on the strategic imperatives revenue within each segment.","So now let's turn to the segment performance, and I'll start Cognitive. I mentioned that solutions software includes analytic, security, and social. To give you some context, analytics is the largest part of our solutions portfolio and includes our traditional analytics platform, industry solutions, commerce, and the Watson-related businesses. Transaction processing software, on the other hand, primarily runs mission-critical systems in industries like banking, airlines, and retail. This includes our offerings such as CICS, TPS, and IMS running on z Systems which were primarily reflected in other middleware in our previously reported software segment. Most of it is on-premise and annuity in nature, and not a growing opportunity in the software market.","In the first quarter, Cognitive Solutions generated revenue of $4 billion, which was up modestly year-to-year. Solutions software grew, mitigated by a decline in transaction processing software. Our solutions software growth of 3% was a significant sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. Contributing to this growth was strong double-digit performance in our Watson cloud based offerings and acquisitive content. From an offering perspective, the growth was led by analytics and security. In both of these areas, we have highly differentiated strategies and capabilities.","Security isn't just about trying to keep things out; we approach security as a big data problem. On average today, organizations use 80 security products from 40 different vendors, and they're looking for us to bring all this together. We're in a unique position as we not only provide our own leading capabilities but bring it all together for them in an integrated solution. Security solutions are a mix of on-premise software and software-as-a-service, and we believe we have the largest enterprise security software-as-a-service business.","Our leadership and momentum continued into the first quarter with high single-digit growth in our security software, outpacing the market. In addition, we continue to invest to build our security platform, and we've recently acquired Resilient Systems, which provides leading incident response capabilities. This acquisition expands our overall leadership in security where we lead the market in four out of six security segments. With our differentiated strategy and our market leadership, we can attract the best talent in a very competitive market. We now have more than 7,000 security experts, maybe more than 1,000 in the last year. We can attract top talent because we're not just identifying problems and doing audits, we're solving security problems.","Our approach in analytics is also unique and differentiated. We're building an industrial strength cognitive platform that is cloud-based and leverages Watson. It's also supported by industry-specific data and an ecosystem to help provide new insights in key industries. This allows us to go after a new $2 trillion market opportunity beyond the $1.2 trillion traditional IT market. So it's a new and incremental opportunity for us.","Watson Healthcare is our first industry-focused area, where we're creating a new market. This is an industry with billions of dollars of new revenue opportunity for IBM. We started to move into the cognitive healthcare space just about a year ago and have invested $4 billion through four acquisitions. We're scaling rapidly, moving from effectively no employees to more than 6,000 in a year. Most came to us through the acquisitions, but we've also hired nearly 700 employees who are highly skilled healthcare professionals who will now make a difference in millions of lives. We believe success will be based on building platforms, and we're focused on leveraging partnerships and ecosystems.","We're now working with clients such as the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, and Under Armour, in addition to initial partners of Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson, CVS, and many more. As I mentioned, in early April we closed our Truven acquisition that brings more than 8,500 clients to our Watson Health portfolio, including employers, health insurers, hospitals, clinicians, life sciences companies, and government agencies that support health programs. Data and insights from Truven inform benefit decisions for one in three Americans.","We're already seeing the signs of our strategy playing out. In the first quarter we closed deals with a few large healthcare insurers, who have millions of members that can use our Watson Health cloud-based solutions. We believe that the healthcare industry is moving to value-based care. It is still early stages, but as the market shifts, we're positioned to deliver value.","We're also broadening the reach of Watson as it starts to support an increasing number of decisions. Let me share a few more examples. When we first introduced Watson, it could reach a population of 400 million English-speaking people. As Watson has been taught more languages, it can now speak with another billion people in their native language. We are working on our Watson oncology solution with a number of hospitals that have a combined reach of more than three million patients.","You heard from a few of our healthcare clients on Investor Day. Let me comment on another in insurance that has Watson in production. Geico is using Watson in 46 states to enhance aspects of their industry-leading digital channel. They're encouraged by the results they have seen with existing and new policyholders in areas including online experience, engagement, and sales.","So now, looking at the profit results for this segment, the gross margin is impacted by a lower level of transactional revenue and the fact that more of our new areas where we're investing are cloud-based and build over time. The pre-tax income performance also reflects a higher level of investment in areas like Watson Platform, Watson Health, and Watson IoT, as well as an impact from workforce rebalancing charges and currency.","Global Business Services delivered $4.1 billion of revenue, which is down 2%. As I mentioned earlier, Global Business Services segment content in total did not change, but within GBS we are now reporting consulting, global process services, and application management, consistent with the way we're running the business.","Our application management business helps modernize a client's application processes and brings apps to market faster through digital cloud platforms like Bluemix. Our application management revenue represents about 45% of GBS revenue. Performance was relatively stable last year and that continued into the first quarter.","In consulting, which is another 45% or so of our revenue, the process of shifting to the new areas continues to impact our growth rate, but we did see some improvement versus the prior quarter. Global process services revenue, which is less than 10% of GBS revenue, was down 1%.","At our investor briefing in February, we spent time on the shift that we're driving in GBS away from some of the more traditional areas into the more strategic areas. This quarter, GBS revenue in the strategic imperatives was up 22%, with strong growth across our cloud, analytics, mobility, and security practices.","We're expanding our design capabilities as consumer-grade experience is becoming a new strategy for enterprises. This quarter, we announced three acquisitions that will be integrated into the IBM Interactive Experience, the largest global digital agency. Through our experienced design capabilities, we're able to bring clients the distinct combination of industry insight, design thinking, and end-to-end digital transformation. We are delivering high-value digital services in over 25 studios worldwide, including a new studio in Dubai that we announced this quarter.","We are investing in expanding our skills in other areas as well. We've recently announced the acquisition of Bluewolf, which has over 500 resources across the U.S., Europe, and Australia. This will extend our industry consulting leadership with one of the world's leading salesforce consulting practices to deliver differentiated consumer-grade experiences through the cloud.","Our Apple partnership continues to redesign workflows and drive productivity for our clients. We recently announced strategic mobile transformation products with RWE Generation in Germany for mobile maintenance of heavy mining equipment; with Alior Bank in Poland to transform the way clients experience banking services; and with Etisalat in Egypt to deploy the Expert Tech app and transform how its remote site support technicians deliver services to their customers.","Turning to GBS profit, our gross margin was down about a point and a half as we continue to invest to drive our transformation. We're engineering the shift of our resources to higher-value services, which has a near-term impact on our margin. Our strategy is based on moving to higher value, so we'll continue this shift. We continue to see price and profit pressure in some parts of the portfolio. Looking at pre-tax profit performance, more than half the margin decline is driven by the structural actions we took this quarter. At the same time, we continue to invest in our digital and cognitive practices. These actions will help us progress our transformation in GBS.","Technology Services and Cloud Platforms delivered $8.4 billion of revenue, up 2%. For the segment, our strategic imperative revenue was up 45%, driven by our cloud revenue which was up 50%. Our view on cloud is that enterprises see the most value in hybrid cloud solutions that enable new business models while leveraging existing systems and data. We brought Global Technology Services closer together with IBM's cloud infrastructure and platform capabilities to better position us to deliver these solutions to our clients.","We will provide a view of infrastructure services, technical support services, and integration software. Infrastructure services reflects our evolution from a systems integrator to a services integrator, driven by the move to hybrid cloud. It includes our previous strategic outsourcing and integrated technology services lines.","Technical support services provides a complete line of support services to maintain and improve the ability of clients' IT infrastructures. This includes maintenance for both IBM and non-IBM products as well as some support previously reported in integrated technology services.","Infrastructure services was up 4% this quarter as clients continue to turn to us as a trusted partner to modernize their most critical IT systems and move them to hybrid. For example, at Chubb, we're implementing a new hybrid cloud model designed to enhance customer service and strengthen their industry practices. This new agile infrastructure will be designed to fit a wide variety of business needs, including enhanced user experience, faster deployment of services, and increased speed to market.","We're also working with one of Indostat, one of Indonesia's largest telecommunications and services providers that serves 70 million mobile customers. They need a cloud partner with scale, and we will deliver solutions on the IBM cloud that will help Indonesian businesses drive innovation and agility, streamline their process, and improve productivity.","We continue to see strong momentum in software, which again grew to strong double digits this quarter. We continue to invest to build out our global capability, announcing a new cloud datacenter in South Africa to support large regional service provider clients like Gijima and Vodacom.","Earlier this quarter, about 25,000 clients and partners attended our global InterConnect conference where we made some important announcements as we continue to evolve the IBM cloud. We announced that 100% of relevant software is now available in the cloud through a series of offerings such as WebSphere Connect where more than 200 million global licenses can now access the cloud. This fundamentally transforms how enterprise clients extend their existing IT investments and capabilities to the cloud.","We also announced we are the first to bring the Swift programming language to the server. Swift is used by about 11 million developers to build Apple iOS applications to radically simplify the development of end-to-end applications and help enterprises reach new levels of productivity.","We also launched several important strategic partnerships as we continue to build out our ecosystem. With VMware, we've jointly designed an architecture and cloud offering that will allow nearly half a million VMware customers to extend their virtual machines to the IBM cloud. And with GitHub, we'll be delivering an enterprise offering to the more than 12 million developers that will allow them to build and run applications consistently across public and private environments.","We continue to expand our cloud capabilities with the acquisition of Ustream and the formation of the IBM cloud video services unit that will that will provide our clients with a powerful portfolio of video services and digital analytics. Ustream provides cloud-based video streaming and on-demand video to about 80 million viewers per month for customer such as Facebook, Nike, the Discovery Channel, Samsung, and NASA.","Looking at the software content in this segment, integration software was down 2%. Our annuity content is growing with stability in our on-premises content and acceleration in the adoption of SaaS, specifically in the products that integrate a hybrid cloud environment, like application servers and our Connect family of products.","Looking at profit, Technology Services and Cloud Platforms' gross margin was down just over a point year-to-year. Margin is impacted by the revenue trajectory of integration software as we move more of the portfolio to an as-a-service model delivered through the cloud. Within infrastructure services, we're investing to contemporize our clients' IT systems as we bring on new contracts.","At the pre-tax profit level, our margin decline reflects the continued investment to build up platforms such as Bluemix and SoftLayer as we drive our transformation as well as currency impacts. This quarter also includes the impact of the workforce transformation actions, which is about half of the decline.","Our Systems segment comprises our systems hardware business and operating system software. Systems revenue was about $1.7 billion this quarter, which was down about 20%. Our hardware revenue was down 25%, primarily reflecting the product cycle in our z Systems. Operating systems continue to be a headwind to growth. This quarter, the revenue was down 7%.","So looking at the hardware performance by brand, our z Systems revenue was down 40% on the back of a very strong performance of up 130% last year when we launched our new z13. Typically, we see better margins in z Systems as we move into the back half of the cycle, and we did see some good margin improvement this quarter.","After four quarters of growth, Power revenue was down double digits as we ramped on a strong performance in UNIX-based entry systems from last year. But we had continued momentum in our Linux offerings and expansion of OpenPOWER efforts. We've been focused on the growth in Power-based Linux systems and they've now grown to about 10% of the overall revenue base.","We recently signed a deal with a large enterprise in China that is dramatically growing its Linux server footprint, and has chosen Linux on Power partly because they can do it with half of the footprint they would have required with x86. The relationship will lead to the installation of thousands of Linux on Power Systems.","We also continued to see good traction with the OpenPOWER Foundation-based innovations, which will ultimately drive adoption of the Power platform and provide intellectual property income. Just a few weeks ago, Google, a founding member of the OpenPOWER Foundation, announced that it is working with Rackspace, an Open Compute Project founding member, to codevelop an open server specification based around IBM's new POWER9 architecture. The two companies will submit a candidate POWER9 server design to the Open Compute Project.","Turning to Storage, hardware revenue was down 6%, which continues to reflect weakness in the overall storage market. We are well positioned to capture the strategic growth areas of flash, software-defined storage, and object storage, which together grew in the quarter.","Our Systems gross profit margin was up with improvement across z Systems, Power, and Storage. Our pre-tax income decline reflects the improved gross margin on the lower revenue and the impact of the actions we took this quarter, which is about half of the decline.","So now, let me come back to the performance of software across our segments. Our total software revenue was down less than 1%. This is a significant improvement from our performance last quarter, which was down 6%. We got the improvement we expected from the higher mix of annuity versus transactional content in the first quarter. In addition, we've been adding a lot of new capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions, and this quarter software growth reflected the acquisitions which closed over the last year. These acquisitions contribute to revenue growth but impact our profit performance in the first year.","Our annuity revenue was up 2% in the quarter with steady renewal rates and growth in our SaaS business. From a product area perspective, growth in our solutions software was offset by a continued headwind in operating systems and transaction processing software.","Let me make one other comment on our software performance. As I mentioned earlier, total software includes cognitive solutions, integration software, and operating systems. This includes a portion of our software support line revenue that was previously reported in our GTS segment. The addition of support line did not impact our software growth rate this quarter. Our software revenue was down 0.8 points including support line and would've been down 0.8 points without support line.","Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we generated $3.3 billion of cash from operations in the quarter excluding our financing receivables and $2.3 billion of free cash flow. This is up over $1 billion year-to-year. This year-to-year increase was driven by the tax benefit of $1 billion plus interest. As I mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions that impacted our profit this quarter and will impact our cash flow over the next several quarters.","Looking at the uses of cash in the quarter, we invested just under $1 billion in capital expenditures with continued investment in cloud capacity. We closed six acquisitions this quarter, and acquisition spend was over $2.5 billion, with the largest being The Weather Company transaction. The Truven acquisition closed about a week and a half ago and so will be included in our second quarter acquisition spend.","We returned over $2 billion to shareholders including $1.2 billion in dividends, and we bought back over 6.5 million shares. At the end of March we had $4.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Looking at the balance sheet highlights, we ended the quarter with nearly $15 billion in cash and $46 billion in total debt, both of which are up an equivalent amount from year-end, driven by the timing of this year's term debt issuances. About $27 billion of our total debt was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7:1.","I want to mention that the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 51% investment grade, which you can see in the supplemental charts. We had a few point reduction in investment grade over the last couple of quarters driven by rating changes in our existing portfolio, not by changes in how we approach the market. Now, this data is based on the credit ratings of the companies in our portfolio. We do take actions to transfer exposure to third parties where we then get the credit ratings of the insurance companies. We've done this for many years. And on that basis, our investment-grade content increases by 14 points to 65%.","Our non-financing debt was $18.8 billion, up year-to-year driven by the timing of our debt issuances this year relative to the maturities, and as I mentioned, the increase is equivalent to the increase in cash. We continue to be very well positioned to support our long-term growth strategy.","Let me spend a minute on some of the larger items that impacted the first quarter results and give you a sense of the implications of these actions for the balance of the year. The tax benefit contributed about $1.20 to EPS. As I mentioned, our underlying tax rate was 19% in the quarter, consistent with the range we provided at the beginning of the year of 18% plus or minus a couple of points. This, of course, doesn't include discrete or one-time items.","As we transform our business, we need to transform our workforce, and in this quarter we took a pre-tax charge for workforce rebalancing of $1 billion or $0.84 of earnings per share. Some of this charge is used to take action where we've been dealing with underutilization, but the vast majority is to shift and rebalance our skills.","As we build new businesses in areas like Watson Health and Watson Internet of Things, this requires different skills and to be in different places. I mentioned earlier that over the last year we've added over 6,000 resources in Watson Health and added over 1,000 security experts. These are specialized skills in highly competitive areas. So this is not about reducing our capacity; this is about transforming our workforce. We started the year with just under 380,000 people. We have people leaving the business, but we're also adding large numbers of resources. We currently have tens of thousands of open positions, and we're hiring aggressively. So if we have similar hiring dynamics to last year, we could end the year with an employee base that is about the same as where we started. Our hiring will be aligned to where we see demand, by skill area, and by geography. As we look at the resource actions, about 90% of the spending is outside the U.S.","Now, looking at the returns on this action, we expect we'll save about $500 million this year, maybe a little more, and nearly $2 billion on an annualized basis. When you look at the makeup of the $1 billion charge, a couple hundred was in the run rate and drives the bulk of the $500 million savings this year. The balance of the charge was for actions that yield the remainder due to geographic mix and timing. But as I said, this is about rebalancing skills rather than capacity reduction, and so we think about this as spending that is freed up to be reinvested in building capabilities in our strategic imperatives.","As we transform our workforce, we're changing how we're working, more agile, more collaboratively, and this requires a different work environment. So this quarter, we took a real estate charge of over $300 million as we changed the way we work, moving to agile with less space required. We also took actions to reposition the business in Latin America in light of the macro conditions. I mentioned earlier that we've refocused our business in Brazil including reducing exposure in our financing and services portfolio this quarter. We also reduced our exposure in Venezuela.","As you know, we've always had some unique items in the quarter, but we've included here the items that accelerate our transformation. We didn't include for example the nearly $40 million loss from the sale of our remaining equity position in Lenovo. We have no future exposure there.","So we made good progress in transforming our business this quarter. We continued strong growth in our strategic imperatives, and as I've said earlier, they now represent 37% of our revenue. We added significant capabilities this quarter through organic investments, acquisitions, and partnerships, and we took significant actions to improve our position for the long term. As we look forward, we expect much of what we saw in the first quarter to continue. We expect to drive strong growth in our strategic imperatives.","Our acquisitions are starting to contribute to our top line, and while they are a drag on profit in the first few quarters, they will certainly contribute to the profit base over time. We will continue to invest at a high level. Much of the capabilities we're building are cloud-based and delivered as a service. Both the higher investment levels and the return profile put some pressure on our profit in the near term but we're confident it's right for the long term. As I just mentioned, we'll start to yield some of the benefits from the actions we just took but we do expect much of it to be reinvested. When we take all of this into consideration, we continue to expect at least $13.50 of operating earnings per share for the year.","You'll recall that last quarter I said that we expect free cash flow realization of GAAP net income in the 90s, which implied a range of $11 billion to $12 billion of free cash flow for the year at the $13.50 level. We have now improved our view of free cash flow for the year and now expect free cash flow to come in at the high end of that range at that same profit level.","As we look at the second quarter, we typically see a profit improvement from first to second quarter. In fact, last year, it was $1 billion increase in pre-tax income. This year, we expect more given the significant charges in our first quarter, but we'll also have an impact from the acquisition ramp and quarter-to-quarter impact from currency hedges. Put it all together and we see about a $2 billion increase in pre-tax profit from first to second quarter. With our anticipated tax rate and our share repurchase, at that profit level we'd achieve between 38% and 39% of the $13.50 of earnings per share by the end of the first half.","So to finish, again, this quarter we made a lot of progress in transforming our business and we got done what we set out to do to start the year. Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.","Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. These too have been updated to reflect the new segment structure and additional information provided. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.","Operator, let's please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. One moment, please, for the first question. First question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks, Martin, for all the detail. Just to build on your closing comment on the original 15% from last quarter, timing-wise, what shifted from what you expected? Or is there some conservatism to consider? Because I guess with what you reported, it looks like actual could be around 17.5% of the full-year guidance.","Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Tien-tsin. So, you're right. If we were just to line up the math of where we finished relative to the at least $13.50 at that base level, we'd be about 17%. So the first quarter, I would say I'd characterize a couple of ways. One, on the top line, we got done what we wanted to get done and, in fact, the signposts that we've given to our investor community around driving double-digit growth while we continue to invest in those areas played out pretty much as we expected. And we are growing our revenue in those strategic imperatives faster than the marketplace, which we think is an important element as we transform the business.","On the profit side, the first quarter played out kind of the way we said we would get done what we would in February, which was we were going to get a tax benefit and that we were going to accelerate the transformation. So we put of all of that together and while \u2013 because we had some of the restructuring already in the run rate, if you will, we did better, if you will, than what the original guidance implied. So the math you're doing is kind of spot on relative to that $13.50. We are seeing the dynamics in the revenue lines that we had expected and we're seeing the profit equation come together as we kind of expected, again, given that nuance that we had some of the restructuring in the run rate.","The other thing I'd point out, what's not in yet is obviously some of the newer acquisition content. We closed on Truven about a week and a half ago. We closed on The Weather Company's digital assets during the quarter, so not a full quarter. Those come also with our intent to grow the spending in those to create new solutions. So when they come in, at whatever profitability they were, we build our business cases around substantial investment in those two. So we'll get the revenue but the profit impact, as we said in the prepared remarks, will last for a couple of quarters.","Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tien-tsin. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify something, just because you said it very quickly at the end of the call, and then I have a real question. So you're guiding for 38% to 39% of earnings in the first half, which I think implies $2.85 in EPS for Q2. That's about $0.60 below consensus, and only about a 21% increase sequentially. Historically I think you're at 30% or 35%. So I just want to be sure I did the math right on that. That's the clarification.","And my real question is, it's really just where you think you are in the transformation. We continue to see really good growth on the strategic imperatives. But revenue growth at constant currency was minus 2 and I think on an organic basis was probably about minus 3. And that's kind of at the low end of what you've done over the last eight quarters or so. So maybe you could help us understand, is it just the combination of the transformation still requiring time? Or is there something about the move to an as-a-service model? But why aren't we seeing some gradual improvement in revenue on a constant currency basis? And can you help us understand, is there something that you either anniversary or overlap, or when investors should think about seeing that inflection point in terms of improving revenues?","Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Thanks, Toni. So first, on your clarifying non-question, I think the way you described it is what we said. We said we'd get 38% to 39% of the first half done, and your math was right on. The one thing, though, I think it's important to remember, and I know you know this, but I think we ought to bear in mind the business looks fundamentally different as we transform it. And so, using first-half averages from days gone by when currency was different and the level of transformation and the pace of transformation was different and the levels of investment were different, I would caution our investors to make sure they understand the underpinnings of that. And so that's why we laid out, if you will, within my prepared remarks \u2013 that's why we laid out what we saw happening in this quarter from first to second. So again, your math was right, we said 38% to 39%. But again, there is a lot more going on within the transformation than just the statistics. And I think it's important to understand the componentry.","In terms of where we are in the transformation, I think I'd make a few comments. One, continued growth in the strategic imperatives \u2013 as you said, good growth and we're pleased with the double-digit growth. It's a big part of how we're measuring our progress. The other element that we're measuring, and we talked about this at Investor Day and it holds true as well in the first is, are the spaces we're going to, are they generating higher value than the spaces we're moving from? And as we showed at Investor Day, our gross margins in those new areas continue to be higher, and they were higher again in the first. So that's an important element for us. Again, grow those businesses and make sure they're higher value.","At the same time, part of our transformation is to create new opportunities. And so we spent a bit of time at Investor Day, as you know, talking about not only the traditional IT opportunity. And I would put things like our new cloud video services unit into that, where we get to apply a globally scalable cloud approach on an industry basis with our industry expertise. And so that's a good example of how we're shifting into new areas in the cloud world in the traditional space. But part of this transformation is all about moving into businesses that don't yet exist.","And so when you mention, is it as-a-service, is it something else, these are as-a-service businesses, and so we do expect there to take a while to ramp. But we did get to put a lot of money to work over the past 12 months. In fact, our acquisition activity over the last 12 months, if you include Truven now \u2013 so we just closed Truven about a week and a half ago \u2013 we spent about $9 billion now over that time period on acquisitions, which is more than we've spent in any 12-month period in IBM. So, part of this is also on building those new businesses.","So where are we in the transformation? It is continued focus on shifting our investments into those strategic imperatives, it is making sure that the space we're moving to is higher margin and higher profit opportunity for us and then making sure we're investing aggressively to keep those businesses growing.","Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Toni. Rowena, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Yes, thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks, Martin. The software and the GBS businesses have the highest strategic content, and both of those declines improved from what you outlined happened in 2015 at the Analyst Day. At the same time, deferred revenue grew for the first time in almost two years, which is tied to at least the software portion of the business. So, just curious if you isolate those two segments where you've had some big headwinds. Do you feel like you're moving beyond that and you've seen a sustainable turn in those businesses? Or is there something about annuity versus transactional mix in the first quarter where we shouldn't assume that those businesses continue to get better? Thank you.","Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Katy. So, a couple of things. First, on software, we did talk about in January that we would we'd get an improved trajectory in our software business just from the mix of transactional annuity, and we did get that. So we did see an improvement from the mix in lower transactional content in the first, then in the fourth that drove some improvement.","Secondly, we also got a benefit from the acquisition content that closed. That added about 2 points as well to the software performance. So with the annuity component of our software business continuing to grow, with the acquisition content coming in, I do feel okay about our software business going forward and the acquisitions that we've completed more recently will also help support that software business. So from a revenue perspective I feel okay about the investments we've made and the future of the software business.","Now, on the profit side, those take spending to create the kinds of solutions that we think will create new markets, so we'll continue to invest heavily, but the improvement we got from the mix was what we said we would get in the first and then we got the benefit of acquisitions as well.","Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations","Very good...","Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, Katy. You also asked about GBS. So on GBS, we did see a sequential improvement from fourth to first, and we saw that in our consulting business as well. Now, in the GBS business, the strategic imperatives content continues to do fine in the GBS business, and we'll continue to shift our labor pools and our expertise into those. And you saw that we made some acquisitions in that digital channel to create \u2013 again, to keep our lead, I should say, in being the world's largest digital agency.","What you also saw us do over the last few months now in GBS is we moved \u2013 we continued to move our business to where we see the greatest consulting opportunities. And quite frankly, we stayed in these big ERP implementations a bit too long. And so now, what you saw us buy a few months ago was a company called Meteorix, which is really built around helping companies move into workday solutions. And then you saw us recently announced the acquisition of a company called Bluewolf, which works on sales force implementations.","And so as the world moves into what we've always said it would, which is that the shift to cloud creates consulting opportunities because companies have to fundamentally change workflow, we did, quite frankly, move a little bit late, so we're playing a little bit of catch-up in that part of the business. But with these two acquisitions, we'll drive growth in what are two pretty hot market opportunities and we'll continue then to pull resources away from that commoditizing content and drive more the shift into the strategic imperatives.","Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Katy. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Yes, Ma'am. Thank you. Next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. You may ask your question.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. So, Martin, can I just quickly follow up on your software comment? So based on current visibility, can growth stay on this trajectory in the more seasonally difficult second quarter, and will acquisitions actually contribute more in the June quarter given the first quarter activity?","Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So the simple answer is that acquisitions that we've gotten done now will add again to the growth rate in the second quarter. If I looked at \u2013 if we look at just the Cognitive Solutions segment as an example, part of that business, our transaction processing system business \u2013 that's a very high value business. It declined 5% in the quarter, but it's in a declining market opportunity space. And so we're providing very high value to our clients. We run their most important transaction systems. We'll continue to do that. We'll continue to refresh those products that delivers the new capability, but quite frankly, that is an opportunity that will decline over time. But again, we'll decline with it. We won't lose share.","When we look at the software solutions part of that Cognitive segment, you saw that we got back to low single-digit growth in the first, and with the acquisition content we see that continuing to accelerate even in the second already. So that acquisition content will help bolster the software results as we go through the rest of the year.","Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, David. Can we take the next question please?","Rowena? We can't hear anything from our side, Rowena?","Operator","Yes. Hello? Yes. Hello. Our next question is from Louis Miscioscia from CLSA. You may ask your question.","Louis Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you. So going back to GBS again, you have strategic imperatives there at $3.1 billion, and that the total category is $4.1 billion. So when we look at the revenue, should we assume that that $1 billion that's not in the strategic imperative that's not growing is what's basically got a wind-down? And maybe you could give us an idea of how quickly you think you can transfer that over, or maybe I just couldn't (52:45) do the math on the percent decline, if that's accurate?","Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I guess the way to think about it is that within the Global Business Services, that the areas we're moving out of have a lot of price pressure. So implementing these large-scale ERP implementations, we see a lot of price pressure in there. And the areas we're moving into are continuing to grow pretty well, but we're building those. By the way, they're going to take a while to build. Some of them are brand-new practices. So as an example, we just announced the creation last year, at the end of last year, of a cognitive practice. That doesn't exist anywhere. It's the world's first. We are building skills there.","So within the GBS segment, again, this shift we've been working on, we were a little bit late in some parts of it and moving more into \u2013 if you will, moving more into the consulting side of this. But we have the total of strategic imperatives is within that segment is about $2 billion of the $4.1 billion. The chart that you may be looking at is not additive, right? The strategic imperatives are $2 billion. The cloud element is $600 million; that's within the $2 billion. And then the as-a-service is $0.5 billion; that's within that as well. So it's not additive, it's not three \u2013 one of the four; it's two of the four with those two as the components.","Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Lou. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Milunovich from UBS. You may ask your question.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. A couple of quick ones. Number one, the currency impact last quarter, you said, would be $1.10 hit to earnings this year. With currency now improved, what is that number likely to be? Number two, free cash flow. You said $11 billion to $12 billion; now, at the high end. Is the only difference the $1.2 billion that you received in the tax rebate, or has anything else changed in your underlying view? And then third, do you expect any more restructuring charges this year? Are those in your guidance at all?","Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Steve, thank you for the non-multipart \u2013 no, it's okay Steve. As you said, they are quick. They're good questions because it's all important data. So first, on constant currency, we said that in total, the currency impact would be over $1 billion for us in the year. Now, bear in mind that a big part of that, the bulk of that, almost all of it, was because of the hedges we had last year which we're not going to get this year. So we had to work our way through that. Now, at current rates, obviously we see \u2013 we still see the same size impact from the hedges because those were there last year. At current rates we would get a bit of a translation benefit, but I think it's really important to recognize that while as much as we like to think this is uniform on both sides of a dollar move, and we do believe that a weaker dollar on balance helps us, a weaker dollar also drives renegotiation in price and other things that come into the equation. So the impact at this point, the hedge impact on the currency rates today is obviously exactly the same. We'd do a little bit better at this point in profit if we were able to keep it; we'd do a little bit better there for the rest of the year.","On free cash flow, I'd say it really is \u2013 I wouldn't attribute it all to the tax that we got back. I would attribute it to we're through 90 days, we've have $100-plus billion balance sheet, and when we look at the ins and outs and the efficiency of the balance sheet, we feel incrementally more positive about the realization for the year.","And then on restructuring, this is something where \u2013 and we tried to go through this a bit in the prepared remarks \u2013 it really is about shifting the work force from a set of skills that have value in the marketplace today to a new set of skills where we're trying and build new businesses. The minority of the charge, if you will, is for reductions in usable capacity, and most of that's outside the U.S. The bulk of this is to get new set of skills. So as we build a Watson Health business, as we build out our security practice, we're adding new skills. So we'll see.","We think about our ability to acquire skills. In many of these sectors, we will hire them as quickly as the world can create them. We hired 1,000 security experts last year and quite frankly, if world created 2,000 of the caliber and the kind of talent we needed, we would've hired 2,000. But the world creates these skills at a certain rate and we'll hire them as aggressively as we can. We have some limits in terms of how do we put them to work and where's the demand and does that all match up, but we'll hire people as aggressively as we can as we build these businesses out. We are relying on some pretty unique talents in some these businesses.","Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Steve. Can we take the next question, please?","Operator","Yes, thank you. Next question is from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the services business, what you're seeing there specifically as it relates to your customers' discretionary spending outlook for services. You had a very strong signing quarter last quarter, but that was not so strong this quarter. I think it was down 17% year-over-year. Understanding that that can be very lumpy, does it say anything about the discretionary outlook for services among your clients? And can you maybe just address when we might expect to see that margin inflection in GBS?","Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So, a couple things. On services, in terms of signings, as you said, they tend to be lumpy. Maybe not the most elegant of words to describe it, but it is an accurate description of what happens in any 90-day period. Quite frankly, when you look at the kinds of relationships we're building with our clients, neither the IBM teams involved that are building these nor our clients are thinking about these on a 90-day cycle. These are pretty big, transformative partnerships that we build, and they're running and trusting us to run their most important and most critical systems. So it's completely understandable why a 90-day reporting cycle may not work.","We also have looked, and we've told our investors over time to look at the backlog. So when you look, for instance, within the GTS business, our backlog, even with the signings performance in the quarter, but because we've had strong signings last year we grew the backlog 1%.","And I think that's indicative of the kind of demand profile we see for those kinds of services. Remember, within that business there is certainly an element of productivity, i.e. our clients are asking us to do and manage that for them in a way that gets them to a sustainable economic model, which means we need to deliver productivity quite regularly. And then it also includes a lot of what they want in terms of moving into hybrid cloud environments and taking advantage of the investments they've already made in their own systems plus getting the agility from us running their cloud.","So that services business, again, the demand profile I'd say looks more like that low single-digit kind of growth rate, which is evident in the backlog. And then we'll \u2013 again, given the transformative nature of some these deals, we'll sign them when they're ready and when they're complete.","In terms of margin on GBS, we've talked a fair bit about what we're going through with GBS. The only thing I'd add to the comments we've made is, again, we continue to see that the areas and the spaces we're moving to are more valuable as measured by gross profit margin, if you will. They're more valuable than where we're coming from, and so we see certainly a bright future. Now, it's just a matter of getting that weighting right and working our way through the transition and transformation of that, where we have a bit of a productivity impact as well.","Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jim. Rowena, can we take the next question?","Operator","Yes ma'am, thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Could you just talk about the workforce transformation that you guys are implementing right now? What sort of gross savings are you guys targeting to get? I realize the net number may be fairly modest, but \u2013 just what sort of gross savings you think you can get, when does that start? And then the M&A contribution, can you just talk about what total revenues and strategic growth looks like on a organic basis, ex currency, ex M&A?","Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Amit. A couple of things. So on savings, if you will, and as you've pointed out, we're going to \u2013 we expect that we'll reinvest a lot of the savings as we start to realize them and as we start to achieve the savings. So in the prepared remarks and in the charts we've distributed, we've actually laid out quarter-by-quarter when we would expect to get about that $500 million or so of savings this year. And then we've also identified on a full year basis, that this frees up \u2013 for our spend rate, it frees up about $2 billion that we will now look to shift into these new areas. That's how we think about it. Again, this is not about capacity reduction; it's actually about moving into these new areas where we see new opportunities.","And then from a revenue perspective, as I covered in the prepared remarks, in the first quarter, the contribution from acquisitions in terms of revenue growth was under a point. Now, we've since closed Truven in April and we didn't have The Weather Company, for instance, in the full quarter, so we'll get a bit over a point as we go into the second. But we don't see \u2013 it's not adding 3 or 4 or 5 points here. It really is a point to 2 points as we go into the second in terms of acquisition contribution to revenue growth.","Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Amit. Can we take the next question please?","Operator","Yes ma'am, thank you. Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citigroup. You may ask your question.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much. I was taking a look at your supplemental information on slide 20, and you discuss the signings down 17% year-over-year. And I understand that they're kind of lumpy. Could you address the service backlog, which was down 1% year-over-year, and help us understand how mathematically that number is adjusted for acquisitions that are coming in the year? Thank you.","Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So, the first one or the second part of that, the acquisitions we're making are in things like software businesses. They are in as-a-service businesses. There's nothing in the backlog from acquisitions. So in the back-up information \u2013 and first, Jim, I do want to say, since we put so much time into all these backup charts, I do appreciate that someone's looking at them all, so thank you for that. In the services backlog of down 1%, there are really two components. One is, as I mentioned a couple of questions ago, the GTS component of that continues to grow about 1%, so think of it as low single-digit. And I think that's a good reflection of the demand environment for the kinds of services integrators that our GTS business is becoming.","The other piece of that is the GBS backlog, which is down 5%. So that down 1% is up 1% for GTS down 5%. And that's a reflection of our shift out of these large ERP implementations and the need for us to build some of these new businesses like Cognitive. So there's not a lot of, obviously, Cognitive signings in that backlog yet because we've created the practice within the last six months, and we're building the skill base and we're building the relationships with our clients. It's really those two dynamics. It's pretty good, stable growth \u2013 stable but growing in GTS and a decline in GBS as we shift into those new areas.","Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay, Rowena. Why don't we take one last question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Last question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. Martin, you took the opportunity to invest at a higher rate given the tax refund to accelerate your transformation. How should investors think about that acceleration? Will you get to your goals and strategic imperatives revenue faster than 2018 because you're now investing at a higher pace and acquiring these skill sets, or perhaps throw off higher cash flow faster? And if accelerating the transformation is the right move, then why not like increase leverage and reinvest more aggressively for the remainder of the year as well instead of sort of waiting for the tax refund?","Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, a couple of things, Wamsi. So, we are investing quite aggressively here. And I run the deal committee. We have pretty active discussions still on what else we should acquire in order to build, again, new businesses, to extend the lead that we have in a business. So we'll keep doing that and we'll think prudently about where we deploy our capital.","Now, in terms of spend rates, as I mentioned, investments are shifting our workforce, if you will, investing are changing the way we operate. It's changing the way we engage with one another. So if the world created 5,000 cognitive experts, we would hire 5,000 cognitive experts. We already have, by the way, the largest private math department in the world, and so we are absorbing, if you will, the skills that we need for our business in order to drive these.","But there is a rate at which it doesn't make sense for us to keep putting money into these because the world doesn't create them any more. It's not a problem that can be solved by spending more money. It's a problem that is constrained by the kinds of skills the world's creating. So we have a global search on for talent. People come to IBM and we got about 1.2 million applications \u2013 applicants I should say. We've got more applications, but 1.2 million applicants. They come here in order to work with the leaders in their fields. What we find is that skills have gravity and highly skilled people want to work with others in their fields who are also highly skilled. So they come here to work with our unique data sets, with our unique technologies, with our unique industry expertise, in order to change the way the world works in order to change the way industries operate, in order to change professions. And we'll do that as fast as we can, but you can get a sense \u2013 I think we talked earlier, not in this call but in prior calls, that we hired 70,000 people last year out of the 1.2 million applicants. It takes a while to find the right people, so we'll invest as fast as the world creates the skills we need.","Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So let me wrap up the call because we got a lot done in the quarter, and quite frankly I think we're pretty well positioned for the future. The new structure that we have been talking about which reflects our management system, we expect that it will facilitate our move to a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company, and it will also help our investors understand where we're making investments and where we seeing returns.","We introduced the structure just in February. We provided the history back in March as we said we would, and now it's the first quarter that we're reporting. So hopefully, with what we've done in this transition to this new reporting structure, you found all the information helpful and helped contextualize the results you're looking at and hopefully getting some insight into the businesses as we move through the transformation.","So thank you for joining the call, and we'll talk to you again in July.","Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations","Rowena, can I turn it back to you to wrap it up?","Operator","Yes, ma'am, thank you.

This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM, and I\u2019d like to welcome you to our fourth quarter earnings presentation. I\u2019m here today with Jim Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours, and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow. I\u2019ll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM web site, or from us in Investor Relations.","Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to their related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You will find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation, and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.","So, with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Kavanaugh","Thanks Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us. The fourth quarter capped off a year where we grew revenue, operating pre-tax income, and operating earnings per share. We stabilized our margin as we moved through the year, and we expanded gross and pre-tax margin in the fourth quarter. We continued to invest and take actions to shift our business toward higher-value areas like hybrid cloud and AI, including the announcement of our acquisition of Red Hat.","And we again generated solid free cash flow, which enables this continued investment and shareholder returns. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $21.8 billion of revenue, which was down 1% at constant currency, though down 3% with the impact of currency translation.","As always, I\u2019ll focus on constant currency results. Our operating pre-tax income was $5 billion, and we had $4.87 of operating earnings per share. We had strong performance in software, and in services we had revenue growth and gross margin expansion. This was offset by the expected impact of our IBM Z product cycle dynamics.","Our total software revenue was up 2%. We entered the quarter with a good pipeline of software opportunities, and we executed well, driven by hybrid cloud adoption and strong demand for analytics and AI offerings.","Total services revenue was up 2%. We had steady improvement in Global Business Services throughout the year, with 6% growth in the fourth quarter and revenue growth and gross margin expansion across all three of our GBS business lines.","Global Technology Services had a modest revenue decline, with solid gross margin expansion. We had a great signings quarter, reflecting strong demand for hybrid cloud implementations and our value prop to deliver productivity. Our hardware revenue was down. You\u2019ll recall in 2017 we had a terrific fourth quarter in IBM Z, and so our decline reflects a wrap on that performance.","This continues to be a very successful Z program and remains ahead of our prior cycle. Once again, we had strong growth in Power, with POWER9 now introduced throughout our portfolio.","As you know we provide technology and industry expertise to help run our clients\u2019 most important processes, which puts us in a unique position to help them transform their businesses. As we exit 2018, we\u2019re continuing to see a few themes across our engagements. First, our clients continue to look to turn data into competitive advantage by applying analytics and AI, with an industry lens.","Second, clients are increasingly looking to cloud to drive business value. As they move more mission-critical workloads to the cloud, they need to securely move data and workloads across multiple cloud environments and that requires a hybrid and open-cloud strategy.","And third, clients are focused on productivity and predictability in their spend. Now, IT has always been about driving both technology innovation and productivity, with the balance shifting over time. We\u2019re recently seeing increasing interest in productivity as clients look forward to the next couple of years.","And so our results this quarter reflect our ability to deliver innovation and productivity you see this in our strong results in analytics and AI, in our as-a-Service cloud revenue, and in strong signings in our services business that deliver technology solutions and economic value, all through our integrated value proposition. That\u2019s why companies such as Vodafone and BNP Paribas are leveraging the IBM Cloud, where they benefit from our hybrid multi-cloud capabilities and access to the most advanced technologies. And it\u2019s why Bradesco Bank made a software, hardware and services multi-year commitment to the IBM Z platform, to take them to the next level in AI and hybrid IT, with more predictability in their operating cost.","Across our segments, our strategic imperatives revenue for the year was up 9% to about $40 billion. Within that, our cloud revenue is over $19 billion, and we exited the year with an annual run rate for cloud-delivered-as-a-Service of over $12 billion, which is up 21% over last year. This is a solid base of cloud and cognitive capabilities, and we\u2019re continuing to deliver innovation in these high value areas. For example, in the fourth quarter we introduced AI OpenScale, a platform to manage the lifecycle of all forms of AI models, and Multicloud Manager, a service to deploy and manage complete applications, in any cloud environment.","We\u2019re adding innovative services, like the world\u2019s first commercial quantum computer available on the IBM Cloud. You may have seen that ExxonMobil is already using it to help address its most complex business challenges, such as energy exploration and chemicals manufacturing. The number of new clients using IBM Cloud Private accelerated in the fourth quarter, and adoption is growing for our IBM Cloud Private for Data platform, which was named a leader in the first quarter 2019 Forrester Wave report on Enterprise Insight Platforms. All of this is a validation of our hybrid, open approach to cloud, and we have a strong foundation from which to drive synergies across the business with the addition of Red Hat.","Let me pause here to remind you of the value we see from the combination of IBM and Red Hat, which is all about accelerating hybrid cloud adoption. The client response to the announcement has been overwhelmingly positive. They understand the power of this acquisition, and the combination of IBM and Red Hat capabilities, in helping them move beyond their initial cloud work to really shifting their business applications to the cloud.","They are concerned about the secure portability of data and workloads across cloud environments, about consistency in management and security protocols across clouds, and in avoiding vendor lock-in. They understand how the combination of IBM and Red Hat will help them address these issues.","We see the strong bookings Red Hat recently reported as further evidence of clients\u2019 confidence in the value. Remember, the quarter ended a month after the transaction was announced. From a value perspective, in addition to the growing Red Hat business itself, we see an opportunity to lift all of IBM by selling more of our own IBM Cloud and by selling more of our analytics and AI capabilities on OpenShift across multiple platforms.","As clients proceed on their journey to get more business value from the cloud, they need more services help from the digital design, to app modernization, to native app development, to management of hybrid cloud environments. You saw last week the results of Red Hat\u2019s shareholder vote, with very high participation, and over 99% voting in support.","We are moving through the regulatory process and continue to expect to close in the second half of 2019. We\u2019ve had a decade-long partnership with Red Hat and extended it nearly a year ago around hybrid and multi-cloud. And now, after the announcement in late October, we\u2019ve begun the internal enablement planning so we can hit the ground running post closing.","So now, I\u2019ll go through the details of the fourth quarter, wrap up with a summary of the full year, and our view of 2019. As I said, our revenue in the quarter was $21.8 billion. This includes a currency hurt to revenue of over $500 million, which is 150 million more than mid-October spot rates suggested, as the dollar has continued to strengthen. Looking at our margin dynamics, we expanded both our gross and pre-tax operating margins.","Our gross margin was up 10 basis points, with strong performance in the services businesses, together up 190 basis points. This was mitigated by the expected mix headwind from the IBM Z cycle dynamics. Our operating expense was better 5%. When currency impacts the top line, it generally helps expense, due to both translation and the benefit of hedging contracts.","And so, with the strengthening of the dollar, currency helped our expense by nearly five points. Remember, the majority of our hedges are reflected in expense, and these hedging gains mitigate the currency impacts throughout the P&L. We\u2019ve been focused on driving productivity in our business, implementing new ways of working, like using agile methodologies, and leveraging automation and infusing AI into our processes. This provides flexibility to drive innovation in areas like hybrid cloud, AI, security and blockchain, while also delivering operating leverage.","Within our expense decline, we also had a lower level of IP income. At the beginning of the year we said we expected IP income to be down year-to-year, and it has been tracking lower, down $165 million year-to-year in the fourth quarter, and nearly $450 million for the full year. Putting this expense performance together with our gross margin expansion, pre-tax margin was up 50 basis points.","Looking at operating tax, at the beginning of 2018, we provided a range for our full year tax rate of 16% plus or minus two points and that was without discrete items. With our final geographic and product mix, the full year rate without discretes was about 15%, within the expected range. Including the discrete items in the first and third quarters, our full year operating tax rate was 8%, which is a headwind year-to-year. The resulting tax rate in the fourth quarter was 12%, which is up about six points year-to-year.","Regarding our GAAP tax rate, you saw in our press release that our fourth quarter rate also reflects a charge for a GILTI tax election, associated with the implementation of 2017 U.S. tax reform. This charge impacts GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share.","And so, turning back to our operating results, operating earnings per share of $4.87 was driven by solid operating leverage, offset by an expected headwind from tax.","Looking at our cash metrics, we generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter with $11.9 billion for the year, in line with our expectations. Our realization of GAAP net income is 111% for the year, normalizing for the non-operating tax reform charge. This supports a high level of investment and shareholder returns. So now let me move on to the segments.","Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 2%, with 3% growth in Solutions Software and 1% growth in Transaction Processing Software. We expanded pre-tax margin by nearly three points, delivering operating leverage on this revenue growth, from both operational efficiencies and mix, while still investing at high levels.","In the quarter, we continued to deliver innovation to our clients and scale our platforms and solutions, resulting in growth in our transactional revenue and SaaS signings. In Transaction Processing Software, we capitalized on the strong pipeline of larger transactions we discussed entering the fourth quarter, driven by our clients\u2019 buying cycles. Our fourth quarter performance reflects these clients\u2019 commitment to our platform for the longer term, given the value we provide in managing their mission-critical workloads and predictability in their spending.","In Solutions Software, growth was led by analytics and AI offerings, with several other high-value areas growing as well. In our underlying analytics platform, we had broad-based growth across our Db2 portfolio including analytics appliances, and Data Science offerings.","Demand for our IBM Cloud Private for Data offering accelerated, and now over 100 clients have adopted the platform, and that\u2019s since launching just over six months ago. New clients include the Korea Internet and Security Agency, which is developing an app on ICP for Data that leverages a variety of data sources and machine learning models to find and thwart new cyber threats.","In addition, we\u2019re scaling our newest Watson services running on IBM Cloud Private for Data, like AI OpenScale. In Security, we continued to have solid demand for our integrated security and services solutions, including strong growth in our security intelligence and orchestration offerings, QRadar and Resilient. Within our industry verticals, Watson Health had growth across Payer, Provider, Imaging and Government and IoT once again had strong growth in our core offerings, Maximo and Tririga, where we lead the market in asset management and facilities management.","In the emerging blockchain area, we announced several new clients this quarter, including our work with Smart Dubai on the Middle East\u2019s first government-endorsed blockchain platform. We introduced an on-prem offering in November, the IBM Blockchain Platform for IBM Cloud Private, and signed several new deals this first month. We see a strong pipeline as clients are interested in the benefits of blockchain behind their firewall.","Now, over the last few quarters, I called out offerings within our Solutions Software, which address horizontal domains where we\u2019ve faced secular shifts in the market, specifically collaboration, commerce and talent. We\u2019ve been taking actions, and last month we announced the divestiture of our collaboration and on-prem marketing and commerce products to HCL. After closing, which is currently expected to be mid-year, this action will improve our Cognitive Solutions revenue performance, normalizing for the divested content, and reflects our commitment to disciplined portfolio management.","So now moving on to services, before getting into the two segments, I want to provide a view of the total services business. As I said earlier, revenue was up 2%, and gross margin expanded 190 basis points. Looking at our signings, on our last earnings call we talked about the strong pipeline of deals we had going into the fourth quarter. And we executed well, delivering signings of $15.8 billion, which is up 21% at constant currency.","This results in a backlog which is now $116 billion. Since it\u2019s measured at year-end spot rates, currency is obviously impacting the backlog. But at constant currency, the backlog is down 60 basis points year-to-year, which is about a two-point improvement versus last quarter\u2019s performance.","Customers are increasingly looking to leverage digital for growth and innovation, while at the same time increasing efficiencies and reducing cost within their businesses. IBM Services can deliver this value by leveraging its breadth across GBS and GTS. A recent example is at the Bank of the Philippine Islands, where we\u2019ll provide IT infrastructure services as well as Digital Experience Solutions to support the bank\u2019s ongoing digital transformation, increasing their IT efficiency and scale, and enabling them to seize opportunities in an increasingly digital financial sector.","So now turning to Global Business Services, we again, delivered solid performance, building on the momentum throughout the year. The GBS team has done a really nice job repositioning this business, and you can see it in the results. Revenue grew 6%, with growth across all business lines, and gross margin expanded 300 basis points.","Consulting revenue growth accelerated to 10%. This is validation of our success in bringing together technology and industry expertise to help our clients on their digital journey. We had continued strong growth in Digital Strategy, fueled by our Digital Commerce and CRM offerings. We are also accelerating growth in next generation Enterprise Applications led by strong demand in our consulting and implementation services in areas like S4\/HANA, Salesforce, and Workday.","In Application Management, we grew 4%. This quarter we returned to growth with strong performance in cloud migration factory and cloud application development, mitigated by continued declines in traditional application management engagements, as our clients move to the cloud. The 4% growth also reflects the achievement of significant milestones across a few accounts. We\u2019ve been also improving our revenue profile in Global Process Services.","Revenue grew 5% as we reinvent industry workflows by leveraging automation and infusing AI. And earlier this month, we announced the sale of our mortgage servicing business. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter and will result in improving revenue and margin profile, normalizing for the divested content. So, this action, like the divestiture of select software assets, is about portfolio optimization. We\u2019re focusing on higher-value offerings that are important to our integrated value proposition.","Turning to GBS gross profit, there are a number of drivers of our 300 basis point expansion, including the operating leverage we get on the revenue growth, our mix towards higher-value offerings, and capturing the price for value, a help from currency, given our global delivery mix, and the yield on our productivity and utilization initiatives, including the re-alignment of our skills pyramids to key growth areas.","In Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, we delivered $8.9 billion of revenue, which is flat versus last year, and gross margin expanded approximately 150 basis points. We continued to have strong growth in cloud revenue in the segment, this quarter up 22% year-to-year. We had a strong signings quarter, with 16 transactions over $100 million each. Both new and existing clients are looking to IBM to manage their critical infrastructure and deliver innovation, while simultaneously achieving predictable spending. We continue to see momentum in our open hybrid multi-cloud approach.","I mentioned BNP Paribas earlier. BNP Paribas has selected IBM to strengthen its cloud environment, with a hybrid multi-cloud approach, bringing together the IBM Cloud, private clouds, along with existing infrastructure. Leveraging IBM\u2019s technical and industry expertise, BNP Paribas will accelerate its digitization to offer its clients the best services, while respecting the security and confidentiality of their data.","Looking at the revenue by line of business, Infrastructure Services revenue was flat. As we prioritize our portfolio, we are exiting some lower value content, which slightly impacts near-term revenue performance, but results in higher margins.","In Technical Support Services, revenue was down 3%. TSS continues to be impacted by the hardware product cycle dynamics, partially off-set by continued growth in our core multi-vendor services offerings. And, finally, Integration Software growth accelerated to 4%. This performance was driven by continued strong adoption of IBM Cloud Private, where we added 200 new clients. That brings our total number of clients using this innovative platform to 600 in just over a year, as they continue to modernize traditional workloads.","We also now have over 100 IBM software offerings integrated with IBM Cloud Private, including Blockchain, Watson, IoT, and Analytics. We are continuing to deliver innovation in this space, with new offerings to enable clients in an open, hybrid, multi-cloud world, like IBM Multicloud Manager which I mentioned earlier.","Turning to profit for the segment, gross margin improvement is driven by the lift of our productivity initiatives. This includes infusing AI and automation in our delivery processes, such as by leveraging IBM Services Delivery Platform with Watson, and embedding agile thinking into our service delivery processes. We\u2019re also leveraging productivity and talent optimization efforts, where we continue to optimize business processes, reskill our expert workforce and leverage our global scale. PTI margin was flat, reflecting continued investments to expand our go-to-market capabilities and develop new offerings to capture the hybrid market opportunity.","So, to wrap up services at the beginning of 2018, we said we expected an improving trajectory in our services revenue and profit, and we delivered on that throughout the year, with a strong fourth quarter.","In systems, revenue was down 20% this quarter. I\u2019ll remind you that this is compared to a very strong performance in the fourth quarter last year, where we grew 28%. Systems pre-tax margin was down 6.5 points, reflecting the mix headwind from the IBM Z product cycle.","I\u2019ll walk through the different dynamics across the hardware portfolio. In IBM Z, we are six quarters into the z14 cycle. Z revenue declined 44%, while margins expanded modestly, in line with where we are in the cycle. The program continues to track ahead of the prior program, with broad client adoption across industries and countries. We continued to add new clients and new workloads to the platform. Since launching the z14 program, our MIPs capacity has increased nearly 20%, with new workload MIPs growing twice the rate of our standard MIPs.","So, we\u2019re taking advantage of the secular shifts in the market, and now over 55% of our installed MIPs inventory is in emerging workload areas. And while there is volatility in the hardware due to product cycles, as we continue to grow our install base, up roughly 3.5 times over the last decade, this provides stability in our related software, services and financing business across IBM. Power revenue was up 10% driven by Linux and continued strong adoption across our new POWER9-based architecture.","In the fourth quarter, we completed the release of our next generation POWER9 processors in the high end, and we had strong adoption in both the low and high-end systems. Our Power9 systems are designed for handling advanced analytics, cloud environments and data-intensive workloads in AI, HANA, and UNIX markets and we now have extended HANA certification to our Power9 high end.","In the fourth quarter, we had strong initial traction with our new offerings that optimize both hardware and software for AI, such as PowerAI Vision which we introduced in the second half of 2018. And we\u2019ve essentially completed the deployment of our supercomputers at the U.S. Department of Energy labs in the quarter.","Storage hardware was down, with declines in midrange, mitigated by continued strong growth in All Flash Arrays. The storage market remains very competitive, with ongoing pricing pressures. We\u2019re continuing to introduce new innovations and functionality. For example, in December we extended our next generation NVMe technology into the midrange, with strong initial client adoption. We will continue to roll out NVMe across the storage portfolio in the first half of 2019.","So now turning to cash, we generated $7.3 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, excluding our financing receivables. With nearly $900 million in capital expenditures, we generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. This capped off a year with $15.6 billion of cash from operations, also excluding financing. We invested $3.7 billion in CapEx this year, mainly in our services and cloud-based businesses, and that\u2019s up $400 million from","last year.","And so, we generated free cash flow of $11.9 billion for the year, and as I mentioned, our normalized free cash flow realization was 111%. You\u2019ll recall that we expected our free cash flow to be about $12 billion for 2018. The year-to-year decline reflects the headwinds we anticipated from CapEx, working capital and cash taxes. We returned over $10 billion to shareholders in the year, including dividends of $5.7 billion. We\u2019ve now increased our dividend per share for 23 consecutive years, and we remain committed to continued dividend increases. We also bought back just under 33 million shares, reducing our","average share count by over 2%. At the end of the year, we had $3.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.","Now looking at the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of $12.2 billion, which without the impact of currency is consistent with a year ago. Total debt was $45.8 billion, down a $1 billion year-to-year, with 68% in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business is in line with the target of 9 to 1, and the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 55% investment grade, a point better than a year ago. And so, our balance sheet remains strong, and we are committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating.","As we typically do at the end of the year, I want to provide a quick update on our retirement-related plans. Our U.S. plan has been frozen for over a decade, and over the last several years we\u2019ve moved our asset base to a lower risk, lower return profile. At the end of 2018, in aggregate, our worldwide tax-qualified plans are nearly fully funded, with the U.S. at 104%, consistent with a year ago. So, despite the volatility in the markets, our plans are in really good shape.","So, let me start to wrap up with some thoughts on 2018, and then I\u2019ll move on to expectations for 2019. As we opened the year, we talked about the work we had done to reposition our business to help move our clients to the future, shifting our portfolio, changing our operating model and the way we work, and reallocating our capital.","And in our earnings call last January, we talked about how that drove our expectations for 2018, in revenue, in margin, and in earnings per share. First, we said we expected to grow revenue at then-current spot rates. We did in fact grow revenue for the year, and that\u2019s despite the U.S. dollar appreciation since early 2018, reducing our revenue growth by about two points, or $1.7 billion.","Second, we said we\u2019d stabilize gross margins. While we fell a bit short for the full year, we stabilized gross margin in the third quarter, and expanded both gross and pre-tax margin in the fourth quarter and second half, that\u2019s for the first time in over three years. We said tax would be a headwind for the year. And it was a headwind to us, for the year, and in the fourth quarter. We continued to return value to shareholders, with share repurchases contributing to earnings per share growth.","And finally, we said we expected operating earnings per share of at least $13.80 and free cash flow of about $12 billion and we achieved both of these. So, looking back on 2018, we grew revenue, operating profit and operating earnings per share for the year, with strong free cash flow realization. We had good momentum in GBS, with particular strength in consulting, led by our digital and cloud application offerings. We executed well in software in the fourth quarter, finishing the year strong, led by analytics and AI, and our hybrid cloud software.","As we execute our strategy to help our clients implement hybrid cloud, our total cloud revenue grew to over $19 billion. Across software and services, we continued to build our as-a-Service revenue, and we exited the year with a $12 billion annual run rate, which is up 21%. We continued our very successful IBM Z program and strong performance in Power, with our Power9 architecture roll-out. We repositioned our operating model and drove productivity, which improved our margin profile.","We also continued to prioritize our investments and took actions to optimize our portfolio. We announced the sale of select software and services businesses, actions that not only improve our go-forward revenue profile, but allow us to increase our focus and investment in the high value segments of IT in areas like hybrid cloud, AI, and blockchain.","All of this provides a solid business and financial foundation for the addition of Red Hat. And it gives us confidence in our expectation for full year 2019 operating earnings per share of at least $13.90. Before we go to Q&A, I want to be clear about what is, and is not included in our expectations.","As I mentioned earlier, Red Hat is expected to close in the second half, and given the financial implications to 2019 are heavily dependent on the timing of the closing, Red Hat is not included in our expectations. We\u2019ll update our view of the year at the time of closing.","In the last month and a half, we\u2019ve also announced two divestitures, the sale of our collaboration and on-prem marketing commerce software and the sale of our Seterus mortgage servicing business. For these businesses, when we consider the combination of the foregone profit, the gain on the sale of software assets, the actions to address structure and stranded costs and the resulting benefits from these actions, we expect there to be minimal impact to our profit and earnings per share for the year.","And unlike the Red Hat acquisition, the timing of the closing does not have a significant impact on the financial implications for the year, though it may affect the quarterly skew. As a result, our guidance assumes these divestitures. Said another way, because the divestitures are essentially neutral to our profit for 2019, they don\u2019t impact the Operating EPS guidance for the year, though they do have a benefit to our financial profile over the longer term.","Turning to free cash flow, we expect about $12 billion in 2019, with a realization rate of about 100%. This reflects our expected operational profit performance and continued working capital efficiency, partially offset with a cash tax headwind. We have also taken into account the estimated free cash flow impacts of the software and services divestitures.","Note that while these are relatively neutral to earnings, they are a headwind to our free cash flow, because the gain proceeds flow into the investing section of our cash flow statement. Finally, while we haven\u2019t included Red Hat, we have taken into account an estimate of the pre-closing financing costs associated with the acquisition. So, when you put it all together, we see free cash flow of about $12 billion, which is roughly flat year-to-year, even after absorbing the headwind from the portfolio actions.","And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia for the Q&A.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and the full year. This includes the 2018 performance and year-end assumptions for our retirement-related plans, and supporting information on the 2019 implications of our divested businesses.","And second, as always, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So, operator, let\u2019s please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now start the question-and-answer session of this conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. Jim, IBM delivered a nice profit trajectory here exiting 2018. In this weaker macro backdrop, it looks like you've a pretty robust 2019 guidance. And I was hoping that you can help talk through what the profit trajectory looks like and gross and PTI level in 2019 and some color on the broader puts and takes embedded in your 2019 guide including the IP income and taxes. That would be helpful. Thank you.","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay, Wamsi. Thank you very much for the question. And it's probably a good place to start given we just concluded the prepared remarks and we talked about some of the dynamics of what's in our guidance. But as always, you would expect we run multiple scenarios here across our business and we're looking at the trajectory of our business, the macroeconomic environment, what our enterprise clients are telling us. And we also take into account our own operational indices in front of us and our business plans and strategies.","And when we put all that together this is what gives us confidence in and expectation of our operating EPS of at least $13.90 for 2019. Now, as I just stated, this guidance excludes Red Hat just given to the timing sensitivity and the financial implications I want to close as, but it includes the announced divestitures. And we'll talk about that through all these Q&As with regards to any forward-looking guidance.","But we enter \u2013 from my perspective, we enter 2019 with a much improved business profile in terms of one driving operating leverage and you saw how that played out in the second half. And it's right to the core of your question. And two, I mean, our strategic imperatives right now, the high value emerging segments in the IT industry are now consistently over 50% of IBM's business.","So we don't give guidance on revenue. Let me give you a little color behind that and then I'll go to operating leverage and gross and pretax margin and tax, as we move forward. But first I'll start with a tailwind. We have a solid annuity base in our business, today it's about 60% of IBM and that builds resiliency into our model.","And we got good momentum in our as-a-Service as you heard. We exited the year with an annualized exit run rate of $12.2 billion and that's up 21% year-over-year. You combine that with the strength within our services business, we accelerated throughout the year and we exited the year with a very strong performance by GBS team who is just doing excellent with regards to continuing to win in front of the marketplace and deliver value to their clients.","And we also captured significant signings in the fourth quarter that positions our GTS business, and really instantiates our value around hybrid cloud and how we're winning. And then you couple that with solid execution on software. We talked 90 days ago about where we were at in the third quarter around software and we made some forward-looking projections and we turned our software business around to growth growing 2% in the fourth quarter, and we have a strong portfolio lineup so we would expect that to continue.","And in hardware, yes, we\u2019re on the back end of our mainframe cycle. And I would tell you it's the most successful mainframe we\u2019ve had in quite a bit of time. But we continue to bring new innovation to market to deliver value for our clients in our POWER9 architecture, which is resonating well in the marketplace and we got great acceptance, grew 10% in the fourth quarter. We expect that will continue to play out in 2019. So we've got a good book of business here and some tailwinds at us.","And from a headwind perspective, you talked about macro. Well, the first thing I would call out is currency. The U.S. dollar continues to strengthen throughout 2018. Especially even since our last earnings call 90 days ago, the U.S. dollar continued to appreciate. And right now you saw in the supplemental charts we provide you with transparency, we expect about a one to two point headwind on currency. And then finally, we are taking very disciplined portfolio actions across our business where they don't align to our integrated value play and where we can reprioritize and focus our investment to drive the value around the IBM company that divested contents is going to be about a one point headwind.","So when you put it all together, we've got some pluses and minuses at the top line. But really, this year, in 2019, it's going to be predicated on operating leverage. We made good progress through 2018 and it positions us very well into expand margins in 2019. So amongst all of our scenarios, our guidance model and our expectations indicate that we will expand gross and pre-tax operating margin in 2019 as we continue to deliver value. And that's going to come out of scale efficiencies, that's going to come out of our services momentum and the mixed shift and productivity, which will offset \u2013 more than offset the product cycle mix, we still have in the divested content.","And one last thing that I would call out is tax. We're guiding to an all-in rate of about 11% to 12%, which by the way is a headwind year-to-year that we're going to have to overcome, a finishing with a printed rate of about 8% in 2018. Now this rate assumes estimated potential discretes. This is a change we're doing this to provide enhanced transparency into our guidance as we move forward. But I will tell you discretes by nature, vary in timing. They vary in amounts and will be recorded when they occur in 2019.","But you put all that together, we've got headwinds and tailwinds on revenue, strong portfolio line-up in our high value services and software. We got expanding operating leverage that we expect, the tax rate all-in of about 11% or 12%. This gives us confidence in our full year EPS of at least $13.90 and a free cash flow of about $12 billion.","Patricia Murphy","Great. Thanks. Thanks Wamsi. Can we go to the question, please?","Operator","Here our next question is coming from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes. Thank you. And thank you for the clarification on the previous question. I just wanted to know if you could clarify what the size of the expected gain is on the sale of assets to Red Hat, excuse me to HCL. And then whether you expect directionally Red Hat to be accretive or dilutive to free cash flow and EPS this year?","And then on software, could you comment on the strength that you saw, was it a push out? Do you feel like you captured large enterprise license agreements or is this sort of a more normalized book? And should we expect cognitive to grow in Q1 and Q2 at a similar pace to what we saw in Q4? Thank you.","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay, Toni. Thank you very much. Very good questions. Let me try to take each of these piece by piece. First of all as you saw from our last earnings, we continue to take disciplined portfolio prioritization efforts around \u2013 our portfolio both in terms of an announcement of the acquisition of Red Hat and also the announcement of sale of certain assets within our cognitive and GBS business.","Red Hat, as we talked about, expected was \u2013 we're working through regulatory right now. We expect to close that in the second half. But with regards to your specific question on divestitures, we included in our guidance the sale of our collaboration in non-prem marketing and commerce business and the sale of our Seterus mortgaging business.","Both of these will drive headwinds as you can imagine in revenue for the year. We expect the mortgage business to close later in the first quarter. That will be a headwind this year to GBS revenue. But on a sustainable basis, this improves both our revenue profile in GBS and our margin profile as we continue to shift the higher value as we move forward.","In terms of our Cognitive assets that we sold, with regards to collaboration in non-prem, those businesses generated roughly a little bit over $1 billion of revenue over the last 12 months. We said we expected to close that by mid-year. The transaction price was $1.8 billion, but the expected gain, I will tell you, will be a lot less than that $1.8 billion as we're working through the acquisition accounting right now with regards to goodwill and how much goodwill will be applied to that. But we still expect a sizable gain, nowhere near $1.8 billion, but a sizeable gain.","And as we said, we've got to overcome; one, the foregone profit of these businesses, the stranded cost of these businesses, and we will take that gain and as you would expect, we're going to utilize a portion of that gain to address that stranded costs and structure and we\u2019ll get return on that.","All of that put together is minimal impact to our profit. So we included that in our guidance. It has minimal impact to our profit and EPS, but it does have an impact to free cash flow. Just given what I said a little while ago in the prepared remarks, on the gain, on the asset sale, we\u2019ll end up in the investing section, our free cash flow. So we've overcome that and still guided our free cash flow, that's roughly flat at about $12 billion.","Now your second question was on Cognitive. We obviously executed well. You dial back 90 days ago and we had some pretty frank discussions about our portfolio, how we had confidence in our portfolio, the competitiveness and the value we bring to clients. And we didn't execute in third quarter and we came back, we executed on strong pipelines.","Software was up 2% overall. Our transact \u2013 we had strong transactional performance. But probably what I'm most proud about is it was pervasive. We grew in hybrid cloud integration software 4%, we grew in solutions software 3% across many of our offerings led by data and AI and analytics, also in many offerings in our industry verticals around Watson Health, and we grew in transaction processing software, which we said that business\u2019s mission-critical, high value to our clients and a foul client-buying cycles.","So if anything in our overall portfolio software that\u2019s tied to skew, it\u2019s really the transaction processing software business, where we close strong pipeline, which we talked about 90 days ago. So we feel very good about the competitiveness and value of our portfolio. We\u2019re going to feel even better when we close the Red Hat acquisition, and what that does to provide us an acceleration in a leadership position on a hybrid multi-cloud and we\u2019re excited and looking forward to that.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Tony. And can we please go to the next question?","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Good afternoon. Congrats on the nice numbers in the fourth quarter. Question around linearity in 2019, there\u2019s a lot going on with tax, grade, divestiture, another Red Hat numbers are in the guidance yet. But how should we think about linearity given that the timing of some of these discrete items may change the walkthrough in the year?","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay. Thank you, Katy. And thanks on behalf of the entire IBM team, really just deliver the solid fourth quarter here. But if you take a look at, it\u2019s very good question. Why don\u2019t I just address it by trying to get some visibility into first quarter? It\u2019s right in front of us right now. If you take a look at first quarter again, we guided full year EPS of at least $13.90. If you look at first quarter, first of all, on an EPS perspective, we would expect the operating EPS skew to be around 16% of the full year $13.90.","So when you take a look at that, it gets us off to a good start. It does acknowledge that we are on the back end of a mainframe product cycle, but we got acceleration in our services and our software base of business. And we feel confident in at least that 16% starting out the year. Now, if you look at that compared to the last three years, it will show that it\u2019s a little bit less attainment.","But to your \u2013 heart of your question, the last few years we had substantial discrete tax items in the first quarter. If you go back to 16%, we closed on the Japan audit. If you go back to last year, we closed on the U.S. audit settlement. We do not see anywhere near the level of discretes in the first quarter. And I would project somewhere around 11%, 10%. There might be something within the first quarter, but we\u2019re not talking substantial amount.","So that is really EPS. On revenue, which we probably have the best visibility just given our operational indices, the mixed differential of our revenue base between annuity and transactional, when we move from a fourth quarter and the first quarter. That seasonality, the transactional businesses have a more muted effect on 1Q versus 4Q. And as the mix of more annuity content, which plays out in the first quarter, this should contribute about a 1 to 2 point sequential improvement and our growth at constant currency. We just came off our fourth quarter with many different dynamics that produce a down 1 at constant currency.","So we do see an improvement just given the mixed shift in the strength of our annuity content as we move forward. The last thing that I\u2019ll bring up about first quarter is, I talked a little bit about currency for the year, we have our toughest compare on currency in the first quarter, just given last year the dollar weakened throughout the first quarter and then dramatically accelerated or strengthen as we move through 2Q to 4Q.","So as you saw in the supplemental chart, our currency impact is going to be a 3 to 4 point headwind and based on what I looked that were dollar closed late today, it\u2019s going to be probably closer to that 4 point headwind overall.","Patricia Murphy","Okay. Thanks, Katy. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Thanks. I want to ask on services that improved, like you said, it would in 2018. I\u2019m curious, your outlook is for 2019 within services, because there are some moving parts GBS is perform really well application management up into a nice place, so curious on a sustainability there. Just as a clarification away from the services, what strategic imperatives of 9%, there wasn\u2019t as much talk about that in the prepared remarks. I\u2019m curious, that still going to be a metric that\u2019s going to be provided or attract going forward. Thanks.","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay, Tien-tsin. Thank you very much for the question. We obviously are very pleased with our services business and how we\u2019ve continued to reposition our portfolio both in GBS, but also in our GTS space of business as we move throughout 2018. But when you look at the trajectory of our business, we ended the year with an overall are absolute backlog of $116 billion, that\u2019s down 60 basis points at constant currency and it\u2019s a big improvement from where we started a year ago. If you remember our discussions here a year ago, we had a lot of discussion about your overall backlog is down 3% at constant currency and we talked a lot about what we saw play out in 2018 and the team\u2019s just done an excellent job. We\u2019re in a much better position. And we do see across our total services business in 2019 sustained revenue growth and margin profile.","Well, let me take the pieces and just give you a little bit of perspective. GBS, I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the team about what they\u2019ve done to reposition their portfolio and their offerings in capturing, in delivering growth to our clients, in digital, in cognitive and cloud. You saw in the fourth quarter, we exited GBS, I\u2019ll get these numbers pretty close. Strategic imperatives growing mid-teens, cloud growing 30%-plus and our as-a-Service based business, exiting would over a $2 billion number, I think up 64% overall.","And we\u2019ve got pervasive growth across all three lines of business led by digital. We did state an application management, where we finally returned back to growth in the fourth quarter. We are executing and delivering value and driving cloud migration services and cloud application development. We have a differentiated offering and we\u2019re delivering value to our clients, but we also closed on many client specific milestones that caught up in the fourth quarter, but we still see good growth. It\u2019s just not going to be at the level that you saw here in the fourth quarter.","With all that said, our margin and operating leverage, we feel comfortable. We grew GBS operating gross margins 300 basis points in the fourth quarter. That will dissipate throughout 2019, but we still see strong operating leverage led by our mix shift to higher value in the offerings, how we\u2019re capturing that price realization and how we\u2019re delivering real value and quality to our clients.","Now in GTS, we are obviously winning with our hybrid cloud momentum. We had a strong signings quarter, really led by GTS overall in the hybrid cloud value prop, delivered $15.8 billion of signings, up 21% that\u2019s what improved their backlog position here at the end of the year, and we\u2019re exiting with $8 billion as-a-Service annualized exit run rate which provides a strong annuity based content and resiliency in our model.","Now with that said, we are doing portfolio prioritization in GTS. We are constantly going to focus on where we can exploit and deliver value to our client and also make high value returns for the IBM shareholder. We are walking away from low value based content in GTS, you saw that in the fourth quarter where our GTS business overall was down I think, 50, 70 basis points.","And while you see that back \u2013 absolute backlog improve, we are going to continue prioritizing high value because we want to get prioritization of cash, profit and margin out of that business and leverage that business in the value of incumbency and moving our clients to the future in capitalizing on hybrid cloud.","So we\u2019ll see continued margin expansion in GTS as we move forward and that\u2019s going to come out of very similar scale efficiencies, productivity. And remember in both, we\u2019re still going to get the second half of our productivity from our 2018 actions. So we feel pretty comfortable and confident in our services base of business as we walk into 2019.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Tien-tsin. Can we go to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.","David Grossman","Thank you. So Jim, you\u2019ve announced two divestitures in the last six weeks, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you are exiting some GTS business that was perhaps lower margin, slower growth. Obviously, without getting too specific, what else can you tell us about the other efforts that are underway to streamline the legacy core that may positively impact the agility of the organization as well as positively impact your growth rate.","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay. David, thanks very much for the question. Let me take a big step back. Obviously I\u2019ve been thinking about this as Jenny and everyone else. From my perspective, we constantly say IBM is a high value based company. We\u2019re a high value to our clients. We\u2019re high value to our shareholders. In the way we remain high value is through disciplined portfolio optimization. And whether you go over, what we just did the last 90 or 120 days or you go over the last three to five years, we have constantly focused on one, where is the market moving in terms of growth, high value offerings, client value, and most importantly profit pools. And you\u2019re seeing us continue to do that as we move forward.","These latest actions really center around disciplined portfolio prioritization around market attractiveness, around differentiation and around how they really play to the integrated value of the IBM portfolio. Our differentiated hardware software services, and that was really at the heart of the divestitures that we just announced around certain assets in our Cognitive Solutions segment and in our global processing mortgage servicing unit, they were basically more and more sold as standalone only products and offerings that can be leveraged and delivered to our clients through a different partner, who will make the investment prioritization as we move forward.","I could tell you, we're always looking at portfolio optimization, and how we prioritize our investment and capital allocation and you see that with the announcement of Red Hat and you see that play out and what we just did with Cognitive and GBS. But as we go forward, we're going to continue to prudently managing our portfolio and operate what that financial discipline in terms of acquisitions. Our strategy hasn't changed. It's always been built around supporting high value.","And it's about built around leveraging the investment thesis and narrative of IBM innovative technology, deep industry expertise and trust and security all delivered through an integrated model of hardware, software services. And then finally, I would tell you, we have a strong balance sheet. We have great cash flow and we have enough financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business and returning value to our shareholders over the long term. So we feel pretty good.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, David. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming John Roy of UBS. Your line is open.","John Roy","Great. Thank you so much. So, well, obviously, cloud is a trend that everybody is giving off more importance here in the enterprise space and yet, you have somewhat of a flat quarter. I was curious as to when you win cloud deals as to why and how would you see the Red Hat acquisition is changing the color around why you win and how much you win?","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay, John. Thank you very much for the question. Let me try to put this in perspective around cloud. First of our cloud overall for the year, it was $19.2 billion. That was up 12%. And within that, as we always talk about the high value emerging areas of as-a-Service finished when an annualized exit run rate of $12.2 billion up 21%, which really clearly underlines our consistent execution in us capturing the high value secular shifts around cloud in that as-a-Service. Now, when you look at cloud in the quarter, the cloud number as printed really reflects the same fundamental headwind on the wrap of the product cycle or mainframe that we had to overcome.","Now that isn't new, we expected that. We've been talking about that all year long. Second half of the year, we knew we were going to be on the backend of our mainframe product cycle. Remember we came off a mainframe that grew 71% in the fourth quarter of 2017. And this is as I said before, the most successful mainframe product cycle in quite some time, which by the way generates and captures new emerging workloads around pervasive encryption, but also as capturing new workloads around cloud as we move forward.","So that cloud business without mainframe was actually up 19%. That's an acceleration underlying our software acceleration from 3Q to 4Q underlining our services acceleration from 3Q to 4Q and we see that as we move forward because remember, although we had a deal with the largest transactional quarter on mainframe, albeit in 2019, that starts to dissipate because we're through that biggest volume based quarter.","So we see cloud still resonating with our clients into your heart of your question about Red Hat, Red Hat and IBM together we see this movement of how we can deliver value in leading the second phase, Ginni calls this chapter two, the second phase around where clients are moving, very business critical business value lead workloads and that's about 80% of the workloads ahead of us.","So the value of bringing IBM and Red Hat together is going to be centered around hybrid open multicloud and us wrapping around our security, secure to the core and how we're going to deliver that differentiated value proposition. And we're just excited about what Red Hat is going to mean to the IBM company and our clients.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks John. And can we please take the next question?","Operator","Next question is coming from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jim Schneider","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, it's good to see the improvement in software and cognitive relative last quarter. I guess the question is on a go forward basis or you have a target of mid-single-digit growth long-term in cognitive, is it realistic to expect that you could achieve that, as we head throughout 2019 and maybe talk about the impact of any of the transactional business you may have seen this quarter that might affect that, and just kind of talk broadly about the macro environment for that product fit in general?","Jim Kavanaugh","Yes. Jim, thanks very much for the question overall. We are pleased with our software performance exiting the year. As I talked about, I think it's really an instantiation that demonstrates our ability to deliver innovative solutions embedded with AI, that drives business value to our clients really through an industry lens that plays across the integrated value of IBM. What are services base of business in stacked on top of our hardware based platforms, but when you look at fourth quarter, we exited 2% growth.","We had good pervasive growth across the portfolio, as I said before, good, strong transactional growth, good SaaS signings, high renewal rates, and remember this cognitive solution segment is high value, high operating margins, and we continue to expand operating margins here in the fourth quarter and for the full year.","Now when you take a step back, U.S. long-term, well obviously in 2019 we're going to deal with the headwind I talked about what the domestic content, that will to cognitive solutions probably be, on a trailing 12 months we did a over a little over $1 billion. It'll be about a four, five point headwind in 2019 and that's pre Red Hat acquisition because Red Hat\u2019s not in 2019 yet. But we're going to have right off the bat of four to five point headwind.","But the underlying fundamentals in our long-term sustainability around that. Yes, our long-term model has not changed. We still see the strength of our offering portfolio, one, even getting better around our hybrid integration software, two around our analytics portfolio, which just had a great quarter, a data AI, our industry based verticals our Watson Health had growth across many of its offerings as I talked about earlier.","And even in IoT we had growth around our core franchises, our facilities management and asset management, Maximo, Tririga. So we got a good, good lineup. It's going to be on us to execute here in 20 \u2013 2019. We fully expect to do that.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks, Jim. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi","Hi, it sounded like in your remarks earlier that you thought you could deliver sustainable organic constant currency growth in 2019. And so does that include or exclude Red Hat and then just as importantly, maybe you can give us some color around first half margins versus second half margins and maybe what the margin exit rate will be for 2019? Thanks.","Jim Kavanaugh","Sure, Joe, thank you very much for the call. First of all, we don\u2019t guide on revenue for the year. So, I don\u2019t remember stating that we are going to grow the year at constant currency organically et cetera. Red Hat is not in any of the guidance as we talked about upfront. We do have the divestitures in here and divestitures are going to be about a point headwind as we move forward and as I stated, currency is going to be a one or two point headwind at actual rates. But we do feel confident in the book of business we have around our services and around our software as we move forward. But the underlying dynamics as I talked about, we got many different scenarios we\u2019re running here.","All the point to given us confidence in our expectation of at least $13.90 as we move forward. That is going to be a mixture of the mix of our portfolio, the revenue of our portfolio, the operating leverage of our portfolio, the tax structure IP, there are many different variables that go into that $13.90 overall.","We do see strong operating leverage continuing in 2019; both gross and pretax margin leveraging our scale efficiencies, leveraging our mixed shift, the higher value, leveraging our productivity initiatives.","And when you look at it, we\u2019ve got great momentum exiting second half in particular on our services base of business. Second half services grew operating gross margins by 200 basis points. And I think you would expect a similar first half trend around that and in second half, we\u2019ll start wrapping on a little bit tougher compares, but for the first, excuse me, for the full year, we would expect good operating leverage and that\u2019s what we\u2019re guiding to.","Patricia Murphy","Thanks Joe. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. In your prepared slides, Slide number 10, it was very informative to help us bridge the two different years on our earnings. The question I have is, as we look forward to next year I know you have a lot of variables, are there any bridge items that you want to particularly call us out for most likely to happen to hit your $13.90, and how come cash flow wouldn\u2019t be growing if your earnings growing? Thank you.","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay, Jim. First of all, thank you for the question. Thanks for the compliment. Team does work very hard that you provide the right level of transparency. So our investors can understand the operating dynamics of our business. Chart 10 lays out that full year. You see how 2018 played out, strong operating leverage, tax headwind, revenue growth at actuals when you look at it and you go back to beginning of January last year, we stated what we saw for the year. We grew revenue. We grew operating leverage. We grew operating pretax income. We grew earnings per share and that played out well. If you look at 2019, as I stated many different scenarios, but what have we talked about already on this call?","One, we see continued operating leverage coming out of gross and pretax margin in 2019. Two, we do see tax being a headwind to us in 2019 and again, we tried to provide enhanced transparency, where we\u2019re giving you an all in rate of at least 11% to 12%, but even with that, that\u2019s a three to four point headwind. We\u2019ll continue to buy back shares as we talked about.","I think that\u2019s one level of confidence and we have in the long-term value of IBM, but it\u2019s also a level of confidence that we have in the power of the IBM and Red Hat acquisition. So, I think you could see that continuing to play out. And then I guess last, we talked about currency on revenue; currency on revenue, the impact of one or two points and the divestiture. So, we will continue showing the transparency of the CPS bridge, helps our investors understand the operating dynamics as we move forward.","Patricia Murphy","And then jim, on your question on cash, as jim said in the prepared remarks, we obviously have a headwind from the divested businesses, because we have the forgone \u2013 we\u2019ll have forgone profit and we\u2019ll have a gain, but the gain doesn\u2019t go into free cash flow. We also will have some items that hit our free cash flow relative to some pre-closing costs for Red Hat. So, that\u2019s the reason that our free cash flow is flat despite the fact that we have a couple of headwinds within them. So, operator, why don\u2019t we take one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question in queue is coming from Keith Bachman of BMO. Your line is open.","Keith Bachman","Hi, thank you. Jim, just a clarification first then a question on the clarification, you mentioned the impact of the divestitures. And the slide that indicates the impact is $1.5 billion, I think you said $1 billion was coming out of cognitive and I just wanted to see if you just clarify, where is the rest coming out of?","And then the question is on technology services and cloud platforms. I wanted to get your perspective as you look at 2019; this business continues to trail a little bit relative to GBS in terms of revenue performance. Would you expect or anticipate this business to grow and CY19? And therefore, would you expect operating leverage to also be demonstrated in this business? Thank you.","Jim Kavanaugh","Yes. Thanks keith for the question overall. First of all, on your clarification, the impact of divestitures, we actually did provide a supplemental chart that hopefully each of you and our investors will appreciate on the transparency and the implications both on 2019 and then directionally on 2019. I think, I said a little over $1 billion, if you look at Chart 15 in the supplementals, the cognitive software assets of divesting collaboration and our on-prem marketing and commerce was about a $1.3 billion.","So that\u2019s what I meant about a little over $1 billion. When you take a look at the GBS mortgage servicing divesture that\u2019s about $200 million, so on a full year basis annualized it\u2019s about $1.5 billion between the two of them. So hopefully that answers the clarification.","And then on your second question, TS and CP, we finished the year with strong signings growth, which really instantiates our hybrid cloud value proposition and also the value of incumbency that we provide with our clients of understanding their workloads, understanding their business processes, and enabling us to move them to the future and capturing that cloud backlog. In fact cloud backlog is up over 5 points year-to-year as a percent of our total outsourcing backlog.","But as I said earlier, GTS business, we are going to manage this business for profit, for cash and for leveraging our incumbency to move our clients in the future and provide better client value and delight them through loyalty as they move forward. And we are going to exit some low value content business. So for 2019, I would expect pretty similar performance in GTS overall on a top line, but in margin we are going to expand margin that\u2019s in our expectations and you see that play out in the second half of 2018 and we expect that to continue.","So, all right, with that said, apologize for going a little bit long here, we wanted to get a lot in here, one about the quarter but two about wrapping up the year and what it means for 2019, so a few comments to wrap up.","We\u2019re entering 2019 in a great position to help our clients whether they\u2019re looking for innovation or productivity or both. We\u2019ve got a solid base of business. You see this in our software and services results with strategic imperatives now consistently at about half of our revenue. And an operating leverage we\u2019re driving and we expect that to continue. This gives us confidence in our expectation of at least $13.90 of earnings per share for the year and our hand-rolling gets stronger with the addition of Red Hat, which positions us as the leader in hybrid multi-cloud world.","So thanks for joining us today. We look forward to continuing the dialogue over the course of the year. Thank you very much.","Patricia Murphy","Okay. And let me turn it back to you to wrap up the call.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call.

In the second quarter, we delivered $20 billion of revenue, $3.4 billion of operating pretax income and $3.08 of operating earnings per share. Overall, it was a good quarter. We grew revenue, operating gross profit, pretax income, and earnings per share with strong pretax margin performance. Our revenue was up 4% as reported with growth in all four of our major segments and our constant currency revenue growth was 2%. This is our best constant currency growth in seven years. And our pretax income was up 11%, reflecting good operating leverage on that revenue growth.","Looking at our performance at constant currency. The revenue trajectory improved in both services segments and both returned to modest growth. This is important to our overall revenue growth profile as services represents about 60% of our revenue on an annual basis. In Cognitive, we had good performance in analytics and in our industry verticals, driven by financial services, and IoT. Growth was mitigated by the same three areas I told you about on our last call as we continue to focus on repositioning these offerings. And we had strong performance and gained share in our Systems business, which was up over 20% with growth across all three hardware platforms.","Across our segments, we had continue momentum in our strategic imperatives revenue. Over the last 12 months, our strategic imperatives revenue has grown to $39 billion, which represents 48% of IBM's revenue. And within that, cloud is now $18.5 billion. Our strategic imperatives revenue in the quarter was up 15% and accelerated to 13% at constant currency. Revenue performance this quarter was led by security and cloud. Security was up about 80% this quarter, driven by strong demand for the pervasive encryption of IBM Z and growth in our integrated software and services business. Cloud revenue was up 20% or 18% at constant currency, driven by our as-a-Service offerings. We\u2019re exiting the second quarter within as-a-Service annual run rate of over $11 billion, which is up about 25%. This reflects our success in helping enterprise clients with their journey to the cloud and we\u2019re becoming the destination for mission-critical workloads in hybrid environments. We\u2019re capturing this high-value growth with our unique differentiation of the innovative technology combined with deep industry expertise underpinned with trust and security, all through our integrated model.","You saw that this quarter in a long-term partnership with the Australian government, valued at about $740 million to automate and digitize government services, leveraging IBM systems, software, and cloud-based solutions. We expanded our work at Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel, who is using the IBM Cloud, security, IBM Z and Watson to drive its next wave of transformation across its business lines. We delivered the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputer to the U.S. Department of Energy. We had competitive cloud wins at leading companies like ExxonMobil, Amtrak and Telef\u00f3nica de Espa\u00f1a.","We signed a deal with Anthem where we will help them drive their digital transformation to deliver an enhanced digital experience for millions of health plan consumers. And in total, we signed 13 services deals over a $100 million this quarter. These are just a few of the new client engagements that will play out over the coming quarters and years. And putting this together with our first half performance, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for the year.","Before getting into the detailed financial metrics, I want to provide a perspective on the drivers of our operating earnings per share growth for the quarter. What it shows as we deliver 5% growth, despite a significant tax headwind? So, let me break it down.","Our 4% revenue growth contributed $0.10 of earnings per share growth at constant margin. We realized good pretax operating leverage on that revenue growth with 11% growth in pretax income and we expanded our pretax margin by 110 basis points. About two thirds of that pretax income growth came from gross profit dollars, which were up 2%, driven by profit growth in Global Business Services and Systems. Gross margin was down 60 basis points year-to-year, about half was due to mix and half from the continued investments we\u2019ve been making to build out our IBM Cloud. Productivity was fairly neutral to the year-to-year gross margin dynamics in the quarter. And as we discussed last quarter, the benefit from actions we took earlier in the year will ramp up in the second half. The remaining third of the pretax income growth came from efficiencies we\u2019ve been driving in our expense structure. And then, as I said, tax was a significant headwind, driven primarily by discrete tax benefit last year. Finally, a lower share count contributed to growth. Putting it all together, we delivered the 5% growth with good contribution from revenue, pretax margin expansion and to a lesser extent, share repurchases.","Looking at our key financial metrics. As I said, revenue was up 4%. Currency contributed 2 points, which is about half the contribution, based on the spot rates at the time of our first quarter earnings call. And I\u2019ll remind you, the significant volatility in currencies has implications across the income statement, not just revenue. Constant currency revenue was up 2%, which is essentially all organic. I\u2019ll talk to revenue on a constant currency basis going forward. Our revenue growth was broad-based across geographies and sectors. We had growth in more than 60 countries, representing over 80% of IBM\u2019s revenue. EMEA growth accelerated to 4%, led by Germany, the UK, France and Spain with pervasive growth across business areas.","Looking at our operating pretax income growth of 11%, I said that about one-third of that was from operating expense, which was better by 2%. This includes a 2-point impact from currency, which is significantly less than the first quarter impact due to the dollar strengthening. And so, our base expense was better by 4%. As we continue to invest to build our innovation pipeline in areas like AI and security and blockchain, we\u2019re also realizing acquisition synergies and driving operational efficiencies by streamlining our management system, scaling agile and implementing new ways of working. I talked about some of these in our webcast back in March. And we\u2019re seeing the benefit not only in improved speed and responsiveness, but also in a more efficient structure. Within expense, we also absorbed a lower level of IT income, which was down $115 million year-to-year in the quarter, and about $240 million in the first half. Our operating tax rate of 16% was up nearly 7 points with just over a point from the underlying rate and the balance from last year\u2019s discrete tax benefits of a $170 million.","Looking at the cash metrics. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.2 billion in the first half, which is down $400 million year-to-year. Our solid working capital performance was more than offset by a cash tax headwind and growth in capital investments, consistent with what we discussed earlier in the year. Remember, there\u2019s a lot of seasonality in our cash generation. And over the last 12 months, we generated $12.6 billion, that\u2019s 111% of GAAP net income.","Now, turning to our segments. Cognitive Solutions had $4.6 billion of revenue, which was down 1% at constant currency. We had continued growth in our as-a-Service revenue, exiting the quarter within annualized run rate of $2 billion. Within Solutions Software, we\u2019re scaling new platforms and solutions with growth in several key areas, I\u2019ll name a few. Growth in our underlying analytics platform was led by DB2 portfolio, our data science offerings and our new IBM Cloud Private for data offering, which makes data ready for AI across the clouds. In our Watson platform, the AI platform for business, growth reflects strong demand for our new virtual assistant offering with triple digit growth in our conversation service usage. Clients using Watson Assistant include Bradesco, Orange Bank, Autodesk, Royal Bank of Scotland, Vodafone and LivePerson, to name a few.","Watson is both a platform on its own and a driver of growth in differentiation in several of our industry verticals. Our industry verticals continue to scale, led by IoT and Watson for Financial Services. IoT growth was driven by Maximo, which is the number one asset management solution, and Tririga, the number one facilities management solutions.","Financial services reflect strong performance in our risk and regulatory business and financial crimes portfolio, leveraging our promontory skills and AI technologies. In Watson Health, we had good performance in areas like payer and life sciences. And in emerging areas like blockchain, we\u2019ve now seeded the market with over 60 active blockchain networks. This quarter, we launched We.trade with nine large banks including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC and Natixis. This is the first live blockchain-based bank-to-bank trading platform.","Growth in these areas is offset by a transition in some areas I talked about in April, specifically, talent, collaboration and commerce, which today are a combination of on-perm and SaaS offerings. We are modernizing our offerings and making investments to address the secular shifts in the market. Keep in mind, the time-to-value of these investments is longer in SaaS.","Our Transaction Processing Software was down 2%, driven by declines in storage software. Within TPS, we had growth in IBM Z middleware and Power middleware.","Looking at profit this quarter, we grew pretax income 9% and expanded pretax margin by over 2 points year-to-year, driven by operational efficiencies and acquisition synergies, while continuing to invest at high levels in key strategic areas such as AI, security and blockchain.","Before getting into Global Business Services, let me give you a perspective on our total services business across the two segments. We continue to make good progress. Our services signings grew, the year-to-year your services backlog trajectory improved from last quarter. Services revenue returned to growth, and we had a modest improvement in the year-to-year your services gross margin trajectory. Our signings were up 6% and within that we had 13 deals over a $100 million. So, we\u2019re clearly winning in a competitive environment. We\u2019re addressing the fundamental shifts in the industry, like helping clients implement hybrid cloud and manage security services. This is driving a shift in our backlog content with nearly 30% of our outsourcing backlog now in cloud. And then looking at the services gross margin, it was down just 25 basis points year-to-year. I\u2019ll remind you again that we have most of the benefits from the first quarter productivity actions still ahead of us.","So, now, let\u2019s get into the two segments. Global Business Services returned to modest revenue growth, increased gross profit dollars and expanded gross margins. We\u2019re realizing the improved revenue trajectory from the run-out of our opening backlog for the year. Our strategic imperatives grew 6% with strong performance in the as-a-Service offerings, which were up 25%. We have talked about how we\u2019ve realigned our practice model around three growth platforms, digital transformation, cloud application and cognitive processes. While all are progressing, we have particularly strength in digital, which again grew strong double digits. This was driven by digital business strategy and by our mobile offerings.","Across these platforms, consulting revenue growth accelerated to 4% year-to-year, led by our offerings in digital and cloud. Our GBS consulting practice brings business expertise together with technology expertise to unlock value for our clients. For example, this quarter, IBM Digital and Mediaocean launched a blockchain consortium comprised of leading advertisers and publishers, including Kellogg, Unilever, Kimberly-Clark and Pfizer, to set the new industry standard for the digital ad-buying ecosystem. We\u2019re continuing to invest recently announcing the acquisition of Oniqua Holdings, which adds technology and professional expertise and asset optimization. This strengthens our integrated IoT platform across Cognitive Solutions and GBS.","Application management services revenue was down 3%, reflecting continued declines in traditional enterprise application managed services. We\u2019re growing in strategic offerings like Cloud Migration Factory and Cloud Application Development. The increased demand in these areas has led to two consecutive quarters of double-digit signings growth in application management.","Turning to gross profit. GBS\u2019 gross margin grew 130 basis points year-to-year. We have done a lot of work to transform our portfolio and reposition our offerings to capture improved price for value, and we are also starting to see early contributions from our productivity actions around labor models and structure.","In summary, GBS delivered a solid quarter, and we\u2019re starting to see the realization of our initiatives in our results.","In Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, revenue returned to growth. Similar to GBS, this performance was driven primarily by our improved opening backlog run-out dynamics. The strategic imperatives revenue in this segment grew 24%. This was led by cloud, which grew 27% and our as-a-Service revenue grew 30%, which is up about 6 points sequentially and is now at an annualized run rate of $7.6 billion.","Infrastructure services revenue growth improved to 1% this quarter, as we continue to help clients on their journey to cloud. The IBM Cloud enables clients to migrate, modernize and build new cloud apps, is AI ready and secure to the core. This quarter we completed the migration of Westpac\u2019s core banking applications to the IBM Cloud. It\u2019s just one example of how we\u2019re becoming the go to destination for mission-critical workloads on the cloud. We\u2019re continuing to build capabilities, recently announcing an expansion to 18 availability zones for the IBM Cloud across the world. To expand the global footprint, it is important as clients look to maintain control of their data, as they implement hybrid, especially given the increased data regulations.","In technical support services, revenue was down 4%. As is always the case with the Z launch, we\u2019re seeing a short-term impact in our maintenance stream, as IBM Z sales move client from maintenance to warranty for the first year. The impact to maintenance is becoming more pronounced now with the higher adoption rates by existing clients in the strong current Z cycle. This impact was moderated by continued growth in our multivendor support offerings.","Integration software grew 1%. We had good performance in offerings that modernize applications and enable cloud adoption. This includes offerings like IBM Cloud Private, which helps clients to develop cloud native applications behind their firewall. We\u2019ve added a 100 new clients in the second quarter and now have over 300 clients since the product was announced at the end of last year.","Turning to gross profit. Margin for the segment was down a point from last year. The majority of this decline was driven by the revenue mix away from higher margin TSS in the quarter, with the remainder driven by continued scale out of our cloud. We did have some productivity benefits, but as I said earlier, the actions we took in the first quarter will yield predominantly in the back half of the year.","In Systems, we grew revenue again, as we continue to deliver innovative technologies that address today\u2019s most contemporary workloads. All three brands IBM Z, Power and Storage grew and we gained share overall.","In this second quarter, IBM Z grew revenues by 112% year-to-year on nearly 200% MIPS growth, again driven by new workload MIPS. The z14 adoption remain broad-based and after four quarters continues to track ahead of the prior program. The value prop benefits existing IBM Z clients who are growing and expanding workloads on z14 this quarter, whether it\u2019s ecommerce sales, mobile banking volumes, machine learning or emerging blockchain services. And we are adding new clients from all corners of the globe from a managed care provider in the U.S., to a University in Canada, to an electronics distributor in Italy, to a bank in Africa. We also had good acceptance of our new single-frame z14 designed specifically for cloud environments, which launched earlier in the quarter.","Power revenue was up 4% driven by adoption of our new POWER9 entry level portfolio, and continued growth in Linux. These cloud-ready systems provide leadership capabilities in advanced analytics, cloud environments, and data intensive workloads in AI, HANA and UNIX markets. We continued to roll out our supercomputers at the U.S. Department of Energy labs. As part of our deployment, the U.S. government recently unveiled the POWER9-based Summit, the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputer which is ranked number one in the TOP500 List of commercially available computers. This is the first time in over five years that a U.S. company topped the list.","Storage hardware returned to growth this quarter, after facing some sales execution challenges in a competitive market last quarter. This growth was broad-based geographically and led by strong growth in all flash arrays. Flash grew double digits across the portfolio and took share. We are coming out with new offerings, including a new midrange FlashSystem announced last week, with industry-leading performance technology.","Turning to profit. Systems pretax income was up about $275 million year-to-year and pretax margin was up over 10 points, so solid performance.","Moving on to cash flow and balance sheet. In the second quarter, we generated $2.9 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables, and $1.9 billion of free cash flow. And so, in the first half, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow, which is down $400 million from last year. This reflects solid working capital performance, offset by a $300 million increase in CapEx, as we build out global cloud data centers, and $700 million more of cash tax payments. We\u2019ve now got the entire cash tax headwind that we expect for the year, behind us.","Looking at uses of cash for the half. We\u2019ve returned $4.6 billion to our shareholders. In April, we again raised our dividend. And with that, we\u2019ve now tripled our dividend per share over the last decade. In the first half, we bought back nearly 12 million shares, ending June with 913 million shares outstanding and $2 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Looking at the balance sheet highlights, our cash and total debt levels are pretty consistent with last June. About two thirds of our debt supports our financing business, which is leveraged at 9 to 1. And the majority of our financing receivables, 54% are at investment grade which is 2 points better than this time last year. So, our balance sheet remains strong with plenty of flexibility to support our investments and shareholder returns over the longer term.","In summary, our performance this quarter underscores the extent to which we have repositioned our business over the last several years. As I said, nearly half of our revenue is aligned to the strategic imperatives, which represent the emerging, high-value, high-growth segments in our industry. This also reflects a major portfolio shift for IBM, driven as we discussed at our investor webcast in March, by major shifts in our capital allocation and investment strategy. Those shifts reflect our vision of what clients would value in a rapidly reordering IT industry, driven by cloud, data and AI, and that is innovative technology in key emerging areas, the expertise to apply that technology in industry-specific processes and workflows, and a commitment that their enterprise data would be handled responsibly. This is IBM\u2019s differentiation, and we\u2019re seeing it come through in our revenue and profit performance.","This quarter, we delivered 2% constant currency revenue growth, 11% operating pretax income growth, and 5% earnings per share growth, capping off a first half where we also grew revenue, operating profit and earnings per share.","As always, we have some tailwinds and headwinds as we move into the second half. But with this performance and our continued focus on driving consistent operational execution, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share, and free cash flow in the range of $12 billion.","And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia for Q&A.","Patricia Murphy","Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, as always, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So, operator, let\u2019s please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thank you. Jim, you saw some constant currency deceleration in Cognitive revenues but PTI margins improved nicely. You alluded to a few factors in there. I was wondering if you could provide some more granularity on the drivers of that PTI margin expansion between the operational efficiencies, the acquisition synergies that you alluded to and the relative pace of investment. And secondarily, your base expense decline was quite significant in the quarter. Can you talk about the trajectory of that in the second half, especially given some of the cost actions that you said are yet to be reflected, the cost actions that you took in 1Q, they are yet to be reflected in the back half?","Jim Kavanaugh","Sure, Wamsi. Thank you very much for the question. Let me address the Cognitive Solutions segment first and talk about constant currency and then get to the operating leverage component. And then, I\u2019ll address your expense question next. Cognitive Solutions, first of all, as you all know, our financial model for the Cognitive Solutions segment is to deliver growth and also deliver operating leverage consistent with that growth. And what we\u2019ve been seeing over the last couple of quarters, as we\u2019ve been driving the acquisition integration synergies across our business, we\u2019ve been seeing that operating leverage well in advance of our actual revenue growth within that segment. We\u2019ve also been driving operational efficiencies and synergies around redefining how we do work, redefining development optimization, applying agile methodologies in getting better speed, responsiveness, cycle time and throughput and output within our organizations. So, we\u2019re getting more value for dollar spend overall. And you see that play out in operating leverage in that segment in the first quarter and you\u2019ve seen it play out in the second quarter with strong profit growth of 9% on that constant currency revenue growth. So, we continue to expect that as we move forward and will continue to leverage and get value out of that business overall.","In terms of expense dynamics, you heard in the prepared remarks, our operating expense was better by 2%, but there are many different components within that operating expense 2% better. First and foremost, currency had impacted our operating expense by 2 points. Now, I will tell you that was about half of the impact or even a little bit less than half the impact than we expected 90 days ago, just given the volatility of what\u2019s been happening in the FX markets, in particular around the U.S. dollar appreciation. So, the last couple quarters, currencies impacted by expense by 4 to 5 points, now, it was only a 2-point impact. So, our base productivity was about 4% better. And that is being driven as we continue to drive the operating leverage through our enterprise productivity initiatives around reinventing IBM and how we actually do work, changing our management system, addressing our structure, attacking cost and complexity, aligning decision rights and driving accountability. So, that 4% is a base level productivity that we\u2019re driving and we expect that going forward.","And then, I\u2019ll just add one other point and that is on IP income. You see, through the second quarter, our IP income was down by over $100 million -- $115 million I think to be exact; and through the first half, it\u2019s down nearly $250 million overall. So, we continue to leverage and monetize the value of our research and development spending and we continue to invest in those areas, and we\u2019ll opportunistically optimize that through many modernizations models, but IP right now is down a 115. When you bring all that together, it\u2019s delivering substantial operating leverage to our business, as you\u2019re seeing here in the second quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is now open.","Steve Milunovich","A fair amount of your growth in revenue and even pretax profit came from the hardware area. What are you expecting in terms of second half mainframe compares? Are we going to be down year-over-year in the third and then down pretty severely in the fourth? And then, just to follow up on your currency comments. I assume you\u2019re losing about $2 billion of revenue in the second half relative to what you expected back in April. Have you taken actions to compensate for that to get to your $13.80, to get to your $12 billion of free cash flow?","Jim Kavanaugh","Yes. So, thank you, Steve. Many questions there. So, let me take each one individually. First of all, yes, we had a very strong Systems quarter overall, both on revenue and on operating leverage where we grew pretax income over 10 points year-over-year. But, let\u2019s put the quarter in perspective.","We delivered 4% revenue overall, 2% at constant currency. It was our strongest constant currency revenue growth rate in over seven years. And it was led by our continued acceleration in our strategic imperatives which were up 15% at actual, 13% at constant currency. That was an acceleration from the first quarter. And within that our cloud business $18.5 billion, up 23%; our as-a-Service annualized run rate now over $11 billion, that\u2019s up 24%; and our services businesses returned back to growth at constant currency, both GBS, which had a great quarter and TS&CP.","But even if you take our Systems business and to your question around mainframe, and if we take mainframe out, you would see those same dynamics in the quarter-to-quarter acceleration of our strategic imperative business. And as you all know, in our as-a-Service acceleration of over $11 billion growing 24%, that doesn\u2019t have any Systems business within it.","And the last point I\u2019ll bring up around top-line, then I\u2019ll get to your other questions. We had broad-based geographic and sector growth across our business, probably the best breadth and growth across a number of countries that we\u2019ve had in quite a period of time. 60 plus countries grew at constant currency, and that represented over 80% of IBM\u2019s revenue. And if you extract out the mainframe cycle, we still had over 60% of our -- or excuse me, 60 countries that actually grew. And those are large countries like Japan, like UK, like Germany, France, Spain, Australia, many which are not mainframe dominant. So, we see continued momentum.","Now, with regards to mainframe, I\u2019m not going to apologize. This is the most enduring platform that you\u2019ve seen out there, and we continue to capitalize on gaining new emerging workloads onto that platform. And we delivered substantial growth in the second quarter, over a 100% growth, and we tripled our installed MIPS inventory that we shipped. And we\u2019re [captioning] [ph], over 60% of that MIPS ship is in specialty workloads. So through the first four quarters -- now, it\u2019s a pertinent time to have the discussion, through the first four quarters, we are well in advance of what the prior cycle was.","And with regards to your question about second half, I would expect that to continue in the second half as we move forward. We know in the fourth quarter that we got a tremendous compare, and I talked about that 90 days ago. So, we will have an impact, but we\u2019ve got momentum in our services businesses returning to growth. And as you know that\u2019s 60% of our business overall.","Now, with regards to currency. I\u2019m glad that you brought that up. We\u2019ve seen dramatic volatility over the last 90 days since our last earnings call. And to put it in perspective, we had stated here 90 days ago that we expected about a 4-point tailwind in the second quarter coming off of a 5-point tailwind in the first quarter. And you see that that only ended up being a little bit over 2 points of a tailwind in the second quarter as the U.S. dollar appreciated significantly against most currencies.","Now, when we look at the second half, the second half, we see about a 1 to 2-point headwind, currency will flip, and that\u2019s about somewhere in the neighborhood of the $1.5 billion including second quarter\u2019s $400 million that I talked about. Now, with that said, currency -- you understand the top-line dynamic of revenue, but currency also impacts margins and they impact expense. From a margin perspective, if you look at -- we\u2019ve got two different businesses, we\u2019ve got a product-based business and we\u2019ve got services-based businesses. On product-based businesses, you don\u2019t have a direct alignment of your sources of revenue and your sources of cost. So, that translation revenue impact that you see in our product-based businesses, a hardware, software and services, you will see a gross margin impact on that at the GP line. Services, where you have a much more alignment of source of revenue, of course you have basically a natural hedge, you won\u2019t see a gross profit impact on that revenue translation. But as you all know, we drive a hedging programs to mitigate the foreign exchange volatility at a profit level. Why? Because it gives us time to address our pricing terms, our structure and our sourcing strategies. So, at a PTI level, you see a very de minimis impact in period. Currency doesn\u2019t eliminate -- excuse me, hedging doesn\u2019t eliminate, it only defers it, but at a profit level, it\u2019s a very de minimis impact but it impacts the P&L differently as we move forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Katy Huberty","Jim, as was mentioned in earlier question, investors are certainly worried about the tougher comps in the back half of this year, and the 2% growth was a nice surprise this quarter, but you\u2019re quite at consistent and meaningful growth across the businesses. And so, my question is whether you and the rest of the management team would consider stepping up, either M&A or divestitures to more meaningfully remix revenue and set the Company on a path in a narrative around much more meaningful and sustainable growth?","Jim Kavanaugh","Yes. As you stated, we delivered a very solid quarter at 2% constant currency. And I would say, it\u2019s our third straight quarter of growth overall with an acceleration in terms of breadth and depth across geographies, across sectors and across countries around the world.","But, let\u2019s take a look at our portfolio. First and foremost, we are very confident in the portfolio lineup that we have here today around each of our segments. We talked about at our investor day the value differentiation of IBM. And that value differentiation is built around innovative technology, around deep industry expertise, and around trust and security, all delivered through an integrated model.","And if you take a look at it, we talked about the key value differentiators as we move forward. And the value of bringing that together, I think you\u2019re seeing instantiated now here in the second quarter with very strong growth overall in our systems platform, and the importance they play to our infrastructure, in our integrated model, you see our services base of businesses continue that trajectory improvement that we talked about starting in January of this year, we improved in the first quarter, and now we got both businesses back to growth, and we delivered double-digit signings at actual rates in the first half, which positions us well as we move forward. But, you know our model overall, we\u2019ve done a lot of work around remixing our capital and investment to build out the portfolio that we have today. And we\u2019re very disciplined in our capital allocation strategy. We said 70% to 80% of that capital and investment is going to go back to our shareholders in the form of share buyback and dividend and you saw us raise our dividend here in April this year, our 23rd straight year. But, the remainder is for us to use internally to build out our differentiated capability around investments in R&D and capital to drive leadership in AI, leadership in blockchain, leadership in security and leadership now in quantum as we move forward. But acquisitions are an integral part, and we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate our portfolio and how we capitalize the value of those acquisitions, in light of the integrated differentiated strategy of the IBM Company going forward.","Operator","The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Toni Sacconaghi","I\u2019m wondering if you could comment a little bit more about the dynamics affecting Cognitive Solutions revenue growth. It was down at constant currency versus a pretty easy comparison. And it\u2019s the business that has the highest percentage of strategic initiatives in it. So, it\u2019s obviously very important for you. Can you maybe comment specifically on what\u2019s happening with Watson Health? There were lots of press reports that a significant retrenchment in that business. And I know you said the acquisitions take time. But, you\u2019ve had them all for at least a year. And so, maybe even comment on why you think we haven\u2019t seen better revenue progress or what specifically happened this quarter. And then, very quickly, if you could just confirm, you talked about flattish gross margins for the year. You\u2019re down in each of the first two quarters year-over-year. So, should we be expecting gross margins to be up about 50 basis points year-over-year in the second half to sort of hit that bogey flattish?","Jim Kavanaugh","There is a lot you compacted in a multiple parts question, but let me try to address each piece. So, let\u2019s start with Cognitive. In terms of our Cognitive Solutions, we have a strong portfolio in the key strategic areas around analytics, around industry verticals, around security and around IoT, and we continue to see good performance overall. But, I\u2019ll remind you, this portfolio is a high-annuity content. Over 80% of the business is annuity with strong renewal rates we continue to drive, but that SaaS has a longer time to value and longer time to realization. But, let me unpack the segment because you got to understand the piece parts because they each fit different purposes within the overarching IBM strategy and purpose.","One is around TPS. TPS declined 2% overall, and it\u2019s about what we would expect in this area and you\u2019ve even commented on this in the last couple quarters. We been riding the wave of the mainframe product cycle over the last three quarters and saw a pretty good growth that was unusual. Now we\u2019re back to down 2%. This is high-value, high-profit, strategically important to our clients overall, but it\u2019s in stable to declining businesses, and it wasn\u2019t unexpected.","And when you look at our software solution portfolio, we\u2019ve got growth in analytics as we revamped that portfolio coming off of a pretty disappointing fourth quarter. We grew in first quarter, we grew again in second, and we got good double-digit growth in our industry verticals like financial services and IoT, and we\u2019re seeing good growth in Watson Health. We got growth in life sciences segment, imaging, payer and we\u2019re seeing good SaaS signings in our government segments within that business. Yes, we are driving acquisition synergies, and you\u2019re seeing that play out; it\u2019s well in advance of a year, and you\u2019re seeing that operating leverage play out well in advance of our financial model around Cognitive Solutions.","So transaction processing software, pretty much as expected high-value base market, software solutions, the key strategic areas that we have are growing. The focus that we\u2019ve got and we\u2019ve talked about this 90 days ago, three key segments around talent, around collaboration and around commerce where we are investing to modernize our portfolio to address the secular shifts that are happening in both client value and in consumption models. As you know, this business today in these three segments are both the mixture of on-prem and SaaS. And we are investing aggressively to revitalize this portfolio into a SaaS world around driving user interface improvements to make our offerings more digitally consumable, and also about shifting and investing to embed AI to deliver differentiated value for our clients overall. So, that\u2019s Cognitive Solutions.","Now, you asked about gross profit margins. So, let me take a step back and give you my perspective. Now, that I\u2019ve been on the job six months as CFO of IBM, and I spent a lot of time with our investors and also with many of you, the sell side analysts, listening and also getting a perspective of our Company, the sentiment and the strategic positioning, and what you would like to see. And in each of those inevitably, the discussion around margin comes up. Why? Because yes, we are value-based stock. Our investment thesis is around value. Value driving profit growth at the end of the day that gives us the free cash flow flexibility to continue to return value to our shareholders and invest in our business. But, the discussion around gross profit margins always inevitably get at services. If service is deflationary and can you grow services margins? And I would tell you, I think that\u2019s at the heart of your question around gross profit. And I\u2019ll answer it in a couple of ways. One, talking about our financial model; and two, talking about how we manage the business.","But before I get into that, first and foremost, the net answer is, as I stated 90 days ago, we expect our services gross margins to expand in the second half and we still feel confident coming off of the trajectory improvement of what we saw in the second quarter really led by strong margin expansion in our GBS business and the productivity actions we have in front of us. But, when you look at this from an overall IBM perspective, our financial model, as we talked about is low-single digit revenue growth, mid-single digit profit growth and high-single digit EPS growth. And in 2Q, you saw the instantiation of delivering that model. We grew revenue, we had PTI margin expansion of 110 basis points, strongest we\u2019ve had in years, and we drove operating leverage to deliver 11% profit growth, well in excess of our model.","So from a full year perspective, our view at an operating level in terms of profit growth has not changed. We\u2019re going to grow profit, we\u2019re going to grow PTI margins, and that supports our full year guidance.","Now, let\u2019s talk about how we manage the business. Because I think it\u2019s important for our investors, and it\u2019s important for each of you as analysts to understand this. Number one, we got two distinct different business models in our company. We got a product-based business model and we got a services based business model. In a product-based business model, hardware, software, and solutions, value is instantiated in delivering returns at a PTI level. Why? Because all the investment we make in a product-based business ends up below the gross profit margin line. And you see in our product-based businesses systems and Cognitive Solutions, we\u2019re growing substantial operating leverage and we\u2019re growing substantial return on investment.","Now in services, as I said 90 days ago, in a human capital-based business values instantiated in gross profit margins. And we manage our services business to get a return on our human capital at the gross profit level. And as I said, at a gross profit level in services, we still expect to expand margins in the second half. The only thing that has changed in the last 90 days has been the extreme volatility in the FX world around the U.S. dollar appreciation. And as I stated earlier, we have a hedging policy that mitigates the volatility of currency in our I&E at profit level but it does impact gross margins in particular, at a product level in our product-based businesses; does not impact profit in the near term, it allows you time to then go adjust your pricing terms, your cost structure and your sourcing strategies as we move forward. So, that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s changed in the last 90 days. We feel confident we\u2019re going to grow revenue for the year at current spot rates, even in light of currency flip into a headwind in the second half, we feel confident we\u2019re going to expand pretax margins, similar to what we did in the second quarter, in the second half, and within that we feel confident we\u2019re actually going to deliver services gross profit margin expansion in the second half of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","So, consulting accelerated, which is encouraging. I am curious is that starting to pull in some other services revenue around it or behind it? I saw -- or you mentioned, the large [indiscernible] were good again. So, again is this enough to drive the positive FX neutral revenue growth in services in the second half, just trying to piece all those things together and think about future revenue growth for services overall, in the second half?","Jim Kavanaugh","Yes. If you take a look at GBS in second quarter, first of all, we\u2019re very pleased with our performance. The work that Mark and the team have done tirelessly to transform our structure, our business models, our growth platforms, the set of initiatives around productivity, we\u2019re very pleased, and you saw that play out in continued trajectory improvement throughout the first half and returning to modest revenue growth and significant operating leverage and margin expansion, which we expect will be a big contributor in our second half services margin expansion that we talked about in the last question.","Now, with that said, if you look at that acceleration and what\u2019s been happening in the trajectory of our services business, first, as you all understand the dynamics of that business, you have to get signings that have to yield into backlog, which has to yield into revenue as we move forward. And we\u2019re seeing tremendous momentum in our consulting base of business. We delivered 4% revenue growth, as you stated, in the second quarter. And that\u2019s leveraging momentum around how we redesign our growth platforms, and how we redesign our service lines and offerings and practices. And we\u2019re capturing higher value, value around digital transformation offerings that enable clients to move their journey to the cloud as we move forward, we\u2019re doing great in our CRM practice, our workday practice, and we\u2019re also capturing new emerging areas like blockchain, where we\u2019re seeing good growth in our services base of business at all.","And as you know and we talked about extensively at our investor webcast at the beginning of the year, GBS has a very integral part and an integrated model strategy of the IBM Company. They have the mission of bringing business and technology transformation together. So, the long answer to your question around, is consulting and GBS, a key leading indicator of dragging the rest of IBM, the answer is definitely yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jim Schneider","I was wondering if you could maybe kind of follow up on that prior question, talk about the ability of the Tech Services & Cloud Platform segment to start to return to growth in the back half. And clearly, we\u2019re starting to get a little bit better signings performance. But, I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s a realistic expectation for the back half for that segment and whether you can achieve it at the same time as you are expanding margins there?","Jim Kavanaugh","Sure, Jim, and good to talk to you again. Thanks for the question. Yes. On TS&CP, similar to our discussion around GBS, we\u2019re pleased with the trajectory improvement and the progress that we\u2019ve been making within this business on a top line throughout the first half. We made sequential progress quarter-to-quarter. We have now returned to growth delivering $8.6 billion of revenue. So, let\u2019s talk about a couple of the key components.","First, we are capitalizing on tremendous momentum around enterprise hybrid cloud strategy. We are becoming the destination of moving and enabling our clients\u2019 journey to the cloud. And our GTS business is an instrumental part of that strategy as we move forward. So, we got a lot of momentum in our enterprise hybrid cloud that as you see is delivering and as-a-Service annualized run rate of $7.6 billion, that\u2019s up 30% year-to-year, and that has tremendous value as we move forward to continue getting scale efficiencies and the like.","But, let\u2019s talk about then the core GTS business overall. Infrastructure services returned to growth 1% in the quarter. And it\u2019s really been built off of a very strong first half where we delivered double-digit signings growth at the GTS and TS&CP segment level. And now, you saw our backlog continues to improve. Our backlog now in total is $116 billion. And within that 30% of that backlog now is cloud as we continue to capitalize on the secular shift and deliver more and more value overall. Our integration software business has grown 1% and continues to grow through the first half. And what we\u2019ve got to work on, and this is part of having an integrated portfolio and part of having success in other areas, our TSS business is down 4% but that\u2019s a function of us significantly overachieving against our last program, our mainframe product cycle. And we see a deceleration in TSS, but we\u2019re seeing the offset in our systems base of business going forward. So, when you look at that trajectory improvement, we returned our backlog back to flat in the second quarter in TS&CP. And again, a lot of work ahead of us. We got a few second half signings, we got a good opportunity pipeline, but I see continued trajectory improvement. And then our focus on margins as we move forward in the second half to deliver second half services gross profit margin expansion are going to be critical to our guidance.","Operator","The next question comes from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Your line is now open.","David Grossman","This year, you are guiding to free cash flow roughly equal to net income, which is above your longer term target. I know it\u2019s way too early to providing 2019 insight. However, are there any factors that are driving the \u201818 free cash flow that may not reoccur next year or even potentially reverse that we should be factoring into our thinking for next year?","Jim Kavanaugh","Yes, David. Thank you very and good to hear from you again. Before I get to the long-term view, I mean, I think you kind of nailed it. Let\u2019s talk about our free cash flow guidance here through the second quarter and more importantly through the first half. First of all, we talked about entering the year that we expected $12 billion of free cash flow; that was down about $1 billion. If you remember, at that point in time, we talked about we were going to continue to invest in our business in terms of capital, to build out our IBM Cloud architecture. And by the way, in the second quarter, I think you have seen the announcement where we expanded 18 new availability zones around the world. So, we are committed to winning in the cloud space, and we\u2019re investing to go do that. But we also saw we\u2019re going to have a significant cash tax headwind here in 2018. And then, our GAAP profit, as we start turning this business and deliver on our at least $13.80 was going to pretty much offset our strong working capital efficiency that we exited last year on with our mainframe cycle.","So, through the first half, we delivered $3.2 billion of free cash flow. That\u2019s down $400 million. But it\u2019s important to understand the underpinnings behind that. Within that we\u2019ve invested $300 million year-to-year, up 20% on capital already through the first half. And we\u2019ve had strong operational pretax -- or excuse me, after-tax profit performance that\u2019s delivered a positive contribution of $600 million to support that investment in capital as we move forward. So, when you do the math then, our entire year-to-year reduction through the first half is all driven by cash tax headwind. And that cash tax headwind is $700 million through the first half, and it\u2019s all behind us now. So, our second half free cash flow, to your point, we\u2019ve always said as a rule of thumb, free cash flow should follow our profit levels. And when you look at our realization, you see a playing out in our realization. We\u2019re well in excess of 100%. And our trailing 12 months is at $12.6 billion and our attainment supports that $12 billion free cash flow level as we move forward.","So, it\u2019s too early to look at \u201819, we\u2019ll deliver that in January, but at least hopefully the answer gives you some of the dynamics of what\u2019s playing out within free cash flow.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open.","Keith Bachman","Hi. Thank you very much. Jim, I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the durability of services. You\u2019ve talked about GBS and technology and cloud outsourcing growing constant currency in the second half of the year. Yet, backlog, total services backlog is down 1% in constant currency. So, once you recheck growth, are you still calling for durable growth in those businesses, even with backlog down? And then, my follow-up -- well, let me ask my follow-up question after that.","Jim Kavanaugh","Why don\u2019t you ask your follow-up question?","Keith Bachman","Well, just within GBS, something I wanted to come back to, application management is still under pressure as it is for most of the providers. And is that going to continue within the context of GBS, or you actually see application management within the confines of GBS improving?","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay, Keith. So, thank you very much for just giving a better perspective of entirety of your multiple-part questions, so we can put this in perspective. So, let\u2019s talk about -- I\u2019ll drive you back to 180 days ago, when we were sitting here in January. We talked about the position where we were at. We talked about what\u2019s going on with the dynamics of our backlog overall. And we talked about the backlog realization run-out that we saw over the 2018 period. And we said entering 2018 that we had a much stronger backlog realization or run-out I should say that we are starting with that we did entering 2017. And you\u2019re seeing that play out as we go through the first half where we have made sequential year-to-year improvement over the first quarter and now returned both of our services businesses back to growth.","Now, within that, as we stated earlier, in the human capital base services business, you got to continue fueling those signings that delivers backlog and more importantly, you got to drive the right composition of backlog that drives your backlog realization and yield, and also drives duration. And obviously what you\u2019re seeing over time is you\u2019re seeing I think a secular shift with regards to what\u2019s happening to duration in long term contracts. You\u2019re not seeing that anymore. So we\u2019re getting higher yielding revenue, where also the composition of our backlog with consulting, which accelerated to 4%, that composition is much more shorter term and higher value, as we move forward. So, over the long run, you\u2019re right. You got to continue to fuel signings to fuel that backlog. But I would tell you, outer years of six, seven, eight, nine, ten are very -- in today\u2019s world, much less relevant than in period your first year, your second year, your third year in the composition. So, we do feel confident with that trajectory improvement, we came off in first half delivering good growth double digits in signings in the first half and the composition of those signings as I said, we already have 30% of our backlog that\u2019s sitting in cloud. And by the way, over 40% of our backlog is now in key strategic imperative workloads overall. So, that\u2019s kind of your first question.","Your second question, AMS. We talked about AMS. Obviously that\u2019s going through a secular shift in the industry, and you\u2019re seeing that play out against all the competitors that are in the space today. But I would tell you, what differentiates IBM with regards to AMS. One, it\u2019s our value of incumbency. The integrated play, the integrated model of IBM, the value of incumbency and the reason we\u2019re in the AMS business is we understand our clients\u2019 operating models, our clients\u2019 workloads and our clients\u2019 business processes. And we said entering this year that we were seeing success in us leveraging that value of incumbency to be the destination to help our clients with the journey to the cloud and move to the cloud. And we\u2019re seeing that play out in the first half where not only in the first quarter, but also in the second quarter, we had double-digit signings growth in AMS business over time. Again, backlog, yes, is still down overall. Our revenue was down 3%. But, we see this inflection point as we move forward, and we continue to leverage and deliver that value for our clients as they move on their journey overall.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Suva of Citibank. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Jim, I just had one question for you. As you sit there in the CFO seat and you\u2019re calling now for margins to accelerate or improve or expand year-over-year in the second half of the year, what are the milestones that are hitting to kind of make you call that out the happiness behind the confidence? What\u2019s the milestones that we can then look back and say, oh! That made a lot of sense and it has long-term durability to it? Thank you.","Jim Kavanaugh","Hey, Jim. Thank you very much for the question. It\u2019s good question overall. Let me take a look at it. I\u2019ve said from January, as we look at we obviously have multiple scenarios, how do we make at least $13.80. And what I look at and the team and the entire management team looks at is the trajectory of our business, the operational indices and the drivers as we see going forward of headwinds and tailwinds on how we deliver that guidance for our shareholders of at least $13.80.","But, when you take a look at revenue growth, I said we would have revenue growth at current spot rates for the full year and that we would have pretax operating margin expansion and operating leverage in our business. So, to your question, what do we look at and what are the trends that are driving that. So, let\u2019 unpack it, and I\u2019ve talked about this the last couple of calls. And the way I look at margin expansion really centers around three or four major areas. Number one, margin expansion is going to be delivered through us continuing to leverage the momentum in our enterprise cloud and our as-a-Service-based business. Why? Because it\u2019s going to generate scale efficiencies for us to deliver on what we\u2019ve said at our Investor Day, which is margin accretion as we move through to the cloud. So, scale efficiencies, we are seeing that improvement in the first quarter, we\u2019re seeing the improvement in the second quarter and it\u2019s all being built off of the momentum around our cloud and our as-a-Service-based business.","Second, we talk about mix, mix being another lever. So, you look at the mix of one within our each of our segments and how we\u2019re shifting to higher value, which we\u2019re making good progress. The best instantiation of that is GBS where they are getting better price realization and better value around remixing their offerings to better value but also across segments we have a big mix headwind as we talked about 90 days ago with regards to the mainframe cycle. So, we take that into account.","But, the third bucket is around productivity. This is around how you transform the way you work, it\u2019s predominantly led by our services base of business but it\u2019s also about how we reinvent and how we run our company around our infrastructure and enterprise productivity. Both are giving us operating leverage as we move forward. We\u2019re seeing the latter play out in our expense efficiency structure here in the second quarter and in our services base of business we talked about the work we\u2019re doing around our workforce optimization, the significant actions we took in the first quarter. I said, it\u2019s predominantly the yield on that is in the second half. And that should accelerate significantly, but we\u2019re also transforming the way we actually deliver service, redesigning it, applying agile methodologies, infusing AI and automation, and driving a differentiated value to our clients to improve the quality in addition to the efficiency and margin.","And then, finally, the last point which given services is 60% of our business, human capital-based business, you have to generate revenue to generate operating leverage. It\u2019s tough generating operating leverage when revenue is down. And we\u2019re seeing as that revenue trajectory improves and we\u2019re seeing as we play out here in the second quarter returning services back to growth that we\u2019re going to get the operating leverage as we move forward. And that\u2019s what makes us confident in delivering at least $13.80.","Operator","The last question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks. Glad, I made it on to the line there. I guess, maybe to start, Cognitive revenue, they\u2019re down in constant currency in the quarter, and as always, there is some amount of transactional business there. But, just help me understand, tampered the growth there? And then, do you think Cognitive can actually grow in the back half of the year because your compare start to get fairly difficult in that business I think in the back half of the year. And then, Jim, just on gross margins, what \u2018s leading you to start talking about \u201819, as it was aggregate total IBM gross margins will be flat to stable. And now, it sounds like it\u2019s only in services. So, what\u2019s the degradation in Cognitive or Systems that\u2019s changed that statement on gross margins from a corporate level to only services now?","Jim Kavanaugh","Okay. On each of them -- Amit, first of all, thanks for getting into the queue. It\u2019s good to hear from you, again. But on each of these, I think I answered them already. But, let me just give the synopsis. On Cognitive, we talked about the different dynamics within our portfolio around TPS, which had been growing, leveraging the mainframe cycle, now is more in line with what our expectations are? And in solutions software, we\u2019ve got strength in key strategic areas of our portfolio, analytics, industry verticals, both FSS, in health, in security and IoT. But, we\u2019ve got work to do on modernizing those key three segment areas of talent, collaboration and commerce, and that as those secular shifts move much more aggressively to SaaS, that time to value gets realized over a longer period of time. So, we do see strength in certain components. We\u2019re making investments in others to transform, as I talked about, modernize those offerings. And that will play out over time. But with that said, we\u2019ve done all the work and are driving the acquisition integration synergies, the operational efficiency savings. So, we feel confident, even at this level of revenue, we can drive operating leverage within that business.","And then finally, back to your question on margins. As I talked, first, I think value -- the way we manage this business, values instantiate in the services based business and gross profit margin. Values instantiate in the product based business in pretax income. Because you\u2019ve got to recoup the return on investment of your go-to-market and your development. And I will not say I\u2019m changing, I would say our operating view of the year of our financial model of revenue growth, of profit growth, of earnings per share is exactly the same. The only thing that\u2019s different within that is the FX change in the last 90 days with the significant U.S. dollar appreciation. Now, we hedge, we hedge that mitigates that profit variability, but when you look at currency around the element of the I&E, you see how it plays out differently. And that transparency and credibility is what I feel is important for you and investors to understand, but it has no impact on our bottom line profit contribution and our delivery of our free cash flow and our at least $13.80 for the year. So, thank you, Amit.","With that said, let me wrap up the call, where I started, by saying this was a good quarter and we\u2019re pleased. We had solid revenue growth and profit performance. This reflects the work we\u2019ve been doing to reposition our business in terms of our offerings, our people, the way we work and reinventing IBM. Now, as always, there\u2019s more work to do. And I look forward to continuing the dialogue over the course of the year. Thank you all for joining us on the call here this evening.","Patricia Murphy","Okay. Ann, I am going to turn it back to you to close up the call.","Operator","Thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time."]}}
