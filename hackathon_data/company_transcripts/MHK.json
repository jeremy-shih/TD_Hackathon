My name is Sia and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mohawk Industries Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, February 9, 2018. Thank you.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Frank Boykin. Mr. Boykin, you may begin your conference, sir.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Sia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries' Quarterly Investors Conference Call. Today we'll update you on the company\u2019s results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 and provide guidance for the first quarter of 2018.","I would like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank.","In 2017, our strong organization and long-term strategies allowed Mohawk to deliver record-breaking results. For the full year, our revenues rose to an all-time high of $9.5 billion, a 6% increase. We generated operating income of $1.4 billion, up 6% as reported and 9% excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges. Our EBITDA rose to $1.8 billion both records.","Our reoccurring business income grew at a much higher rate in 2017 when excluding the expired patent income and the incremental start-up investments. During the year, we identified opportunities for growing our business, differentiating our products, improving our productivity which we supported with over 900 million of internal investments, the highest in our company history.","Over the past three years, our strategies of adding new products, increasing our capacities and acquiring new businesses have led to an expanded earnings even as income from our Click patent expired. Our 2017 results reflected the impact of these strategies including 34 million of start-up costs to ramp up new products and production and significant increases in raw materials.","During the past year we completed four acquisitions to broaden our product offering and improve our cost structure. These include bolt-on Ceramic businesses in Italy and Poland and a U.S. top mine for ceramic materials and a nylon polymerization plant to further integrate our carpet manufacturing.","In 2018, we\u2019ll invest additional 750 million in our existing businesses to complete projects that were begun in 2017 and to commence new initiatives. Our largest investments during the two-year period are the expansion of our LVT in the U.S. and Europe, ceramic capacity increases in the U.S., Mexico, Italy, Poland, Bulgaria and Russia, laminate luxury laminate in the U.S., Europe and Russia, carpet tile in Europe, sheet vinyl in Russia and countertops in the U.S. and Europe, as well as carpet and rugs in the United States.","We are awaiting government approvals which take longer in Australia and New Zealand to finalize our acquisition of Godfrey Hirst, the largest flooring producer in those countries. We expect to enhance Godfrey Hirst\u2019s strategies as well as our existing U.S. carpet manufacturing as we learn from each other.","In addition, we anticipate synergies between Godfrey Hirst\u2019s expanding hard surface sales and existing Mohawk distribution in both countries. The U.S. economy strengthened during the Spring and Summer through increased consumer spending, business investments and job creation.","The fourth quarter growth moderated, U.S. GDP is forecast to increase in 2018 along with an improving global economy. According to the National Association of Home Builders, single family housing rose 8.5% in 2017 and the organization is predicting further single-family home growth in 2018.","Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing study predicts this year could deliver the strongest remodeling gains in more than a decade with the support of a strong economy, increasing housing values and low unemployment.","The American Institute of Architecture is projecting increased construction spending in non-residential buildings noting that national disasters in 2017 and corporate tax relief will support additional building expansion.","Outside the U.S., economic growth is projected for the European Union as confidence improves across all business sectors and employment increases across the Euro zone. Higher oil prices should benefit the Russian recovery and Mexico should see continued economic growth consistent with recent years.","Turning to our fourth quarter performance, we recorded our best results for the period with sales of $2.4 billion, up 8.5% over the prior-year and operating income of $343 million, growing 13% while absorbing start-up costs of $10 million. In the period, our ongoing business income grew at a much higher rate when excluding the decline in income from patents. ","Chris Wellborn, our Chief Operating Officer, will now provide a more detailed look at our fourth quarter performance by segment.","Chris Wellborn","Thank you, Jeff.","In the quarter, our Global Ceramic sales increased 10% as reported and 8% on a constant currency and days basis. Sales in Russia and Mexico grew the fastest and our European acquisitions added 6% to our sales.","As anticipated we saw improvement in our legacy sales during the period with additional capacity coming online in Mexico, Russia and Europe and strengthening sales in the U.S. The segment\u2019s operating margin for the period was 14% as reported, up approximately 20 basis points including the cost from upfront investments in countertops, service centers, integration of acquisitions and plant start-ups. We anticipate our ceramic sales growth to increase in 2018.","Our U.S. business improved as we progress through the period even with large customers postponing product changes and making reductions in their inventories. We are excited about our innovative new wood and stone ceramic collections with merchandising that conveys their unique features and benefits to consumers.","To increase our sales in distribution, we have opened 15 new tile and stone centers in the past 12 months. This year, single-family home construction should provide the greatest growth opportunity for our U.S. tile business. To capitalize on this, we are expanding our partnership with both national and regional builders across the country including both our tile and countertop products.","Our counter top sales are accelerating as we increase our distribution points and broaden our quartz offering. We have hired industry experts from around the globe to start our new state-of-the-art quartz countertop plant which should be operational by the end of the year.","In the U.S. market, we have also begun introducing porcelain slab countertops, which are being manufactured in our new Italian operations and replicate marble, granite, or other surfaces. Our ability to leverage existing relationships should enable us to achieve a leading position in the fast-growing quartz and porcelain countertop category.","During the period, our North American ceramic operations achieved record performances in productivity, quality and cost. Across all facilities, we are improving the recycling of our waste and the safety of our people.","The Mexican ceramic market is strong. We are increasing sales with our recently expanded production. Our new Salamanca plant is fully operational and production is ahead of our expectations.","We are introducing premium collections with European styling in large formats, which are not currently produced in Mexico. We\u2019re also expanding our sales throughout the South American market with our new capacity by providing unique styling and larger sizes.","Our European ceramic sales increased substantially and outperformed the market. We benefited from the addition of both our Italian and Polish acquisitions. We have made significant progress in integrating these businesses, broadening their product offerings and enhancing their sales strategies. We\u2019ve installed a new production line in Italy, and we are adding new capacity in Poland which will be running in the third quarter to expand our northern and Central European sales.","We are expanding Marazzi-branded showrooms and adding commercial specifiers to increase our business. During this quarter, we are starting porcelain slab production which creates large floor and wall tiles as well as furniture, kitchen and bath countertops. Our proprietary Reveal Imaging technology replicates stone, wood and textile visuals on the slabs.","We are optimizing our manufacturing by realigning production to our best-suited assets. We are producing larger sizes in the Bulgarian market to increase our sales and enhance our mix. This geographic expansion has strengthened our European ceramic business and will enable further growth across the region.","In 2017, the Russian ceramic market improved slightly from the recessionary trough and is still experiencing significant pricing and volume pressure. In this environment, our ceramic business is outperforming the market with sales and margins growing as we increase our market share.","Our high-styled offerings, consumer brands, franchised and owned retail stores and efficient operations give us a significant competitive advantage. We\u2019ve been operating at full capacity and are expanding our production to satisfy the growing demand and increase our market share.","In the fourth quarter, our Flooring North America segment margins increased approximately 130 basis points while absorbing $10 million of restructuring cost and sales rose 3%. During the period we also incurred start-up costs of $2.5 million associated with our new LVT line. Late in the fourth quarter, we implemented a carpet price increase to recover rising inflation.","We continue to improve the value proposition and mix of all of our products providing new features and benefits to the consumer. We have started presenting our new collections at our regional shows, and they are being enthusiastically received.","Our carpet sales were strong during the period as some customers raised their inventory levels prior to our price changes and residential sales continued to grow faster than commercial. Almost all channels in residential improved, highlighted by the success of our SmartStrand and Continuum product offerings.","To better serve our dealers, we have recently combined our hard and soft surface residential sales management. We are seeing improvements in performance as we better leverage our relationships across our entire product portfolio.","Our SmartStrand Silk Reserve collections are gaining momentum as luxury consumers choose our super-soft carpets with superior performance. As more homeowners select patterned carpets, the distinctive designs in our premium Karastan brand are driving sales growth.","Our revolutionary Airo product is unified soft floor covering that is gaining momentum in the marketplace. Airo is a hypoallergenic fabric that is constructed from 100% recycled materials. The product takes less than half of the typical installation time of a traditional carpet by using only a knife and double-faced tape and can easily be recycled at the end of its life.","With our new carpet tile and broadloom collections, our commercial sales are strengthening in most channels, with particular growth in hospitality, institutional, retail and Mainstreet. The enhanced segmentation of our commercial sales organization by channel allows us to better leverage our soft and hard surface portfolios to provide comprehensive project solutions.","Sales of our award-winning Lichen Collection are accelerating as customers embrace its leading design and unique sustainability story. We are introducing a new patented backing system in carpet tile to enhance our lower-priced collections.","We\u2019re expanding our rigid and flexible LVT offerings with specific products tailored for each of the residential, do-it-yourself, apartment and commercial markets. During the quarter, we increased our marketing investments in LVT to expand our sales in anticipation of a new manufacturing line which will be in production in the second quarter.","We are introducing RevWood Plus, a revolutionary new waterproof wood product with leading style in larger sizes and contemporary finishes. RevWood Plus creates another unique position for Mohawk in the marketplace.","During the quarter, our Flooring Rest of world segment continued to outperform posting an 18% increase in sales as reported and 9% on a constant currency basis as local economies improve and the Euro strengthened. The price increases we implemented over the dramatic changes in our material cost in most of our products.","Our reported operating income for the period increased 19% as a result of improved productivity, price, mix and a reduction of restructuring and acquisition charges. Agreements have been finalized with our patent licenses and our IP income has exceeded our original estimates due to our patents growing use in LVT.","Excluding the impact of our expired patents, our operating income for our ongoing business increased substantially with all product groups contributing. We\u2019ve agreed to acquire Godfrey Hirst, the largest flooring company in Australia and New Zealand, which is focused on carpet and expanding in hard surface Flooring as well as a small European mezzanine floor manufacturer which will enhance our wood panel strategy and differentiate our products.","In 2018, we\u2019ve also finalized the acquisition of two small distributors in Europe to enhance our geographic penetration. Our LVT sales are growing rapidly as we push the limits of our capacity. We have the broadest LVT offering in Europe and we are positioned as the market\u2019s style, design and performance leader.","Our new LVT line is presently operating two shifts as we refine our processes and improve productivity. Initially we will produce our existing products to satisfy present demand before we add new rigid collections to expand our offering.","Our new European carpet tile plant has initiated limited manufacturing with the final operational phases scheduled to come on line this quarter before a full market launch in the second period. We have hired experienced carpet tile salespeople to build our distribution.","As the world\u2019s leader in premium laminate, we offer the most recognized brands and best retail merchandising with the highest quality and fastest service in the industry. Our laminate sales are growing, driven by unique features such as planks over two meters long and our exclusive waterproof technology. Our laminate sales are increasing as an alternative to wood due to its more desirable styling, greater durability and easier care.","Leveraging our design and technical leadership we are expanding our sheet vinyl distribution in both the residential and commercial channels. Our new plant in Russia should start up in the fourth quarter of 2018. We are preparing for the launch by developing products tailored to the Russian market and assembling and experienced sales organization.","Our installation business has strengthened as our pricing aligned with inflation and as material shortages have declined. We anticipate lower material cost in the future as additional supply becomes available. During the period, our wood panel sales and margins improved with increasing demand and improved efficiencies. New panel introductions enhanced our sales and mix and process improvements have reduced our cost.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period and year.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Chris.","Net sales for the quarter were $2.369 billion, up 8.5% as reported. Our legacy business grew 4% on a constant exchange rate with all segment growth rates improving over the third quarter rates. Our gross margin as reported was 31.8%. Excluding charges, the margin was 32.3% improving over last year as price mix and productivity offset inflation and lower IP.","SG&A as reported was 17.3% of sales, or 17.1% excluding charges, which was an improvement of 40 basis points over last year. Unusual charges for the quarter were $15 million. They were primarily related to plant consolidation and acquisitions in Flooring North America and in Global Ceramic.","Our operating margin excluding charges was 15.1%. That\u2019s up 40 basis points over last year with positive price mix of $59 million and productivity of $44 million, offsetting $57 million of inflation, as well as incremental start-up cost of $5 million and lower IP income.","Interest expense was $7 million during the quarter. We estimate annual interest expense to range from $33 million to $37 million in 2018, excluding the Godfrey Hirst acquisition. In other income and loss, we have a loss in the quarter of $4 million compared to a gain of $2 million last year. The difference is primarily related to foreign exchange movements.","In income taxes, our tax rate excluding nonrecurring items was 27.2% for the quarter compared to 23.6% last year. The 2017 tax reform resulted in a fourth quarter non-cash benefit of $151 million for revaluation of deferred taxes offset by a charge of $152 million for unrepatriated foreign earnings. The tax will be paid over eight years beginning in 2019.","Our 2018 first quarter tax rate should range from 19.5% to 20.5% and for the year is expected to be about 21%. Our 2019 tax rate is anticipated to increase by about 2 percentage points. Earnings per share excluding charges was $3.42, an increase of 5% over last year even with lower IP and higher start-up cost this year.","If we move to the segments, in the Global Ceramics segment sales were $824 million, an increase of 10% as reported. Our legacy business is up 2% on a constant basis with all regions growing. Our growth rate improved this quarter over last quarter. Our operating margin excluding charges was 14% with productivity of $16 million and volume of $6 million covering inflation of $12 million.","In the Flooring North America segment sales were $999 million, a 3% increase. We had good growth in both LVT and in Carpet. Our operating margin excluding charges was 16.7%. It improved 160 basis points as positive price mix of $21 million and productivity of $22 million offset $20 million of inflation.","In the Flooring Rest of World segment sales were $546 million, up 18% as reported. Sales grew 9% on a constant exchange rate basis with all major categories improving. Both price, mix and volume drove higher sales.","Our operating margin excluding charges was 15.8%. Our higher operating income in the quarter was impacted by positive price mix of $35 million and productivity of $6 million along with better volume offsetting inflation of $24 million and lower IP.","As a reminder, we will continue to have a year-over-year headwind from the expired patent revenue until June of this year. In the Corporate and Eliminations segment, our operating loss excluding charges was $10 million. We expect the segment loss to range from $35 million to $45 million in 2018.","Jumping to the balance sheet, our receivables ended the quarter at $1.558 billion with days sales outstanding of 59 days. Our inventories were $1.949 billion with inventories at 119 days. Inventories have been impacted by higher raw material cost, ramp up of new products and backwards integration. We anticipate lowering our inventory next year.","Property, plant and equipment was $4.2 billion. In the fourth quarter, we had capital expenditures of $251 million with depreciation and amortization of $118 million. We are estimating capital expenditures for 2018 of almost $750 million with depreciation and amortization estimated at approximately $520 million. In long term debt, our total debt was $2.8 billion with leverage at 1.4 times debt to EBITDA.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank.","The record results that Mohawk delivered reflect the unique strategy that combine the best features of a large, well-run public company, a private acquisition firm and a venture capital group. Our organization\u2019s capability to continuously expand by innovating our products, increasing our portfolio and participating in new regions is unsurpassed in the market.","This year, to enhance our long-term growth and profitability, we will invest $60 million to $70 million starting up new operations to expand our market position and geographical scope. Of these investments, about one-third is in noncash depreciation due to limited utilization, one-third is for marketing to expand our distribution and one-third is for the cost of ramping up new production.","In the first quarter, we anticipate all segments improving sales and the introduction of innovative products across our portfolio. In Flooring North America, the timing of our carpet price increase moved some sales into the prior quarter.","Our ongoing operating results, excluding the expired patents and start-up investments, was substantially improved in the first quarter. Our earnings will benefit from our past acquisitions, a stronger euro, as well as our 2018 global tax rate, which will decline to approximately 21% due to tax reform.","Taking all of this into account, our EPS guidance for the first quarter is $2.93 to $3.02, excluding any onetime charges. The acquisition of Godfrey Hirst will be completed later this year after normal closing conditions are concluded.","We anticipate opportunities to enhance their product innovation and marketing strategies, lower their cost by supplying raw materials and increasing sales of other hard surface products. Godfrey Hirst should be accretive to EPS by $0.35 to $0.40 first year in the first 12 months.","We\u2019ll now be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith Hughes","You have made some comments on ceramic improving as the quarter went along. Can you just kind of give us your view on the ceramic pace of sales, what caused that, and how we started out 2018?","Chris Wellborn","Yes. Our overall ceramic segment growth was about 8% and we\u2019re adding capacity in four countries. The U.S. business improved during the quarter and the trends are continuing. With our new plant in Mexico running, we\u2019re returning to our historical posture to optimize. LVT did increase significantly and has absorbed a large part of the industry growth, but our new U.S. plant will allow us to expand our LVT offering and increase our business.","Keith Hughes","And do you have kind of a feel for what growth rates you think you\u2019ll see in ceramic in 2018?","Chris Wellborn","I think they\u2019re going to continue to improve. We saw them gradually improve through the fourth quarter and are continuing to improve, so I think you\u2019ll have gradual improvement through the year.","Chris Wellborn","We still have to be - the LVT growth, depending upon how much it grows this year, could impact the sales growth of everything again next year. It\u2019s hard to tell.","Keith Hughes","Final question. Frank had referred to inventory levels coming down in 2018. Is that something you\u2019re going to do here early in the year, take down production to get those down? Or will it come gradually as the year goes along?","Frank Boykin","It\u2019ll probably be gradual as we go through the year. Now, some of it\u2019s caused by the increase in raw material prices before the selling price have gotten through and continuing. Some of it\u2019s caused by further backward integration we\u2019ve done, and we are going to reduce the inventory some more.","Operator","The next question is from John Baugh with Stifel.","John Baugh","I was curious you commented that ceramic was strong, I believe, in Russia and Mexico, and I wonder if you could comment in those two markets specifically what the dynamic is between LVT incursion versus ceramic growth. Are the dynamics different in those markets for the U.S.? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The U.S. LVT is different than the Rest of the World. It depends on a couple of things. One is I would guess we\u2019re probably at least two years or more ahead of Europe\u2019s adaptation, they\u2019re using it but not at the same rates in Europe.","And then, when you move into other markets where ceramic is a much lower cost product to produce as well as to install, the cost difference between ceramic and LVT is dramatically different, so in those markets I\u2019m not sure what LVT will do.","On the basis of the markets, the Mexican markets growing about double-digits and we\u2019ve been growing but we\u2019ve been limited in how much we can grow without the new plant we just started up, so it\u2019ll help us grow. In addition, we\u2019re using the Mexican market as a base to start entering into the South American business.","When you go into Russia, I think they\u2019re down about 30% from the peak. They came off the trough this year. Prior to this year, they were declining. It came off the trough this year but barely and in that environment we\u2019re sold up so we\u2019re putting in new capacity and the question is going to be how fast it ramps up.","Is it like historical things in Russia where it ramps up dramatically or is it going to be slow because of the changes in the oil to the economy? We\u2019re just preparing for our business to do much better.","John Baugh","And then on repatriation, is there an opportunity or will you keep cash, whatever you have, in foreign areas because of acquisition opportunities? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","So we\u2019re really not changing our strategies. We were using most of our cash in the markets we were in and it\u2019s not going to change what we\u2019re doing much.","Operator","The next question is from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim","Appreciate all the detail, but as usual, we have some additional questions. I guess my first question is kind of a broader one. It relates to the likelihood that we would see a positive mix or a negative mix. I know that, Jeff, you\u2019ve talked about the fact that you\u2019ve been capacity constrained in a lot of areas of your business and I think you\u2019d indicated that in that situation, you tend to favor the higher margin-type opportunities that arise and then if the new capacity comes on, there\u2019s a concern that that\u2019s going to be margin derogatory","At the same time you\u2019ve talked about optimizing to larger tile formats in Mexico and Bulgaria. You talk about LVT rigid being a higher price point than the more flexible stuff. So when we stand back and look at all of your businesses, how do you think about mix? Will it be positive or negative excluding any, you know, price and input commodity distortions?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The goal of our business every year is to improve the innovation we bring to the marketplace and improve our mix and we have new innovations in every product category and every market that we\u2019re going into.","On the other hand, when you put in significant increases in capacity in something, you have to get the sales to move up as quickly as possible to cover the depreciation of the new assets so we also in some cases as we do that, actually sell more lower-end business.","I think this year you\u2019ll still see a positive mix, but with all the new capacity coming on, there will be more pieces but in most cases the new capacity is still limited to the almost $10 billion of sales we have.","Stephen Kim","So it sounds like maybe positive mix this year but maybe even more maybe next year. My second question related to productivity. I didn\u2019t hear a productivity number in terms of an outlook. I think last year you\u2019d given some outlook for how productivity might do for the whole year. Frank, maybe you could give us a sense for what you\u2019re comfortable with and maybe what we might see in 1Q?","Frank Boykin","Yes. Productivity in 2016 was $140 million and it will be, it was $180 million as you know in 2017. I\u2019ll just add in here that most public companies don\u2019t greenfield businesses as we\u2019re doing here, as many as we\u2019re doing due to the higher start-up cost, but we are going to see much longer, much better longer-term returns as a result of the greenfield-ing even with all these start-up costs.","And I would say with more investments in new products and the geographies that we\u2019re doing, much of the benefit that we\u2019re going to see from these investments are going to be in 2019 and beyond. In 2018, we\u2019ll have significant amount of productivity, but it will be more in line with what we saw in 2016.","Operator","The next question will come from Sam Eisner with Goldman Sachs.","Sam Eisner","So just on some of the new capacity that\u2019s coming online, it looks as though we\u2019re finally reaching the point where you\u2019re actually starting to put product out into the market. Without obviously giving us any kind of guidance for the full year, how should investors expect kind of either an earnings or a top line acceleration? Is that something that begins to occur for you guys starting in the back half of this year, or is that more 2019? Just kind of a better understanding of when\u2019s this stuff coming to market and how the business should ramp.","Frank Boykin","We have a long history of outperforming the market, and I\u2019ll remind you, over the last three years, the compounded growth rate for sales was 9% and our operating income compounded at 22%, even with the expiration of our patents.","This has come from these investments we\u2019ve done in our existing businesses, new acquisitions and greenfield-ing. We believe we can outperform the market going forward with our strong management and balance sheet, and we\u2019re going to try to grow it as fast as we can.","When you do a lot of these new things we\u2019re doing, the equipment doesn\u2019t show up when it\u2019s supposed to, it doesn\u2019t start up like it\u2019s supposed to, you train people, so it\u2019s going to be a little more volatile than normal. But that\u2019s what you get. But the long-term returns are going to be much better.","Sam Eisner","And then maybe just focusing on the start-up costs, there does seem to be a little bit of a shift going on here from the fourth quarter into the first quarter as well as 2018. Can you maybe just talk about rather than necessarily the numbers, what operationally is causing that start-up shift? Are things behind schedule? Can you maybe walk through some of the facilities and kind of the operational side here and what\u2019s causing that shift?","Frank Boykin","You see it as a shift, we just see it as a normal piece. I mean, things move a month or two either direction, so we ended up with about $34 million of start-up costs this year, and next year, we have it at about $60 million to $70 million. And in that, a lot of it\u2019s coming on as we speak now, so the investments will be heavier in the first quarter than through the rest of the period as you go through. We don\u2019t really see it any change.","Sam Eisner","If I can just sneak one more in here just on Godfrey Hirst, does the $0.35 to $0.40 include synergies within that first 12-month period, or is that just base business?","Frank Boykin","It includes everything.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Eisen with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Eisen","Just want to think a little more big picture longer-term. In the past, you\u2019ve talked about the capacity expansions you guys have done over the last few years supporting well over a billion dollars of incremental revenues, so I just wanted to get a better understanding of what you guys are seeing in the end markets that give you comfort in maintaining these elevated CapEx spending levels and kind of how we should think about the $750 million in 2018 playing out longer-term in benefits.","Jeff Lorberbaum","From a big picture, all signs that we see in our industry are positive almost in every marketplace. If you look more at the U.S. business, business and consumer spending appears to be strengthening. We see the tax law changes as supporting more growth. If you look at the existing and new home sales, everything is expecting them to continue to grow with higher home prices, encouraging more remodeling as you go through.","As you go through, you just pick different markets. In Mexico, we were constrained by the capacity. So that came up in the fourth quarter, and we\u2019ll get benefit out of it. We\u2019re putting new capacity in Europe in two or three different countries. We\u2019re putting new capacity in Russia because we\u2019re basically sold up in the marketplace that\u2019s just coming out of the bottom of a recession.","We\u2019re investing in new products to go into. We\u2019re going into carpet tile, which is a new marketplace. It\u2019s going to take longer to develop the business than the other ones because we don\u2019t have a core base there already selling that. A big opportunity.","We\u2019re doing the same in Russia with sheet vinyl going into new business. So we have a lot of things going on in every country trying to drive our business forward and do much better than the market.","Michael Eisen","And then just one quick follow up. When I\u2019m thinking of kind of the start-up costs and the associated SG&A spending to increase the marketing and the sales force, does the SG&A component of it follow some of the start-up costs where it\u2019s going to be very first quarter, first half weighted? Or how should we think about the cadence of headwinds from both line items flowing through the year?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I don\u2019t have it broken down by individual pieces but what happens is there will be more in the first quarter, a little less in the second quarter, and then the first half will be heavier than the second half, assuming that the stuff starts up like we anticipate. It could be longer or shorter.","Operator","The next question is from Timothy Wojs with Baird.","Timothy Wojs","I guess, just, maybe back on ceramic. Could you talk a little bit about the destocking in the fourth quarter and how do you expect the retailers to kind of spend and set their businesses in 2018?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Well, if you look at 2017 we were capacity constrained in the first part of the year. We added capacity which came up in the fourth quarter. At the same time, we had several product change-outs that happened last year and the retail is really starting at the end of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter taking those new products, that product transition.","Frank Boykin","So what happened in the first half we were operating under constrained conditions and we managed our business based on that and when the capacity comes up, it takes a little while to change strategies from optimizing limited capacity to selling more, and so we\u2019re in the process of that change as we speak.","Timothy Wojs","And then maybe just on price and cost. How do you think that should trend through 2018 just given where raw materials have kind of moved to today? Do you feel like you need to put in more price increases?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Your guess is as good as ours. All the price increases that we\u2019ve put in were based on the costs and our anticipation of where it is. We\u2019ve had oil and commodities seem to have gone up but then oil\u2019s dropped back down. I mean, if I could guess the oil prices I wouldn\u2019t be doing this job, because I can tell you that last year, we had huge inflation in almost every product and marketplace and we implemented pricing to cover it and whatever happens this year we\u2019ll react to it again.","Operator","The next question will come from Scott Rednor with Zelman.","Scott Rednor","I think there is a lot of question just on the timing of investments. So in 2016, the overall legacy sales grew 6%, and in 2017 they grew 4%, and I think consensus is looking for right around 5% in 2018. Given the visibility you have on some of these investments coming to market, are you comfortable with that estimate out there?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We think our sales growth in 2018 will be higher than 2017 and it all depends on how this stuff works through and what the markets are but we\u2019re going to try to get as high as we can.","Scott Rednor","And then, Frank, what\u2019s the total outflow for acquisitions that we should consider in 2018?","Frank Boykin","I think it\u2019s about 400 to 450.","Scott Rednor","And so, Jeff, just realizing the stocks lags you guys are going to generate more than enough cash even with the CapEx. Would you ever consider going back and buying back the stock if you don\u2019t feel like the current valuations reflecting the returns that you see in the next couple of years from the CapEx that you\u2019ve put in?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think we\u2019re going to continue reviewing the opportunities that we have to invest in our business. I can tell you those are always the best returns we can get. Our goal is to keep finding new acquisitions in the categories we\u2019re in.","If you look at the world, I mean, there is huge continents, we don\u2019t have anything yet. So I mean, a major part of the world we don\u2019t have anything. In areas where we\u2019re already in, examples in Europe we\u2019re the largest producer of ceramic but we still have a very small market share and we just started a few years ago so there\u2019s opportunities to look at acquisitions to consolidate it more in Russia where we are and moving into other ones. ","If we don\u2019t find those, as we go forward, we\u2019ve also started to move into countertops which gives us a new leg on the product and if you look long-term, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me that we pick up one more big opportunity somewhere along the line to keep it going.","Given all that, I sure wouldn\u2019t mind going into a slower period with capital, which I\u2019ve never been able to do and I think that I could find opportunities that I haven\u2019t been able to do in the last time because I was always out of money with my capital structure full, so I think we\u2019re well-positioned for whatever happens.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Wood with Nomura Instinet.","Mike Wood","Good job covering the inflation with price in fourth quarter. Some of the other building product companies have pointed to first quarter and first half 2018 headwinds. Is that impacting your profitability in your first quarter guide or can you talk about what\u2019s embedded in your forecast?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think for the most part, we\u2019ve covered most of the increase at this point based on where it was, back in the end of the fourth quarter. Now as the raw materials go up, we\u2019re going to have to review what they have and see if it makes any changes. I\u2019m not sure where they\u2019re going to level out. If you could tell me where oil prices will be next month, it would help me.","Mike Wood","Yes. I guess I was just more thinking about what\u2019s factored into your first quarter guidance, so we had an idea.","Frank Boykin","I think right now, we\u2019re planning on covering whatever inflation that we might have in the first quarter.","Jeff Lorberbaum","We have a difficult time too. We have this price mix that we follow. I mean, it\u2019s hard to tell the difference between price and mix as many products as we have and how much to just product sales change from period-to-period. It\u2019s hard to tell which is which at some point.","Mike Wood","And in terms of the LVT launch coming online here with the rigid, can you talk about kind of the lessons learned from the flexible LVT line launch and what sort of expected with how this ramp goes?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes. I think the biggest part is that the line we put in LVT in the United States was dramatically different than everything we had done and it took us a while to figure out how to optimize it.","The new line, we\u2019re taking all those learnings and expanding upon it but it\u2019s also making rigid LVT which the old one didn\u2019t. There are two lines that we\u2019re putting up that are almost identical. One in the United States and one in Europe. The one in Europe has already started up.","There\u2019s about two, I think we\u2019re running about two shifts now working through the start-ups in it and we\u2019re using it on existing products which our European business was oversold in, so we\u2019re moving that through.","We should start trying to make ridges pretty soon in it and hopefully we\u2019ll have most of the problems worked out before we start the new line in the U.S. which will be in the second quarter some time.","Operator","The next question will come from Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Phil Number","Good to see another strong year of productivity planned for 2018 but with inflation ticking up and another 3 million of start-up costs, do you anticipate you\u2019ll be able to drive margin expansion this year?","Frank Boykin","I think if you look at our business excluding IP and excluding incremental start-up costs that we\u2019re going to see good margin, good operating income growth.","Phil Number","And switching gears to your LVT business, you obviously have a lot of capacity that\u2019s coming online. Any color in how that\u2019s coming along in terms of the ramp, order patterns, and potential contribution to top line this year? Thanks.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The new lines, it depends on how fast we fill them up and how fast we can get the cost structures to where we want as well as how fast we can get them into the marketplace. I would guess there will be some improvement in the second half but the first half, the costs will be higher than the production or the margins will be just as a normal course of events and starting new stuff up.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut","Frank, I just wanted to go back to an earlier question around margins and you\u2019re good enough to give an expectation around productivity for 2018. I guess when you answered it in an earlier question that said we expect margins or profitability to be up. Will you exclude the IP and so forth? ","In 2017, you were able to achieve 40 bps consolidated improvement, and I believe you were expecting continued further margin improvement even with IP in 2018. Has that changed at all? And perhaps is it due to a timing issue with start-up costs? But how are you thinking about consolidated margins in 2018, given that you\u2019ve said a little bit less in productivity focusing on a lot of the start-up issues going on? Should we still expect consolidated expansion all-in?","Frank Boykin","I think as I said before, Mike, I mean, you made a good point. We\u2019re doing - we\u2019re investing a significant amount back into business. We\u2019ve got a lot of new projects that Jeff has already talked about with start-up costs. Timing is not always certain with these projects and when they\u2019re going to come up, but what we do know for sure is that excluding start-up and excluding IP we\u2019re going to see good growth on our operating income.","Michael Rehaut","Maybe asked another way. When you look at Flooring North America, you continue to do fantastic there in terms of year-over-year margin improvement with the fourth quarter, again, up strongly year-over-year and a lot of that driven by productivity. How do you think about the trajectory of the margin for that business? You kind of exceeded a little bit of a 14% margin in 2017.","At some point, everything else equal, you\u2019d expect the incremental margin improvement or the margin expansion to slow a little bit. Are we starting to get in that period where you\u2019re not necessarily going to do 100 bps to 150 bps a year of margin expansion?","Frank Boykin","I would say that Jeff sitting across the table here from me and looking at this picture up on the wall that says we\u2019re always half way there, so we were never going to be satisfied without improving over where we were before. But on the other hand, we\u2019re working through, like I\u2019ve already said a couple times, a lot of start-ups, a lot of projects in North America.","We\u2019ve got a big, big LVT plant coming up with new technology, and so we\u2019re just going to have to see where those things end up. But longer term, longer term, we\u2019re going to have a much better, much more profitable business.","Yes. This is what we\u2019ve been saying now for the last 18 months. We\u2019ve got six, seven, eight different projects around the world, either new geographies, or new products, or new technology, and we\u2019re investing significant amounts recognizing it\u2019s going to be an investment both in our P&L and in the balance sheet. But longer term, we\u2019re going to see good returns from all these things.","Michael Rehaut","One last quick one, just a clarification. The $60 million to $70 million of start-up expense, I just want to make sure I understand, that is the total number? In other words, the $65 million minus $34 million last year, that difference is the incremental. Just want to understand that that\u2019s correct, number one. And number two, the $60 million to $70 million, is that a higher or lower number than you expected three or six months ago?","Frank Boykin","So make sure I understand your question, so we spent $34 million in total start-up costs in 2017 and we\u2019re estimating $60 million to $70 million of total start-up costs in 2018. That\u2019s your first question, I think.","In terms of - the start-up costs are something that we\u2019re taking our best stab at. And estimating here, 12 months before the end of the year and with all these projects moving back and forth, we know that that number is not going to be right. Last year was a little bit less than what we thought. And to be honest, I don\u2019t remember where we were six months ago on start-up costs for 2018.","Operator","The next question will come from Mike Dahl with Barclays.","Mike Dahl","Frank, just a follow up. Not to beat this too much, but from a margin standpoint, when we\u2019re talking about operating margins, understanding that this increase in D&A is also a big headwind in 2018 versus 2017. So if we\u2019re looking at EBITDA margins from a consolidated basis, would you have more confidence or more of a commitment to increasing EBITDA margins in 2018?","Frank Boykin","I think I would address the EBITDA margins the same way I did the EBIT margins; that excluding start-up and excluding IP, we\u2019re going to have good growth.","Mike Dahl","On the IP, it sounds like you\u2019ve finalized some of the agreements that you were working through in the second half of last year. Is there something you can now frame for us just to - I know you don\u2019t want to necessarily give us this on an ongoing basis, but just help us understand what the new run rate looks like?","Chris Wellborn","What we can say is that patent revenue was higher due to the use of our technology in LVT around the world. Growth was better than we expected, and we are continuing to look for opportunities to expand it.","Operator","The next question will come from Laura Champine with Roe Equity Research.","Laura Champine","Good morning. My question is on the margin in Global Ceramic, which missed what we were looking for by a little bit. But I wonder relative to your internal estimates as you began Q4, was the final results better, worse, or about the same? And if you could help us by quantifying in that one segment in Q4, what did you absorb in terms of incremental start-up costs and inefficiencies as you launch new capacity and new product lines?","Chris Wellborn","Well, we brought up capacity in Mexico and we also brought up capacity in Europe during the period, and both of those start-ups went extremely well.","Laura Champine","Do you have the numbers?","Frank Boykin ","$12 million incremental start-up costs there.","Laura Champine","And as far as the adjusted operating income in that segment versus your expectations when you entered the quarter, how did that segment perform?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Listen, they\u2019re always too low.","Frank Boykin ","And, Laura, I need to correct myself. The $12 million is total start-up. And I\u2019ll have to come back to you on the incremental deal.","Operator","The next question is from Stephen East with Wells Fargo.","Stephen East","If we take a look at your growth both fourth quarter and first quarter and looking into 2018, in the fourth quarter you pretty easily beat your guidance that you had given at the end of October. I\u2019m trying to understand from your prior perspective what changed and what accelerated to give you that beat. I was wondering how much the carpet pricing and the carpet pull-forward played a role in that?","And then as you look into 1Q and beyond, you\u2019ve talked about pricing that you are already getting through and that\u2019ll help significantly improve your operations. But are there any other tangible drivers that we ought to be thinking about on the 1Q beat improvement?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think that the biggest piece, which wasn\u2019t a surprise, we knew there was going to be some pull-forward of sales due to price increases. There\u2019s the balancing of the pricing versus the costs and the flow-through and how they actually show up in the fourth quarter we do.","There\u2019s the FX rates that change on us; out of our control within there. In general, the business levels were about where we thought they\u2019d be when we went into them, and we think we have reasonable estimates for the first quarter, given all that\u2019s going on.","Stephen East","And then going back to the capacity that you\u2019ve got coming on, you\u2019ve talked several times in the past you\u2019ve got about, with all this CapEx, you have about $1.4 billion or so in capacity coming on over time. Could you talk a little bit about how much of that\u2019s come on so far, and then sort of give us a rough roadmap of when you think the rest of it is coming on, and then what you would expect in lag for sales filling up that capacity?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It\u2019s not as - the reason we can\u2019t be more clear with you is it\u2019s not like it falls at given minutes and you start it up and then the question is how long does it take to optimize? Then how long does it take to sell it? And then there\u2019s overlapping across timeframes and years.","So I mean, the reason we tend to talk about it in multiple-year circumstances if you draw a line at any minute - we just talked about the line in - LVT line in Europe. It\u2019s coming up and running two shifts. Now how long is it going to take us to sell it up and how long is it going to take us to optimize? We\u2019re going to have to see.","Stephen East","Is it fair to assume though that as you look at that 1.4 billion, not the sales but the capacity itself, the majority of that capacity would be in place by the time we exit 2018?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I\u2019m hesitating because we gave the number a while back and I don\u2019t remember if it was the incremental capacity on the investments we made in 2016 and 2017, which is I think what it was, and now what\u2019s happening we\u2019re moving into 2018 and there\u2019s the 2018 investments which are different and some of those like the Mexican plant.","It\u2019s up and running and it\u2019s not far from the capacity that we had expected it to be at and it\u2019ll be running fairly full, I mean, soon. And I don\u2019t remember the cutoff times between that number and the moment in time we\u2019re at right now.","Stephen East","And just one last, going back to the carpet and the price hike. How much price hike was put through and how much do you think got pulled forward into the fourth quarter?","Frank Boykin","The carpet price increase that we put in, we announced 5% to 6% to cover the inflation and pieces going on. Most of its implemented as we speak. The pull forward is hard to tell because we\u2019re in this normal dip in the winter time.","So we know what we got. The question is we don\u2019t know what the orders are going to be until we see what the customers - when they\u2019re going to start ordering again. It\u2019ll probably be the end of the quarter or maybe the first of next quarter before we have a good view of the actual what occurred.","Operator","The next question will come from Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse.","Christ Kalata","This is Chris on for Susan. Thanks for taking our questions. Our first question is on the move to consolidate sales between hard and softwood surfaces in North America. What drove that change and how does that position you guys versus competitors and how far along are you on this process?","Jeff Lorberbaum","So what we did in the residential business, we changed our regional sales management above the people that are - above the salespeople. So the salespeople are still segregated and selling each of the different product categories. The sales management, we made the region smaller but then put the manager over both product categories, as we\u2019ve done it, and then the management above there we\u2019ve also changed.","And the initial stages so far are showing that our ability to influence the customers because we\u2019re using that structure it looks like it\u2019s going to help us meet the needs of the customers better and present all of the products better.","Christ Kalata","Thanks for that clarification. And then my second question is on the breakdown of CapEx. That $750 million you guys spoke to earlier, how much of that is going into the U.S. versus some of your other faster growing markets?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I don\u2019t have it right now. I\u2019d have to - we have it. I just don\u2019t know it.","Operator","The next question is from John Lovallo with Bank of America.","Pete Galbo","It\u2019s actually Pete Galbo on for John. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m just wondering if you guys could quantify the porcelain countertop opportunity, as well as quartz, in the U.S. specifically.","Chris Wellborn","We could take them separately. So the quartz, the countertop market is $5 billion with quartz estimated at $1.2 billion, and that\u2019s growing more than 10% per year. We\u2019re expanding our stone centers and product offering to support our new plant, which will start up at the end of this year, so that\u2019s on quartz.","And then on porcelain, we have an Italian plant that\u2019s starting this quarter that we\u2019re selling both in the EU and the U.S. Porcelain countertops are really a niche product that\u2019s going to take time to grow, but the plants also produce large sizes for floor, wall and facades.","Pete Galbo","And, Frank, just a quick modeling one. What is driving the step-up in interest expense year-over-year for 2018?","Frank Boykin","It\u2019s not stepping up that much, to be honest, so I\u2019m not sure exactly. It\u2019s actually - it\u2019s up probably about $3 million or $4 million, so it\u2019s not stepping up that much. I don\u2019t know what it is off the top of my head. I\u2019ll get back to you.","Operator","The next question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Just at the end of the call here, a couple of two quick ones. Ceramic, Jeff, I think earlier responding to a question you had indicated that it was difficult to know where ceramic would grow. It\u2019d be a function of what happened in LVT. How much do you think LVT is cannibalizing ceramic growth right now? How much of a headwind are you feeling in your Ceramic business from LVT?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think you interpreted more finitely than I meant it. What I said was - what I meant to say was that LVT is taking a large part of the total incremental increase of all Flooring and Ceramic is going to be impacted the same as everything else, because it\u2019s not just impacting a piece of it.","I would guess two-thirds or more, maybe even higher of all the growth in Flooring in the last year was taken up by LVT. Now, the question is will it start plateauing out or will it keep growing at the same rate. We\u2019ll know after it\u2019s over.","David MacGregor","Second question still on the Ceramic space, what are your plans for opening additional stores in the U.S.? I think you\u2019d mentioned 15 new stores in 2017. What does that plan look like for 2018?","Chris Wellborn","Most of those stores, the 15. And then, we\u2019ll have a few stores here and there, but nothing substantial.","David MacGregor","What\u2019s the base now? Can you give us the denominator?","Chris Wellborn","We have roughly 300 stores altogether.","David MacGregor","Thanks very much.","Jeff Lorberbaum","And service centers.","Operator","The final question is from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard","Two things. Entirely, I understand, Chris, you walked us through the capacity limitations in the first half of last year that sound like it got resolved through the year. Curious what we should think about in terms of the growth rate of that business in 2018. Also understanding the progress that was made through 4Q. Does this business now get back to its traditional 5% or 6% growth? Is that how we should read sort of those moving parts that hurt last year?","Chris Wellborn","All we can say there is that we - it\u2019s starting to come back and we think it\u2019ll get back to where it\u2019s been with the exception of the impact of LVT and other things that could impact the industry.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think that in 2017, our estimate is that the Flooring category grew about 4% and our hope is that it\u2019ll pick up close to that again, could be more. And then the question is how much of that goes into LVT versus spread around the other product categories.","That one we\u2019re having a hard time predicting, but we\u2019re the largest manufacturer of LVT. We\u2019re putting on much more. We have a significant head start of anybody in making low-cost automated LVT in the world, and we think we\u2019re well-positioned.","Eric Bosshard","And so the category and the capacity constraints do get relieved? Just to make sure I understood the comments earlier. The capacity constraints that hurt 2017, that you resolved in tile going into 2018?","Chris Wellborn","That\u2019s correct.","Eric Bosshard","And then, secondly, Jeff, I\u2019m curious in your perspective the evolution of LVT over the last couple of years, specifically in terms of the product evolution and what your thoughts are on that. And then, secondly, the competitive set evolution, specifically the addition of domestic capacity and import capacity and what your perspective is on that.","Jeff Lorberbaum","LVT as a product coming into the marketplace has grown faster than anything that I\u2019ve seen in my 40 years of history. And part of its driven by that people like wood and stone looks on the floor, that it is an easy installation method, it is waterproof, which some of that you need and some you don\u2019t need is it, but it\u2019s being well-accepted as a new product. We\u2019re going to have to see how it plateaus out. The product has evolved dramatically in the last four or five years.","The first - it\u2019s normal when you come out but with stuff being made that - circumstances wouldn\u2019t perform well on the floor and it\u2019s gotten better. The style and design has improved. It\u2019s now got three different categories of product. There\u2019s a rigid that\u2019s selling at the higher-end, the flexible tends to be in the middle. Both of those tend to be Click products.","Then the lower end tends to be glued down products and at lower price points, and the commercial tends to be more of the lower end. And it continues to evolve as all new products do. There are different methods of making it. There\u2019s different visuals going on and it\u2019s going to take a while for it to evolve and level out on an ongoing basis.","We\u2019re at the forefront of making highly-automated low-cost production on a local basis which nobody else has like we do and it\u2019s going to advantage us long-term, however in the short-term it\u2019s impacted our speed-to-market of new introductions because we\u2019re going through the learning curves but we\u2019re way ahead of everybody else.","Frank Boykin","And if I could just clarify two open questions here on the interest expense, we\u2019re estimating it\u2019s going to be up $3 million or $4 million in 2018 and that\u2019s all driven by rate increases in the U.S. and Europe. The second open question had to do with start-up cost in Global Ceramics, incremental start-up cost in the fourth quarter were $2 million. Operator?","Operator","There are no further questions.

Today we'll update you on the Company's results for the fourth quarter of 2018 and provide guidance for the first quarter of 2019.","I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers.

Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. After five consecutive years of record earnings, 2018 proved more difficult than we anticipated with inflation increasing dramatically, luxury vinyl tile impacting other U.S. flooring products and most of our markets slowing. In this environment, we selectively invested approximately $1.5 billion to enhance our long-term performance, primarily in new product categories and geographies with greenfield projects and acquisitions, cost saving initiatives and buying back shares.","Our industry has faced periods with volatile costs and shifts in consumer preferences before and we have always navigated through them to emerge stronger and a more competitive position. And 2018 inflation in the U.S. was primarily driven by increasing material costs, escalating transportation and energy costs and constrained chemical supply. The tight U.S. labor market increased employee turnover, which impacted both efficiencies and training costs. Our ability to offset these pressures was hindered by continuous inflation, more competitive imports due to a stronger dollar and substitution of LVT for other alternatives.","In the U.S., LVT is taking share from other flooring and it will become a significantly larger part of our portfolio. Our LVT manufacturing and import strategies are progressing and our margins will improve in the future. In the U.S. and Europe we are adding more talent to our LVT operations to increase our production, efficiency and differentiation in 2019. While we are managing through these conditions, we are enhancing the long-term value of our business.","In 2018, we acquired leading flooring companies in Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. And in Europe, two flooring distributors and a specialized mezzanine company. We entered the European porcelain slab and carpet tile markets. We expanded our higher-quality ceramic in Eastern Europe and initiated sheet vinyl production in Russia and quartz countertop manufacturing in the United States. Much of the benefit from these capital investments will be realized in 2020 and beyond, as we achieve higher volume, mix and productivity.","Turning to the fourth quarter results. We generated sales of $2.4 billion, up 3% as reported or 5% on a constant currency. For the period, our adjusted operating income was $241 million or 10% of sales with an adjusted EPS of $2.53. As with our first year performance \u2013 as with our full year performance, the period was affected by significant inflation slowing markets and LVT impacting sales of other products. Even as we executed price increases in many products, our business has experienced increased competition and greater pressures on pricing and mix.","In the period, inflation continued to be a headwind across most categories as higher materials flowed through our costs. We decreased our manufacturing production in the fourth quarter to adapt to market demand. Our start-up costs in the period were higher than we projected with LVT production improving slower than anticipated. Our new countertop and sheet vinyl plants initiated manufacturing and our Polish ceramic tile expansion was still starting up. In the period we purchased about $274 million of Mohawk stock, reducing our share count by 2.3 million or the equivalent of 3% of our outstanding shares.","For more details on our segments, I'll now turn the call over to Chris Wellborn.","Chris Wellborn","Thank you, Jeff. For the quarter, our global ceramic segment sales increased about 5% as reported or 7% on a constant currency basis to $861 million with headwinds from inflation, pricing pressures and lower growth in some of our markets. Adjusted operating income for the segment was approximately $87 million or 10% of sales. In North America, our ceramic business increased sequentially but remain challenged due to import pressures and transportation expenses. To improve our margins, we have increased prices on our products to recover inflation and higher freight costs.","We are increasing sales of high-end products made in our new Tennessee plant with technical collections for commercial and color-bodied porcelain with greater slip resistance and durability for residential. For the premium consumer, we are also introducing luxury wall tile collections with handmade looks as well as porcelain floor tile with rectified edges and polished effects. Sales of our large porcelain slabs and countertops are expanding as they gain market acceptance. Our new quartz countertop plant is manufacturing basic products as we ramp up production and optimize our processes and formulations.","We have initiated sales of our patented perennial ceramic roofing with some of the largest distributors in the country. This new product mix premium slate-type roof is accessible to the broader market. This year we will also introduce luxury vinyl tile by Daltile, a new ceramic technology that will make the tile installation faster and easier.","Across North America, we are taking many actions to lower our costs including consolidating regional service centers and reducing headcount. We're improving our service by increasing our regional inventory levels and lowering our transportation costs by shipping truckloads and redistributing them locally instead of making multiple higher cost stocks. We are improving efficiencies of our manufacturing operations and installing an energy generation system in Tennessee to lower cost.","In Mexico our new production lines in Salamanca are operating well, and we are focused on improving our mix and margins. We are expanding our customer base and product offering with our Dalgress large sizes which replicate porcelain at lower price points. We have announced price increases in Mexico to cover inflation and shipping costs. In November, we finalized the purchase of Eliane in Brazil. Eliane is an industry leader with the best brand and a premium position in one of the world's largest ceramic markets. The Brazilian market is strengthening and both our sales and margins are expanding.","We have ordered the first phase of new equipment to enhance Eliane's operations and margins following the strategy we used to dramatically improve Marazzi's profitability. We're formulating strategies to optimize our combined Brazil and Mexico sales in Central and South America. In Europe, conditions softened as we went through the period with the Italian economy deteriorating the most due to the political uncertainty.","Our exports outside Europe which are focused on commercial projects also slowed. Given these conditions, we experienced greater pressure on margins as competition increased. We reduced production rates in the fourth quarter and are continuing to do so in the first period. We are increasing our commercial sales force to boost sales of our premium technical ceramic.","In retail, we are expanding our high-end collections in unique thin wall tile products. We are gaining traction with our large porcelain slabs which can be used for floors, walls and countertops. With the expansion of our European ceramic footprint, we are increasing the specialization of our plants in Italy, Spain, Poland and Bulgaria to improve our competitive advantages.","For example, we are moving production of our outdoor products to Poland where we added new lines dedicated to this category. We have increased the production and size capabilities at our Bulgarian plant to enhance our sales in lower price points across Europe. In Western Europe we are creating a separate sales force specifically for these lower-priced collections. We anticipate introducing a patented easy insulation tile in Europe later this year. With these actions, we expect to increase the utilization of our European assets as we move through the year.","The Russian ceramic market has grown as the economy improved. During the period, our sales and profitability increased substantially although the weaker ruble significantly reduced our translated results. To overcome inflationary pressures, we enhanced our mix and expanded our volume. We have installed two new production lines this year which will enable us to grow both our porcelain floor and wall tile business.","We are launching production of porcelain slabs which are used for floors, walls, countertops and commercial exteriors. In 2019, we will commence production of sanitary ware to make us more complete provider of premium bathroom products. To highlight our offering and enhance our brand, we are expanding the number of large company-owned flagship stores in major metropolitan areas.","In the fourth quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales were approximately $974 million, decreasing about 3% with an adjusted margin of 9% including start-up cost of $7 million. The segment sales shipped \u2013 slowed as we went through the period due to softer existing and new home sales, weaker remodeling and inventory reductions by customers in some channels. During the period we initiated further price increases to recover higher material and freight costs. Additionally, we launched numerous initiatives to enhance efficiency, reduce material cost and improve processes.","In the U.S. market, LVT sales continued to increase, impacting the purchase of other flooring. In November, we announced Paul de Cock's appointment as President of the Flooring North America segment to enhance our results. He has changed the management structure to improve our marketing, operations and innovation in each flooring product. Paul has two decades of experience in the industry and joined Mohawk in 2005 with the Eliane acquisition. Paul previously led the flooring business for our flooring Rest of World segment. Early in his Mohawk career, he led our U.S. Hard Surface business.","In the period, carpet was impacted by the high cost of materials and hard surface alternatives. We have increased carpet prices to better align with our costs. In our premium SmartStrand collections, we introduced our new ColorMax technology which blends colorations with greater clarity and deeper saturation. ColorMax was selected by retailers as the most innovative new product at the recent flooring trade show. We also updated our entry-level SmartStrand collections to enhance their sales.","We expanded our patented Air.O unified soft flooring offering to strengthen our increasing distribution. We've increased our proprietary Continuum polyester offering with higher-style products at all price points. We have completed most of our regional markets and our residential customers remain cautiously optimistic about prospects for 2019.","We continue to enhance our commercial sales organization with increased segmentation by channel and greater focus on specification of large projects. Across all products, many initiatives are being executed to enhance efficiency, material cost, quality and service. We have reinvigorated the premium laminate category through the new investments we made to produce visuals that exceed real wood with previously unachievable water resistance and durability.","Wood sales remain under pressure as we provide other alternatives with superior value propositions. Both our residential and commercial LVT sales grew substantially during the period as we implemented our sourcing and manufacturing strategy. We are offering a premium Pergo LVT collection which, before introducing, has great consumer brand recognition than any other LVT product in the market.","Though we had anticipated even more improvement, the speed of our LVT production increased about 20% over the prior period. We're adding more engineering resources to further increase productivity, formulations and yields. Long-term, we are confident that our investment in this technology will provide us with competitive advantages when it is operating at expected levels.","Our Flooring Rest of World segment delivered fourth quarter sales of $614 million, an increase of 12% as reported or 16% on a constant currency basis with acquisitions enhancing our results. Adjusted margin for the segment was 13% of sales including start-up cost of $18 million. As we progressed through the period, we experienced softening market conditions in both Europe and Australia. LVT sales continued their strong growth and we significantly outperformed the laminate market with our premium collections.","We have initiated laminate price increases to recover rising costs and currency changes. Our investments to expand laminate production in Europe and Russia have increased our market share by delivering differentiated visuals and waterproof features. The new lines also supported margin expansion with improved mix and greater efficiencies. The expanded production is enabling us to increase our sales in Russia which has been constrained by capacity limitations.","Our LVT sales continue to grow dramatically as our production rates increase. Some of our LVT introductions were postponed until later this period as we overcame technical problems that increased our costs during the fourth quarter. We have seen about 15% speed improvements in LVT over the last quarter as our processes have been refined and we anticipate continued improvement in the year ahead. The improved performance of the new line will allow us to add unique visuals and performance features to our collections.","In Europe, we are gaining share in sheet vinyl by launching new products to expand sales on the continent as our new plant in Russia has begun to satisfy its local market. Our Russian sheet vinyl facility is operating as planned and is producing goods to satisfy commitments to major customers. As we refine the plant's processes and costs we will expand our customer base with innovative products. Our European carpet tile plant continues to progress as we broaden our product offering and customer base. We're expanding our commercial sales force and increasing the specification of our products.","We have integrated Godfrey Hirst into the Mohawk structure. Presently, the Australian housing market is slowing and we are adapting to the changing conditions. We are investing in new assets to expand Godfrey Hirst's commercial carpet and leveraging Mohawk's resources to enhance product and material strategies. We anticipate bringing greater value to the market with more innovative products and a comprehensive offering of hard surface products distributed under our brand.","The volume and profitability of our insulation business is improving significantly. Our polyurethane insulation is taking share from other products as it did prior to prices rising from material constraints. Since the supply of raw materials has recovered, our service levels have improved, and pricing has become more competitive with other alternatives.","Our board sales and margins for the year were the highest in the decade. The investments we've made have improved our offering and productivity. With the softening economy in the fourth period, we experienced sales and margin pressures. We have implemented initiatives to increase sales and focus on value-added products. We're expanding the mezzanine flooring business we acquired last year as we leverage our existing manufacturing and sales organization.","Now I'll pass the call to Frank, who will review our fourth quarter financial performance.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Chris. Net sales for the quarter were $2,449 million and grew 3% as reported with the legacy business up almost 1% on a constant exchange rate basis. Flooring Rest of World had the strongest growth with LVT and laminate products performing well both in Rest of World and in our North American segment. Just as a heads up, in 2019 the first quarter will have one additional day and then will have one less day in the fourth quarter of 2019.","Gross margin as reported was 26.4% or 27.1% excluding charges and was down from 32.3% last year. Inflation of $61 million, lower productivity of $24 million, higher start-up of $17 million, plant shutdowns of $15 million and unfavorable foreign exchange of $13 million, offset increased volume of $18 million and price mix of $9 million.","SG&A as reported was 17.7% or excluding charges 17. 3% compared to 17.1% last year. We had unusual charges of $27 million that primarily were related to the Godfrey Hirst and Eliane acquisitions and plant consolidation in North America.","Our operating margin excluding charges was 9.8% down from 15.1% last year. Inflation headwinds of $62 million along with the impact of increased start-up of $18 million, shutdown of $15 million and lower productivity of $23 million, offset $9 million of improvement in price mix. We also had a $7 million headwind from FX. EBITDA was $381 million in the fourth quarter and $1.7 billion for the full year.","Our interest expense for the quarter was $14 million which compares to $7 million last year. The increase was related to early extinguishment of high-cost Eliane debt. Our income tax rate improved to 19.2% from 27.2% last year due to the 2017 tax reform act. We estimate a first quarter rate of approximately 22.5% to 23.5% and a full year rate of 22% to 23% for 2019. Earnings per share excluding charges were $2.53 which was a decrease of 26% compared to last year.","Turning to the segments. Our global ceramic segment had sales of $861 million. Fourth quarter sales increased 5% as reported with our legacy business up 2% on a constant exchange rate basis. Our Russian business reported the highest growth and North America improved sequentially on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. Operating income excluding charges was $87 million with a margin of 10.1% down from 14% last year.","Inflation of $30 million declining price mix of $6 million and increased shutdown costs of $8 million, offset incremental productivity of $13 million and stronger overall volume. In the Flooring North America segment, sales of $974 million decreased year-over-year by 3% with improvement in price mix of $26 million which was offset by volume weakness in soft surface product lines.","Our operating income excluding charges in this segment was $86 million with a margin of 8.9% compared to 16.7% last year. Improvement in price mix of $20 million was offset by inflation of $36 million, unfavorable productivity of $37 million and $7 million of production shutdowns as well as start-up of $7 million. We also had $17 million of lower volume.","In the Flooring Rest of World segment sales were $614 million an increase of 12% as reported with our legacy sales growing 3% on a constant exchange rate basis. LVT had the strongest growth in this category. Operating income excluding charges was $78 million with the margin of 12.8% compared to 15.8% last year.","Productivity and lower material costs were offset by $5 million of foreign exchange and another $5 million of lower price mix as well as higher start-up of $13 million. In the corporate and eliminations segments, we had an operating loss of $11 million. And in 2019, we are estimating a loss ranging between $35 million and $40 million.","Jumping to the balance sheet. Receivables ended the quarter at $1,606 million with our days sales outstanding at 60 days in the quarter compared to 59 days a year ago. Inventories ended the quarter at $2,288 million with inventory days at 128. Our inventory was up $340 million from the fourth quarter of last year with 70% of the increase from new businesses and acquisitions and 30% of the increase from Chinese pre-buy and inflation. We lowered our legacy manufactured inventory in most categories as we ran production below sales during the quarter.","Our fixed assets for the quarter ended up at $4.7 billion and included capital expenditures of $151 million with depreciation and amortization of $139 million. For the full year, capital expenditures were $794 million with depreciation and amortization of $522 million. We are estimating CapEx for 2019 to be approximately $550 million to $580 million with depreciation and amortization estimated at $560 million. Looking at long-term debt, our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong. Total debt was $3.3 billion at the end of the quarter with leverage at 1.8 times debt to EBITDA.","Jeff, I'll turn it back over to you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. As we enter 2019 many macroeconomic conditions around the world could impact our results. Economies have been slowing in most of our markets. Oil volatility is making our costs unpredictable and the housing markets in many regions are under pressure. So our outlook is cautious because of these issues, we expect our results to improve through the year. In the first quarter, we're reducing production rates due to softer environment in most of our markets. Higher price materials will flow through before we realize the benefits from recent changes. The dollar strengthened relative to last year and will have a significant negative impact on the first period.","We continue to introduce innovative new collections, implement price increases and improve manufacturing processes. Taking all of this into account, our EPS guidance for the first quarter of 2019 is $2.02 to $2.12 excluding any one-time charges. Our major product and geographic expansions are at various stages of ramping up. As we progress through the year, these investments will increase our sales and margins, price increases will benefit our results, our start-up costs will decline and production levels will increase. We will realize the potential of these projects in 2020 and beyond as volume and efficiencies increase.","Today the business is strong with substantial resources, a broader product portfolio and a more diverse geographic footprint. We have a strong balance sheet, extensive liquidity and historically low debt leverage. In the short-term we are taking the appropriate steps to manage through these market uncertainties and we are confident our investments and acquisitions will significantly enhance our long-term business.","We'll now be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet.","Michael Wood","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could shed some light on general industry dynamics in the U.S. ceramics market. With the 10% EBIT margins you reported, which are going lower in the first part of 2019. I guess even if we say you're tracking above that because of the investment headwinds and destocking that are hurting results temporarily, where do you think the competitors are from a profitability standpoint and where that marginal production cost is? I'm trying to understand that given your scale advantages, at what point do you start to see the competitors alleviate some pressures that you're seeing on the price cost side?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The competitors we believe are already reducing their production rate significantly in the U.S. market. However, about 50% or more of the U.S. capacity is satisfied by worldwide supply base and is imported. At the same time you have the 10% increase in tariffs from China, which is the biggest supplier of imports to the country. So you have a lot of dynamics going on. We are raising our prices as we speak to recover some of the freight and margin loss we've incurred so far.","Michael Wood","Okay. And then as a follow-up, you talked about deteriorating slowing sales in many markets. Can you just give us an update on what market you seemed stabilized since at the start of this year? And what markets are continuing to slow down?","Jeff Lorberbaum","So we see in Europe, the markets slowing across, we have a large part of our sales in Italy which is going into a recession. And we have the Russian market is improving in Russia. The Mexican market decreased in 2018. It was running at double digits in our category in 2017, in 2018 it was running negative. We think a lot of it was caused by the interactions between the U.S. and them, but we see it improving. In the U.S., your guess on what's going to happen with the economy and housing is as good as mine this year.","Michael Wood","Okay. Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much guys. First question is about your LVT production and how or whether your plans have evolved since you started building the two major lines a couple of years ago, the two new lines. Like for instance, I'm wondering is your intention to focus to new Dalton line on like high-end rigid LVT and source the rest whereas maybe previously you intended to produce both high-end low-end rigid? Or maybe you're planning to do flexible LVT on that line for the time being? Or is it basically just that your plan is essentially unchanged just merely delayed. So whatever you can share about your thinking and how it may have evolved will be great. And as for the rigid product you are currently making, where is this product being sold today?","Jeff Lorberbaum","See, if I can answer all of those. So in the United States, our strategy hasn't changed. The new line is focused on making rigid products and it will primarily make mid to higher-end rigid products because we think we can utilize the full capacity of doing that. We change the thing that given that it was taking us longer than we hoped and the market was growing faster, we changed the strategy in the middle of last year. And we began importing more products so that we could satisfy larger parts of the marketplace.","And going into this year, we've raised our inventory substantially and LVT going into the year to support it. And then we've also announced that we said we're introducing a new Pergo brand in that which today has a higher consumer brand than any other thing in the category. We haven't sold the first piece of it yet. And we're also going to put LVT in the Dal-Tile product offering this year.","Stephen Kim","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Okay. So then my second question relates to inventory. I think you mentioned that you're sort of building, the stuff that you're making in LVT, the new LVT line is going into inventory right now. I assume that means that you're going to be looking to launch this Pergo product, I guess, probably in the home centers I'm guessing and maybe other places too, in 1Q I'm guessing. So could we actually see inventory dollars down as soon as 2Q this year? And I mean on a year-over-year basis inventory dollars down? Or should \u2013 are we going to have to wait until later this year?","Jeff Lorberbaum","First is that, I assume that the Chinese have a down period in the first of the year so you have to prebuy ahead of it. The second is we are expecting our sales to go up, so we're building inventories for those product categories before we have any sales. And you have to build enough so that we can satisfy the customers. Third is the inventory is also going into all these new businesses we go keep talking about. When you start them up, you put in all the raw materials, the inventories and you're building new products before the sales in those two. So the inventories were all there. Frank, you want to touch a little bit on where the inventory distribution is at this minute, the inventory growth, distribution?","Frank Boykin","Yes. Like I said in my comments, about 70% of the $340 million of growth is in new businesses and acquisitions and the balance here in Chinese prebuy or inflation. And I think another point to make there is that we worked real hard to take our inventory \u2013 manufactured inventory levels down by reducing production levels down below the sales levels. And I think we've done a pretty good job of keeping the manufactured inventories down in most categories.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The growth in all these different businesses you have to put the inventories ahead. So I don't expect the inventory turns to be what we like them going into the second quarter because it's going to take a while to get all these businesses up even though the inventory is there to support much higher sales.","Stephen Kim","Okay. So inventory probably won't be down year-over-year until maybe the back half of the year is kind of what I'm hearing. Is that fair?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes, the turns \u2013 would be the turns right in the inventory.","Stephen Kim","Okay. So the turns will be up, got it \u2013 in the back half. All right. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Bouley with Barclays.","Matt Bouley","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Jeff, could you elaborate on the comment you made there around improving results through the year during 2019? Is that a revenue growth or a margin comment? Are you anticipating, I guess, the margin declines to lessen? Just how exactly should we model improving results after the first quarter? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","To start out with the outlook which we said is cautious because of the economies and the housing which we're having difficulty projecting what's going to happen this year, but we do expect improvements in the business as we go through with the expansion of the sales and the margins as we go through the year.","Matt Bouley","Okay. Understood. And then secondly, does these first quarter guidance anticipate any effect from the tariffs? And I'm assuming you wouldn't necessarily see an immediate impact. But I guess beyond the first quarter, obviously as you're sourcing from China, how should we think about what the margin impact would look like or what you're planning around that? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I don't have any idea what additional tariffs will go in and not go in. We don't know. We haven't built anything into our plan but we'll have to adjust if they go in, how we operate, and how it impacts the marketplaces.","Matt Bouley","Okay. Thanks for the detail.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America.","John Lovallo","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. The first question is just following up on Matt's question maybe. It looks like the first quarter implied operating margin could kind of be in the 8.5% to 9% range realizing that could be just conservatism on your part. But the comments about things getting better or improving, I mean, should we be thinking about improvement just sequentially? Or should we be thinking about that on a year-over-year basis in terms of operating margin?","Frank Boykin","We were talking about the year-over-year margin percentage improving sequentially \u2013 third quarter, fourth quarter.","John Lovallo","Okay, got it. All right, that's helpful. And then if we think about some of the headcount and consolidation that you guys \u2013 headcount reduction I should say and consolidation of the service centers that you guys talked about, I mean, clearly it makes a lot of sense from a cost perspective. Is there any risk though that of negative impact to your operations? Or was this really just kind of redundant capacity?","Jeff Lorberbaum","What we did is in some of the major markets we have multiple stores in every corner of the metropolitan areas and we've developed ways of getting the product to those customers with less store foot \u2013 service center footprints in the area.","Chris Wellborn","Yes. And we don't really see a risk to that because we analyze each market by market. And where we took the reductions, we should be fine.","John Lovallo","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.","Mike Dahl","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question I wanted to go back to the discussion around inventory. And notwithstanding the uncertainty about whether or not tariffs go into effect at 25% in March just focus specifically at what's played out over the last couple of months. You mentioned the Chinese prebuy. Part of that is around the Lunar New Year part presumably for you guys and also maybe your competitors is really that they're also getting the in out of the tariffs. Can you just discuss on what you're seeing in terms of both competitor inventory levels and channel inventory levels from your customers in LVT?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I can't speak for my competitors because I have no idea. But we are raising the inventories for all the reasons you just went through. In some cases we're buying it ahead because of the pricing. In some cases we're buying it ahead because of the increases. And in some cases we're buying it ahead to expand our business and footprint and brands we're selling under in each cases. So it's all of the above. I would imagine the rest of the world is doing the same thing.","Mike Dahl","And so do you see any potential channel issues in terms of too much inventory in the retail channel as you head into the spring?","Chris Wellborn","I mean I can see what \u2013 on the ceramic side we tend to build up in preparation for that Chinese shutdown. But then as you go through the quarter obviously your inventory goes down because you're not buying more from the Chinese when they shutdown.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The imports in ceramics which we can see always go up dramatically the first of the year as people are putting in new products, changing out old ones and building up the inventories. And so what happens is the imports decline as you go through the year and they make adjustments in the second half coming out of it. So you typically go in with a more optimistic view and you adjust in the second half of the year. And you could see it in the import data.","Mike Dahl","Got it. Okay. And then my second question, Jeff, I was hoping if you could give us a little more color around Paul's appointment in North America and just what specifically he's already changed out? And if there's anything more radical in nature that he's considering as far as strategy there?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I guess a little background on Paul. Paul has been in the industry his whole life. He joined our business when we acquired Eliane in 2005. At that point, he came to the United States and he ran our United States hard surface business for a number of years. And then he went back and he's been running the Rest of World segment's Flooring business since. Since he got here, he's announced changes in the management structure where we've had a more focused approach on each product category. And with that, we expect to have greater efficiencies and execution in each category. At the same time we're going to enhance these sales synergies across the total segment as we go through. And he's \u2013 a majority of those things needed to be done, have already been announced and executed.","Mike Dahl","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi. Thank you taking my questions today. The first is really more for LVT production, more specifically in the U.S., secondarily in Europe. As you think about tackling the new ceramic or stone type LVT product, is this a type of product that you would attempt to manufacture domestically? Is it still a type of product that you would prefer to import? And just really broadly speaking stepping back and looking at the forest for the trees how do you intend to tackle the fast growing different types of products coming out of LVT either manufacturing or more import? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","There are two types of stone products. One stone product is just changing the stone ceramic looks, is just changing the visuals on the various types that are here, which we have been doing the other. And then there's a new product type that has a different core with it that's being made in China. And we have not entered that one yet.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. Do you \u2013 is it your intention to get into that product this year or is this something...","Jeff Lorberbaum","Our strategy is to have both a sourced strategy and a manufactured strategy. And if the business believes they're better off or they need something to source we won't hesitate to do it.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay, great. My second question just is on Flooring North America. You gave some great detail in the prepared commentary on some puts and takes on the margins. But as we've had a really two consecutive quarters with pretty steep declines year-over-year, can you help us understand what things are more easily addressable and fixable? And what ones will take a little bit longer to rectify? So really kind of more inflation things that can catch up but others that are trickier like manufacturing. Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I mean, there's some \u2013 I'd say, going forward, there are different issues. So the issues you have with the overall economies and pieces which we can't control, which we're not sure exactly how they're going to evolve, how we're going to have to react to. You have issues in each category like ceramic where the stronger dollar has reduced the pricing in the marketplace. The tariffs are raising the prices of the stuff coming out of China. And at the same time our freight costs have been going up here which we've absorbed last year. We announced an increase at the end of the fourth quarter to try to recover both some of the margins as well as the freight costs to get them back. In each of the different product categories and markets, there's different dynamics in each.","You have on top of that all of these new investments we have are under-utilizing the fixed costs because when we go into the new businesses, it takes time to ramp them up which is why we said that a large part of these new profitability will be in 2020 and beyond. Because even if we start them up and get them there, we have to get the customers to buy enough to get the profitability that we expect. So it will improve through the year. But until you hit these rates of utilization that we need in each one, you won't be to the potential of what they can have.","Kathryn Thompson","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good morning. My first question is, just it seems like you did make some significant progress in the quarter in terms of price mix despite some of the macro weakness that we saw. Can you talk to just a little bit more color around that how sustainable it is? And really how we should be thinking about it trending as we move through this year?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I guess a few things. One is in our carpet business with raw materials, we would expect that as the inventories flow through, that it will help the margins which should be about the second quarter we should start seeing that. However, I can say that the oil prices, the predictions by people who know more than I do, range from about $50 a barrel to $90. And so I have no way of predicting what they're going to be and we'll have to react as they go through.","The same thing you hear us we talked about in the introductory things about introducing a lot of higher-value products in each category about try to driving the premium products. And the question is going to be as we go through the thing we think we'll help the mix. The question is going to be how the economies and volumes is going to be as we progress through the year. And we're sure we'll improve it if we don't have any negative things we're not anticipating show up.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And then my second question is just as we do think about your source as well as manufacturing strategy, can you talk a little bit to the margin differentials with those products and how we should be thinking about the implications of that on the business?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The margin differential in the short term will probably be similar. In the longer term we would expect the margins in our manufacturer to be higher.","Susan Maklari","Okay. So we should be expecting that to come through more in 2020 then?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes.","Susan Maklari","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of John Baugh with Stifel.","John Baugh","Thank you. Good morning. I have two things quickly. You gave us some color around production of LVT both in Europe and the U.S. Was that a rigid comment only? Or is that all LVT? And is there any distinction between the growth rates of the two?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think you asked a production question and a growth question I think. Let's start with the production piece. The production, the new lines will actually make either in the United States were primarily focused on \u2013 well not primarily, we're focused on rigid because there's enough volume to use it. In Europe which hasn't moved as fast we're actually producing significant amounts of flexible because the marketplace isn't moving as fast as rigid as it is here. What was the second part?","John Baugh","So, Jeff, your focus \u2013 your production comment in the U.S. about 20% sequential from third quarter, was rigid?","Jeff Lorberbaum","That's on the rigid.","John Baugh","That was rigid. Okay. Thank you. And then secondly, the home centers are changing out their floors a little bit on what they're offering. Could you discuss how that impacted you, say, last year? And how you anticipate it impacting you this year with any focus on timing this year?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Actually the timings be a subject on the home centers. John, you're talking about a particular category?","John Baugh","Well, we know they're deemphasizing carpet and to hard surface emphasis and I'm just curious as to what you're seeing how that's impacting your business.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Listen, they're trying to participate in all the flooring categories like everybody else. At the same time, they see the trend in LVT like products increasing. So they're giving them more space and reducing some of the space in the other ones while they still try to optimize the other product categories. And I would say that's probably similar for the entire marketplace.","Chris Wellborn","I know they're also relying on our domestic expertise on the ceramic side and we're doing quite a bit of work with the home centers.","John Baugh","Great. Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng","Hi, guys. Rest of World Flooring was a bright spot for you guys last year but you're seeing market conditions slow down a bit in Australia and Europe. How should we think about growth in that market in '19? And margin step back to wood, what drove that?","Chris Wellborn","Well, on the \u2013 particularly on the Godfrey Hirst, we've integrated Godfrey Hirst into our organization. The Australian housing market has weakened as we expected and we're responding. We're expanding our commercial carpet tile in that market. We're sharing best practices with the United States and we're closing inefficient assets. We're also bringing innovative products to the market and expanding our hard surface offering in that market.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The other sales in Europe the sales are moderating as the economies are. And we still have the highest growth in LVT and laminate. We're increasing prices in laminate to offset inflation over there. We're increasing our LVT sales with our expanding production. We have more sheet vinyl capacity in Europe because going forward we won't need it to supply the Russian marketplace as we go through. And we've increased the capacity in high-end laminate in both countries to allow us to expand those as we get through. A lot of it is going to depend on how the economies evolve over there and we're expecting them to be a little slower this year.","Philip Ng","Got it. Slower growth but you're still expecting growth at this point. Is that fair?","Chris Wellborn","It depends on which products, markets and pieces as you go through. I mean, they're all going to be different.","Philip Ng","Got it. And then just given all the moving pieces you've called out was raw mats ramping up new capacity Jeff, I think in the last call you mentioned that flat organic EBITDA growth was probably not a bad way to think about 2019. There's obviously been some puts and takes. Is that still a realistic goal? Or there could be some downside risk to that target at this point?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It depends where the economy is going, what's happening. I would say there's some downside risk to that given what we see in the housing markets and the general economies.","Philip Ng","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Maggie Wellborn","Hi. This is actually Maggie Wellborn on for Mike. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about sales mix by \u2013 like channel and product within your segments during the fourth quarter. And specifically did you see any shifts from the third quarter? And how do you expect it to play out in the first quarter of 2019?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I guess the biggest shift we saw was from the housing sales slowing down and new and existing home sales in the U.S. marketplace. As it slowed down, we felt the impact of it. Other things would be in Italy. They went into a recession, so we saw the same thing. We saw compression of the sales. And then as things slow down, you tend to see more price competition. On the other hand, in the United States market, in some of our categories as we raised prices, we saw some of the retailers trading consumers down to try to offset the higher prices in retail. So that also created a mix change, but I mean all the markets are unique in itself.","Maggie Wellborn","Okay. Thank you. And then just another question. You talked about increase in prices. I was just wondering what is your level of confidence in your ability to realize those better pricing in the first quarter and into 2019?","Frank Boykin","Again it's led by product by country. The carpet industry along with our sales, increased prices and they seem to be holding through the marketplace as we speak. We've announced an increase in ceramic which was helped by the increases in the tariffs and the large amounts coming in there. So we're expecting to be able to get those through as we go through where you go through different markets. In ceramic in Mexico we've raised the prices and we're expecting those to hold. We are very aggressive in Mexico and the lower price points last year because of the new capacity we've put in and pushing it through the marketplace.","And on the other extreme, you have Italy where the volumes going down in the whole industry where there was new capacity put in the marketplace over the last year or so and the margins are being compressed and we're projecting the margins to be lower next year. And I mean \u2013 I don't know. In Russia, we're increasing prices in the Russian markets and expanding it. The Russian market has been a growth area for us. And we see it continuing for this year also.","Maggie Wellborn","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo.","Stephen East","Thank you, and good morning. First, you've talked about curtailing production in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. As you look at your business now, do you expect you'll be curtailing production beyond the first quarter? And if so, how long do you all think it last at least what you're seeing right now?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We believe we'll be increasing the production rates to match sales going through the year. We've been producing under the sales rate in many of the product categories. So the production rate should go up and help us.","Stephen East","Got you. Okay. And then I guess two things. On the LVT, how long do you think you all are at normal capacity utilization rates for a great type product? Is this a '19 event that you think you can get to? Or does that also stretch out into 2020? And then just quickly on your guidance for the first quarter if you wouldn't mind just rank ordering what are the biggest issues in your guidance that you gave?","Frank Boykin","The LVT we think that by the end of the year we should be operating the new lines at similar productivities and speeds as our older lines having worked through the technical challenges of it. So we think going into 2020, we'll have the lines operating at the levels we \u2013 at the productivity levels we expect. And I forgot the second part of the question.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think Stephen, you were asking about the risk in the first quarter guidance? Is that what you were asking?","Stephen East","No, just if you wouldn't mind, Frank, just rank ordering the issues in your guidance that's down year-over-year a bit more than fourth quarter just trying to understand if you would rank order what the biggest drivers of that decline was?","Frank Boykin","In the first quarter it would be the economy slowing in most markets. It would be housing under pressure in some regions. It would be the lower production rates due to the softer environment and it would be the higher-price materials slowing through as some of the sales levels were softer in the fourth quarter, it takes a little longer for the inventories to flow through.","Stephen East","Okay. Got you. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates.","Justin Speer","Thank you. First question for me just on the capacity utilization in these new plant. You mentioned the 20% production speed. Where is it today? And what is fully optimized in your definition?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The plants are running five days a week. They're running at much lower speeds than we anticipate them getting to by the end of the year. There are more interruptions from software, hardware, technical things that are being solved one after the other. There is training going on with each one. So we would expect that the production rates would increase, the downtime would decrease dramatically the \u2013 then you start working on things like the raw material inputs and how you reduce those. And you start working on other things of how to improve the product offering with more technical innovations. All have to happen as we go through the year. We think when we get to the end of the year and go into 2020 we'll be in a good position.","Justin Speer","If you were to kind of like pull back and look it like you have a lot coming at you. You've got raw materials coming at you. You've got macro issues. You've got LVT outgrowth issues. If you could kind of help \u2013 if you could help us unpack how much of the revenue and profit in terms of margin drag from inefficiencies that are being expressed in 2018 and potentially 2019. And where when you get those optimized how much margin improvement you could potentially enjoy as you get those out? Help us unpack that, because I think when you look at raw material, I'd say that was the bad guy in 2018. The other moving pieces, how much is just from being suboptimized?","Jeff Lorberbaum","There's multiple parts. So one part is the start-up costs. So the start-up costs were about $80 million in 2017. And we've said that start-up costs in 2018 will be $35 million to $40 million in the start-up costs. Now besides that, you have to get the productivity and the volume up. And the volume when you get up to 80%, 85%, the costs start dropping dramatically and the profits go up dramatically. And then the second part is as you start filling them up, you start selling more higher-value products and lower-value products you have.","And depending upon the marketplace and what it is, the mix can be a big improvement as you go through once these things stabilize. So, I mean we're at all different places. This new plant making countertops in Tennessee I mean it's operating one shift now as it \u2013 one shift as we train the people and go forward, it's operating with very basic products. And that's totally different than it's going to be next year as we get through. So that's extreme on one side.","In the sheet vinyl plant in Russia, it's operating on two shifts, as it. And we're having to go find new customers who never bought sheet vinyl from us and we're doing that. So, the question on that one is more about the ramp-up of it and how fast we can get cuts first to move versus technical problems and getting it started up for instance. And each one of these is unique and different. But it's balancing \u2013 when you go into new things, the good news is you're going at a new products and new geographies which is a big upside. But everybody doesn't wake up the next day and say they'll buy everything you can make when you haven't been in the markets before.","So there's a lot of things that have to get laid out which is why you really have to think of it in long-term pieces as they ramp up. When they get ramped up and running full they'll all be running at the average of our margins for all of our businesses. That's the potential. Now the question is, is it going to happen in six months or two years in each one? I can't tell you.","Justin Speer","In view of the LVT kind of stopping and starting, is there any change in the economics of that business relative maybe to six or 12 months ago? You mentioned do you think margins would be better internally produced versus sourced? But in a no tariff scenario, are the fully landed economics still superior or at least as good as Chinese imports?","Jeff Lorberbaum","That's our plan.","Justin Speer","And lastly the productivity initiatives, the mix up and another productivity initiatives you mentioned, how should we think about the incremental contributions from those across your business in 2019?","Jeff Lorberbaum","You have to separate out the new projects from the existing ones. And existing one is going to be more determined about the economies and the competition and what it takes to run the assets in the marketplace. And we will have to adjust as they are. If the markets are good, the mix will be better. If the markets are bad, we'll sell more commodity stuff and the mix will go down. So it depends on how the whole markets evolve over time in each product and each country.","Justin Speer","Can I sneak one more in? LVT as a percentage of revenues, where is that in terms of the Flooring Rest of World and Flooring North America?","Frank Boykin","Well LVT once we have all the plants up and running, and fully optimized, we'll have manufactured sales in excess of $1 billion. And then in addition to that we will continue our sourcing strategy like Jeff mentioned earlier.","Justin Speer","Thank you guys.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. Frank, in the prepared comments, did you \u2013 in Flooring North America, did you say productivity was negative $37 million. Is that correct?","Frank Boykin","I did.","Keith Hughes","In this said quarter where it's been pretty notable negative number. Can you just describe what is going on and what caused that?","Frank Boykin","Yes, it was impacted this quarter again by lower manufacturing levels, high employee costs and then ramping up of the new products \u2013 new capital projects that we've got going on. It's going to continue, Keith, to lag \u2013 productivity will continue to lag in the first quarter with inefficiencies and higher costs. But we are expecting to see improvements as we move through the year in there.","Keith Hughes","Okay. And definitionally, in some of the other segments you called out the lower production the lower production volume as a separate item but it's lumped into this number here. Is that correct in Flooring North America?","Frank Boykin","No. Lower volume the margins associated with \u2013 the standard margins associated with lower margin or volumes are included in the volume number. But to the extent you've got higher unabsorbed overhead for example, that's going to show up in productivity.","Keith Hughes","Okay. So the shut \u2013 you talked about some shutdown numbers, that's something different. Is that correct?","Frank Boykin","Correct.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Is that just plant closures or what is it that number to find out?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Well like in ceramic for example there's no plant closures but you may have lines down.","Keith Hughes","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning, everyone. Can you just talk about order patterns you maybe seeing in commercial non-res markets?","Chris Wellborn","Well at least \u2013 on the ceramic side where we've seen the commercial business slowly improve.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Is that we're seeing so far in the first quarter it seems like it's strengthening a little bit for us in all the different markets. So we'll have to see how it works.","David MacGregor","Is that really with respect to North America or is it...","Jeff Lorberbaum","That's a North American comment.","David MacGregor","Right. And is there anything to say about the European non-res commercial?","Chris Wellborn","I think we've seen it at least in Italy in ceramic it slowed a little bit than commercial had.","David MacGregor","Okay. And then what were the most important takeaways for you from the International Surface Event trade show?","Frank Boykin","Which trade show? One more time?","David MacGregor","Vegas, the International Surface Event trade show.","Jeff Lorberbaum","From what we hear from customers is that they are let's say cautiously optimistic really depending on what we see from the housing market.","David MacGregor","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Lee Nalley with SunTrust.","Lee Nalley","Yes, thanks for squeezing [ph] me in. Just regarding the share repurchases, it's not really big for you guys considering your cash flows but the $200 million roughly remaining, should we just expect that to be deployed as quickly as possible considering where your stock price is?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We'll continue purchasing it over time. And depending upon the market and what's going on, we'll act differently.","Lee Nalley","Okay. And then so one follow-up, just thinking about balancing the repurchases and your leverage, I guess, how \u2013 do you have a max target for your leverage? Or how high would you be willing to take your leverage?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Related to the stock purchase, we have approval from the Board to buy $500 million is the approval at this point. So to do different, we would have to go back to the Board and get a different piece. The leverage in the \u2013 our total leverage I mean in our history of it not-too-distant past, we've been comfortable going over three times, but we want to maintain our ratings with the rating agencies so we can continue to book to borrow money. So under the right circumstances and being able to pull the leverage down, we would leverage the company up some more.","Lee Nalley","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we do have an additional question from the line of Christophe Van der with Value Square. Christophe, your line is open.","Christophe Van der","Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. I would like to hear whether you could break out carpet in U.S? Hi, can you hear me? Okay, great. [indiscernible] My question would be regarding carpet, could you break that out? How much there is and how big that is in the U.S? And then also where do you see the carpet market going in the long term? Because carpet and rugs are somewhat of a declining market. So, I was wondering how market positioning itself in that market on the longer term and how you see that evolving in the long term? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The carpet category is approximately one-third of our total business.","Frank Boykin","Global business.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Global business. And it's been declining over time. If you go back a while, it was 100% of our business. It's now one-third we expand into other categories. We would expect that the other categories would grow faster over time. It would continue to decrease as a proportion of the total. Are there any other questions?","Christophe Van der","Okay. And do you expect any further investments or will it really decline? Or do you expect to just go along?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The investments will be in line with what we think need to be competitive, bring new products to the marketplace and increase our efficiencies. But I would expect the investments in it to be lower than the other categories.","Christophe Van der","Thank you. And on ceramics I heard rumors that there are closures in the Dal-Tile stores. Could you elaborate a bit on that one because I was little bit surprised that I heard rumors that the ceramics market is suffering from the LVT. I thought the ceramics would be quite resilient through the entrance of LVT.","Jeff Lorberbaum","LVT has increased at a rate that's so high, that it's impacted the sales of every product category in the flooring industry. So they're all \u2013 they've all been lowered. And LVT is taking 100% of the flooring increase of the entire category. On our stores what we said was we've reduced the number of stores in markets where we had a number of stores and we could maintain the business with lower cost by redistributing the same business to fewer entities. And it's enabled us to reduce our SG&A costs.","Chris Wellborn","I would add that on the LVT so far it's been primarily as it relates to ceramic a U.S. phenomenon. And countries like Mexico, Brazil, Russia where labor is a lot less expensive, we haven't seen that.","Operator","And there are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Lorberbaum for any closing remarks.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you for joining us. We think we're in a good position for the future. And have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's earnings conference call.

Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Our third quarter earnings per share were $1.01 as reported or $1.04, excluding restructuring charges, reflecting an increase of 25% over 2011 adjusted earnings. Improvement in product mix, pricing, volume and productivity, as well as lower interest expense contributed to our results. Sales increased 2% as reported or 4% on a constant exchange rate.","During the period, we generated EBITDA of $179 million and free cash flow of $156 million. Both our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and net capital -- and net debt-to-capitalization ratios improved to 1.7x and 22%, respectively. Across the enterprise, we have managed to keep SG&A dollars in line with last year, even as we increased significantly more in new product innovation and marketing to improve our future sales and product mix.","After the quarter closed, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire Pergo, the most recognized brand of premium laminate flooring in both Europe and the United States for $150 million in cash. Pergo operates manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Sweden and has generated 2011 sales of approximately $320 million. In the U.S., the acquisition complements our strong Unilin specialty retail distribution with Pergo's strength in the DIY channel. In Europe, Pergo's most significant market position is in the Nordic region, which broadens our laminate distribution. In addition, Pergo will enhance other geographic positions and provide opportunities to augment Unilin's patent portfolio. The combination offers significant opportunity to optimize the assets of both companies, while expanding the product design and performance features of both brands.","Any indicators anticipate improving trends for our industry and business, both of which have lagged the overall economy. The U.S. commerce department reported that record low mortgage rates, increasing home prices and limited supply of existing homes have led to the fastest growth in new home construction and building permits in more than 4 years.","In October, we set affirmed plans to keep interest low through at least mid-2015. With existing home sales strong, Harvard's leading indicator of remodeling activity is predicting increased growth and renovation spending. The AIA's  Architecture Billings Index also moved higher, projecting additional commercial construction. Finally, the consumer confidence index also rose at the end of the quarter after an August dip.","Frank, could you give our financial report, please?","Frank H. Boykin","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Net sales for the quarter of $1.473 billion were 2% over last year or 4% on a constant-exchange-rate basis with both volume and price driving gross. Gross profit was $373 million or a margin of 25.3%. That's a 50 basis point improvement over last year, resulting from higher volume, productivity initiatives, pricing and mix. In addition, continuing product innovation, cost reduction and process improvements are driving better results. Our SG&A was $269 million or 18.2% of net sales. SG&A dollars were about flat with last year with our percent to net sales improving 30 basis points.","Emphasis across all businesses on cost control and lean activities are positively impacting us. We had restructuring charges in the quarter of $4 million, of which $3 million were incurred in the Mohawk segment and the remaining $1 million in the Unilin segment. These were incurred to align the business with the current economic conditions. About half, $2 million of those restructuring charges were cash.","Operating income, excluding charges, was $108 million or 7.3% of net sales. This represents a 15% growth in operating income dollars over last year. Interest expense was $18 million, down $7 million from last year. The improvement was due to second quarter payment we made this year of $336 million of the 7.2% bonds, as well as a rating agency upgrade that we improved early -- that we -- upgrade that was made earlier.","Other expense improved from last year due to the negative impact of foreign exchange that we incurred last year. Our income tax rate was 20% this year, that compares to an 11% tax rate that we have last year. We're expecting our fourth quarter tax rate to be in the high-teens.","Our earnings per share, excluding charges, was $1.04. This is up 25% over last year. We had this increase even with significant startup costs from capital projects that were installed during the year. For the full year, we're expecting start up cost of approximately $8 million.","Jumping to the segments. The Mohawk segment sales were $752 million, about flat with last year. We had improving mix and increasing prices, which offset lower volumes. Operating income, excluding charges, was $47 million or a margin of 6.2%. This is 180 basis point improvement over last year, driven by higher productivity and better mix in pricing.","In the Dal-Tile segment, sales were $418 million, a 9% improvement over last year or a 10% increase on a constant-exchange-rate basis. All categories across the business grew this quarter. Our U.S. residential, U.S. commercial and Mexican business were all up over last year. Operating income was $37 million, a margin of 9%. Improvement was from volume increases, which were slightly offset by startup costs and some plant volume adjustments.","In the Unilin segment, our sales were $329 million, up 9% on a constant-exchange-rate basis. We were favorably impacted by North American volume, Russian growth and the Australian acquisition, all of this offsetting slower Western European sales. Operating income, excluding charges, was $30 million with a margin of 9.1%. Foreign exchange was a drag on operating profit of $4 million. We also experienced raw material headwinds and a lower mix during the quarter. Our Corporate segment had an operating loss of $6 million, which was expected. For the full year, we're anticipating about a $25 million loss.","Moving to the balance sheet. Cash ended the quarter at $381 million. We continue to have strong cash flow this quarter with free cash flow of $156 million, improving our cash position and allowing us to continue to pay down debt. Receivables were $817 million, with a slightly higher DSO primarily from channel mix changes. Inventories ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, flat with last year, but with our days improving slightly. We're continuing to focus on improving our turns across all of the business.","Fixed assets ended the quarter at a $1.657 billion. This included capital expenditures in the third quarter of $47 million. We're projecting full year capital expenditures of $200 million and we're estimating depreciation and amortization for the full year of $290 million.","The Unilin amortization in the fourth quarter is expected to decline by $7 million and an additional $35 million next year as certain intangible assets become fully amortized. Long-term debt, including current portion was $1.525 billion. Our debt is down $86 million from last year. We continue to improve our leverage with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.7x. We anticipate using a portion of our bank availability and a portion of our European cash on hand to finance our Pergo acquisition.","Jeff, I'll hand it back over to you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Mohawk segment increased its adjusted operating income margin of 180 basis points, with sales remaining about flat compared to 2011. The gains stemmed from improved pricing and product mix, reduced cost of manufacturing and distribution, increased productivity. Our carpet sales performance was stronger on our specialty and contractor channels, both offset by the timing of product transitions to the home center channel. Our rug sales improved over the prior period though they still remained below last year as retail adjusted their strategies with consumer spending.","Carpet price increases implemented during the second quarter continue to benefit our results this quarter. We saw a continued improvement in mix from our industry-leading products, which have redefined the premium carpet market. We launched additional products to broaden our SmartStrand Silk collection and capitalized on the exceptional customer appeal of this innovation. To further expand the customer demand for silks, unsurpassed softness, high performance and proprietary environmental features, we initiated an ad campaign, along with a new retail marketing program. We also integrated a new SmartStrand premium cushion into merchandising our silk offering.","Complemented demand for SmartStrand Silk softness, we extended technology to create the next generation of supersoft nylon carpet we brand Wear-Dated Embrace, which is being launched as we speak. Going forward, Embrace will further improve our premium carpet offering for consumers seeking luxurious softness at a lower retail price point without the performance features of silk.","In our Mohawk branded hard services, the innovative technology and wood, ceramic, and laminate featured in our recent introductions, increased our sales growth during the period. To satisfy the expending builder multifamily channels, we've recently introduced targeted value products in laminate, porcelain and LVT. During the quarter, we announced price increases to cover the cost inflation in our ceramic and solid wood products.","In the commercial category, we also adapted SmartStrand superior stain resistant, an excellent performance with the new broadloom and tile products. We also introduced our new State of the Mind collection, which is made of our exclusive Duracolor technology that redefines premium modular tile by providing stylish products with the ultimate performance at affordable price points.","Our nonspecified commercial sales continue expanding with the introduction of new refined products, combined appealing design and durability, the addition of more specialized sales representatives, expanding customer base. Across this segment, we improved our manufacturing, distribution efficiencies, realized productivity gains from our capital investments and reduced our waste levels.","During the period, we completed the closure of a yarn plant and integrated the production into an existing extrusion facility, which enhanced our cost structure. Our new customer relationship management tool is increasing our professional approach of our sales personnel, while improving our sales force productivity, increasing customer opportunity and enhancing commercial project management.","Dal-Tile sales grew 9% during the quarter or 10% on a constant exchange rate. This segment improved sales in both the residential and commercial categories and continued significant growth in the Mexican market. Margins were enhanced from actions that improve productivity and increased yields. During the period, we announced a 2% to 4% price increase for most products to recover the inflation in our material and distribution cost. Sales grew across all residential channels supported by our new Reveal Imaging designs, fashionable mosaic tiles and larger format tiles. We're leveraging Dal-Tile's traditional strength in the builder channel across all our business segments to expand commitments with regional builders. We've introduced specific value-engineered products to gain position in the growing multifamily category, improving our product management, our introductions are achieving a higher level of success and our SKU productivity is rising.","Commercial sales increased during the period with restaurant, retail and hospitality sectors leading the growth. We're aggressively pursuing high-volume remodeling projects in shopping malls and national restaurant chains that were deferred during the previous years. To improve our position in the premium commercial category, we're targeting architects and designers with a new sophisticated collection we call Next, which features contemporary designs, expansive color lines and unique textures.","In our American Olean, we've added commercial specification representatives, as well as upgrading some of our distribution partners in key markets. In Mexico, our new Salamanca plant is successfully ramping up and supplying product to satisfy our growing ceramic position. This year, the plant will begin to export its products to the U.S. The ramp-up is progressing faster than we anticipated and creating some temporary plant adjustments. Salamanca continued to incur startup cost at decreasing levels as we move closer to achieving our anticipated cost structure. As a result of our leading design, comprehensive portfolio and local manufacturing, our sales continue to significantly outpace the Mexican ceramic market, which we estimate is growing about 5% this year. By consistently delivering style, quality and value, we're expanding our retail customer base, securing large construction projects and positioning ourselves as a key participant in the Mexican market.","During the quarter, Dal-Tile lowered manufacturing cost to improve material formulations, higher yields and lower waste. Our ongoing quality initiatives have reduced cost and lowered customer deductions. To align production with consumer preferences, we announced the closing of our Olean New York facility, consolidation of our unglazed Mosaic production. We reduced our freight expense through improved efficiencies, consolidated shipments and energy surcharges.","Unilin's third quarter sales were approximately flat as reported, but grew 9% on a local basis. Gain from sales increases in Russia and the U.S., insulation board growth, and home center channel expansion compensated for the soft environment in Western Europe. Our margins were impacted by raw material inflation. Customers trading down and a higher participation in the DIY channel. We implemented cost reductions, including enhanced operational efficiencies, increased recycled content, improved raw material yield and continued improvement in administrative expenses.","Outside North America, laminate and wood flooring sales grew from continued expansion into the DIY channel, increased distribution in Russia and our Australian acquisition. To capitalize on growing European categories, we're introducing a premium LVT plank that features our Uniclic technology for easy installation. Our Russian laminate facility increases production and implemented productivity improvements that reduced our costs.","During the quarter, we increased sales on Russia by expanding our customer base and broadening our commitments to existing customers. In Australia, favorable product mix, as well as increasing sales of Unilin produced products, yielded margin improvements.","In North America, we grew our laminate and wood products through all customer channels during the quarter. New product introductions increased home center penetration and gains within the builder channel and promotional activity, increased our sales. In our wood category, manufacturing improvements offset a lower product mix, introduced new higher value wood products with fashionable soft scrape surfaces and rich finishes. In the fourth quarter, we announced a 6% price increase for our solid wood flooring. Declining new construction in Benelux and France created headwinds for our roofing panels. To reduce costs in this category, we're consolidating our brand and sales forces, as well as executing process improvements.","By helping meet European energy goals, our insulation panels delivered strong sales increases. We completed the expansion at our Belgian insulation panel facility, we began construction of a second plant in France to satisfy our growing demand.","In July, Quick-Step was voted #1 in laminate in a survey of North American retailers. In August, both Colombia Wood and Quick-Step laminate were given Manufacturer of the Year Award at another retail sponsored ceremony.","Mohawk's third quarter results reflect our strength in delivering innovative products, driving operational excellence and entering new geographic markets. We continue to invest strategically by introducing differentiated products, lowering our manufacturing administrative costs and acquiring new companies that will enhance our results. We've taken the necessary steps to align our pricing with our raw material inflation and we'll react as required.","In the U.S., increasing new home construction and improved sales of existing homes provides a positive outlook for future flooring growth. In Europe, soft market conditions due to economic uncertainty and changes in exchange rates are anticipated to be a headwind. Based on these factors, our guidance for the fourth quarter is $0.89 to $0.98 per share, excluding any restructuring costs. Mohawk's strong financial position allowed us to enter an agreement to acquire Pergo, which will benefit our worldwide laminate business. We are well positioned to invest in other opportunities as they arise.","We continue to execute our long-term strategy of product innovation, cost reduction, asset maximization and geographic expansion. Each of our businesses is well situated to benefit from the improvements in the U.S. remodeling and construction category which remain substantially below their peak levels. Our organization is focused on bringing value to our customers, while maximizing our results.","With that, we'll be glad to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Frank, I was glad you hear you talk about that amortization. We've been looking for that for a while. My first question, I did want to talk about Unilin and Pergo. I guess, specifically I wanted to see if you could give a little more clarity around the -- what kind of accretion we might see or perhaps coming at it from a perspective of what multiples you may have paid on an EBITDA basis or an EBIT basis would be helpful.","Frank H. Boykin","The price was somewhere around 6x EBITDA, but they were depressed earnings level. We expect to improve their results with synergies that we expect to have across the whole businesses. The Pergo business is complementary to our business because we're both going after the mid- to high-end of the premium market of laminate, both in the U.S., as well as in Europe. The sales distribution is incremental to ours, a combination of the design and performance features that both businesses have, we expect to enhance our product portfolio. We see significant potential during the near-term to optimize the manufacturing, both in the U.S., as well as Europe. And then there's also additional opportunity to leverage some of their patents and our licensing knowledge, so we think it's good for the company long term.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's great. That's good color. The second question I wanted to ask you about relates to your Mohawk division, specifically, in the U.S., you were referring to the home center channel having some transition and some timing issues related to product transitions. Could you be a little more specific there? And help us understand what sort of happened in the quarter. And when you say timing like that, it makes one think that perhaps you might see a rebound in the fourth quarter to sort of make up what was lost in this quarter. Is that the right way that we should be thinking about that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","What happened was that we have products that were dropped before the new product introductions went in leaving a void. We have commitments in the channel for new products. It will go in between the fourth and first quarters, so we're confident that we'll be back where we want to be next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Just on the Pergo, what was there? Can you be specific with respect to synergy expectations?","Frank H. Boykin","We've just recently signed the documents and the agreement. We have meetings going on and it's going to be a while before we have details of all the changes. We have a long list of opportunities relating to the things that I talked about before. But some of it's got to do with the 2 brands and how we manage the brands in the marketplace. We think that there's going to be -- both companies are driven by innovation, and we think that both combined are stronger than they were before. The plants are very similar. We think that we have some knowledge that can help them and they help us. On the other hand, they have been starved for capital for a while and we see that as being helpful to both. We believe there's ways of optimizing the plant utilizations between both plants and use the plants to manufacture different brands. It also helps vertically integrate Pergo and we think there's opportunities to improve the administrative functions. We're not going to do all this on day one, though.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. You're still waiting to get your arms around sort of the quantifications of the synergies?","Frank H. Boykin","David, we still expect it to be slightly accretive in the first year. You're going to start to move through some of those synergies.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Jeff, you've made a lot of progress in terms of penetrating the home center channel in North America with your laminate product and I'm just wondering if there's cannibalization concerns here?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Well, the Pergo products in the home center channel are in a branded category. They're separate from the rest. We see there's opportunity to do it. Again, though, the market share will go up so it could limit the long-term growth potential because we can't take it from Pergo anymore.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And just last question. The Russian ramp in your Unilin business and the Australia acquisition, can you quantify just what that would have contributed to segment revenues in the quarter?","Frank H. Boykin","We haven't broken out that level of detail, David.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Is the Russian ramp, is that still kind of a $100 million revenue potential business?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","That's about the capacity of the plant. There's no import to support it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","What are you doing in terms of the introduction of Embrace there? I think SmartStrand has been great in terms of the higher price point in carpet and helping the margins also getting away from commodities. When you think about Embrace, how much room do you think there is in sort of the higher price point market in carpet and how deep that segment is for the customer there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think that what we've started with, the beginning of the year with what we called silk. We have changed the premium part of the market place. What's going on at retail is that softness is becoming the rationale for buying higher valued products. And my expectations would be that by a year or so from now, a majority of the premium products the marketplace will have that. By us leading with silk with higher -- it has more features to help the customer and we've come back with Embrace, which we're going to retail at a price point slightly under it with less features, we think that we're positioned to maximize our part of the marketplace. And in both cases, we believe we have -- we're leading the entrance of the products, which is a good place to be. The market is still going to change rapidly.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm just wondering how much of your -- of the carpet sales do you see that segment going, that portion of the carpet sales going to?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I don't have the number off the top of my head. We have estimates. I mean, we believe is the whole high end part of the market, I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head with all the different product categories we have. But I mean, our expectations are that the entire premium marketplace will end up there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question on the Mohawk segment. Obviously, this year and the last couple of quarters specifically from a margin standpoint, you've been able to show some nice improvement. Just trying to get a sense on a year-over-year basis, how much of the improvement year-over-year. I mean, you kind of broke out, for example, this quarter, mix in price kind of offset volume. Out of 180 basis points, is the mix in price roughly equal positive contributors? And how do you see that flowing through on any type of incremental basis over the next year?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think most of the pricing, there was pricing in it, but most of the pricing was to cover material inflation is it. So the majority of the improvement in margin came from productivity increases, mix changes in the marketplace, improvements in operations.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And going forward, I mean, that mix, would you think that you could get another 50 or 100 bps lift into '13?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Our goal is to keep raising the margins going forward and to keep improving it. We're not satisfied the margins in the segment. We think that through mix and continued productivity, we can keep improving it.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And also on the product transition in home centers in Mohawk, I believe you said, Jeff, that you expect some of it to come back in 4Q and some in the first quarter as well. But can you just give us a sense of, on a revenue, on a dollars basis, what impact that was to sales growth in 3Q?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We don't break it down to that detail level but it did impact the business and we expect to be back in line or better with the industry. We think that all of things that we're doing in the high-end part of marketplace, in pushing products there -- across the business, we think, we've improved the execution of our sales force and we think the business and the economy is going to help us a little bit. I think we're well positioned.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","On the tile side, obviously, Salamanca came up faster than expected. I think there was a couple of different issues you talked about there, kind of startup, as well as the fact because it came on, it kind of impacted inventory. Could you be -- just to be clear, reframe how much that was of getting on the startup cost, as well as the inventory. And if it was just a 3Q event or if it's also going to carry into 4Q?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Let me start with the inventory thing. The inventory, what happened is we go into the period and we estimate the sales and that we align the production to meet the sales of that period. And what happened is what we estimated Salamanca to produce, we were able to achieve it coming up faster so we've made some adjustments in the inventory to make up for those. And so there were some shut down costs related to that. Frank, give them some numbers.","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, the startup costs were about $2 million in the quarter. They won't be that large in the fourth quarter, but there will be a little bit more in the fourth quarter.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And now is that $2 million start up, that's, obviously in the reported EBIT and then was there an associated -- is that also including the inventory impact?","Frank H. Boykin","No, no. The inventory -- the impact of the -- of shutting down production to get inventories in line was above that.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Above that?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Will that carry into 4Q?","Frank H. Boykin","No, I don't think so.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Again, very nice -- Pergo, what a nice fit for you guys. Considering the margin mix you're seeing in carpets, an area which -- very good industry structure there for the industry, how large, given your product innovation, a, how large is that kind of that high-end of the market if you want to think about in terms of what volume and dollars, I would appreciate that or percentage of volume, a. And then b, what you're doing with silk because you learned how to manage the Triexta material. How do you think about that in terms of sustainability versus just being more commoditized over time?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The first question was?","Frank H. Boykin","How much of the market is high end in the carpet.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The high end in Pergo...","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Not Pergo, I'm sorry, in carpets, carpets.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","In carpets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes, yes. That's where you're, obviously, getting good mix out of.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Well, listen, we have so many different product categories in markets. I don't remember all the numbers. If you'll call Frank, he'll get you an estimate of the percentage of the business. But we believe that the long-term piece is that these will become fundamental parts of the marketplace, that silk will be the premium end and that the Embrace products will be here. We're leading the market, we're getting to market faster than the rest so we think we'll be able to improve our positions. Over time, the industry is going to move there as fast as it can and then the softness that's been going over the last 3 or 4 years, getting softer and softer, so this is the next step in it. We think the industry will try to catch up with other alternatives over the next year. We think it's sustainable. There will be more competition in the marketplace a year from now than there is today.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Could you comment on are there -- first of all, any capacity constraint issues relating to SmartStrand or silk? And then some thoughts, if you have any, towards the SG&A component as we move into 2013, do you anticipate it going up, going up less than sales? Any color on that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Constraints, we don't see any constraints on raw materials. We continue to add extrusion capacity in to support the business. During the downturn, significant parts of the industry changed raw material types which it used for the excess capacity the industry had and we had in [indiscernible], as well as well in polypropylene. There is limited excess capacity in the industry going forward because we obsoleted it so much of it during the downturn. And due to consumer preferences changing, the valuations of different products.","Frank H. Boykin","On the SG&A, John, this year, as we've said, when we get to the end of the year, we expect the full year to be, in dollars, flat with where we were a year ago. Going into next year, depending on what you use as your estimate for sales, I mean, it's not going to go up at the same rate of sales. But it would be hard to keep it flat, if you assume some improvement in the top line next year. And we said though, as you know, we are laser focused on reducing SG&A. We got lean initiatives across the organization. We've got every function looking at the different activities and how they can improve the activities and reduce cost. So we'll continue to be focused on it but there probably would be some increases as we go into next year with sales going up.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","This year, you're not seeing all the activity that actually happen. The inflation in our SG&A, which occurs from -- on downtown, we have 200-and-something warehouses that typically go up, a few presenting all the personnel pieces. We have absorbed those and then we increased significantly the amount of new product introductions at all our different divisions. And so we took the cost down and supplemented them with what we believe are investments in new areas which are going to help the long term.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just quickly on Pergo, could you comment at all whether there's any sales trend there up or down going into this merger and maybe FX adjusted? And then also on your Western European business, which is, obviously, down year-over-year, is there a light at the end of the tunnel or a slowing of the rate of decline year-over-year for your Western European revenue?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The Pergo business has been -- the trend lines that  are less than positive, they've been taking actions to improve the profitability of the business and change the mix of the products. So they have improved some of the margins over the time, they're still not where they need to be. In Western Europe, if you just segment out our historical business and take out all the new actions, I would guess that Western Europe is probably down about 10%, if you take it on an apples-to-apples basis in the different product categories and pieces in all the positive initiatives out of it, we don't see any trends that are going to change it tomorrow.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","The compares don't get easier at some point?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I mean, if it quits declining, it will get easier.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to understand new residential construction keeps going at a pretty good clip. I wanted to just get a ballpark idea of how much better Mohawk would do on the carpet side of things if new starts go to $900,000 in 2013.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","If you assume that they're about $750,000 this year, that's about a 15% increase in that category, it makes up about 20% of the Mohawk business, maybe a little less now, I don't know. Could be less than that now with where it went to. So there's growth in it. The big opportunity is in consumer confidence, and housing prices reaching a point where people start remodeling the pieces in addition to that. The remodeling side really hasn't done what we had anticipated. We still believe that people want to live in nice places and as they get more confident about the prices of home stabilizing, we expect improvement in the remodeling piece, too.","Frank H. Boykin","And we think there's a good bit of pent-up demand on the remodeling side. If you look at the carpet industry, it's been down for 5 or 6 years and people just haven't been replacing carpets. As Jeff said, once the economy starts to show some improvement, consumers become more confident and start spending again, we should see a nice impact from that.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","What's happening in this time also is the Dal-Tile segment has a much higher portion in new construction. And so the positive move of it impact the Dal-Tile segment much more than the carpet segment and I think 40% of their residential business, I believe, is in construction.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. So you have a mixed biased towards -- on Dal-Tile specifically, you guys had a very strong quarter saleswise. Given current trends, repair and remodel spending is a bit softness as you noted, what do you think is driving that big move up? Is just the fact that you're gaining steam in Mexico and you have momentum there? Or what's the core driver of the better performance there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Well, part of it as we just talked about, they have a larger part of the new construction business. The new construction business is up about the same 15% we're talking about next year. We have a broad product offering, a differentiated product line. We have the distribution strength in the marketplace that combined with -- we have the technology and design over the last few years has moved to new digital printing that we lead the industry in what we call Reveal technology in style and design technology taking benefit of those things. And so the combination of all those things are improving our U.S. business. The Mexican business is growing rapidly but from a small base. So it can't impact the business as much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","First question, just around the hardwood business, I think you mentioned that product mix was a drag in the quarter. Can you just talk big picture about what you're seeing in price and mix and maybe separate those 2 within the industry and just talk about the drivers there as far as what's causing that both on the quarter and how you think about that playing out as residential construction recovers?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The wood business is highly impacted by the new construction business. A lot of the things we're talking about new construction, remember that the flooring is one of the last things to go in new home constructions. So what happened through the year in starts, we put in, in the last month of the building process. So it's still flowing in. We think that wood segment will be positively impacted by it because they're so -- such a -- wood has the highest percentage in new home construction than any of the other product categories. There is some of changes -- the raw material side of the wood business as it picks up, a huge part of the infrastructure to cut the trees down and cut them up was taken out during this downturn. So as its picked up, there's pressure on pricing. And so the solid wood side, which has the most -- the largest use of the wood per square-foot there's pressure on it, which is why we've announced a price increase to cover the prices in it as we go forward.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So looking back, realizing you have a price increase announced and coming, have you seen price pressure in the business within the builder channel or is it just the mix between builder and remodel that's driving that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","There's pricing pressure in all marketplaces today with the industry still at lower levels, we're not past the pricing pressure, if anything. The builder side of it, given the pressure on the building prices, they're trying to buy more moderately priced products. In our business, we're trying to keep improving the cost structures of what we have. If we can get a little more volume through the place, we'll do quite well.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. Frank, as we fold in Pergo next year, can you just give us a little bit more detail on what the D&A will look like once that closed? And then maybe just clarify the revenue side. Is the $320 million a good number to assume for 2012 or is that lower year-over-year?","Frank H. Boykin","Well, on the D&A said, we're not prepared. We're still kind of going through that process of assigning the values in purchase accounting, so I'm not prepared to give you a number on that yet. And on the revenue side, think we said there about $320 million and they've had some headwinds here over the last 9 months or so. So it's probably going to be down at least initially a little bit from that.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then just one last one. Within the carpet, I think the last couple of quarters,  there's just been some issues with both mass merchants and home centers this quarter. If you excluded those customers, what would volumes look like year-over-year within the carpet segment just roughly?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Sorry, I'm not sure what you want to...","Frank H. Boykin","I think your question is if we excluded rug business, what would the volumes look like, is that it?","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Well, but then you also have the home center business this quarter. I guess, if you just exclude the mass merchants and home centers in total, what would volumes look like?","Frank H. Boykin","Well, I mean, if you exclude the 2 pieces, those 2 pieces, the balance of the business would have been up by -- several percent higher than the average of the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Specific to pricing, I know you're talking about wood and ceramic price increases having gone through, are you seeing input cost pressures on the carpet side? I think Honeywell mentioned raising prices on caprolactam and nylon 6. I was wondering whether that was becoming more pervasive to the point where you'd require some pricing increases there incrementally?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think we're a little early in the point. So far, the material costs haven't changed significantly. There are signs of potential cost pressures. But we're not sure what will happen at this point. Our raw materials are influenced by the chemical supply and demand, as well as oil prices and we're watching it. At this point, we haven't announced anything. Depending upon what happens, we'll adjust if necessary.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And my last question. Frank, I think you were answering a prior question regarding Dal-Tile and the impact of the Mexican business being small because it's coming from a small base. Could then we assume then that the U.S. growth in Dal-Tile roughly approximates the 9% growth that you saw in this segment?","Frank H. Boykin","A little less, but not...","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Not appreciably less?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A bigger picture, can you guys discuss -- has your appetite to do some acquisitions outside of flooring changed at all, especially as we start to see housing and maybe some general economic improvement coming through?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Our primary focus on acquisitions are things within the categories that we know that we can get leverage from either knowledge, geography, the businesses, putting them together. On the other hand, in the right set of circumstances, we wouldn't rule out something else but the majority of our focus is leveraging the businesses we're in.","Frank H. Boykin","And we think there's a good many opportunities for us to stay focused on flooring.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then as you sort of look out geographically, you've made a lot of progress over the last few years. Clearly, Russia and Mexico and now Pergo gets you sort of into a different part of Europe somewhat, too. Can you talk about maybe where else can you sort of take your product next and what lies ahead for that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","As you would expect, the places we look at, primarily are the ones that are growing higher. So if you go around the world, you have Eastern Europe, you have Russia, China, Australia, Brazil and then India is a little difficult for people to figure out. But we would have interest under the right set of circumstances. It doesn't mean we won't look at other places either. I think Mexico is surprising, how it sort of separated itself from the U.S. and I think Mexico has a lot of potential in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Question on the insulated panel business and Europe. You made some comments, good and bad, in the press release. Is that business up in the quarter and is it up for the year?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","There may be a little confusion. In what we call our insulation piece, sometimes -- we have a roofing business, which are insulated roofing panels and that goes into new construction remodeling went down under pressure and it's mostly a regional business in the Benelux area. We then started about 3 years ago with a new business that we called -- with a product we called insulation boards. And those insulation boards are used to help meet European energy expectations. That industry is growing double digits and we basically started with no business and with similar technologies that we have and we built a nice niche business. The plant that we built has about $100 million worth of capacity in it. We expanded it to that. Lately, we're running it and so now we're looking for the next step, which is broadening. We have to put up more capacity. We have started building a site in France. We are presently selling into that area from where we are, and we expect it to be up and running the end of next year.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So I assume the new product you discussed is still a lot smaller than that roofing business, correct?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Yes.","David J. Manger - AMI Investment Management, Inc.","Okay. And as you look forward in that businesses is that share gain, specifically in the new business, is that going to continue or is there a limit you're going to reach here near-term?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","It depends on what happens. We believe that the industry is somewhere around $1 billion.","Frank H. Boykin","EUR 1 billion.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","EUR 1 billion. That's growing 10% or more. So we think there's a significant opportunity in it. At the other side, we're not the only competitor in it, there are other people are trying to grow at the same time.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","If we exclude those 2 businesses out with the Unilin segment numbers on constant currency, would they be higher than what you reported?","Frank H. Boykin","North America is  up. If you excluded those 2, trying to do the math here in my head, yes, the Unilin total, total Unilin business would be higher.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Research","This is Adam for Mike. Just a quick question in Unilin. How much room do you guys have left in the DIY expansion? And when do you start anniversary-ing this, if that's kind of the way to look at it?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We talk about it like it's one thing. But what happens is you have DIY, which is called home centers in the U.S. and there's DIY in Europe, which is smaller, more regional businesses, and we actually have different approaches in both continents. In the U.S., if you go back 2 or 3 years, we had, I think, probably close to 0 being sold as laminate through the home centers and the home center channel controls somewhere around 50% of that category of product. But we started building the business in it. The Pergo acquisition, which is good for us, is that their primary sales are through those channels and so it complements where we were going, just gets us there faster. In the European side of the business, we have a different approach where we are putting together -- we are adding to most of them a premium branded segment on top of it but we're doing it with limited distribution strategy so it fits us and them and gives them a differentiated feature and 2 different strategies, both of which have been working so far.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","I was just wondering in the Unilin segment, with a growth of 9%, ex currency, what's the sustainability of the benefits in Russia, in the U.S., in Australia offsetting the weaker euro?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, the Australian acquisition, we're anniversary-ing this quarter so we won't see the same kind of benefit next quarter, next year as we had in the past for that. And the others, Russia continues to grow. We continue to take market share. Insulation continues to grow, so we should see continued help from both of those as we move forward, as well as DIY growth.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","And then we've said before that the Western European businesses are down around 10%, give or take. And we don't know if it's bottomed out or it will keep going down and work more.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Lorberbaum for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you very much for joining us. Have a nice day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14988":["Mohawk Industries, Inc.

Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Ken. Our fourth quarter adjusted results were as we expected with sales flat to last year, operating income of $205 million or 8.4% of sales and EPS of $2.25. For the year, our sales were $10 billion, adjusted operating income was $938 million or 9.4% of sales and EPS was $10.04. Our cash generation remained strong with operating and free cash flow for the quarter of about $440 million and $300 million.","For the year, operating and free cash flow were about $1.4 billion and $870 million. Our leverage is approaching historical lows, which provides us the flexibility to pursue additional opportunities. In the period, we bought back approximately $23 million of stock for a total of $375 million since authorized.","We anticipated our business -- as we anticipated, our business remained challenged by soft demand, greater competition and reduced production volume. In the US markets continued to be influenced by the strong dollar and the impact of LVT on other product categories. Consumer confidence remained high and lower US interest rates are positively influencing new and existing home sales. US tariffs on clickable LVT from China were ascended in the fourth quarter and market pricing has declined for these products.","Imports of ceramic tile from China dropped off substantially in the fourth quarter and shipments from other countries have not offset, which we believe is due to soft demand and a reduction in US ceramic inventories.","Competition has increased in our global markets impacting our pricing and mix as we leverage higher investments in sales and marketing to drive growth. Many countries where we operate are stimulating their economies with lower interest rates to encourage greater consumer spending and economic growth this year.","In the near term we still anticipate continued pressure in our markets and product categories. Throughout the period we implemented changes to increase sales and reduce costs. We've enhanced our LVT manufacturing in the US and Europe and realigned our US carpet operations. We have decreased our ceramic production and inventories and are taking out a wood flooring plant in the United States and in Europe.","We are reducing the complexity of our operations, improving processes to reduce costs and increasing automation to improve efficiencies. We continue to improve the productivity and volume of our new LVT, US countertop, Russian sheet vinyl and European carpet tile investments.","Our acquisitions in Australian and Brazil are installing state-of-the-art equipment that will expand their product portfolios. We are introducing new design and performance innovations to enhance our market position and broaden our customer base. To promote both new and existing products we're making higher levels of sales and marketing investments.","For a review of our financial performance during the period, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn Landau","Thank you, Jeff and good morning, everyone. Moving right into our financial performance and year-over-year bridges, as Jeff shared in the fourth quarter, total Company net sales were $2.4 billion, down 1% compared to prior year as reported and off approximately 2% on a constant basis, which we define as adjusted for FX and days.","For the full year 2019, total Company net sales were flat compared to 2018, as reported and up 2% on a constant basis. Organic growth in the legacy businesses was down 3% in the fourth quarter versus prior year on a constant basis and down 2% for the full year compared to 2018, also on a constant basis.","In terms of earnings, the Company's adjusted operating income was $205 million in the fourth quarter, or 8.4% off 140 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year, largely due to weaker volume and price mix, only partially offset by improved productivity including lower start-up costs. With that said, the Company's year-over-year decline in margins improved on a sequential basis by 100 basis points, which now represents four consecutive quarters of improvement.","Bridging from the prior-year fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings were impacted by number one lower overall volume of $10 million, largely in our Global Ceramic and Flooring North America segments and associated market-related downtime costs of $4 million, all taken in Global Ceramics to match our supply with our demand.","Number two, a modest increase in inflation of $3 million due to higher wages and benefits, partially offset by lower raw materials. Number three an erosion of price-mix of $24 million, largely in our Flooring Rest of the World segment following easing input costs, and $11 million higher spending in SG&A and other due to investments in sales talent and marketing to drive sales.","Moving to the positive offset, productivity including lower start-up costs, swung positive by $16 million versus last year, due to better utilization and non-repeating one-time items. For the full year adjusted operating income was $938 million or 9.4% of sales, off 250 basis points from prior year.","Staying at the enterprise level, adjusted SG&A per net sales was 19.1% in the quarter, excluding unusual items, up 180 basis points year-over-year due to higher sales, marketing and merchandising expenses to roll out new products and to grow in new markets. Inflation, acquisition, lower volume and one-time charges also impacted the quarter.","For the full year adjusted SG&A was 18.4% of sales, up 100 basis points year-over-year. And just to be clear, relative to the rollback of tariffs on clickable LVT product from China, prior to tariffs we had already raised inventory significantly and have since reduced purchases in 2019 as we reduced inventory and ramped up our US production. We also have purchased from other countries in this period. So the total gross rebate amounted to $13.5 million, which is in our guidance, spread over three quarters and largely offset by inventory value on hand.","Special and unusual items in the fourth quarter consisted of a $50 million charge for restructuring and integration costs of which most was non-cash and divided relatively evenly among completing US carpet realignment and rightsizing the Company's wood manufacturing footprints in Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the World as well as a $136 million one-time tax benefit associated with the consolidation of business activities in Europe within a single operating entity to improve management and increase efficiencies, also reducing the Company's tax rate somewhat in 2019.","For the full year, total restructuring and integration charges taken for actions in Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the World were $111 million, of which approximately $41 million was cash. And as we have said, the cash cost associated with carpet restructuring of approximately $30 million will be recovered as operational savings as lower cost pass-through inventory in the first half of this year reaching full run rate in the third quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA was $363 million or 15% before interest expense of $11 million. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion or 15.3%. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 18.9% in the fourth quarter and 20.6% for the full year of '19.","Finally adjusted net earnings per share was $2.25 in the quarter, down from $2.53 or 11% versus last year. And for the full year, adjusted net earnings per share was $10.04, down from $12.33 versus 2018.","Now let me turn to the segments and I'm only going to speak to the fourth quarter here. The Global Ceramic segment delivered net sales of $858 million, flat versus prior year as reported, or a decrease of 1.5% on a constant basis. Looking at -- only at our legacy businesses, sales decreased approximately 4% on a constant basis.","Operating income on an adjusted basis was $54 million, or 6.3% of net sales, down from a 10.1% margin last year, primarily due to increased competition and weaker demand in the US, coupled with higher inflation. So compared to last year at the segment level inflation was $16 million higher, driven by higher wages and materials and benefits, volume was off $14 million inclusive of $4 million of downtime, sales, marketing and other costs were up $5 million, price mix slipped $4 million and this was all partially offset by improved productivity and lower start-up costs of $6 million. FX in the quarter was neutral.","Let's move to Flooring North America. The business showed better overall performance with sales of $936 million, down 4% versus last year as reported and down 5% on a constant basis as continued weakness in soft surfaces were partially offset by continued growth in LVT. Operating income on an adjusted basis was $69 million, or 7.4% of net sales in the fourth quarter.","Bridging from last year, volume was down $17 million versus last year and accounted for the majority of the deficit. Price mix lagged prior year by approximately $6 million. Raw material cost decreases offset increases in wages and benefits, keeping inflation flat and productivity less reduced start-up costs was bettered by $6 million.","Moving to Flooring Rest of the World, the segment had a solid quarter with sales of $630 million, up 2.6% versus last year as reported and 3.7% on a constant basis. Looking just at the legacy business, sales were up 1.5% on a constant basis.","Adjusted operating income came in at $89 million, or 14.2% of sales in the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points versus last year in a very competitive environment, mainly as a result of increased volume. Going to the bridge, volume was better by $18 million, price mix lift by $15 million, but was largely offset by relief in overall inflation of $11 million, driven by lower input costs.","Productivity including lower start-up costs was $3 million. And investments in sales, product marketing and other were $6 million higher in the quarter. FX was again neutral for the quarter. Finally, at the corporate level, expenses and eliminations drove an operating loss of $8 million with a full-year cost of $40 million.","Speaking now to the balance sheet, receivables ended the quarter at $1.5 billion with days sales outstanding up due to changes in geographic and channel mix. Inventories ended the quarter at approximately $2.3 billion, or 134 days, higher in days versus prior year by approximately six days, but relatively flat in dollars as we continued to adjust our production to match our sales.","Fixed assets for the quarter ended at $4.7 billion and capital expenditures of $140 million in the period, lower than depreciation and amortization, which was $154 million. So for the full year, CapEx was at $545 million lower than our D&A of $576 million as we efficiently managed our Q4 project spend in each of our segments.","Total debt was $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter down approximately $200 million versus the third quarter with leverage declining to 1.6 times debt to adjusted EBITDA. Wrapping up the balance sheet is strong and getting stronger with free cash flow of $300 million in the quarter totaling $873 million in 2019 capping off a very solid year at overall cash generation.","So with that, Chris, I'll turn it over to you.","Chris Wellborn","Thanks, Glenn. In our Global Ceramic segment, most of our markets faced a combination of soft demand and excess industry capacity that is compressing market prices and margins. During the quarter, our US ceramic business remained under pressure from LVT taking share and high industry inventories from ceramic purchases ahead of tariffs. Additionally, to align our own inventory levels, we meaningfully reduced production in our North American ceramic plants, which increased our cost.","We have started to see some trends that should benefit our business in 2020. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, total US ceramic imports declined 17% with Chinese ceramic imports falling 90%. Lower interest rates and improving new and existing home sales should also benefit the market this year.","To improve our sales, we are rolling out multiple new products and adding sales representatives and design consultants in major markets. Our new collections aimed at replacing imports are gaining momentum. To increase productivity and reduce cost for our customers, we have streamlined ordering processes and made picking up orders at our service centers faster and easier. We continue to enhance our showrooms and galleries to better communicate the beauty and performance of our ceramic products.","During the fourth quarter, we initiated manufacturing of our new click tile in multiple sizes and designs. A proprietary product has been tested in both residential and commercial applications and has received positive reviews for faster and less expensive installation that is able to be walked on the same day. We are launching click tile at our trade show this quarter and have already received commitments from major customers.","We are expanding our mosaic and wall tile offerings to meet growing demand for these categories. Our quartz countertop sales continued to increase as we ramp up the productivity and throughput at our new Tennessee plant. We are developing more sophisticated visuals to enhance our manufactured quartz collections and improve our margins.","Sales of our large porcelain slabs from Europe are growing and we are increasing the sales of Dal-Tile branded LVT products. In Mexico, the economy continued to face headwinds due to uncertainty around the US trade with the overall construction activity declining in the fourth quarter.","We are gaining share by expanding our brands, distribution and product offerings with larger sizes, porcelain products and more comprehensive wall tile collection. We are increasing our participation in the commercial markets and enlarging our base of stores that exclusively sell our products.","Despite a soft economy in Brazil, we had good sales growth during the period due to our strong brand and product offering. In December, we initiated production on a new porcelain tile line that produces larger sizes to expand our premium offering. To increase our sales in other South American countries, we are updating our showrooms and expanding distribution.","The Southern European economies remained slow impacting our primary ceramic markets and industry pricing. In this environment, we increased our volume even as lagging consumer confidence reduced demand in the larger retail remodeling channel. We are expanding our activities in the commercial channels as well as outdoor products. To extend our style leadership, we are introducing new premium products with the surface structures aligned with the printed design to create more realistic visuals. Our medium priced products have enhanced our results with new sizes and visuals.","Sales of our porcelain slabs grew dramatically from a small base during 2019 with the products gaining greater utilization in traditional areas as well as for countertops. We are increasing our inventories at our regional warehouses in Poland, Greece and Romania to expand our customer base with faster local service. We continue to specialize our plants by product type to optimize our cost and improve our competitive position.","In Russia, we grew our ceramic sales in a soft market. Our growth was driven by our unique business model that includes the industry's most comprehensive premium offering, a national distribution network, owned and franchise retail stores and the strongest project specification organization in the industry.","To further strengthen our position in 2020, we expect to expand the stores that exclusively sell our products to more than 400 locations across the country. To support our growth, we are starting up additional porcelain production to make super large sizes and a new plant to produce coordinated premium sanitary ware.","In our Flooring North America segment, we have executed many initiatives to align the business with the present market conditions. We faced a challenging market with LVT growth continuing to impact sales of other product categories. As expected, our pricing and mix remained under pressure as customers traded down and lower production levels raised the cost. Lower raw material costs during the period were offset by a more competitive environment.","We streamlined our infrastructure by closing three plants, consolidating high cost operations and reducing wood manufacturing. The effects of these actions will increase and flow through the inventory with full cost benefit in the third period.","To reduce costs, we have implemented numerous process improvements, executed machine modifications and increased our recycled polyester production. We are leveraging automation and equipment advances to produce comparable volumes with the smaller manufacturing footprint.","In the period, our residential carpet sales performed best in the new home construction and multifamily channels. Our new carpet introductions were well received at the national flooring trade show and they will be in the marketplace early 2020. We are leveraging our strengths in design and fiber technology to deliver differentiated new collections in both premium and value categories.","In the luxury and super soft categories, we have extended our multi-color and pattern capabilities in our proprietary SmartStrand Silk collections. ColorMax, Mohawk's exclusive color blending technology is rapidly growing in the marketplace with its natural pallet that coordinates with wood and stone looks. We have increased our recycled polyester fiber capacity to expand our participation in the fastest growing carpet category.","In commercial we are coordinating the colors and stylings of our carpet in LVT collections to enhance the design options. We have introduced award-winning collections for schools and workplaces with nature based designs. To increase our focus by channel, we are expanding our commercial sales organization and enhancing their skills. We continue to invest in new design capabilities, proprietary carpet tile backings and a material manufacturing to create greater value for customers and improve our cost.","We have increased the production and speeds of our LVT operations and ongoing initiatives will further improve formulations and throughput. We are now operating at similar speeds to our European LVT operations. During the period US tariffs on click LVT were removed and the market has adjusted pricing to reflect this change.","To expand our price points and highlight our unique visuals and features, we are introducing new collections for both the residential and commercial markets. Our expanded premium Pergo and Karastan collections have been well received at trade shows due to their leading visuals and styling. The virus in China is postponing some production start-ups and it could potentially disrupt some LVT service depending on when shipments resume.","Sales of our waterproof laminate products are expanding across most channels and we anticipate continued market growth due to their realistic appearance durability and ease of installation. The detailed visuals and performance features of our premium laminate collections are increasingly being used as alternatives for both wood and LVT. To support higher laminate sales, we are upgrading our HDF board production to increase capacity and reduce cost.","Our Flooring Rest of World segment continued to deliver strong results in the period. The segment's business is less exposed to those European countries which are having more economic difficulties. Across this segment, our investments in product innovation, cost improvements, acquisitions and new businesses strengthened our results.","We are outperforming the European laminate market with our focus on premium products that are more realistic with unique features. Sales of our new laminate collection are ramping up quickly due to an enhanced level of sophistication. In the period, we absorbed higher marketing cost to support this introduction.","We announced the consolidation of our wood manufacturing to our facility in Malaysia, which will improve our cost and flexibility to better service our customers. Our LVT sales grew as our new manufacturing productivity significantly improved. To further enhance our plant performance, we are implementing specific initiatives to improve throughput, material cost and waste.","To utilize our growing capacity, we are introducing new rigid collections that are being well received in the retail, DIY and commercial channels. We are expanding our LVT offering to our European distribution system to broaden our specialty store penetration.","Our sheet vinyl sales increased primarily from strong growth in Russia. The Russian plant is operating well and positively contributing to our results. Our European carpet tile business is expanding from a small base by increasing our sales organization and introducing higher value products to the market.","Our panels business continues to perform well, as we introduced higher value products to improve our mix. We are increasing the use of recycled wood to benefit our cost and the environment. The expansion of our glue plant is operating well and is contributing positively to our results. We are also installing a second waste to energy plant to reduce our cost and increase recycling. This year our installation business had good results with higher sales volume, even as declining material costs considerably lowered market prices.","In Australia and New Zealand, we had good performance. We are launching many new carpet collections in multiple fiber to enhance our residential offering. Our hard surface products had strong growth with LVT outperforming. New carpet tile collections are being introduced to support our new commercial carpet tile line that is being constructed.","With that, I'll return the call to you, Jeff.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Chris. Market conditions remain challenging across most of our businesses and geographies. In response, we are adjusting our business strategies, enhancing our product offering and restructuring operations and are increasing our investments in sales and marketing, expanding our commercial participation and enhancing both our premium and value collections.","We are bringing new products innovations and categories to the market that will broaden our distribution in the new channels and geographies. Our new LVT countertop, sheet vinyl and carpet tile plants are improving their productivity as we invest to expand our customer base and sales volume. Our LVT manufacturing capacity grows with higher speeds and efficiency.","We are enhancing designs and features and increasing sales of our rigid and flexible offering. We are limiting the traditional inventory build that we typically do in the first quarter as we manage our production with market demand. Taking all this into account our EPS guidance for the first quarter of 2020 is $1.90 to $2.00 excluding any one-time charges.","LVT growth, exchange rate and excess global capacity continue as headwinds for our business. We are executing specific initiatives to adapt to shifting consumer preferences, changing markets and competitive pressure. For the full year of 2020, we expect that our actions to increase sales and distribution, reduce costs and enhance utilization of our new plants will deliver improved results year-over-year with performance accelerating during the second half of the year. Our balance sheet should continue to improve with ongoing cash generation and we remain focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders.","We'll now be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng","Good morning.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Good morning.","Philip Ng","Your comments on LBT in Europe sounded pretty promising on the manufacturing front. So I'm just curious, are you making money with that line yet. And with the success you're seeing on the manufacturing front out there, are you still on track to breakeven in North America early 2020?","Jeff Lorberbaum","In Europe, we have three lines. the two old ones are operating as we expect and are doing well. The third one is not at the level we would like it to, but it's improving and we expect it to be profitable as we go through the year as well as the US line.","Philip Ng","Okay. Any more color in terms of the timing on the US line in terms of getting profitable?","Chris Wellborn","It's going to happen during the year.","Philip Ng","Okay. And then just one last one for me on the cash flow. Glenn, you were kind enough to give us free cash flow guidance last year. Any color on how we should think about 2020, some of the big moving pieces, whether it's working capital, CapEx? And then just given your balance sheet is in really good shape and cash flow still quite strong, are you guys open to buying back more stock?","Glenn Landau","Let me speak to the first part of that and I'll just say that we had a great cash flow year and we expect cash flow to remain strong into next year and the ability to improve our balance sheet is apparent.","Philip Ng","A word about on buybacks.","Glenn Landau","On buybacks, Jeff.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The buybacks, we have $125 million left. We'll continue buying against it and we'll evaluate it when we use it up.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning everyone. First question, I appreciate the kind of directional guidance for the year in terms of your outlook for improved results with acceleration in the back half. I was curious as to what that assumes from a top line perspective either by segment or on a consolidated basis. But just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about sales growth for the year and if also there would be an acceleration in the back half there.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes, I appreciate you like more detailed information, but we give quarter guidance and we give you a direction, but we don't detail the rest of it and we're not going to do it now.","Michael Rehaut","All right. I had to try, I guess, but appreciate that. I guess secondly you've increased or you continue to take action around some of the restructuring and this is kind of an ongoing story as you continue to adjust the conditions. We've heard about the consolidation of the carpet operations going back to be the first half of 2019","I think initially the expectations were around some of those benefits coming through in the back half of '19 and obviously as you shut those plants down, we would presume that there is some amount of cost benefit on the onset. So just trying to understand how those costs are flowing through or at least the cost savings are flowing through. You highlighted the fact that there is things that are in inventory that continue to need to be worked through. But at the same time, I would have thought that some of those cost benefits might have come even in the back half of 2019.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Like we said, Mike, really we finished the carpet restructuring largely in the back half of 2019 and due to the timing of implementation and the inventory flow through of the costs we're talking about a full run rate impact in the third quarter. Yeah, there is a slow ramp-up, but the full impact that's meaningful will be closer to the start of the third quarter.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mike Dahl","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and for all the details so far. First question, Glenn, thanks for outlining the LVT rebates. I guess, just asking more specifically, so I guess the $0.15 roughly in terms of benefits for the year, you said spread over three quarters. How much is included in the first quarter?","Glenn Landau","The first quarter is the lion's share, but it's over three quarters. It started in the first\u2026","Jeff Lorberbaum","It's offsetting the inventories. We have high inventories that you have with long supply chains. And so the majority of it's going to offset the price decreases that we've already implemented and as the inventory flows through they match up.","Glenn Landau","It's in our guidance, it's spread over three quarters. And like I said and like Jeff saying it's largely offset by the inventory value on hand.","Mike Dahl","Okay, that's helpful. And just the second question following up on that would be just given the price declines following the exclusions, you're saying it's offsetting the rebates in the first few quarters. But on a go-forward basis since the rebates kind of go away, the price declines, I guess, don't necessarily, how should we think about the net effect beyond the initial quarter or two where you have the offset from the rebates?","Glenn Landau","I think the way we need to think about it is they are roughly offsetting.","Jeff Lorberbaum","There is not -- there is not -- there is a large -- since we raised the inventory prior to the tariffs, the inventory that -- most of the inventory we sold in the year came from old pieces and we still have large inventories of what we've been purchasing through the period as it -- and so it's offsetting that.","Mike Dahl","Right. I guess -- sorry just where I was going with that, if market pricing has reset lower are you saying that it's only impacting the legacy inventory or is this a go-forward impact from lower market pricing as well?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The market pricing has gone down on clickable LVT and I don't see any reason it's going to change.","Mike Dahl","Okay.","Jeff Lorberbaum","And the products we're buying have gone down too. So the new prices are in line with the -- new selling prices and costs are aligned.","Glenn Landau","So to the extent we're buying it, it's pretty much offset.","Mike Dahl","Right, right. Got it, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh from Stifel. Your line is open.","John Baugh","Thank you and good morning. Two quick questions. One, do you have a rough guess on revenue or sales basis what your market share of the US LVT market is?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes. But we haven't -- we don't give out specific details on product categories.","John Baugh","Okay. Would you have a guess, Jeff as to when you see out into the future reaching parity or any kind of rough idea, timeline?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I don't understand the question.","John Baugh","Well, I presume your share of US LVT sales is lower than your share, sort of, of the flooring market in general. So my question is, when would you see Mohawk in LVT, whether it's imported or made in the US, sort of match up the shares of carpet, ceramic, laminate all put together?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It's continuing to increase, but I don't have a date when the two match up.","John Baugh","Okay. Secondly, really quickly, you mentioned imports of ceramic from around the world into the US around 17% in Q4. Could you just remind us sort of on a normal typical year, how much import as a percentage of the US consumption. Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Imports is a huge part of the ceramic market, maybe 70%, 75%, it's a huge part.","John Baugh","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Glenn Landau","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Speer from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Justin Speer","Appreciate it. Just wanted to start -- just to get a sense from you, because the removal of the click LVT tariff was fairly recent. But I think we understand the deflationary aspect of that in the near term, but how does that affect demand for LVT and what's your view for price and demand for the non-LVT categories in the fourth quarter and what's expected in the first quarter, kind of high level?","Jeff Lorberbaum","There are no details of that available today. Our expectation -- our guess is that LVT has approximately about a $3.5 billion part of the industry. It's growing. We think that the growth rate is slowing as the base gets bigger as we go through. It's impacting the growth rate of the other products within it as you go through. So I'm not sure we have the details that you're looking for.","Justin Speer","Okay. So I would just keep our eye on that. But I guess within your guidance, as you unpack that there is obviously some conservatism around maybe production rates slowing. And then the other element is a variable in SG&A investment. So SG&A was up about 9.5% in the fourth quarter, up 7% for the full year.","I'm just trying to get a sense for what your SG&A investment will be in 2020 recognizing that you have some cost tailwinds from restructuring efforts. But you are also investing in the business. So just trying to get a sense for how much SG&A will be up or down next year.","Glenn Landau","Well, 2020 will be higher due to the full-year impact of our investments. We do expect higher sales in the second half. That's the target of these investments. We will evaluate as we go through the year and we'll adjust if necessary depending on the sales.","Justin Speer","Excellent. An the last question for me is just, I didn't catch it, but on the ceramic tile bridge, what was the price mix and what was the productivity and start-up cost elements of the bridge?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes, repeat the question.","Justin Speer","The bridge, the EBIT bridge that you gave, I didn't hear price mix or the productivity elements of the ceramic tile.","Jeff Lorberbaum","On the ceramic tile. So, on ceramic the price mix was slipped by $4 million.","Justin Speer","Down by $4 million.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Price mix slipped by $4 million and overall productivity and lower startups costs offset that. That was $6 million.","Justin Speer","Perfect. Thank you, guys.","Jeff Lorberbaum","So a little more comment on the SG&A. In the US, we're expanding the commercial sales forces, we're building markets for quartz countertops, roofing and LVT. In Europe, we're developing a new commercial sales organization to sell LVT, vinyl and carpet tile.","We've invested in regional distributors, which we purchased our distribution and different pieces, which all the costs going into SG&A was offset by higher sales and margins. And Russia, we've talked about increasing stores. So there's a lot of activities of which those are only some of.","Justin Speer","So these are growth investments and just ultimately you're -- so you're not pulling in the range. You're digging into invest to grow and ultimately you think that'll really manifest itself in growth -- better growth in the second half. Above market growth, do you think?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I mean the markets -- we're investing to expand the areas which we think we can expand and we'll monitor as we go through the year and we also have all the new product categories and new -- the new businesses. You have to put the sales people in before you get the sales for them and the marketing monies.","Justin Speer","That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","And due to time constraints and to allow everyone to ask a question going further please allow yourself one question. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew Bouley","Hey. Thank you for taking my questions or question. Can you just provide a little more color on the comment you made around the -- how the virus in China is impacting the start up of LVT production and how that's flowing to you guys, because obviously you're ramping your own capacity? I guess the question is how reliant is Mohawk on this start-up capacity in China for year 2020 plants? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The information is less than perfect at this point. They go on holiday for the new year, then the people come back. So the people are not coming back at the rate they would normally come back. There are -- some operations have started, some are in partial things and some haven't started at all. And the question is how is all that going to line up and when they're going to start. Nobody has a clear view of what it's going to be.","Given we have inventories in line, we can last a while before it has any impact on the business and we're having monitor it to see what's going to happen. In our business we do buy products from other countries and we manufacture ourselves. So it has less impact on us than the rest of the industry, but the whole industry has the potential of a slower service depending upon what happens.","Matthew Bouley","Great. Thanks for the details, Jeff.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Susan Maklari","Good morning. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking of inflation and raw materials as we go through the year. I know that you said it was a $3 million benefit as it related to the consolidated business in the fourth quarter. But how are you thinking about that as we look to 2020?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The raw material prices in general, mostly the oil-related products, have come down. At the same time there is more aggressive pricing in the marketplace and we're assuming that the market prices are going to continue to reflect the decreases, mostly in the commodity categories and we're going to continue to participate in aggressive manner. We'll have to see how competition reacts.","In some of the other places we had -- in Europe for instance, we had prices on our insulation boards come down dramatically, but so have the prices of the products in each. So we're assuming, given the excess capacities in the world today, that the changes will be reflected in market prices.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Seldon Clarke from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Seldon Clarke","Hey. Thanks for the question. Just given all the moving parts with your various product rollouts and investments in SG&A and just how the timing of these investments relate to your production ramp, when should we expect to see some operating leverage show up on the SG&A side?","Jeff Lorberbaum","In the second half we're expecting to see some benefits from the actions we're taking and we will keep re-evaluating them and depending upon how the markets change we will continue to adjust.","Seldon Clarke","And are those -- operating leverage, are those savings tied to operating leverage or purely cost, kind of $30 million you're targeting?","Glenn Landau","The $30 million of restructuring is more about cost.","Jeff Lorberbaum","You're tying the restructuring piece with the marketing investments, they are separate.","Seldon Clarke","Right. So I'm just trying to ask like when you should start to see some operating leverage on the SG&A side.","Jeff Lorberbaum","We're expecting to see most -- more of the benefits about in the third quarter in the second half, we keep saying.","Seldon Clarke","Got it, okay. Appreciate the question. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is open.","Tim Wojs","Hey guys. Good morning.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Good morning.","Tim Wojs","Just a clarification. So SG&A is up and is expected to be up over the next few quarters as you're investing in to grow sales. But the gross profit was actually up in Q4 for the first time in, I think, six or seven quarters. So should we expect that that gross profit can actually grow a little bit and you're reinvesting that in SG&A now and that's really what's driving some of the year-over-year EBIT margin compression? Is that the right way to look at it?","Jeff Lorberbaum","You answer what he wants.","Glenn Landau","I think we stated broadly, we expect 2020 to improve over this year, our overall results back-end weighted to the second half and that's broad based. It's based on our initiatives and the pass-through of the costs. So SG&A is a function of that and ultimately the trend should continue.","Tim Wojs","Okay.","Jeff Lorberbaum","On the cost side, we're expecting the restructuring pieces we've done to benefit at the same time, the increased volume through the new plants should reduce the cost and help the margins in those also.","Tim Wojs","Okay. Okay. That sounds good. And then just sneaking another one in. What's the cost inflation outlook in ceramic?","Glenn Landau","Again, we've talked about that several times in ceramic and that's really overseas. That is largely some raw material, but energy costs that are driven by the Eastern European facilities and fixed government pricing.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yeah, I think in Europe we expect maybe a little relief on some of the energy increases this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes","Thanks. Questions on North America ceramic, in light of the fall in imports as you had identified, is that -- I guess my question is where does the channel inventory stand now? When do you think that will be more balanced? I know it's been out of over-inventory for sometimes.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Keith, we don't know -- we don't have the data to see the inventory exactly. What we know is that the imports, which is a huge piece of the market came down 17% in the quarter and the imports from China dropped off altogether. So we expect that it's a combination of inventories in this channel coming down and softness in the market.","Keith Hughes","Is this still something that's going to affect the first half\u2026","Jeff Lorberbaum","It's just hard to tell because --","Keith Hughes","Hard to tell.","Jeff Lorberbaum","All we can really see is the amount of inventory coming in to the country. But we don't have a sense yet exactly the size of the inventory in the channel.","Keith Hughes","I understand. Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Wood from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Michael Wood","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to talk about that ceramics import data. If I look at it historically it is down considerably fourth quarter year-over-year although it's still higher than the fourth quarter in '17 and '16. So I'm just curious how you're looking at that level of imports and how you're thinking where it should be. I mean, is this a level a healthy amount of import activity currently that we can sustain?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Well, what we believe is that as you got into 2019 and when the tariffs were announced on the Chinese product prior to those going to effect there was, we believe, a significant increase in pre-buys related to that. In addition, as they replace the Chinese inventory with other countries, you had a combination of Chinese inventories in the system plus new products that they were purchasing to replace it which elevated those inventories and sort of, we believe, gave a sort of a thoughts view of how much the industry was growing. We don't know exactly last year, but we think it probably declined 3% to 5% -- would be, but it's just a guess.","Michael Wood","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Truman Patterson","The question for me, the capacity that you all have coming online previously earlier last year, you said you had about $1.2 billion coming online in 2019 and 2020. Could you just give us an update of how much is coming online in 2020 and possibly 2021? Remind us which products and categories. And then just one item for clarification. The LVT rebate, if I'm hearing you correctly in the first quarter, it will probably be somewhere around maybe $0.10 benefit to EPS.","Glenn Landau","Well, again, what we said is that's the total rebate which will be largely offset by inventory and lower pricing. So, again, it's immaterial, but it's in the guidance.","Truman Patterson","Okay. And then the capacity.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The new plants are they -- the different pieces. We have LVT which is still ramping up that will ramp up all through this year. We have the Russian sheet vinyl plant, which is running -- it's positively helping the business now, but it still has -- it's only used about 30% of the capacity as we push it into the marketplace. We have the carpet tile business, which we're developing an entire commercial sales organization, which is also going to sell vinyl and LVT in Europe.","So it's ramping up. It takes a while to develop the customers and pieces. We put in a new capacity in Brazil to put in higher end products. We have capacity in Eastern Europe to make low-end ceramic, which expands our market there, is ramping up. We have the quartz plant in the United States that's running about three shifts today, but it's building inventory and also pushing it in.","Over time that would go to four shifts and the productivity and inventories -- the productivity and throughput will go up. And all of them we have to get the mix aligned because you start out selling more lower-quality products to get more volume through the plants and it's going to take time to develop those as we go through. So they're all working through they system at different rates.","Truman Patterson","Okay, thank you. Is that still about $1.2 billion that you're bringing online over the next couple of years?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I mean part of it's already on. So what's happening is, some of the upside is getting offset by decreases in our legacy businesses. So the legacy businesses have declines and it's offsetting some of the gains in the new pieces.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.","Brian Biros","This is actually Brian Biros on for Kathryn. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the coronavirus and I guess the supply chain impact. TRG industry contacts are telling us that the supply chain has not really yet been meaningfully impacted.","But if the manufacturing stoppages are extended another three to four weeks, that could then impact shipments about three to five months from now. Actually wanted to see if you guys think that logic makes sense and maybe any color on what you're hearing from manufacturers from either Vietnam or South Korea on the impact to their supply chain.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think that's close to what we said. We said that right now it's difficult to say how fast it's going to come up that there are huge inventories in the chain over different times that it depends on each piece. So typically there is anywhere from four to seven months of inventory through the channels and the stuff coming through, and in that you have some that have low parts and some that have high parts across the industry. So depending upon what it is and each piece and how fast the part comes up, it depends on the time. There could be people on the channel with less than that and they could be impacted with a few weeks' worth of delays.","The non-Chinese production and the surrounding countries, some of it or a significant part of it also uses inputs coming out of China. So if the inputs don't come up, it could affect those also. So at this point, it's really difficult to know what's going to happen and the impact. It depends on the inventory levels of any individual SKUs at this point.","As most people when they buy from there, there is the Chinese New Year where they shut down. So you have the product that was bought in anticipation of that still flowing across the water coming in. And so it still comes back to how fast it's going to pick up and what's the timing of the new production is going to -- production coming up and nobody has any idea.","Brian Biros","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Lovallo","Hey guys. Thank you for fitting me in here. I just want to make sure that I understand your outlook seems to imply year-over-year operating margin expansion at least in 3Q and 4Q, is that correct?","Glenn Landau","Yes.","John Lovallo","Thanks.","Operator","And our final question today comes from the line of Laura Champine from Loop Capital. Your line is open.","Laura Champine","Thanks for taking my question. If we look at your new production of LVT in the US, how competitively do you think you'll be able to price that product relative to Chinese competition and how does that influence your ability to get close to full capacity by the end of the year?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We think when it's fully optimized that we'll be able to compete with the world marketplaces. At the same time our goal isn't to sell all commodity product. Our goal is to sell value-added products that have a higher average mix which will help -- which will allow us to meet the return goals that we have.","Laura Champine","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lorberbaum for closing remarks.","Jeff Lorberbaum","While reacting to the market conditions, we see excess capacities in the market continuing and we'll have to continue to react to competition in the marketplaces as they evolve. There are a lot of indicators that many of the markets around the world are expecting the economies to get better and improve. We have a lot of -- a lot going on to increase the utilization of our new plants, which we think will help the second half as the throughputs go up, which will allow the cost to come down and also the mix to improve over time.","We think we're doing the right things to react to the market and invest in the categories to increase our business level during these times. We appreciate you taking your time and listening to us. Have a nice day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today conference call. Thank you for participating.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, February 10, 2017.","Thank you. I would now like to introduce Mr. Frank Boykin. Mr. Boykin, you may begin your conference.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries quarterly investor conference call. Today, we\u2019ll update you on the Company\u2019s results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016 and provide guidance for the first quarter of 2017.","I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Mohawk delivered record results in 2016. For the full year, our revenues rose to an all-time high of $9 billion, an 11% increase. We generated adjusted operating income of $1.3 billion, up 24%. And our EBITDA for the year rose to $1.7 billion, both the highest in our history. Mohawk\u2019s performance in 2016 is the result of an aggressive growth strategy we began in 2013. From 2013 to 2015, Mohawk invested $4.8 billion in capital expenditures and acquisitions, growing our sales and operating income at a compounded rate of 12% and 38%, respectively, over that period. Of the $4.8 billion, $1.4 billion was invested in capital expenditures to expand sales, introduce innovative products, and increase productivity across the enterprise by $300 million in that three year period.","While making these capital investments, we also acquired nine companies for $3.4 billion. The acquisitions expanded our ceramic sales in the U.S., Mexico, Europe, and Russia; our laminate and wood sales in U.S., Europe, and the South Pacific; our vinyl and LVT sales in the U.S. and Europe; our insulation and wood panel sales in Europe. During this period our adjusted EBITDA increased by $720 million. In 2016, our capital investments were the highest ever at $670 million. This year we will escalate the capital investments further to $750 million, yielding a combined 2016 and 2017 investment of over $1.4 billion, approximately the same amount we invested in the previous three years.","The largest part of these new investments is dedicated to expanding our manufacturing, adding the equivalent of $1.4 billion of product sales, which is a standalone company would rank among the largest flooring producers in the world. We are also adding unique capabilities to bring out more differentiated products and further enhance our productivity. In 2016 alone, process improvements from new methods; product re-engineering and equipment upgrades increased our productivity by $140 million. We anticipate even higher productivity improvements in the coming year.","In December, with the election behind us, U.S. consumer confidence rose to its highest level in 15 years setting a positive tone for 2017. U.S. housing starts in 2016 rose to their highest level since 2007 and the National Association of Homebuilders has projected another year of steady improvement in the housing market as wage growth and rising home values lead consumers to commit, to larger home improvement projects. Harvard University, likewise, cites higher home values as a driver of strong and stable growth in home remodeling and repair spending.","The LIRA Index is projected to rise during 2017 on par with last year. The AIA reported that the last three months of 2016 posted growth in design billings. The Architectural Billing Index recorded its strongest gains of the year in December. The strong close to the year should support commercial growth in 2017. In Europe, job creation and low interest rates improved GDP growth to 1.8%.","The Russian economy is projected to improve in 2017 as oil prices increase and the ruble strengthens. In the fourth quarter, our sales grew 9% with an adjusted operating margin of 14.7%, an 80 basis points improvement over the prior year. Our sales and operating margin represent the highest fourth-quarter results in the Company\u2019s history. Business improved sequentially as we went through the period with the completion of the U.S. elections and rising consumer confidence.","I will now review our fourth quarter results by segment. During the quarter, sales in our global ceramic increased 5% with adjusted margins rising to 14%, an 80 basis point improvement over the prior year. Sales in our northern American ceramic business improved with new construction, commercial and home center channels outperforming. During the period, our margins expanded due to productivity, volume, and improved mix from new product introductions.","In our regional sales centers, merchandising investments that highlight our new collections expanded our sales. We are simplifying our interactions with our distributors by merging the salesforce of Marazzi and American Olean brands. In geographies where we don\u2019t distribution partners, we are investing in combined American Olean and Marazzi service centers. We are adding new slabs centers to expand our countertop business. Our larger sizes, contemporary shapes, and proprietary Reveal Imaging are driving our sales growth.","Our design and service leadership has expanded our new home construction, national accounts and home center programs. To meet growing demand in North America, we are using both our global assets and international sourcing to supplement our domestic production. Our Greenfield ceramic plant in Tennessee became fully operational during the period and should reach planned efficiency levels in the first quarter. We\u2019re introducing higher-value products at the facility to improve the product mix in the plant.","During the period our productivity benefited from process innovations, improved yield, and product reformulations. In the period, we successfully replaced our U.S. information system with SAP. Our new system is operating well, improving reporting and productivity.","To offset inflation in labor, energy, and materials, we have announced price increases on selected products. In Mexico, our sales grew significantly, but we were constrained by our existing capacity. Our expanded product offering is driving sales and margin improvement, as well as expanding our participation in the commercial channel. Our Salamanca plant expansion will double the site\u2019s capacity and should be operational by late 2017.","In anticipation of higher volume, we are increasing our sales organization to expand our Mexican sales and exports to Central and South American markets. We have implemented price increases to cover labor and energy inflation as well as currency changes.","Our European ceramics sales and margins improved, despite market softness in the beginning of the quarter. We have completed the transformation of our European product offering and become a leader in style in the marketplace. We have increased commercial tile inventories in the fourth quarter so we can stop production and replace high-cost equipment during the first quarter.","The plant will resume operations in the second quarter and should be operating at expected levels by the end of July. We are expanding our sales and specification organization to increase our penetration in the commercial channel. We are installing new technology to manufacture large porcelain slabs for countertops, furniture, floors, and wall. Our unique Reveal Imaging technology will allow us to replicate natural stone, wood, and other visuals on these slabs.","Our Eastern European operations continue to grow their sales and expand margins. Our new introductions with higher fashion and larger sizes should improve our mix and productivity improvements should increase our manufacturing capacity in 2017. To enhance our process and controls, we anticipate implementing our Italian ERP system in Bulgaria in the second quarter.","In Russia, we continue to outperform the market as we bring leading global design to the region. We have expanded our branded retail stores and consumer advertising to enhance our offering. We are upgrading our assets to bring larger and smaller sizes to the marketplace. We continue to strengthen our organization and specialize our sales, marketing, and manufacturing to optimize our penetration in all channels.","We are installing additional capacity to support the expected improvement in the Russian economy. During the period, sales in our North American flooring business segment increased 10%, with hard surface product sales substantially increasing and carpet and rug products performing well. The segment\u2019s adjusted operating margins expanded to 15%, a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year.","Fourth-quarter sales began slowly and improved as we progressed through the period. Our results benefited from volume, process enhancements, and capital investments. Residential carpet sales improved despite decreased selling prices that reflected channel mix and growth in polyester. Our price increase of 3% to 5% that we announced last quarter to cover rising costs is being implemented in the first quarter.","Most of our 2017 markets have been completed and retail expectations for the year are the strongest since the industry peaked. Timing of shows and price increases improved our sales in our sales in the period. We introduced the next generation of super soft carpet called SmartStrand Silk Reserve, which elevates carpet softness to an unprecedented level.","Sophisticated new fabric designs are expanding our Karastan offering as we increase the distribution of our premium brand. We are introducing Aero, a patented recycled polyester technology that produces a unique, more luxurious soft flooring product with a built-in cushion that installs in half the time.","Our new carpet pad plant in Mexicali has started and we will increase our cushion sales on the West Coast. During the period, our commercial business grew faster than residential. The investments we made last year expanding our products and sales organization are increasing our market share.","In November, interior designers voted our new Topography carpet tile collection as the best modular carpet of the year for versatile looks made possible with a combination of sizes, shapes, and textures. To improve efficiency, we have consolidated two of our commercial manufacturing operations and we are enhancing our productivity and service through ongoing process improvements. We opened a new commercial carpet and hard surface design center that highlights our style and sustainability leadership and promotes innovative uses of our products.","Our hard surface sales, which include LVT, laminate, wood, and vinyl, continued their dramatic expansion. Our Dalton LVT plant made significant improvements during the period and we are installing another LVT production line that will double our U.S. capacity by the end of this year. We are introducing SolidTech, a rigid product to complement our existing LVT collections.","Our premium laminate products, with realistic visuals and proprietary water resistance, are outperforming the market. Our laminate sales will be constrained until our new production line is operational in the second half of this year. We\u2019re introducing more refined visuals and longer engineered planks that replicate solid wood at our newly- commissioned plant.","We are enhancing our shape vinyl offering as we expand our residential and commercial distribution and increase our share in the home center channel. This year we will continue elevating capital investments in this segment to enhance our product innovation, capacity, and productivity. We anticipate increased sales and marketing investments to utilize the capacity we are building in LVT, laminate, and engineered wood.","During the quarter, sales in our flooring rest of the world segment increased 14% with adjusted operating margins rising to 17%, an 80 basis point improvement over the prior year, excluding restructuring costs. Our sales growth was led by LVT laminate and insulation products. Both our sheet vinyl and wood sales were hampered by prior manufacturing disruptions, which we have overcome.","Our segment margins increased due to higher volume and productivity, the success of our new introductions, and price increases, which offset inflation and currency. Our LVT sales growth remains constrained by capacity limitations to maximize production, we\u2019ve implemented numerous operational improvements that increased our throughput and reduced our manufacturing costs.","In the short term we are expanding the sales of source products to meet the increasing demand for our brand. Increased production capacity and reduced shipments to the U.S. will support our European growth this year. We continue to invest in sales and marketing to expand the distribution of our LVT products in anticipation of our new plant.","In laminate, we continue to grow our sales and margins through design and performance innovation. We have the most realistic visuals, the greatest durability, and unique water resistance that differentiate our products. We are introducing new wood collections with unique surfaces and longer, wider planks. We are improving our wood manufacturing and we have begun production of wood veneers to improve our cost position.","In vinyl, all of our production is running at capacity and we are replenishing our inventory levels to improve our ongoing sales after the plant disruptions. We are introducing more realistic sheet vinyl designs with sharper detail, brighter colors, and enhanced textures, as well as introducing vinyl rugs. We are initiating the sale of carpet tile products in Europe, which is a market of about \u20ac500 million. We are building a plant in Belgium and it should be operational by the end of this year. We are adding sales personnel to specify our LVT, sheet vinyl, and carpet tile to grow our commercial participation in Europe.","In addition to the expansion of laminate in Europe and Russia and our new European carpet tile facility, we have approved the construction of a sheet vinyl plant in Russia adjacent to our ceramic facility that will be operational in the middle of 2018. Sheet vinyl is one of the largest flooring categories in Russia and we will leverage our relationships in ceramic and laminate to build our sheet vinyl distribution.","During the period, the sales of our insulation products increased significantly and we realigned our management and sales strategies. We are integrating the information systems of our Irish acquisition and increasing prices to offset inflation and currency changes. We continue to enhance our board manufacturing processes and equipment to improve our costs and sales.","I will now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period and the year.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $2.2 billion, up 7% on a constant days and FX basis for our legacy business. For the full year, legacy sales were $9 billion, which was up 5.5% on a constant basis.","All segments increased in the fourth quarter with the strongest performance in our flooring North American segment. In the fourth quarter of 2016 we had one more day compared to 2015. In 2017 we have different days in the U.S. and Europe due to holidays. The overall impact is we will have one half-day less in both the first quarter and the second quarter compared to 2016, and the third and fourth quarters of 2017 will be the same between the years. The legacy gross margin, excluding unusual items, was 32.4%, up 50 basis points. Volume of $33 million and productivity of $24 million where the biggest drivers of that improvement.","SG&A was 17.5% of net sales, excluding unusual items, which was a 50 basis point improvement over last year and that is even with sales and marketing investments of $8 million. We expect the SG&A percentage in 2017 to be flat to slightly lower versus 2016 as we continue to invest back into the business.","Unusual charges for the quarter were $16 million and primarily came from plant consolidation in the flooring North American segment and acquisition integration activities in the rest of world segment.","Operating income, excluding charges, was $321 million, with a margin of 14.7%. The income is up 16% versus last year, even with FX pressure of $5 million and SG&A investments of $8 million. We had total productivity in the quarter of $29 million at operating income level.","Interest expense was $8 million and decreased from last year due to the redemption of higher-rate bonds in January 2016 and the introduction of our lower-rate commercial paper program. We expect interest expense to range from $33 million to $36 million in 2017.","Other income was $2 million and was favorably impacted by FX. Both 2016 and 2015 include the unwinding of an indemnification receivable recorded in the IBC purchase accounting of $3 million and $11 million, respectively. The income tax rate was 23.6% for the quarter versus 18.7% last year. The tax rate for 2017 for the full year is estimated to be between 26% and 27% and for the first quarter is estimated to be 26% to 26.5%. Earnings per share, excluding charges, was $3.26, an increase of 16%.","Turning to the segments; in the global ceramic segment sales of $749 million were up 5% using constant days and FX, as new products and sales and marketing investments drove growth. Our operating income, excluding charges, was $130 million and improved 12% over last year. We had productivity of $10 million, volume of $8 million, and price mix of $5 million that all favorably impacted our results. This was partially offset by inflation of $8 million and SG&A investments of $3 million.","In the flooring North American segment, sales are $970 million, up 8.5% using constant days, with all products categories performing well.","Operating income, excluding charges of $148 million, improved 17% over last year. Earnings increased from volume of $17 million and productivity of $11 million with price mix of $7 million and SG&A investments of $4 million as headwinds.","In the flooring rest of world segment, sales were $463 million. That\u2019s up 7% using constant days in FX for our legacy business, with LVT growth outpacing all of our other categories.","Operating income margin excluding charge \u2013 operating income, excluding charges, was $80 million, which is up 20% as both volume of $9 million and productivity of $8 million added to our earnings.","IP income in this segment for the quarter was flat year-over-year and the full-year income came in at $148 million as we received some delinquent payments from prior years. As a reminder, IP income will drop to $65 million to $70 million in 2017 with a $35 million run rate, annual run rate beginning in June.","If we go to the balance sheet, receivables ended up at $1.4 billion with our days sales outstanding increasing up to 58 days, due primarily to changes in channel mix. Inventories ended the quarter at $1.7 billion with our inventory days improving by two days to 110 days as we continue to drive inventory management.","Fixed assets were $3.4 billion and included fourth quarter capital expenditures of $211 million and depreciation and amortization of $104 million. For the full year, capital expenditures were $672 million and depreciation and amortization of $409 million. For the year, we had very strong operating cash flow of $1.3 billion and, even with our elevated capital expenditures, we had free cash flow of $655 million.","Capital expenditures for 2017 are estimated to be approximately $750 million with D&A at $450 million. We had total long-term debt of $2.5 billion as we continue to improve the balance sheet with our strong cash flow. Moody\u2019s upgraded our rating to Baa1 in January as our credit position continues to improve. Our strong balance sheet and liquidity position us well for future growth.","Jeff, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Today Mohawk is in the best position in the Company\u2019s history. Mohawk delivered record results in 2016 as our investment strategy to enhance our product innovation, brands, and service continue to benefit our customers and provide the returns we expected. We remain optimistic about 2017 and we made greater internal investments than any time in our history to expand capacity and enter new markets. I would like to clarify the earnings release from last night which has caused some confusion.","Excluding acquisitions and intellectual property, our 2017 sales will grow similarly to last year. Including the expected intellectual property decline in 2017, our operating margin for the year will increase slightly. This increase in operating margin includes the impact of $105 million to $110 million of incremental startup expenses and the reduction in intellectual property income. Across the enterprise we are making investments to increase our sales growth. Our ceramic manufacturing is being expanded in all markets. We are broadening our countertop sales in the U.S. and Europe.","We are significantly increasing our LVT capacity in the U.S. and Europe and introducing rigid LVT products. We\u2019ve entered the outdoor rug and utility mat business and we\u2019ll produce carpet tile in Europe. We are expanding laminate production in the U.S., Europe, and Russia. We are adding engineered wood capacity in the U.S. and constructing a sheet vinyl plant in Russia. Some of these projects will require several years to fully develop our distribution and optimize our efficiencies.","Over a five-year period, these internal expansions typically provide a greater return on investment than the acquisitions we execute. In January, we entered into an agreement to acquire a ceramic company in Italy located near our existing facilities. It is expected to close in the second quarter and will expand our presence in the European market. The business had 2016 sales of approximately $160 million and an EBITDA margin of about 19%. Product sales and manufacturing synergies will enhance our cost position and strengthen our combined brand and distribution. We believe there is further opportunity consolidate the European ceramic market and grow our market position.","Even with the considerable investments we have made since 2013, our financial leverage is historically low at 1.4 times EBITDA. We believe there are potential acquisitions in our current market and product categories, as well as opportunities in new geographies and complementary products. As we increase the international scope of our business, volatility and foreign exchange markets could impact the translation of our future results.","Taking all this into account, our EPS guidance for the first quarter of 2017 is $2.64 to $2.73. This represents an 11% to 15% increase over our first quarter 2016. Mohawk\u2019s organization creates an environment that allows us to respond rapidly to market changes and execute multiple investments at the same time. Presently, about 70% of our business is in the United States, where one out of every four flooring purchases is a Mohawk product. This year we are investing more than any time in our history to internally grow our business with much of the benefit coming in future years. Today our organization and balance sheet can support significant additional investments to expand our business and enhance shareholder value.","We will now be glad to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Bob Wetenhall","Hey, good morning and nice finish to a very strong year. I was hoping you could shed a little bit of light. I know there was some confusion around the press release. If you are saying about 2017 revenue growth and I understand correctly, if you adjust up on a constant exchange rate basis and strip out the acquisitions, are you talking full-year revenue growth in the range of 5% to 6%? Is that the right kind of target?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes, that is a reasonable estimate.","Bob Wetenhall","Okay. And, Jeff, you had said that total headwinds between startup costs for the new plants that are coming online and the loss of income from the IP will kind of be in the range of $100 million to $110 million. And that\u2019s a lot of headwind in terms of lost operating income to incur. You also said that you anticipate that operating margins are going to rise. I was hoping you could step me through how, even though you are facing a pretty big $100 million headwind, how you are still going to grow operating income.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Listen, it all starts with the growth rate which you started out with of the business, which is going to help the top line. We have a huge number of new projects; at the same time we\u2019re going to get some incremental improvements in all our businesses from the $670 million we invested last year. It will start giving us more productivity, as well as improving the top line, as well as giving us some product differentiation and other features to help. All of these things combined are helping us overcome the $100 million to $110 million of operating income that we are losing.","Bob Wetenhall","Could you dig in a little bit deeper on the specifics of that? Is it just productivity improvements from what you\u2019ve already spent in the business or is it operating leverage given mid single-digit sales growth or is it price versus commodity management? What are the levers specifically that you see giving you operating margin expansion to overcome this headwind in 2017?","Frank Boykin","Bob, it\u2019s a lot of different moving parts. It\u2019s going to be the higher volume allowing us to better leverage our fixed cost. It\u2019s going to the productivity that Jeff talked about that is going to be even greater in 2017 than in 2016. And if you look in different parts of our business, you get different factors driving it. For example, we are continuing to see margin improvement in our European ceramic business as they are completing the last phase of their equipment upgrade. And so if you look across all the different parts of the business where we are adding and upgrading equipment, we are going to continue to see margin improvement as a result of that.","Bob Wetenhall","And just one final, then I will turn it over. If we had to think about the magnitude of margin improvement, would somewhere between zero and 50 basis points be the right way to think about the size of margin improvement? You had 150 basis point uptick this year, which is fantastic. That\u2019s a very tough pace to sustain going forward. Is the right level of growth in operating margin somewhere between zero and 50 basis points in 2017?","Frank Boykin","Listen, you sort of need to think about that. Take the incremental costs we talked about of over $100 million, that\u2019s more than 1% by itself, and then we said we would have a slightly improvement over that. So if you strip that out its somewhere over 1%. The question of how much more, you will have to make your own estimate.","Bob Wetenhall","Good, congratulations on a very good year. Good luck.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Baugh","Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a great year. Quickly on LVT, could you discuss pricing trends there? I\u2019m interested in the rigid movement we see, the rigid cores. Is that something that hurts the competition, helps Mohawk? How are you positioned to manufacture that product, number one? Number two, is that not a commodity product where you could maybe hope to get a little more margin or is there a lot of competition already there as well? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","LVT is progressing as we had anticipated two years ago as we starting to getting ready to get in this stuff. As you put \u2013 as the market matures you expect it to get more competitive \u2013 and it is \u2013 and the pricing are getting more competitive, as expected. And while that\u2019s going on, our manufacturing costs are improving as we do it. At the same time, we are putting in strategies to improve our plant and what we do and bring more product innovation to the marketplace.","The rigid product has been in the market for a while and it has ended up at the premium end of the marketplace. The biggest reason for it is the rigid product will cover up more subfloor irregularities. So you don\u2019t have to fix the floors underneath as well, but you have to pay a premium for it.","Presently, we are introducing those products as sourced products in the marketplace, along with everybody else. And when we get more capacity at the end of this year going into next year, we will be able to produce that and bring more product innovation and use our brands in marketing and distribution to optimize our position in it.","John Baugh","Thanks. Then if I could pivot to your carpet tile announcement in Europe. Any timing there as to when we see that production? What is sort of the initial capacity plan for that plant? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","It\u2019s going to take most of this year to get the plant up and operating, so it will be next year. We are introducing products into the marketplace out of the United States; shipping over there, paving the way for it. We are putting in salespeople in Europe to sell it, but one of the reasons for doing it now, with the sheet vinyl we have going into the commercial, we have LVT that can go into commercial, the carpet tile now fits into a broader strategy of becoming a much bigger commercial player in the European market as we go through.","We also think that we can bring to the marketplace in carpet tile technology, fiber, and innovation that we think we have in the United States that we can bring over there. And we think that we can offer new options and choices to the marketplace. In addition, the management team that we got in IVC, there is knowledge from prior days of running in both the business in Europe in the carpet business. So we have a management team that knows, that understands the local marketplace and we\u2019re going to supplement it by adding people as well as from our U.S. knowledge, so we think we are well-positioned to get into it.","It will take a while to push the distribution, because when you get into more specified parts of the marketplace it takes a while to develop the relationships and people. We think it\u2019s a good thing to do. In addition, just as a directional strategy, we think, like this, there are more places where we can bring in knowledge and technology in greenfield plants and put them in like we said before in sheet vinyl. And we are looking for other opportunities to do that on a continuous basis.","John Baugh","Thank you for that color and good luck.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. Just question on Europe in general. If you could just talk about the market climate heading into the year in Western Europe and contrast that with what you are seeing in Russia as you begin the year.","Jeff Lorberbaum","It\u2019s hard to talk about Europe as one thing, but I will attempt it. It feels a little better in general. The GDP is increasing a little more. It feels better and we see some opportunities of it improving, but again you have to take each region by where it is. On the other side, Russia has been in a huge recession for about two years now I think, could be more, and we believe it\u2019s hitting a bottom. The GDP looks like it\u2019s going to be flat and start turning up by most people\u2019s estimates.","In that environment, we have a significant position in ceramic and in laminate with our manufacturing base there. All of those businesses are sold up completely. We are putting expansions in both this year in order \u2013 as the marketplace turns up, which it will, we have to have more capacity to participate in it and we are in a stronger position coming out of the recession than we were going in.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Second question was in carpet. There\u2019s been some more noise of raw material, potential raw material inflation coming in the spring here or late winter. Can you give any comments on that; if you will be facing more inflation in carpet inputs?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We started out using the best knowledge we had in the fourth quarter deciding what it would take to cover the raw materials. We put in a 3% to 5% increase, which is going in now. There is increases that look like they are going up more. We are not sure if they are temporary or permanent. We will have to evaluate what is going to happen and if we need more price increases we will announce them.","Keith Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. It\u2019s Jason in for Mike. First question on the $45 million in startup costs that you highlighted. Just wanted to get a sense as to what the quarterly progression of those costs will look like, if it\u2019s weighted any more heavily to any particular quarter. And then as you look into 2018 as we think about startup costs, should they come down from the type of level that you are seeing this year or should it stay pretty similar? Then I guess more broadly, as these plants ramp up, how much additional revenue would you expect to be driven by the plants where you are currently getting \u2013 incurring these costs.","Frank Boykin","Okay. Yes, let me address the first part of that and I will give it to Jeff for the hard part. In terms of the $45 million of startup costs that we said we think we are going to incur this year, the first thing I would say is it\u2019s an estimate and that it can move around from month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, depending on how quickly or how slowly some of these plants come up. But right now, our best guess is that we are going to see \u2013 it\u2019s going to be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year than the first half. We will have costs in every one of the quarters, but just looking at it overall for the full year we see more of it in the second half.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Just as an instance of that in my review to begin with, we are taking an entire plant that makes high-end commercial through-body tile in Europe and we are shutting it down to replace all the equipment in the first quarter. So all those costs are going to show up in the first quarter; as we start it up, it\u2019s going to hit the second quarter. All these investments are going to come through at different times and the costs are going to be there as we come out of it.","The best returns we get on anything we do are these investments when they come up and work as we expect, but they\u2019re different than acquisitions. You\u2019re not paying for the people and the existing cash flows that are in the business, so it gives us the best returns of anything we can do. However, you do have these startup costs at the front end, which are negative. But if you look at it over a five-year period, which is once they get up and operating, it\u2019s a really much better investment.","Looking forward to next year, some of this stuff will still have startup costs going into next year because, as you heard, there\u2019s a lot of it that won\u2019t be coming up until late in the year. And so there will be more coming into next year. The question next year is the total cost of this $45 million. Now next year depends on our perception of the marketplace and do we keep putting more in. If we stopped all of it, the $45 million would disappear, but I\u2019m hoping to keep growing more.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then next question, just going back to cost inflation. I think you\u2019ve highlighted several price increases across the business to offset this and higher energy costs as well. So wanted to get a sense as you look across the business for 2017 overall if you have an estimate as to what you expect total cost inflation to be relative to 2016.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I would have to be a soothsayer to give that one. We are raising prices where we have seen it. There\u2019s raw material inflation, there\u2019s labor inflation, there\u2019s currency changes between things moving between different currencies and we\u2019re doing the right things to cover it. We just have to adjust as it changes and we will see how it goes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Eisner with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Sam Eisner","Yes. Thanks very much and good morning, everyone.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Good morning.","Frank Boykin","Good morning.","Sam Eisner","So I just wanted to discuss ceramic was a little bit lighter than our expectations. For the print, obviously we recognize there is a bunch of things going on in that segment. Can you maybe discuss mix as it relates to that segment? Where there any trends that you saw that might have constrained the profitability there? And then, ultimately, how are you thinking about mix looking out to 2017?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Let me say that some of the pricing differences in the North American market [indiscernible] others. There\u2019s channel mix that changes and right now the new construction builder markets are increasing faster than the remodeling, which tends to have higher margins and more differentiation in them. So the channel mix is impacting it. From our standpoint though, I have to tell you, we are in line with where we thought we would be. We continue to bring out new product and innovation, and we continue to find ways to improve our costs. We\u2019re bringing up new plants, the new plant in Tennessee.","I mean we put up a brand-new plant in a new geography with nobody who knew anything and it\u2019s up and running. And we think in less than six months from zero, we will be operating almost at the same efficiency level as plants we\u2019ve had for 20 years. So I mean we are really doing a lot of good things in it. We are investing in everywhere we are to put in new capacity and we think we are going along as we would like.","Sam Eisner","That\u2019s helpful. Then, Jeff, maybe given your commentary about similar levels of organic growth into 2017, if you can perhaps maybe walk around the world or talk about it on a segment basis how you are thinking about those respective businesses to kind of get to your blended, let\u2019s say, roughly 5%, 6%-ish type organic growth?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Listen, there\u2019s so many parts and pieces it\u2019s really hard because each one is different and different \u2013 you have the geographies, which the U.S. economy is doing the best of all of them. In Mexico, the Mexican ceramic flooring business has been growing dramatically the last two or three years so it\u2019s actually been growing at a higher rate than the rest of the world. Each of the product categories you have \u2013 so LVT in all marketplaces is in the infancy and is growing. It\u2019s probably, if I had to guess, in about the third or fourth inning of what\u2019s going on. So we expect to see multiple years going ahead and we\u2019ve been investing heavily.","When we get through putting in all the capacity that we have going on and get it operating, we will have over $1 billion of capacity in LVT in what we believe to be the most modern and the largest plants in the world as we go through. So we are well-positioned in the new product category within it. In ceramic, we have been limited by most of the marketplaces. We are selling almost all the capacity, so most of the improvements are coming through improvements in pieces, but also putting in new capacity. We continue to try to drive up the style and design and differentiation in all the product categories and we think that we are \u2013 in each of the categories we are bringing a lot of innovation to all the markets, which is helping us. We\u2019re in good position everywhere we are.","The really \u2013 the most \u2013 from a business position, being at the size we are at, is growing at the rates I\u2019m trying to grow the earnings over time, which is really forcing me to continue to look for these opportunities and finance all of these new things we\u2019re doing internally, as well as continue to look for new acquisitions that meet our long-term goals. We are staying disciplined and there\u2019s always new opportunities and we want to use the money to optimize the long-term profitability and shareholder return. We think we\u2019re doing the right things for the right reason and we\u2019re not going to let the money drive our decisions.","Sam Eisner","That\u2019s helpful. Maybe if I could just sneak one more here. Frank, the impact of the plant shutdown in Europe in the ceramic segment, is there a way to quantify how much that will be a drag on the first-quarter results? Thanks.","Frank Boykin","Yes, there is a way to quantify it, but that\u2019s not something we are prepared to disclose. We have built that all into our forward-looking estimates.","Sam Eisner","Got it, understood. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with Barclays. Your line is open.","Mike Dahl","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start with a question around the ceramic acquisition and so it sounds like mill ceramic has relatively similar margin profile as your existing business, but I was curious if you could just give us a little more color on the strategic rationale and what made this a good fit. What do they do differently than you and where can you kind of leverage your expertise to help drive additional business or margin opportunity for them?","Jeff Lorberbaum","First of all, the business is focused on the mid to higher segments of the marketplace, similar to ours. The location of the business is like an almost across the street, so there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to utilize the knowledge between the businesses as we go through. Their distribution is much more limited than ours and their product offering is much more limited than ours. We think that we can improve both and give them a broader product line and increase the distribution of it through the marketplace.","They have relationships that we don\u2019t have, which will allow us to push products into those groups that we haven\u2019t done before. We think that there is opportunities to utilize the assets over time and reduce the complexity of individual assets across the business by specializing them more, making them part of a bigger piece as we go through. Every acquisition that we buy we learn something from. They have good style and design in the business.","We think we can add their capabilities to ours and improve it. And like everything else, we are prepared to invest in their assets and their business to improve it. So it\u2019s the same thing we\u2019ve done about, I think, 35 times and we\u2019re going to do it another 35 times.","Mike Dahl","Great, thanks. And then sticking with ceramic, but shifting over to Mexico and the capacity there; I think you made a comment that part of the reason for expanding the capacity and staffing up sales a bit more is to start exporting to Central and South America. Can you provide us any sort of color on sizing up that market opportunity and how you see that playing out over the next couple of years?","Frank Boykin","I think it\u2019s two separate pieces. One is we are putting in a significant amount of capacity to Mexico. Within that one, we are going to first try to utilize it in the Mexican marketplace. At the same time, we\u2019re going to put salespeople into the South American market to start developing new accounts and new business down there. And then long-term, the question is, is there a way to enter the marketplace and build a larger presence in Central and South America than we have? I think that would be a good thing over time.","Mike Dahl","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Scott Rednor","Hi, good morning, thanks for squeezing me in. Jeff, if you look at any of the flooring stats this year, growth is going be around 2% to 3%, plus or minus. And you guys are growing 6% or double that and you are guiding to a similar level next year. So can you maybe just give us some color on why you think you are growing faster than the market and how long that can continue?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Sure. I think that our growth rate is probably close to 4% for this year, but I\u2019m not sure exactly \u2013 3% to 4% we think, for the market is it. Listen, I mean I don\u2019t know anybody in the industry that\u2019s investing like we are. And we are investing in product \u2013 in equipment to increase the piece. We are investing in ways of differentiating the products. We are investing in differentiation and new products. We are investing in sales and marketing to help our customers sell them through better.","We have an infrastructure second to none and I think that all that\u2019s helping us. At the same time, there are growth areas and growth areas like LVT. We put money in to grow our LVT business and the acquisition that we bought a couple years ago put us in a different spot that everybody else. And then we are investing in it at really high rates to expand everything. In the U.S. and Europe we are building new plants. We\u2019re putting a new sheet vinyl plant in Russia; just using that as a foundation to step off of.","So I don\u2019t believe there is a more aggressive company. I don\u2019t believe that any other companies have the organization and infrastructure that we have to drive it. It\u2019s basically repeating the same thing \u2013 we\u2019ve learned the lessons over the last 20 years \u2013 and driving it. Then the balance sheet we have to allow us to do that at the costs we are doing; our average interest costs today are somewhere around 1.5%. So not only do we have the ability to get it, we have low cost of credit which are also helping us. I wouldn\u2019t trade my position with anybody in the world today.","Scott Rednor","Fair enough. And then one other one. Recognizing there\u2019s a lot of variability, but just \u2013 obviously there\u2019s discussion about border tax and if there were to be some kind of adjustment. Maybe you guys could just frame how investors could think about that. Do you view it as a risk? I\u2019m sure you guys are thinking about it internally as well.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Listen, everything is a risk. But when you look at it, if there are tariffs on imports, we primarily manufacture our U.S. products in the United States and we have the largest capacity in all the categories of anybody. So if it\u2019s going to be advantaged to being a local producer, we are in a position to take advantage of it better than anybody else. We have the capability of expanding our businesses and capacity, if it makes sense; if the market changes and imports are less advantageous to be here. And we have the people in order to execute it. So if it\u2019s advantageous to do more here, we are first in line to do it.","Scott Rednor","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","Yes. Congratulations on all the progress. Can you talk about your labor situation in the U.S.? With an expanding manufacturing footprint, are you feeling a tightness in labor availability? And if so, to what extent will that be potential margin headwind over the next couple years? I realize you are investing pretty aggressively in kind of advanced manufacturing technologies. Is that what saves you here or \u2013 can you just talk about potential risk to the margin story on labor?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The increase in labor \u2013 presently labor rates is somewhere approximately 3% a year and I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to increase or not. It was a little less during the downturn, but it has remained somewhere around there. As labor gets tighter, you have more turnover in the workforce so there\u2019s more training costs and things going in. We think that we have built the organization so we become one of the preferred people that \u2013 companies that people want to work for as we go through.","On the other hand, we are investing in automation every place that we can find it to minimize the requirement for labor as we go through. And we think we are well-positioned to handle whatever comes up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Lovallo","Hey, guys thanks for fitting me in here. I guess the first question is what were the startup costs in 2016, if any? In other words, the $45 million that you guys are expecting in 2017, how much of that is incremental? And then how should we think about that in terms of the segments, the mix in the segments?","Frank Boykin","It was $21 million in 2016 and I have to get back to you on how it is allocated among the three segments.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The incremental piece will be the difference between that and the $45 million. The $45 million is not an exact number, gentlemen. There\u2019s a huge number of variables and pieces, but it\u2019s our best guess and some of that is being spent on increasing the sales and marketing to drive the volume to fill up those plants. All that expense comes in front of the sales and revenues.","John Lovallo","Got it. Then when we think about these, just the raw material basket for carpet, how much of the raw materials are influenced by the price of oil? What percentage?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We use different raw materials; there\u2019s different influences in them. The higher-end raw materials, the higher-end products tend to have more up-and-down related to oil. In ours we are using recycled soda bottles in the polyester pieces on the other and so \u2013 but even with that, when the alternatives go up and down, the bottles tend to follow the prices up and down. So even though they are not directly, it\u2019s got to do with the relationships between them.","But in addition to oil, there\u2019s also gas and then you also have the intermediate capacity between it is as much influence in the short term. So you get tightness of capacity in some of the chemical processes and the prices can go up dramatically. But then the question is how long they stay or not is dependent upon the supply and demand of it and we have to manage within those things.","John Lovallo","Okay, great. Then quickly, Frank, did you give \u2013 I may have missed this, but \u2013 a corporate expense estimate for 2017?","Frank Boykin","It should be in line with the number that we had for 2016.","John Lovallo","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions today. For the North American carpet business, just a follow-up from earlier question. You noted some drag from mix in the quarter. Could you give us a better sense of how much of that breakout is from poly versus gaining share in big box in 2016?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We don\u2019t break it out those details, but there is a mix change and there is the move to polyester. And then you still have left \u2013 you still have the industry passed through the declining raw materials during last year and so as the materials declined, the average prices in the industry went down, which lowered the average prices, which also necessitating the increase in prices that we are doing now. If we were smarter, we wouldn\u2019t have done that.","Kathryn Thompson","Understood, understood. Not to beat the dead horse with the estimated $45 million for startup in 2017, but maybe thinking about it differently in terms of just the physical plant versus all the other. Are you able to break out in rough percentages how much of that $45 million is just physical plant in your estimation versus all the other type of startup?","Frank Boykin","We do have it, not here in front of me, but there are estimates of everything. What the startup costs are \u2013 we start with the physical building of the plant and the machinery. Now all those costs get capitalized until you turn the machine on and turn it over to the manufacturing group to utilize it. So all the costs related to building it go into \u2013 get capitalized in the equipment.","Now once you give it to the manufacturing group and say produce product on it, all the expenses of underutilization of the equipment, product yields that aren\u2019t what you want, fixing things that happened, training labor as you go through, all those costs are in startup. As well as some of the things we put in, is also is we put on salespeople to sell it. We have to start selling it before the sales come up so we have sales and investments in samples that all go into the piece and orders so that you can utilize the thing as quickly as possible.","Now once it ramps up to a certain point, all those disappear and you breakeven. Then when you move it on up you start making significant returns on your investment.","Kathryn Thompson","Understood. I will follow-up on that after the call. Final question for your European carpet tile expansion. I assume as you are approaching to enter that market, just your softening the bottom. Are you already selling some product as you soften the market in advance of opening that plant?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We are starting right now introducing carpet tile manufactured in the United States and selling it over there in order to get prepared for the plant being up and running maybe the end of this year, so for next year. Then switching those sales into locally produced products.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Stephen East","Thank you. Good morning, Jeff and Frank. Jeff, early on in your prepared remarks you talk about how much CapEx you are spending and it will drive about $1.4 billion in revenues or so over the next several years. That\u2019s a huge number, but then when I look at where you are starting from, if you do it over the next three or four years, it\u2019s about a 15% increase from where you are today. So it almost \u2013 it\u2019s almost as if you are keeping pace with the market. And I know that is distinctly not in your DNA to keep pace with the market, so am I thinking about this incorrectly or? Can you help me out here that?","Jeff Lorberbaum","You start out with first you have to assume there\u2019s some excess capacity in what I have, so that\u2019s in addition to it.","Stephen East","Okay.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Then you have to add that. And then the question is how long does it take to fill it up? My goal is to fill it up as soon as possible and we will have to see how long it takes.","Stephen East","All right, fair enough.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Then one more, you\u2019re also assuming that it stops. You\u2019re taking it and saying this is all we are going to do. If the industry and the world looks good, we\u2019re going to keep adding more capacity going forward. So it\u2019s not the end, it\u2019s just the intermediate step.","Stephen East","And that was my follow-on question. As you look at $670 million, $750 million, is this sort of the new world order for you all on CapEx?","Jeff Lorberbaum","That depends how much growth we can create and how many ideas we can come up with and how much the market will allow us to sustain. And then it\u2019s also going to be dependent on what alternatives we find for acquisitions and how those work.","Stephen East","Fair enough.","Jeff Lorberbaum","But listen, this amount of investment is not to maintain the business as it is.","Stephen East","Yes, got you, okay. Then as you looked at your North American sales you made the comment that commercial was stronger than residential. And as I think about the mix more broadly, with new construction up 10% to 12% or so and R&R seeming to be up mid single-digits, I guess it surprised me a little bit that commercial continues to run ahead of residential. Could you just talk about what you think is going on with you all there and why commercial continues to run like it is?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Remember in our commercial business you also have \u2013 LVT is also being sold in commercial, so that\u2019s helping. My ceramic business is there, so I think we\u2019re doing better than the market is on an average. At the same time, we\u2019ve been driving carpet innovation in carpet tiles. Our carpet tile we think we are doing better than everyone else. Listen, my goal isn\u2019t to do what everyone else does.","Stephen East","All right. And then one last quick one. You said productivity improvements above 216. Are we talking just minimally above? Are we talking significant changes? How should we think about it?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Listen, the reason we are giving you as much information \u2013 given the drop off in IP, we are really giving you a much more forward view than we have and I think people look at the productivity and they say that was last year and it\u2019s going to go down. What you\u2019re telling you is all these investments in equipment, process innovation, and methodology our expectation is for next year to continue up. I mean these are high rates that we are doing and we think they\u2019re going to continue this year, even better.","Stephen East","Thank you, I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Sam Darkatsh","Hey, Jeff, Frank, how are you? Hope you well. Just a couple of clarification questions, if I could, piggybacking a little bit on Stephen East\u2019s topic there around productivity. I think, Frank, if my math is right, I think you all spent of the $670 million in CapEx in 2016, I think you spent about $180 million to $200 million specific to productivity. What does that number look like, ballpark, within the $750 million in CapEx in 2017? And are you still looking at a three- to five-year payback on productivity efforts as it stands right now?","Frank Boykin","Yes. I don\u2019t have that number in front of me, Sam.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Listen, we give you a few more numbers, they won\u2019t need you.","Sam Darkatsh","Fair point. Although, arguably, they already don\u2019t need me, but that\u2019s okay. Then the last question, if I could, are you anticipating that price increase efforts or price hike efforts are going to fully offset raw material inflation or is there some sort of a negative\/positive ARB that is expected here in 2017?","Frank Boykin","Our goal is to try to offset them, but depending on the volatility and what happens \u2013 we see what happens, but that\u2019s our goal.","Sam Darkatsh","Okay, very good. Have a terrific weekend, thank you.","Frank Boykin","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Your line is open.","Eric Bosshard","Good morning. A clarification and then a question. The clarification is the acquisition which looks likes it\u2019s maybe $25 million of EBIT, that\u2019s not in the guidance; that\u2019s correct?","Frank Boykin","You have that correct.","Eric Bosshard","Okay. And then, on the business, the two things I\u2019m curious on. One is the price and mix trends you are seeing \u2013 specifically in carpet and in tile, what you are seeing going on with price receptivity on price increases in mix. And then, secondly, the 7% growth. It sounds like you didn\u2019t have a great start to the quarter and so if you could just give us some thoughts about the strength of the quarter and what was driving that and then the sustainability of that.","Frank Boykin","Let\u2019s I will start with the last one and we will work our way back. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right or not; I think that the election when it started and all the attention on it, what was going on, I think it impacted people\u2019s confidence in what was happening. Once the election was over it appeared that people started spending a little more and the confidence improved. The mix in carpet is \u2013 as the raw materials declined starting about the year before in 2015, the industry started reducing prices and passing it through. And that continued all the way through the year.","Then the same thing happened with \u2013 as that was happening, you still had the continuous increase in polyester, which was substituting for higher-value nylon products and so that also impacted the mix. Then the channel mix between the builder business being better than the remodeling business, all those things influence the mix. Now at the same time, we are taking actions to try to improve our position through improved product innovation, introducing new products that are different, to upgrade our sales with it, which is helping.","We talked about new introductions to continue it going through the year, of introducing newer softer carpets, of introducing newer type of carpets and backing, of expanding our Karastan higher end. So we are trying to have a better mix in the industry as a whole in all the product categories and it\u2019s coming from significant investments, both in equipment as well as people and innovative ideas. We are doing things and taking some risks. When you do new things on the outer edge, they don\u2019t all pay off, but you have to do a number of them to find ones that really work well and I think that we are spending more money in doing those things and bringing more to the marketplace than anybody else.","Eric Bosshard","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Roe Equity Research. Your line is open.","Laura Champine","Good afternoon. Wondering just quickly approximately what percentage of Mohawk sales are \u2013 come from products that are made in Mexico and sold in the U.S. and how is that changing.","Jeff Lorberbaum","It\u2019s a small percentage. Basically, what\u2019s coming from Mexico is we are sending some ceramic from Mexico into the United States. As our Mexican business has grown, we have used the capacity down in Mexico. The new plant that came up in the United States that provided more supply here and we\u2019ve even put more of it down there, so it\u2019s getting to be a smaller and smaller portion as we go through. The Mexican market has been growing rapidly, so it\u2019s a limited portion of the whole business. Now just to remind you, almost 50% of the U.S. ceramic comes from somewhere else in the world. We have, by far, the most capacity in the United States. And any changes it may hurt us a little bit, but it\u2019s going to hurt the rest of the industry dramatically more than we are and create great opportunities for us.","Laura Champine","Got it. And then you\u2019ve obviously been spending an elevated level of CapEx this year and last year. Where do you think long-term CapEx spending should be approximately as a percentage of sales?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It depends on our ability to keep growing. When I look at my use of capital, if I could find ideas to spend all my capital on new projects and new businesses internally done, I would spend it because \u2013 You guys tend to focus short term. And in the first year to two years I may have a negative impact on my earnings in those years from all these startups and pieces you go through, but in years two, three, four, five the impact is dramatically much better. So anything that my organization can come up with to grow the business to go into new markets to try new things internally, I\u2019m supporting them and I will continue to.","Laura Champine","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes form the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Obviously strong quarter. I wanted to drill a little bit more into this \u2013 the growth CapEx driving potentially $1.4 billion in product sales and what\u2019s sort of in that. I guess basically as we think about the sales, eventual sales ramp up for those assets, I\u2019m trying to get a sense for \u2013 by the time you, let\u2019s say, exit 2018 would it be a reasonable assumption that maybe two-thirds or so of that $1.4 billion we might be actually witnessing that on the sales line. Is there \u2013 can you give us a sense for like how that might be spread by segment? Will it be pretty evenly across the segment or is one sticking out in your mind as getting a bigger share of that increase?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I can\u2019t answer the question you have. If you think through the list of things I gave you that we were doing and that\u2019s only the really big ones. There\u2019s a bunch more underneath those that are smaller as you go through. Now each one of them is different. Where we go into I will take extremes. We are going to go into the sheet vinyl business in Russia. That\u2019s going to ramp up slower because we don\u2019t have a big base and we\u2019re going to have to ramp it up over time versus if I put a ceramic piece in Mexico, where the market is growing rapidly my market share is growing rapidly, that one will ramp up very quickly. And there is everywhere between those two extremes.","Stephen Kim","Got it. Then just to clarify the amount. I know that when you were talking earlier you were \u2013 we were talking about the opportunities for growth beyond the $1.4 billion, because obviously you\u2019ve got capacity and things like that that you\u2019ve already got still to load. I will was also thinking about price. I know that price mix and just price in general is something that also is happening in the business and sort of mix shift to higher-priced products, particularly in ceramic, we\u2019ve seen. Is there any price growth assumed in that $1.4 billion? Should we generally be thinking that price and positive price mix should be incremental to that $1.4 billion?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We just took in the $1.4 billion we just assumed that we would utilize the capacity at approximately the same mix that we are running today. It\u2019s a rough estimate of what that would be. There is a million variables that will impact it before you get there and use it. You take things like LVT. As the LVT market matures, we have built in our assumptions a decreasing price over time. Now it may decrease more than we think or it may decrease less. Who knows?","Stephen Kim","Yes. Then shifting gears here in the North American flooring business, one of the things you\u2019ve talked a little bit about was your recycling program. My understanding is that is something that has been going very well for you and, if anything, you\u2019ve been expanding that. But you are already recycling a pretty large share of the bottles in this country and I was curious as to whether you think there\u2019s any risk to your ability to expand this program as you go forward.","Frank Boykin","Well, let\u2019s see. We are installing now another increment to increase and we believe that we can get the material to supply it. So we are putting an increment in and it will be operating by the second quarter, I believe is it. At all points in time, in that piece just like others, there is users that are being added and there\u2019s also users that fall out. People don\u2019t have economic ways of using it as they go through. It\u2019s not all one way. There are people whose economics are bad. They come in and out. There\u2019s also parts of it that are shipped overseas. There\u2019s also different grades of bottles that can come through and use.","The bottles have to trade over longer periods of time at some economic value that doesn\u2019t cost more than virgin or else you\u2019re better off doing something else without the investments. Now they tend to trade up and down, and as the market changes over time, I still think they are only gathering about 35%, 40% of all the bottles used in the country. So the question is as the demand increases you think there\u2019s ways to get some portion of the rest?","Stephen Kim","Okay. Then you made a comment there about the comparability of the raw material that you get from your recycled program versus virgin. One of the things that I had heard and I was curious as whether you could confirm or deny it, but the product \u2013 the raw material embedded in the plastic bottles as technology has changed has actually improved. So the quality is actually today from a recycled bottle, the polyethylene that comes out of that, is actually a higher quality than what you would get in virgin. That perhaps there are ways to utilize that. Is that \u2013 am I my thinking about that correctly?","Jeff Lorberbaum","They have to use more expensive raw materials to make bottles than you do to make carpet fibers. So when we start with that we are starting with a higher quality resin than is typically used in it, but there\u2019s all kinds of other variables in it. We think that we bring to the marketplace a recycled story. We think that we bring innovation in the products and we think that the marketing avenue of being able to say that you are helping the environment, consumers like that. So we think it\u2019s a good thing to do.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Mr. Boykin, you may begin your conference.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries quarterly investor conference call. Today, we\u2019ll update you on the Company\u2019s results for the first quarter 2017 and provide guidance for the second quarter.","I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers.

Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. In the first quarter Mohawk sales rose approximately 4% on a constant days and local currency basis to a first quarter record of $2.2 billion was flooring North America and rest of world outpacing global ceramic growth. Operating income grew 12% to about $275 million and our operating margin 12.4%, up 110 basis points over the prior year due to volume mix and productivity, adding $60 million to operating income. Both our operating income and margin were first quarter records.","During the period material costs increased across our portfolio and we initiated price increases that should cover our material costs in the third quarter. This year around the world we plan to invest more than $750 million to expand our ceramic, carpet, laminate and LVT as well as our sheet vinyl and wood. The utilize this capacity we will invest more in marketing and start-up cost this year with the fourth quarter investment being the highest.","In addition, we are entering the European carpet tile and countertop market as well as the Russian sheet vinyl business. In April, we completed the acquisition of two small ceramic manufacturers in Europe and a carpet nylon polymerization plant in the U.S.; in May, we anticipate purchasing a mine for our U.S. ceramic operations. The price for these will be about $270 million plus future investments to optimize them.","In the U.S. consumer confidence rose in March to the highest level since 2000 supported by job and wage growth. The National Association of Realtor reported March existing home sales improved to the highest level in more than 10 years. In March new home starts increased 9% and have home prices continue to rise. Harbors LIRA Index is forecasting home remodeling growth of 7% this year.","In the first quarter the AIA reported strong commercial inquiries and architectural index is projecting higher growth. The European recovery is gaining traction in the EU is forecasting expansion for all countries in 2017 and 2018. In Russia, GDP in the fourth quarter increased for the first time in two years and could indicate a recovery.","With that, let\u2019s turn to our first quarter results by segment. During the quarter, our Global Ceramic segment increased 2% as reported and on a constant days and currency basis. With operating margins rising 15%, a 190 basis point improvement. Growth slowed in the period due to customer inventory adjustments and postpone product trends actions in North America, extreme weather in Russia and Eastern Europe and a weaker Mexican peso.","Purchasing patterns have now returned to normal and our sales growth is increasing. To recover increasing cost, we announced the general price increase in North America, which should be implemented by the end of the second quarter. Our recent investments in our North American ceramic business will propel our growth through the remainder of the year.","In the U.S. this year, we are planning to open 18 to 20 new ceramic tile or stone centers to expand our distribution. Statement, our shop within a shot concept is being expanded among leading ceramic retailers. We have increased our regional and national homebuilder relationships by providing them a complete product offering that satisfies all of their needs.","Our distributors are embracing our new product launches and replacing other imports with unique collections acquired directly from our Italian operations. Our new Tennessee facility is operating at planned volume and quality levels, and we are using the plant's advanced technology to introduce premium products, such as sophisticated metallic and glazed color body collections.","We are increasing our countertop sales, as we open additional service centers and expand our product offering including porcelain countertops from Italy. We are upgrading our floor and wall tile offering in the home center channels to address evolving consumer preferences.","Our ceramic sales in Mexico continued to outpace the growing market, but are limited by our current capacity. To utilize additional capacity coming from our seller market expansion later this year, we are developing new collections in distribution as well as adding South American customers to expand our geographic reach.","In Europe, our ceramic business increased our profitability as a result of improved product mix, productivity, and equipment upgrades. Severe weather in Eastern Europe lowered our sales growth, which is now returned to normal. Our innovative new products are being well accepted by the market, enhancing our distribution, and improving our average selling price. Our new product development and sales processes activated our spring collections earlier and we train more retail salespeople to promote these new offerings.","Upgrades to our commercial technical plant are progressing as planned with incremental production starting in May and continuing to expand through the end of July. We have successfully implemented our Italian information system and our Bulgarian business to improve our efficiency, controls, and service. Additional enhancements will be executed over the next year.","Multiple equipment upgrades are being installed in Italy and Bulgaria to enhance our product offering and reduce our cost further. We completed our previously announced ceramic acquisition in Italy and the purchase of a small Polish ceramic operation. We are initiating strategies to enhance product offerings, improve efficiencies, and expand sales in both companies. In the last quarter of 2016, the Russian economy realizes its first GDP growth in two years, which could be an indication of a recovery.","Since the downturn, the Russian ceramic market has declined almost 30%, while we have increased our market share and capacity. With the investments we have made, our domestic ceramic collections with award winning designs and large sizes up to 10 feet long are replacing premium imported products. During the quarter, sales in our flooring North America segment increased 4% as reported, are over 5% on a constant basis with hard surface sales continuing to outpace our carpet category.","The segment's operating margin increased to 10%, up 150 basis points over the prior year. Our raw materials have risen. And we are increasing prices as necessary. Our residential carpet sales performed well during the period, with ongoing strength from our proprietary SmartStrand franchise. During the quarter, we introduced SmartStrand Silk Reserve, the next generation of ultra-soft carpet. This is the third addition of our exclusive fiber system, which has extended our leadership in premium carpet.","We are adding unique products and specialized sales personnel to expand our Main Street commercial and high-end Kyrgyzstan collections. In the middle price points, sales of our continuing polyester offerings are growing with their differentiated feel, performance and value. Our revolutionary new Aero product changes the way soft flooring is manufactured, installed, and recycled.","Aero\u2019s luxurious feel and unique construction is being well received as an innovative alternative to traditional soft flooring. Our commercial carpet bookings improved during the period. Those shipments were postponed due to the timing. We are adding commercial sales personnel to target key regions and channels. We are growing our participation with both large U.S. and international accounts.","We anticipate continued sales improvement from our new tufted, printed and woven technologies and we are extending our design leadership in carpet tile. We are integrating our soft and hard surface offerings to provide architects and designers with more appealing combinations that satisfied our client needs.","Sales of our hard surface products continue to expand at a higher rate with our LVT and premium laminate growing the fastest. With their superior design performance, our flexible, rigid and commercial LVT collections are being well accepted across all channels. The continued improvement of our LVT manufacturing process is increasing our capacity and margins. Construction of our new LVT line will begin this quarter and we anticipate start up in the fourth quarter.","Our sheet vinyl sales strategy has improved our position with Mohawk retailers, independent distributors and home centers. We\u2019ve announced a price increase in sheet vinyl that cover increasing raw material costs.","Sales of our laminate collections remained strong with our unique styling and performance features and our new production line should be operational in the fourth quarter. We have upgraded our wood offering to meet growing demand for wider planks with rich textures and sophisticated colors.","During the second period, we acquired a nylon resin plant to extend our backward integration and improve our cost position. To improve service and efficiency, we closed the carpet dyeing operation, consolidated commercial carpet facilities and rationalized wood plan, while increasing our other engineered wood capacity.","Across the segment, we have multiple new investments in various stages of implementation to introduce innovative products and capacity and improve our profitability. For the quarter, our Flooring Rest of the World segment sales were up about 3% on a local basis and constant days. The segment\u2019s operating margin was down versus the prior year due to higher material costs and currency changes.","We are increasing prices across most product categories to offset higher material costs, which should cover the costs in the third quarter. To utilize our upcoming LVT laminate sheets vinyl and carpet tile expansions. We're investing a more sales, marketing and product development during the year.","All of our LVT brands grew significantly during the period as we increase our production and expanded our distribution and product offering. Our new LVT product introductions are being well received across all channels, due to the unique design and performance attributes.","We are reducing our costs as we improve our line speeds efficiencies and yields. Construction has begun for a new LVT production line, which is start up in the fourth quarter, expanding our product offering in both flexible and rigid LVT. Our sheet vinyl sales lag compared to last year as low inventories from earlier plant disruptions limited our service.","We anticipate normalized sheet vinyl sales in the second quarter. We have identified a location in Russia for our new sheet vinyl plant, which should be operational by early next year. Our laminate production in Europe is running at capacity and we're preparing for the installation of new equipment that will give us additional capacities to extend our lead in the category.","To meet growing demand, we're also expanding our Russian laminate operation, which is presently fully utilized. Our impressive collection as refined the premium, laminate category with its unique water resistance and deeply textured services and has now become our largest selling product in the category.","Our wood margins have increased as we enhance the visuals of our wider planks and install state-of-the-art equipment to improve our yields and efficiencies. Our insulation board sales continued to increase during the period. However, shortages in key materials are dramatically increasing our costs and impacting our production volume. We are aggressively raising prices to offset the costs we are incurring.","Our wood panel sales are growing and our margins are expanding, as we improve our mix, capacity and costs. We are preparing an existing site for our new Belgium carpet tile plant, which should be operational by the first of next year.","I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $2.221 billion, up 2% as reported or up 4% on a constant days and FX basis with the strongest growth in the Flooring North American segment. Our gross margin as reported was 30.6%, excluding non-recurring items the margin was 30.8%, up 110 basis points. With the improvement from productivity of $36 million, volume of $14 million and price mix of $10 million, offsetting input cost inflation of $22 million.","SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 18.3% as reported or 18.2% excluding charges. The percentage was flat to last year as we continue to invest in the sales and marketing to grow our business. And usual charges of $4 million were primarily related to the plant consolidation in the flooring North American and continuing consolidation integration and flooring rest of world.","Operating margin, excluding charges was 12.6%. This is 100 basis point improvement over last year. This includes productivity of $41 million, volume of $9 million in price mix of $9 million. All impacting our margin positively and offsetting input cost inflation of $22 million. Our interest expense was $8 million a decrease from last year as we leveraged our lower rate commercial paper program.","We estimate total year interest expense of about $30 million including our announced acquisitions. Other income loss was a loss of $2 million with transactional FX impact in the results over last year. Our income tax rate for the quarter was 25.6% and that compares to 25.4% last year. We expect the rate to be between 26% and 26.5% for the second quarter. Our earnings per share, excluding charges was $2.72 an increase of 14% over last year.","Moving to the segments. In the Global Ceramic segment sales were $785 million that's up 2% both as reported and on a constant basis as weather and customer product transitions impacted our results. Our operating income margin excluding charges was 14.8% or 180 basis points over last year. The primary factors for the increase were productivity of $19 million and positive price mix of $5 million offsetting input cost inflation of $9 million.","In the flooring North American segment sales as reported were $939 million, a 4% increase or 5% up using constant days. As Jeff mentioned flooring North America is implemented to carpet price increases to compensate for inflation. LVT continues to be the highest growth product category here. Our operating income margin excluding charges was 10.1%, up 140 basis points improvement was supported by productivity of $13 million and volume of $5 million.","In the flooring rest of world segment, sales as reported were $496 million, up 1% or up 3% using constant days in exchange rates. All product categories grew as LVT turned in another strong performance. Our operating income margin excluding charges was 15.7%. The margin was benefited by productivity of $10 million offset by input cost inflation of $11 million in negative FX of $5 million. Price increases are being implemented in most categories to offset the inflation.","I would like to remind everyone of our IP change this year that we described last quarter. We expect our total IP to be between $65 million and $70 million this year with the annual run rate dropping to $35 million at the beginning of June. In the corporate and elimination segment the operating loss was $9 million and we expect the loss to be between $35 million and $40 million for the full-year.","Turning to the balance sheet. We had receivables of $1.498 billion with DSOs up to 54.9 days compared 52.3 days last year. This was primarily impacted by channel mix. Inventories were $1.741 billion with inventory days at 110 compared to 107 days last year impacted by geographic expansion and product growth. Fixed assets were $3.5 billion and included first quarter capital expenditures of $201 million with depreciation and amortization of $105 million.","We're currently estimating full-year CapEx of $750 million with DNA of almost $450 million. We do expect the CapEx spend increase with acquisitions and additional projects, but we haven't finalized the number. Long-term debt was $2.6 billion and our leverage was at 1.4 times debt to EBITDA.","With that, I will turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. We remain optimistic about the economy, the flooring industry, and Mohawk\u2019s potential. Our second quarter sales growth should accelerate sequentially on a local basis and our operating income should improve despite higher inflation, expiring patents, and a weaker British pound.","We are implementing product price increases across the enterprise due to escalating material costs. Our capital investments and process improvements will continue to yield higher productivity. This quarter we will finalize four acquisitions that will broaden our product offering, geographic penetration, and competitive position. Taking all this into account, our adjusted EPS for the second quarter is $3.53 to $3.62 including our acquisitions.","In the third quarter, higher pricing and productivity as well as lower currency headwind should improve our results. As we stated last quarter, this year\u2019s sales growth prior to acquisition will be similar to last year's level, and our adjusted operating margin will increase slightly. We are investing at record levels, absorbing startup and marketing cost this year to enhance our long-term growth and make Mohawk a more profitable Company.","We will be now glad to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Bob Wetenhall","Hey, good morning. Thanks for all the color and granularity. I guess this is more for Frank. I was hoping you could talk about core profitability and the reason I'm asking about it is you have a lot of moving pieces, you're calling out start-up costs related to plant openings, increased spend on marketing, you're losing IP operating income and there's also FX headwinds. So there are bunch of moving pieces, but if you look at the business and try to isolate price versus cost and all the productivity improvement, I'm just trying to understand directionally speaking which way operating margins go into each of the segments, once you take out some of the non-recurring items?","Frank Boykin","Sure, I'll be glad to address that. Our business is improving significantly this year without start-up cost in IP. We have not changed our annual outlook and with the four acquisitions, we'll add another $0.15 a share to EPS this year. We still maintained that our 2017 sales will increase 5.5% and operating margins will improve slightly even with start-up cost IP and some pretty high inflation.","Bob Wetenhall","With that being said, can you talk to me a little bit about the pace in cadence the profitability in 2Q and 3Q just because Jeff gave your updated outlook for second quarter EPS? Is there going to be \u2013 how do we think about profit margin moving in 2Q and 3Q, given what you're talking about price increases coming, loss of IP in rest of world, and then kind of maybe moderating FX headwinds in the third quarter. I'm just trying to put it together to get a more. It seems like there is a bunch of moving pieces, some are transitory. There is some movement in the P&L. I'm trying to understand how to think 2Q versus 3Q specifically. Thanks for the help.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Sure. Let me take a shy at it. So in the second quarter profitability is going to be negatively impacted by the British pound and inflation \u2013 with inflation across the business impacting us. Our third quarter operating income was going to increase sequentially over the second quarter and that's going to be driven by price increases and productivity with more of the productivity for the full-year impacting the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we are going to incur higher start-up costs from investments.","Frank Boykin","Listen, it seems to be so much focus on the quarters. I just want to make sure that we're not missing how we are strengthening our business in total. We're going into new products and geographies. We're expanding our production across the world. We're doing all the right things to enhance the profitability. This is really the same strategy we've been using to compound our shareholder return by over 25% over the last five years. I mean we're really doing the right things to make that business grow.","Bob Wetenhall","With that being said and that's what I was trying to get at essentially with what you're seeing year-to-date and your expectations based on what Frank outlined just now stepping through the next couple of quarters? Are you tracking today based on where you expect it to be at the start of the year or as what you're seeing in the marketplace across your different product categories consistent with your expectations and from an execution standpoint, are you delivering based on your plan ahead of it or behind it? Thanks and good luck.","Jeff Lorberbaum","As I really think we're doing better than the plant because we have all this inflation, we hadn't anticipated. There is significant pricing mix in the lag between the pricing and the costs we\u2019re incurring. So we've overcome all those and we're still going to hit where we started the first of the year. I mean we're doing really well in our execution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Yes, thanks very much guys. Appreciate it. Yes, so I wanted to talk a little bit if I could about the productivity. I don't think you mentioned in your release, the $140 million or better than the $140 million productivity, which you did last year. Want to make sure that that was something that you still felt strongly about and the $36 million of productivity you recorded, I think actually $41 million, I think you recorded in the first quarter.","How should we think about that number going through the year? Will it be sharply weighted towards increasing in the back half of the year or is going to take a step down significantly in Q2 because of the factors we\u2019re talking about? Just give us a sense for how that may flow year-over-year?","Frank Boykin","Yes, first just a kind of level set it. We have hundreds of projects that are driving that productivity both capital expenditures as well as process improvement. So a lot of moving parts and it's hard to say precisely how much productivity we're going to add in one quarter versus the other.","But right now as we look at the timing for those productivity improvements as they roll out through the year, we would expect to see, as I mentioned before, higher productivity improvements in the third quarter compared to the other three quarters. And your point earlier Steve, the point we had made last time, last quarter on the call that productivity for the full-year will be greater than the $140 million for last year, we still stand by that.","Jeff Lorberbaum","And don\u2019t forget where they went to review it, all the different projects you heard coming up in the fourth quarter is going to have a higher percentage of the startup costs in the fourth quarter than the prior quarters.","Stephen Kim","Great, that\u2019s really encouraging. I guess a lot of other things we could ask about. But let me ask about your net price input headwind. In the first quarter it looked like it was about $13 million, we know that you're going to recover that in the back half of the year, you\u2019re very clear about that.","I was curious about two things. One, in the second quarter, we know there\u2019s going to be a little bit of a gap there. Could we see that net headwind of $13 million? I mean could be like meaningfully higher like maybe double, like $25 million, $30 million of a net headwind between price and input. And for the year, do you expect the back half to be able to recover some of the headwind that you have in the first half or is the back half just could be kind of a net neutral in the year will be negative by the amount of the first half is negative.","Frank Boykin","You exceeded your questions, with that one question. Let me take a shot and then Jeff will finish with that. It will \u2013 the raw material inflation will be more significant in the third and fourth \u2013 second, third and fourth quarters. We won\u2019t cover it all with the second quarter, but we will cover it all with the third and the fourth quarters.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I forgot the rest of the question.","Stephen Kim","Basically what I was trying to figure out is, when we look at the whole year, will the recovery in the second half of the year also sort of help cover what you the negatives that you absorbed in the first half or is the back half just going to be kind of like breakeven in terms of price and input?","Jeff Lorberbaum","There is a lot of inflation going on of different types, labor, energy and the pieces and all flow-through. We think we had enough price to cover most of that. We always contribute some of the productivity and other things. We also contribute to offset some of it, it's not as black and white as you're asking the question.","Stephen Kim","Okay.","Frank Boykin","I mean I think the more important point is the comment that Jeff made before we started the questions is that we think even with all this inflation when we get to the end of the year, we're still going to be where we thought we\u2019re going to be at the beginning of the year.","Stephen Kim","Right. Got that. Thanks guys.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Stephen East","Thank you and good morning, guys. Frank, maybe I'll ask you your core growth of 5%. Could you break that down for us as we go through the year between price mix and volume and maybe just give us a little indication of which segments sort of rank order your segment growth there?","Frank Boykin","That would be a lot of moving parts in the increased between now and the end of the year. And I would say that we're going to see volume growth, but we're also going to see some improvement in that topline with the price increases that we're putting in, but I don't have the data here in front I mean you give it to you that in that level of detail.","Stephen East","Okay. Is it fair to say, we think the volume would be the bigger driver that 5.5%?","Frank Boykin","Yes. And I think the other point to make on that. The cadence of that as you move through the year, as you saw in the first quarter the growth rate was lower and it should start to ratch it up in the second and then more so in the third and fourth quarters.","Stephen East","Sure. I got you. Okay, thanks. And second question, Jeff is sort of the bigger picture. I've never really seen company take the CapEx from the 2% to 7%, 8% for multiple years and truly drive the productivity like you guys haven't gotten the results that you guys have. So I wonder as you keep ongoing year-by-year. Could you talk a little bit about how you would view the risks, they're always risks of over investing getting diminishing returns. You haven\u2019t really seen that yet. I guess I'm wondering how you think about that. What specifically to your business and then maybe give us some idea of how you are what tracking mechanisms you all used to make sure that doesn't creep into the CapEx spend?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The CapEx is made up of multiple things across the world we've discussed over multiple calls. Many of our production facilities are running at or near capacity and sell in order to keep the growth of the business, we have to invest in those things to keep expanding them. In addition, the capital investments to increase our product innovation, which allows us to make more differentiated products, which allows us to participate in higher margin premium categories.","At the same time we've announced going into additional products and geographies we are not in like carpet tile we mentioned in Europe, sheet vinyl in and Russia and countertops in Italy and there's multiple of those and smaller ones we've been talk about we\u2019re putting on in order to expand our base and improve our business. We are in a cyclical business, and it does change over time, we don't see anything occurring in the foreseeable future that would slow it down from where it is. We've been through multiple downturns, we understand how to handle and what to do with them and we'll do the same we've always done when they occur.","Stephen East","Okay. As you look at your productivity side of your spend is there, can you give us maybe a peak under the covers about where it may start to show up per store what you all would be looking for from that perspective.","Jeff Lorberbaum","We\u2019ve given you a high level view that said it\u2019s going to be more than next year. We try to give you a direction over what the operating profit will be for the year and I mean it all adds up to those numbers and direction that we've given you as we go through. The productivity pieces or a combination of just innovative ideas how to do things different a one side and on the other side, it's a result of many of these acquisitions that either increase our productivity as we go through.","And then at the same time following another category you have as we introduce new products that have more differentiation and actually increase the margins of the products, which flows into the price mix category and it's a combination of managing all those things all these investments and how we're doing and the innovation that we're driving through the company is really what's enabling us to perform at levels that I don't think anybody's ever been that in our industry.","Stephen East","I would definitely agree with that last statement. So thanks a lot. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Barclays. Your line is open.","Michael Dahl","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Jeff, just a follow-up on that last comment of yours it truly is differentiated performance compared to how I think any of us have thought about the industry in the past. And if I look at your guidance for this year and what it implies for the back half of the year as far as growth ramping up. You've clearly laid out all of the capacity initiatives, the pricing initiatives, is this a period where we could be entering kind of a sustained period of high single-digit type of growth for your business from a topline standpoint compared to what historically, it was more like a low to maybe mid single-digit?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Listen that would be a favorable conclusion. I'm not sure that I have been embedded in mine that way. The business is huge at this point. It takes a lot of capital to keep growing at the rates we're in and we really look at it as a two-pronged piece. One is increasing the sales of our present businesses, improving the mix of the business, reducing the cost structures through investments and innovation at the same time continuing to find additional acquisitions that we can help and fit our strategy, and the combination of the two, we believe will allow us to continue growing at a rate much faster than the market.","Michael Dahl","Okay, thanks. As a follow-up on the acquisitions, I think you mentioned $270 million total investment plus some future spend to optimize the manufacturing. Can you help us understand from a \u2013 how these businesses are going on from. How much it has the sales and presumably since there is some investment needed to optimize they may currently be running at below company line margins, but just a little detail on the margin profile and how long it will take you to get them back up to company average?","Jeff Lorberbaum","First thing, we gave you an indication that said for the balance of the year, we expect them to add about $0.15 to earnings to give you a view of the present piece. Each one of them is different, and the biggest one is in Italy and the one in Italy is almost across the street from our present business and so combining those is basically a bolt-on business to combine the two together to enhance \u2013 to reduce the \u2013 improve the productivity and efficiencies of both businesses, putting together to broaden the distribution of the products. We have a much broader product offering and we can use our assets to give them a broader offering to their customer base.","The Polish business is really a very small plant that is really a foundation to grow a new business. The business itself is relatively small. We're going to increase the capacity of the plant. It's in a low cost labor area. It has raw materials that are almost next door to it, so you have low cost manufacturing base. We can provide it through more investments. The ability to make much higher stuff and better products, the vicinity where it's located gives you low transportation cost to get to Northern Europe and the places around and compete in a lower price points than the focus of our Southern European business today.","The other pieces are just what the other things we're buying the mine in the nylon plant are just ways of securing our raw materials at better prices and more control, and all the businesses will require investments to drive them over time. And I think we have a long history of buying businesses and improving them and it's just doing the same thing over again.","Frank Boykin","And just to remind everyone last quarter, I think we have said that the Italian ceramic business itself we\u2019re about \u20ac160 million.","Michael Dahl","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line John Baugh from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","John Baugh","Thank you and good morning. I wanted to touch on carpet I guess and you have pretty good expansion in the margin in that segment. Just curious, I\u2019m not sure you are not going to give me a number, but what overall carpet played in the margin in the quarter. The carpet is a large piece of the business. We've been investing heavily in it as we go through, you heard we have closed plants, consolidated plants, put more investments in backward integration. We're driving the productivity of the business up. We're using our product innovation to improve the mix and quality of it. I mean it's a good part of our business and we think we can keep it operating well and improvement.","Frank Boykin","So I presume given its way \u2013 it had a fairly nice margin performance year-over-year in Q1, despite implanting [indiscernible] conclusion?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It would be hard to drive the margins up dramatically without \u2013 and leads out such a large part of our business.","John Baugh","Got it, and then on the acquisition front, Jeff, what if anything are you seeing I guess as you get longer into a cycle, people tend to certainly get higher expectations. You've done some small things here, but I'm just curious what the acquisition pipeline looks like? What you're seeing from potential sellers are you just so focused on all your CapEx expansion really, really not focused there?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We continually talk to acquisition candidates. Given that our management is capable of buying things around the world. There\u2019s always people looking to do differently with the businesses. We continuously talk to ones all the time. The question really becomes the perception of value and how to get both sides together to make it work out. And sometimes that work out easily and sometimes a take a long time.","Frank Boykin","WE believe we've got both the balance sheet and the management strength to do both capital projects, as well as more acquisitions.","John Baugh","Noted, eye on that. Thanks and good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Nomura. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Mason on for Mike. What is the early read on sales in Adult Novelty plant and where is that plant stand with production efficiencies?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The existing plant continues to improve, the line speeds continue to go up. The yields continue to improve. We're focused on two things, which is driving them up even further and then putting more complexity in the plant to get more \u2013 higher value products. We're working through both of those as we speak. We have broken ground to expand the buildings to put in new line, which should be installed and starting operation by the end of the year. We think it's a good category and we intend to be a leader in it.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, and the second question, how much of \u2013 bleeds into your 2Q guidance for June. And are there any potential SG&A offsets from the royalty loss?","Frank Boykin","Not sure we understand the question, one more time.","Unidentified Analyst","How much of [indiscernible] in your Q2 guidance for June?","Frank Boykin","I mean the IP?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes.","Frank Boykin","Well, again what we said was if you do the math, the full-year will be between $65 million and $70 million. But in that run rate is going to drop to an annual run rate of $35 million starting in June 1.","Jeff Lorberbaum","We had seven months at $35 million, the difference in the two gives you the first part.","Frank Boykin","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Megan McGrath","Good morning. Just wanted to get some more detail if I could on the input cost inflation, you mentioned a couple of items, but it also sounded like you might have seen an unexpected inter quarter spike and I lose one input cost. So could you give us a little bit more detail on what you're seeing and the biggest pressure and where you've seen them kind of trend throughout the quarter if there is any sort of relief on the horizon?","Frank Boykin","I\u2019m not sure I can get the granular on every product category has inflation and more than we anticipated. The chemical-based materials are going to everything has increased the prices in everything from glue to fiber types to anything this got chemicals and it's going up. The wood prices have moved up in Europe, there is labor and energy increases across everything. And then you have currency changes that have impacted as we shift between currencies that we have to overcome.","There is in polyurethane there is actually a shortage in urethane chemicals going into it. The shortages severe the prices are going up dramatically and to the point where we actually won't be able to manufacture as much as we want. So it's across the anything and everything and everyone of the businesses is repricing the products, both on a local basis and we ship across currencies they're making adjustments for the currencies, as we go through and we believe that we'll be covering those costs in the third quarter.","Megan McGrath","Great. Thank you. Any potential impact from the proposed Canadiantariff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Listen, if you can tell me what the proposals will look like how decide what it is. The tariffs up there are on softwood and we use hardwood. And then the woods we use typically we buy in local areas because the freight so much. So that particular tariff won't impacted is it.","Megan McGrath","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Hi, thanks. Good morning, Mike Rehaut. Question around price points during the quarter, I was hoping you could speak to the relative strength as you saw in North America in terms of - I'm thinking here particularly in terms of just residential carpet and ceramic. If you could kind of talk to the relative strength of kind of the lower-end value commodity type product versus more the typical mid-price point and as well as anything on the higher end. How those different price points are trending both in carpet in ceramic?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The price points are in carpet are really hard to read when you start putting out price increases, what\u2019s you get is the high volume, more commodity products they start pre-buying and front of it and then you have to guess, how much is pre-buying how is it going to flow through.","So it's hard to see I think in general the business was probably a little softer than we had hoped that we just saw the GDP numbers come out, they were lower than we thought it would be. The remodeling business, the stronger it gets it trades at a higher price points. And then at the lower price points, you have typically the new construction of apartment businesses. So it depends on a little bit on how each of the categories are running relative to each other, is probably the biggest impact as we see.","And we also mentioned in our ceramic business, we had some unusual things with large customers postponing introductions, which impacted the piece and then we have inventory reductions going on. So there's a lot of moving parts I can't tell you that I seeing anything that dramatically change the historical trends.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. That's helpful, Jeff. And I guess secondly just looking at the three different businesses in terms of profitability. You talked obviously a lot about in the back half of the year, being able to recover the higher raw materials. How would you consider this year a bigger picture - do you feel like the raw material pressures are a little higher than normal or then in 2016 and as you go later into the cycle would you still expect to be able to more or less recover inflation through price and obviously just kind of more of a timing issue in the second quarter?","Jeff Lorberbaum","So last year you had the oil prices hit a bottom and then I came back up. So you had the prices going down and back up, is that happened. As we came to the end of the year those things were flowing through and we're guessing how those we're going to apply to the year.","So it looks like \u2013 my guess is oil looks like it's going to stay relatively in the range of that for a while you've then have the chemical companies in between that are trying to improve their margins as they go through, and I don't know enough about it to know how they're going to react in the supply and demand of those things to projected forward any better than you do. So there is a chance that we've seen the majority of the inflation. We're going to get for a while or we could be surprised. Only thing I can tell you is just like you saw us to react now, we will react to push them through to the marketplace.","Michael Rehaut","Great, thanks guys.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Eisner from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Samuel Eisner","Good morning, guys. Just on the \u2013 you cited I think across all segments there was some kind of revenue that was missed in the quarter either regards to customer inventory dynamic, the product transitions. So is there a way to put a point estimate on how much that was a drag in terms of organic growth in the quarter, dollar basis or even percentage basis. And then perhaps maybe just give a little bit more color on kind of where those customer kind of squeeze points are today?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I can't tell you what something would have been if something else didn\u2019t happen. I'm not that smart. What we said is that even though the growth rate in the first quarter was lower than our annual estimate that we think we're going to hit the annual estimate as close to of around 5.5%, which means the future quarters have to strengthen and we've said that we anticipated strengthening further as we go through the year. We have said that some of our product categories have been limited by capacity and some of those things will change over time as they go through. I think that\u2019s the best we can do for you.","Frank Boykin","The only other point I would make on the ceramic side of the businesses is the first quarter of 2016. That growth was unusually high. So we had a difficult comp going into the first quarter with ceramic.","Samuel Eisner","That\u2019s helpful. And then with regards to the acquisitions and the new product offerings that you guys are doing, you commented that fourth quarter should have some elevated sales and marketing expense. Is it just a way to think about for the full-year how much higher sales and marketing expense should be? You obviously have given some guidance around productivity initiatives and things of that nature, just curious where that particular line item, any kind of thoughts around it? Thanks.","Jeff Lorberbaum","We've given guidance that the combination of start-up costs and marketing additional is going to be around $45 million for the year and it doesn't come through level, but the biggest piece would hit in the fourth quarter, but it\u2019s going all the way through, as we start adding salespeople marketing as we go through and different projects come up with different times.","Samuel Eisner","Very helpful. And maybe if I can just sneak one more in here. Your growth or your kind of further expansion into the countertop market, any kind of sense of how much traction you're seeing there anyway to kind of think about the medium term kind of opportunity for you guys? Thanks so much.","Jeff Lorberbaum","It's made up of a couple of different pieces. One is we have a significant stone and slab distribution in the United States. We said we're increasing the number of those in the United States to improve our distribution and increase the sales of the products. Those products we presently buy from around the world to support that business. In Europe, we are building a plant specifically to make countertops out of ceramic, which is a business that's been in Europe for several years.","It's being more and more accepted there. So we're going to enter there. We are going to use the same equipment to ship those products into the United States to sell-through our present distribution. And then presently, we're actually importing similar products to build the market for it. It typically takes a while to build it and we would assume that once we establish and get it running, we will build another plant like the one we've built in Europe here to support it. So we see the ceramic and the countertop businesses as another leg to grow with.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research. Your line is open.","Laura Champine","Good morning. Could you talk a little about the backward integration you're doing in terms if you can generalize about how much that can add to margins and how much more you have to do along those lines in your different segments?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Those pieces are so small relative to our total business. It\u2019s not going to change the margins of the business. What we do on each one, as we look at it on a return basis on each investment, and we expect to get a return on investment over time, they tend to be low risk because we use most if not all of the capacities.","We know what's going to happen, and we know that we're going to need it over 20 years. So those are just normal pieces. We own mines around the country around the world to support some of our ceramic in some cases it makes sense to own them and other cases it doesn't and when things become available. We consider them. We also look to start our own mine to different places we've done.","The raw materials supply the ceramic piece and ceramic just the mine piece usually the transportation for the mine to the plant has more than the materials. So the location of those things is really important as we go through and we mentioned that do thing in Poland, it sitting on top of mind closed by, which gives it an economic advantages manufacturing point. The same thing with the backward integration on the carpet side, it's just one of many that we have and it just fills another gap that we had. Nylon makes up somewhere around 35% of the industry. And so it gives us a stronger position than we\u2019ve had.","Laura Champine","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Lovallo","Hey guys, thanks for fitting me in here. First question, I guess you've done a nice job of pushing price through to offset some of the raw material inflation here, but I guess I'm curious how do your contracts work if I'm thinking of specialty stores with contractors and home center et cetera. I mean, are you able to go back to them and push price even further than it is now if materials continue to rise?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The majority of our sales are done at market. So they are fluid and changeable and depending upon which market and what type of account, there are some different lead times on different things, but for the most part they change relatively limited period of time. On the other side with most of our suppliers, they\u2019re either at market or cost plus some basis and they\u2019re different all over the place.","John Lovallo","Okay. And then Frank, could you just, I guess one housekeeping item here. A number of your competitors, who have adjusted for excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, running that through the tax line, is that that's in your guidance now or how should we think about that?","Frank Boykin","You're talking about a new share-based payment accounting rule that came out and only impact us was in the first quarter with new material impact in our first quarter tax rate. And that was all included in our guidance we gave guidance for the first quarter.","John Lovallo","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. You announced 20 new Daltile centers, so two question on that. First, how many does that bring to in a total right now? And is there any work on those two presenters more of a retail format. We can actually transactions in the store or different anything along those lines?","Jeff Lorberbaum","What we said was there 20 either Daltile surface centers or Daltile slab centers. So they\u2019re not all exactly the same. What each of those do, it is distribution operation for a local market in order to supply it, and then within those pieces there also selection centers, so that our customers can bring their customers and help them pick out and make choices of the products as we go through.","We have areas that we think we can improve our business and get more market share out of it and we do it that way. In addition, we also add more salespeople, which we talk about in order to get to more customers and it could be builders, it could be commercial jobs they operate out of those local market, local places in order to optimize our position in the marketplace.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Sam Darkatsh","Jeff, Frank. How are you? Just one question for me a lots of different capacity at projects that you highlighted Jeff, I think the only one by my notes that you actually mentioned was on time and on plan was the other Tennessee ceramic facility? Are we on plan and one-time with all the other ones, are there any delays or cost overruns how we doing with milepost says the year progresses?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It was on time and other one that went actually came up out of the ground and went to start up in the fall of last year. So I went through startup. So what we're saying is not only of the start-up is now operating at peak performance that we expected it to get to the other ones are all moving as we expect.","But I mean these things there are million variables and from getting the permits to government approvals to suppliers putting stuff and to all kinds of things and we tried to give you directionally that we thought they would - when I would come up in the operating and most of the big ones are running from the fourth quarter - some of the big ones to be in the fourth quarter.","Some in the first quarter of next year as we go through, but I mean we have all kinds of things. We have a carpet cushion plant that we put up in to satisfy the market in the Western United States, it's up and running well. We have a new engineered wood plan that's in came up that it's running well. I mean there is multiple of projects that are coming up or not we tended to focus on the big new capacity increases, which are being spent this year. But there is all kinds of projects that came through last year that are in various stages of optimizing.","Sam Darkatsh","What I'm getting - just as you look at all the different projects are there any material call-outs that that project or two has been delayed enough where it may cause some risk to the sales growth expectations over the next few quarters?","Jeff Lorberbaum","There's nothing at this point that we would say is dramatically ahead or behind where we thought it would.","Sam Darkatsh","Thank you very much.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Rednor from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Scott Rednor","Hey, good afternoon at this point. Just quickly, Frank the 5.5 sales growth for the year, that excludes currency, it excludes the acquisition? Does it include or exclude the patent revenue that's rolling off?","Frank Boykin","It includes the patent revenue.","Scott Rednor","Okay. Great thank you for clarifying. And then just quickly, can you guys frame how much of for North America is soft surface right now carpet rugs just broadly and Jeff, if you had to guess what you think the share of that business is going over the next couple years.","Jeff Lorberbaum","But we don't break out the details of the different product categories across it. Carpeting as loss share relative to the total growth. In the U.S. we would guess flooring over time will grow about 3% to 4% and I would guess carpet could be flat to up a level plus or minus, who knows exactly as it relative to it and then same embedded in the same thing, you have LVT that\u2019s going rapidly as a percent, so it's growing much higher. You have ceramic that\u2019s growing at a faster rate in the industry as general from industry trends. And then you have the other ones that are growing tend to be at the 3% to 4% or less. We participate in all of them.","Scott Rednor","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Eric Bosshard","Thank you. Jeff, you had commented a bit on the market earlier and I just wanted to hear you expand on that, understand how GDP growth behave, but in terms of your markets the demand in 1Q and the visibility you have on order books as we go into 2Q and through the year, how is that behaving relative to what you expected coming into the year?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I mean going back, what I just said was our view is that the flooring industrial growth rate of 4% this year. I don't think anything's is changed it for whatever reasons, first quarter GDP and first quarter growth for the industry historically has been a little slower than the average. So we don't see it changing anything. When you look at the big parts, the new housing construction seems like it's going to grow somewhere around 10% based on most people's estimate is in line with what the expectations are to reach that. The commercial business should be growing about industry growth rate plus or minus a little bit overall.","And then the big upside question is how does remodeling take off or not and it's been running slightly less than those, is it going to pick up and do better or not as housing prices go up, as interest rates go up. People may start staying at \u2013 see that they're not going to move and may start investing more in it. And we could have more upside if that occurs. But we're still sitting with an industry growth of 3% to 4%.","Eric Bosshard","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Robert Aurand","Hi. This is Robert Aurand on for David. I guess just going back to the capacity additions, Mohawk has always been the company recognized with a strong management bench, but just given the magnitude of the growth you're undertaking into your manufacturing capacity within a relatively short period of time. Can you talk about how you're developing the management capability to step in and run all those capacity efficiently?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Sure. First, you have to start out that we run our business in a decentralized manner that we've run different products and different geographies under local managers and we do that on purpose in order to allow them to adjust to local circumstances and needs. With that it enables us to give different projects to different groups and handle a multitude of things at the same time, where each only handling one or two, so that collectively we can handle a lot of projects at the time.","At the same time we do have interaction between them to help them with technology knowledge, design, style, engineering capabilities that we share across as needed and each of the managers know that their goal is to optimize their piece, but they better do the right thing for the whole as yet. And I get a lot of positive things out of doing \u2013 helping each other. It's good for them and it's good for the whole group as you go through.","So I mean we're really in a unique position and then connected to that our strength of our balance sheet and the cost of our debt is extremely low as we go through and it's all because of the strength of the entire company. And then we have, as we've grown different than most companies when we go through acquisitions, we buy the management as much as we buy the assets.","And I don't know many companies that have been able to maintain the management from these acquisitions like we have, and it takes a unique method of driving it in order to make sure that they feel that they're part of the business and can help and when buy good acquisitions we feed them capital and ideas, but I mean they're still driving the business as we go through, which is why go back to the first segment, which was Daltile, the same management as you're driving at today that was driving it 15 years ago and we have the same thing through a large number of all the acquisitions.","Robert Aurand","Thank you. I appreciate the color.","Operator","There are no other questions at this time. I will turn the call back to Mr. Lorberbaum for closing comments.","Jeff Lorberbaum","We appreciate everyone joining us. We want to keep focusing on that we're investing at record levels. And we're looking at acquisitions and we\u2019re improving our business and the goal is to keep and maintain Mohawk as a high growth Company and make it more profitable in the future than it is today. We're doing the right things and I know it's uncomfortable that the variation between quarters goes up and more as we do these things, but I mean the long-term conclusion is we're going to have a much stronger and more profitable business. We appreciate your support and thank you for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation, this concludes today's conference call .

Today, we'll update you on the company's results for the fourth quarter of 2015 and provide guidance for the first quarter of 2016.","I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Frank. First, I'll begin with a review of our results for the past year. We delivered record annual sales of $8.1 billion, growing 10% on a constant exchange basis and record adjusted earnings per share of $10.20. Our adjusted operating income exceeded $1 billion and improved 26% compared to 2014. Last year, we achieved record earnings per share in each quarter with about 30% of our business outside the United States, where we face significant foreign exchange headwinds.","If adjusted for exchange rate changes, our 2015 net sales would have been $490 million higher, an impact of approximately 6%, and our operating income would have been $74 million higher, a 9% impact. Our strong performance was a result of aggressive growth strategy and targeted investments we began in 2013, as the economic recovery gained momentum. Since that time, we've invested almost $5 billion, of which about $3.5 billion was in nine acquisitions to expand our products, geographies and market share, and about $1.5 billion was in our existing businesses to introduce innovative products, enhance manufacturing efficiencies and expand our capability.","While making these investments for future growth, we improved our balance sheet and reduced our leverage, enabling us to optimize our returns. We remain optimistic about 2016 and we will invest an additional $600 million to $650 million in internal projects this year, which include increased ceramic capacity and upgrades in our U.S., Mexico, Europe and Russia, process improvements in carpet manufacturing, additional LVT manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe, increased wood production in the U.S and Europe, and installation of advanced technology in our laminate businesses.","During 2015, we changed our organizational structure to create three segments: Global Ceramic, Flooring North America, and Flooring Rest of the World. This restructuring has enabled us to optimize our assets, leverage our customer relationships and transfer best practices to minimize \u2013 to maximize our profitability. By fostering greater interaction between our teams, we delivered innovative new products, increased collaboration among our sales groups, and improved productivity and costs across our global organization.","Last year, as a result of continuous improvement, we closed all or part of 13 plants and warehouses across the enterprise to streamline the business. Over the past year, we completed four acquisitions. The IVC Group is a major, fully integrated, vinyl flooring manufacturer that provides Mohawk with leading positions in the U.S. and Europe in both sheet vinyl and luxury tile. KAI extended our leading position in ceramic tile into Eastern Europe. The acquisition of a ceramic plant in Northwest Mexico provided a new supply strategy, giving us advantages in the Western U.S. and Mexico.","In the fourth quarter, we acquired three plants to expand our European insulation board business. In 2015, to support future growth, we expanded our capacities in ceramic tile, polyester carpet, LVT and premium laminates. In our higher growth products and geographies, we increased investment in new product samples and merchandising systems as well as sales personnel to increase our market penetration.","Our results reflect the great work of a deep and talented management team that concurrently executed complex initiatives across multiple product categories and geographies. Despite some moderation in the U.S. economy during the fourth quarter, we're entering 2016 with cautious optimism, based on a number of leading indicators including: a healthy consumer with rising household spending, low gasoline prices and improving unemployment rate. With mortgage rates remaining at historic lows, 2015 existing home sales rose more than 6% year over year. The National Association of Home Builders reported that new single-family home construction rose last year to the highest level since 2007, with expectations for continued gains in 2016. Rising home values accelerated housing turnover and the aging of the country's residential infrastructure will continue to affect home improvement investments, which Harvard's LIRA index predicts will surpass the previous peak of 2006.","The American Institute of Architects correctly predicted solid growth in commercial construction in 2015 and forecasts continued commercial growth in 2016 with hotel and office space leading the category. Low oil prices are expected to keep the Russian economy in recession through 2016. The Mexican economy is benefiting from low unemployment, strong consumer activity from government \u2013 and government reforms that are improving the construction in the country. The European Central Bank's quantitative easing program is providing stimulus for growth in the region and most economists are predicting modest gains for the euro zone in 2016.","Turning to our fourth quarter performance, our record adjusted earnings per share rose 24% to $2.82, even as we increased investments to improve future results. This represents our seventh consecutive quarter with record adjusted earnings per share. Our net sales of $2.0 billion were a record in the period and represent an increase of 13% on a constant exchange rate basis and same days basis.","Our adjusted quarterly operating income margin rose to 14% of sales, an increase of 260 basis points due to productivity, volume and lower costs. Every segment delivered sales growth on a comparable basis, while also expanding margins. I'll now review the fourth quarter performance by segment.","Our Global Ceramic segment net sales adjusted for currency translation and days rose 7% with adjusted operating income up 14% on a constant exchange rate basis. We continue to reap the benefits of Marazzi and KAI acquisitions.","The combined R&D of our worldwide ceramic business has dramatically enhanced our style leadership, product technology and process enhancements. In addition, we're using our Italian, Bulgarian, Russian and Mexican ceramic capacity to support sales in the United States market.","Our North American business makes up the majority of our ceramics segment. In the U.S. market, new home construction represented the most robust channel during the quarter, followed by commercial and residential remodeling. Our margins increased during the period, as we improved our mix, enhanced our productivity and leveraged our overhead. We increased our sales investments to improve our market position by increasing service centers, expanding our sales personnel and upgrading our distribution.","Our ceramic statements program, a store-within-a-store concept, has grown to include 215 of our country's largest dealers and enhancing their sales and margins. We continue to improve our position in the home center channel, with greater commitments for both floor and wall tile. Our American Olean and Marazzi brands are growing sales through partnerships with leading independent distributors and through our own cobranded service centers in markets without strong partners.","We're increasing our product mix, as we introduced higher-style products in larger sizes, planks, stone look, hexagons and bricks.","We also are introducing large and small wall tiles, with unique surface structures, which are now used as focal points in all areas of the home. We've made significant progress in realigning our plants and production lines to specialize in different products, optimizing our productivity and service. Our new Tennessee porcelain plant is in the final stages of construction and should start up within the quarter.","There will be three new kilns which begin production during 2016 and we expect to fully benefit from these by 2017. The new plants will enhance our premium offering and replace products that we've historically imported, improving our service and costs. We've integrated the ceramic plant we acquired in Western Mexico and have improved its capacity and cost structures. Shipping from the facility should provide us advantages within the Western part of the U.S. and Mexico.","The Mexican economy is doing well and the ceramic industry there grew by more than 15% in 2015. Due to the investments we made in Salamanca in 2012, we've been able to outpace market growth. We've dramatically expanded our product offering at all price points and have improved our margin and mix as we increased our market share.","To continue this progress, we're planning to increase the capacity of our Salamanca plant to greater participate in the Central Mexico region, that makes up 60% of the total market. Our European ceramic sales have been growing in a lackluster market. Our product mix has improved as we introduced uniquely-styled products and expanded on our margins. We have successfully enhanced our product offering and we're now expanding our sales force, introducing new merchandising and escalating our retail sales training. We anticipate completing the second phase of our equipment upgrades by the second quarter, which will further enhance our product offering and improve our cost structure.","The third phase of equipment upgrades will begin the end of this year, and complete our major investments to modernize the Marazzi assets we acquired in 2013.","The optimization of our Bulgarian ceramic operation continues with a focus on improving our product offering. We have a strong management team in Bulgaria that is enhancing our internal processes and manufacturing methods. We're improving our mix by increasing the use of digital designs in larger sizes, implementing more automation and supplying product to the U.S., Eastern Europe and other international markets.","In Russia, we gained market share in the period as sales increased and margins compressed. Our comparisons in the fourth quarter and first quarter will be difficult due to consumers accelerating purchases a year ago. We have outperformed the market due to our strong brand position, new styles in larger and smaller sizes and increased distribution in both the remodeling and new construction channels. We're expanding our porcelain capacity, which was fully utilized last year.","Our North America segment net sales were up 6% on an adjusted days basis, with adjusted operating earnings expanding 31%. All of our product categories contributed to our growing profitability, and we are well positioned in each product category to take advantage of an improving U.S. market. The carpet industry's growth remains slower than the hard surface categories. Our profitability continues to increase, even though carpet sales were softer and pricing was impacted by price and mix pressure. We've taken many actions to optimize our business profitability, which is expanding with the business cycle. Our builders and multi-family residential business continue to outperform the remodeling channel. Sales of our premium carpet products, including our luxury Karastan brand and SmartStrand product collections, grew during the period.","We continued to introduce differentiated products with our SmartStrand Silk Naturals collection, which replicates the appearance of wool with superior softness, texture and performance. We further extended our SmartStrand family with our all new, All Pet Protection, which enhances \u2013 which has enhancements for cleaning up accidents. This collection was voted by retailers as the most innovative flooring product in the industry at the recent show in Las Vegas. We also enhanced our Continuum recycled polyester by introducing Forever Fresh carpets with odor-eliminating technology, which gives consumers another reason to trade up to Mohawk.","We're continuing the expansion of our sales teams, as well as increasing their specialization to maximize our participation in each end market. Our commercial margins continue to improve as a result of our new product introduction, streamlined manufacturing and plant consolidations. Our carpet tile sales are increasing as the market continues to expand and sales of our Duracolor-branded products are increasing through their premium performance characteristics.","We've expanded the shapes and sizes of our carpet tiles and we've introduced new collections with cushion that improves comfort and reduces noise. To extend our participation of value-oriented commercial carpet, we launched new collections made with our exclusive recycled Continuum polyester.","Our corporate operations continue the simplifications of our raw material components of manufacturing. Last year, we closed 10 plants and warehouses and several production lines. All of these actions are contributing to the improvement of our costs as well as the enhancement of our efficiency, quality and service levels. Our rug business continues to outperform the overall segment. Our new product innovation is creating more fashionable accent rugs made with our exclusive fibers, providing softer characteristics with greater value. We're entering new rug categories including commercial and residential utility mats and flat-woven outdoor rugs.","Our North American laminate and wood business continues to improve as we enhance the differentiation of our products. We're expanding our new impressive laminate collection, which provides stylized looks, unachievable and natural wood. We're increasing our laminate production with new technology to support these unique features. In addition to our best-in-class innovation, we also extended our design leadership by introducing newer, longer and wider planks in both laminate and wood collections.","Our engineered wood sales continue to grow and we're planning new investments to support increased demand. We are launching unique Pergo-branded collections in wood, laminate and LVT into the specialty retail channel to leverage one of the most recognized consumer brands in the flooring industry. The new Pergo products were debuted at the recent industry show and were enthusiastically received by the retail community.","The reorganization of our U.S. vinyl business has been completed with the former IVC management team directing the product offering and marketing strategies for all of our vinyl products and brands. Our IVC vinyl sales are performing as planned and we are introducing sheet vinyl and LVT products into our Mohawk brands from our U.S. facilities.","Our new LVT plant continues to improve in performance with increased production. We anticipate that the present production line will be operating at planned levels by the end of the year. LVT continues to take share in the U.S. flooring market as sales of the category expand across all channels and end uses. Our sales trends anticipate full utilization of our current LVT capacity, and we have announced investments to further increase our production and expand our product offering.","We're also expanding our sheet vinyl business across other brands and leveraging our customer relationships to increase our market penetration. We're continuing to ramp up our Mohawk-branded sheet vinyl sales in builder, multi-family and retail markets, and we're developing new products to extend our sheet vinyl further into the commercial channel.","Our Flooring North America segment has made progress in expanding our brands and customer relationships, expanding our style and design, transferring innovative manufacturing practices and utilizing the Mohawk distribution for all products.","During the period, both sales and margins in our Flooring Rest of World segment rose dramatically in a muted economic environment due to improved results and the IVC acquisition. Our local \u2013 on a local basis, adjusted for days, net sales for the segment increased 41%. Adjusted operating income was 59% up on a constant exchange rate basis. The leadership for the Flooring Rest of World segment has been reorganized to leverage sales, manufacturing and product management for the entire organization.","Our new vinyl business is being holistically managed to optimize our asset distribution and best practices across the segment. Our laminate and wood business in Europe outperformed the market as a result of our focus on differentiated products at mid-end to high-end price points. Where we operate direct distribution, it has enhanced our market share and increased our penetration. We continue to expand our latest embossing technology, which creates more realistic visuals. We will further extend this technology in new larger plank to be launched later this year. To meet the growing demand, we're installing additional capacity this year.","Our European wood sales are growing quickly, and we are taking market share. The Czech wood plant we acquired two years ago is operating near capacity, with the balance of our product needs coming from our Malaysian facility. We're planning to expand our engineered wood capacity in the Czech Republic.","The legacy IDC vinyl business is reaching full capacity. In sheet vinyl and LVT, we're achieving some capacity increases through process improvements. The new LVT plant in Belgium is operating well and the sales are developing better than planned. This plant is temporarily constrained by manufacturing limitations, which will be addressed with additional equipment, increasing the capacity by 40% in the middle of this year. To meet current demand, we're importing LVT to supplement our present capacity, and we're planning further investments to add a new LVT production line. We are continuing to develop new products in anticipation of these increased capabilities.","Our insulation business had record sales this year. We continue to enhance our distribution and manufacturing capabilities, including the addition of another production shift at our plant in France. At the end of the quarter, we finalized the acquisition of three insulation board plants in Ireland, the UK and Belgium to expand our offering and geographic footprint. Our management structure has already been reorganized and we're identifying opportunities to enhance all the operations. Our other board product sales were up slightly, with margins improving for mix, asset upgrades and plant consolidations.","I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $1,998 million, up 2%, as reported. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we had four fewer days than we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Our constant FX \u2013 on a constant FX and days basis, our sales grew 13%, or 4% excluding acquisitions.","Foreign exchange reduced sales $86 million compared to last year. All segments grew on a legacy basis using a constant exchange rate and days. Acquisitions and volume increases were the primary drivers. Our gross margin was 31.1%, as reported. Excluding charges, the margin was 31.9%, up 360 basis points from last year. Higher volume, productivity and lower raw materials were the biggest contributors to this increase.","Our SG&A, as reported, was $373 million or 18.7% of sales. Excluding charges, SG&A was 18% of net sales, up from 17% last year. Fewer days in the quarter and investments back into SG&A moved the percent up from last year. Our focus on investments allowed for better sales growth as well as improved mix in the quarter. We anticipate the SG&A percentage improving to a lower number in 2016 as we leverage spending against sales growth.","Unusual charges for the quarter were $28 million, with approximately $20 million associated with our acquisitions. The balance was due to restructuring actions in the North American Flooring segment.","For the full year, we had $212 million in non-recurring expense, with $122 million of that related to a legal settlement, which, by the way, we believe was extortion, $70 million for acquisitions and $17 million for restructuring of existing businesses. Of the acquisition costs, $8 million were for M&A fees, $14 million were for inventory step ups related to purchase accounting and $48 million for plant closures, manufacturing consolidations, administrative reductions and system upgrades, all to improve profitability.","Our operating margin for the quarter was 13.9%, up 260 basis points and our operating income would have been $12 million higher, using a constant exchange rate. Interest expense was $18 million and showed improvement this year due to a premium paid last year on the early redemption of some of our bonds. Other expense was $12 million and includes a charge for unwinding an $11 million indemnification receivable recorded in the IVC purchase accounting earlier in the year.","There is also an offsetting $11 million benefit included in tax expense, as reported, as related liability was unwound. The income tax rate excluding unusual items for the quarter was 18.7%, compares to a 19% rate last year. We expect the first quarter rate in this year to be 25% and the full year rate for 2016 to be between 24.5% and 25.5%. And I'll remind you that our rate fluctuates by quarter depending upon timing for certain tax deductions.","Our earnings per share, excluding charges, was $2.82, which represents an increase of 24% over last year. Turning to the segments, in the Global Ceramics segment, sales were $712 million, down 4%, as reported. Using a constant exchange rate and days for our legacy business, it was up 4%. FX was a $45 million headwind in the quarter for this segment. All regions are up on a constant currency and days basis.","Our operating income margin, excluding charges, was 13%. This expanded 150 basis points over last year. And operating income would have been $5 million higher using constant exchange rates. Productivity and improving mix were the biggest drivers of this increase.","In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $880 million. They were flat, as reported, but increased by 3% on a constant days basis for the legacy business. Hard surface products grew at a faster rate than soft surface.","Our operating income margin, excluding charges, was 14.2%. That is up 340 basis points from last year, with productivity and input costs the biggest contributors to the improvement, partially offset by price and mix. Our team continues to produce better results through continuous improvements in innovative products.","In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales were $407 million, up 22% as reported, or up 7% using constant exchange rate and days for our legacy business. This was unusually high due to laminate, wood, LVT and intellectual property sales, which we do not believe will continue into next year.","FX was a $42 million impact on revenues during the quarter. Our wood and vinyl flooring products both had strong quarters and we believe they outperformed the industry. Our operating income margin, excluding charges, was 16.4%, up 240 basis points from last year. And operating income would have been $7 million higher using a constant exchange rate. Volume, productivity and input costs were the biggest drivers of growth here.","In 2015, we had operating income from our patents, which was $130 million, and was higher than last year due to payments for past due fees. We expect 2016 to be 5% to 10% lower. After June 2017, when the Uniclic patents expire, we estimate annualized operating income of $30 million to $35 million from other patents.","In addition, over the next few years, we'll benefit from internal investments, both current and future acquisitions and lower interest costs. So if we turn to the balance sheet, receivables ended the year at $1.3 million with days sales outstanding at 55 days compared to 54 days last year. These days in the current year were slightly impacted by change in channel mix.","Inventories ended the year at $1.6 billion. Our inventory days continued to show strong improvement at 112 days for the quarter compared to last year's 116 days. Fixed assets were $3.1 billion and includes fourth quarter capital expenditures of $152 million and depreciation and amortization of $94 million. Capital expenditure for the full year were $504 million, with D&A of $363 million. We estimate $600 million to $650 million of CapEx for 2016 with depreciation and amortization estimated at $400 million for 2016. Long-term debt was $3.2 billion at the end of the year. Our leverage ended the year at 2.1 times debt to EBITDA on a pro forma basis.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jeff for concluding remarks.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","2015 was the best year in Mohawk's history and we expect the momentum to continue this year. We anticipate that the demand trends in our U.S. and international markets will remain consistent with what we've been experiencing.","Though growth in Europe is limited and negative in Russia, our international businesses are delivering solid results on a local basis. Our sales and margins should continue to improve over last year as a result of our continued innovations, process improvements and disciplined execution.","Our recent acquisitions are progressing with operational market synergy as we anticipated. This year, we will increase investments in our existing businesses to optimize our long-term performance. Taking these factors into account, our guidance for the first quarter is $2.24 to $2.33 per share; that would be a 32% to 37% increase over 2015, excluding any restructuring charges.","We have taken many actions to outperform the industry in each of our products and geographies over the past few years and will continue to benefit from those strategies this year. In 2016, we will continue to execute creative product ideas, along with substantial investments to optimize our long-term results.","We'll now be glad to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie Securities. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Ryan Hunter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, guys, it's actually Ryan Hunter on for Mike this morning. My first question regarding the CapEx, $600 million to $650 million, this isn't much high a level than we've seen in above \u2013 recent elevated levels. Do these investments carry the similar three-year to five-year payback, as you've mentioned in the past, or do capacity expanding investments carry a lower payback?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Most of them would in the three-year to five-year range, as we go through. Let's just see if I could give you some more color. Between 2015, we've been expanding or upgrading our ceramic in the U.S., Mexico, Europe and Russia. In carpet, we increased our polyester and rug capacity and as well as other process improvements. In LVT, we're adding U.S. and European capacity. We're increasing our engineered wood in the U.S. and Europe. We're upgrading our laminate technology and we're replacing leased assets with own assets. These assets support approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of sales, based on today's exchange rates. If these investments were a standalone business, they would rank as one of the top flooring companies in the world.","Ryan Hunter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And then just a quick follow-up regarding organic growth, a little of deceleration at 4.2% versus 5.6% in 3Q. Can you just give us some color on what region decelerated organically? And do you think that this can reaccelerate back into the 5% range in 2016?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think that was just timing. I think if you look at our outlook for the \u2013 our business both in the U.S., Europe and in Russia, it's going to be more of the same with \u2013 here in the U.S., the new residential, continuing to grow nicely, and commercial and remodel also growing, and Europe \u2013 Europe showing some improvement as well. And then, Russia, we've got a recession we're dealing with, but they're outperforming the market there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Roll\u00e9 from Longbow Research. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Brandon Roll\u00e9 - Longbow Research LLC","Hi, this is Brandon Roll\u00e9 on for David MacGregor. I just wanted to touch on your increasing engineered wood, we had heard from some people that there's been a shift in the market to people winning larger, wider planks. Is this fueling your increased investment in engineered wood in the U.S.? Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, the market is \u2013 the higher-end part of the market is trending to wider and longer planks. Our present manufacturing capacity is close to being fully utilized, so the new capacity will be able to make all the things we have been, plus make wider and longer planks in addition.","Brandon Roll\u00e9 - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And to follow up on that, I was also hoping you could walk us through your three segments and what's driving the organic growth in each. Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, I spent 15 minutes trying to answer that in my opening remarks. In the carpet business, we believe that our focus on new innovative products is expanding our position within the marketplace. We are dramatically cutting the cost structures we have to improve margin in what's going to be a lower growth business. In the rug business, we're going into new product categories that we weren't in, as well as we've introduced new products.","In the ceramic business in North America, we're the leader in offering a total broad product line in all categories. We're putting new investments in that allow us to make products that the majority of the people in the United States can't and give us leading positions in style and design.","In Mexico, we're expanding from a relatively small base. We had success in filling up a brand-new plant from 2012. And at this moment, we're planning to double the size of that plant again this year to take advantage of our expanding distribution in the marketplace. In Europe, the ceramic business has been limited growth, but through our investments, we've been able to significantly cut the costs, and at the same time, we've been able to bring new product and innovation to the marketplace, which is allowing us to grow in a low-growth market. But our primary objective was we bought the business that was not profitable and expand the margins, but there is some increase in capacity as we go through.","The new acquisition with KAI, they have a high position in their market share, in their markets. We're continuing to support them to optimize that business through improving their mix and giving them opportunities to sell product outside their local region with all our other sales and marketing people across the country. The Russian business, we're growing market shares significantly as the market declines. Last year, our volume was flat or up a little bit in a marketplace that was declining significantly. We've been able to do that through we have the leading style and design in the marketplace. We're the best option for high-style product that used to be imported out of Italy, which we can make in there. Our high-end ceramic capacity was fully utilized last year and we're actually increasing our capacity in Russia in a market that's horrible. Is it \u2013 at the same time, we're using the strength of our business to increase the distribution into the various channels and optimize our brand.","Moving back into the Flooring Rest of the World, our laminate, we focus on medium-to-high in Europe. We have brought unique product innovation to the marketplace, which we started introducing last year; we've extended it this year. We have run out of capacity in that category, which is being installed the 1st of this year so that we can keep growing that, which is very unique. We have multiple brands in the marketplace, which we go after different channels of the marketplace. The acquisition of IVC brought us another brand that's focused on a lower price category than the other ones we have, so we're using it to expand our distribution across the marketplace, but still not in the commodity areas. The wood business, we still have a limited portion of a very large market. And because of that, we have focused on, again, the medium-end to high-end.","We have been able to add value to the marketplace. We bought the Ceramic business in Czech two years ago, I think. And it's running full, and we're planning on expanding it to give us opportunities to grow further. The IVC business, we're managing through the changes, and I mean, doing well. As their sales to Russia declined, we put those in the other marketplace. We think we're going to be pushing the limits of the capacity in sheet vinyl. And LVT, the two plants that we have are selling everything they can make.","The newer plant, which is the one that we started building before them, they've helped us optimize. And by the middle of the year, we'll increase the capacity by about another 40%. We have plan to put another line in our facilities over there to grow further in the marketplace in LVT. And then we have our other \u2013 our insulation board business, we had two plants, so we greenfielded both. The first one has been running at full capacity; the second one is in France. We're adding another shift to it, as we speak. And then we purchased another business that had different geographic presence, as well as slightly different products in it. And then our board businesses, we've spent money consolidating those and increasing the capacity is limited, but it's more like cost savings and closing plants and we should get most of those benefits during this year.","Brandon Roll\u00e9 - Longbow Research LLC","All right, thank you for that color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Rednor from Zelman & Associates. Go ahead, your line is open.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Hey, good morning. Jeff, I have a bigger picture question for you. Two years ago, you had no capacity in LVT. With the additions, you're now going to have five plants in, call it, a three-year to four-year period. What gives you confidence that you need all that hard capacity versus the sourcing model that's helping you right now?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","One of the major reasons we were interested in IVC was the technology and leadership they had in the marketplace. So, we had gone into it with one plant and we were working to start it up, and in a limited period of time, with them, we've been able to ramp it up to where it is and the plant is utilizing all we can make and it's expanding further and we believe that we can sell all of that in Europe.","In addition, in the United States, the plant that they had constructed, we have significant commitments from people to use the capacity. The market in the U.S. and Europe collectively is growing about 15%. In the U.S., that's about $200 million a year of new capacity coming into the marketplace and we think we're best positioned to provide the products to the marketplace, and we're well prepared to compete with the imported products coming in with higher style and value that's required to compete. At the same time, we believe we can bring better local service to the marketplace; we can bring better product innovation to the marketplace. And we don't have to fight the FX volatility. We believe the market can absorb it and we're going to be the leader in it.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Appreciate that color. Just one quick one, Frank, the IP catch-up. Can you help frame how much that aided 4Q in terms of what won't repeat in 1Q?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","When you say the IP catch-up, you mean the...","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","You highlighted on the \u2013 yeah, no, you highlighted the sales impact on Flooring Rest of World in the quarter.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, what I was referring to when I talked about the full year that in the full year, we would have fewer sales, fewer operating \u2013 less operating income in 2016 for the full year because of uncollected fees that we got, past due fees that we got in 2015 (43:46).","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Go ahead, your line is open.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning. You guys talked a little bit about the price and mix pressure that you're continuing to see in carpet. Can you just talk a little bit to, has that shifted any as you look towards the beginning of this year and how you're thinking about that trending through 2016?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. The industry \u2013 two parts, as polyester grows in the industry, polyester is a lower cost option than the other pieces. So as the industry shifts, the industry average price goes down. And then second, as expected, as the raw material prices have declined in the commodity products, the average selling prices have gone down with those and the combined pieces are reducing the average selling prices for the industry and for us.","At the same time, we are really focused on bringing differentiated value-added products which we mentioned several in the prior discussions that we're coming to the market with, we did the same thing last year, and we continue in every business we have trying to bring differentiation that the consumer is willing to pay for and differentiates us, so we believe that our average price is better than the industry's.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just looking more broadly, have you seen in terms of the overall demand trends, has there been any improvement in terms of perhaps mix shift, people willing to spend on some higher-end products at all?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","When you look across all our different businesses, we are selling higher-end products in all of them: my laminate business, my ceramic business and my carpet business, we're selling higher-end products, and in most of our businesses, our pricing is consistent or growing as an average price point. The carpet part of it, though, due to the other shifts, you have some general shifts going on in it that's pulling the average prices down, which we're also susceptible to.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. But across the rest of your products, are you seeing an improvement in the higher-end product categories would you say?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We are, but I think it's driven by our style and design and innovation. I'm not sure the industry...","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, all right.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","(46:40).","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, all right. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Co. Go ahead, your line is open.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you. You commented about market growth being similar in 2016 to 2015, or perhaps your growth. But I'm curious on your market share expectations in 2016 relative to 2015, how you would expect to perform relative to the market, especially in response to the investments that you're making across the business?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All those investments we went through were to increase our ability to participate in different markets and we expect to use the assets we put in.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Does that mean that the share performance or the performance relative to market is similar in 2016 and 2015 or would you be disappointed if you didn't grow faster in 2016 versus 2015 relative to the market?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that we should grow faster than the marketplace, but there is all kinds of shifts going on, like we mentioned in LVT, some of LVT is going to come out of imports, some of my ceramic business is going to come out of imports, some of my laminate is going to come out of import, so the piece between imports and exports that is going on also.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Let me ask the question differently then. As you think about the three-year to five-year payback, how would you suggest we look for that on the income statement top line relative to operating margin? Where would you expect for that benefit to show up?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There's going to be two parts: one is that you've seen last year, the year before and this year, we keep telling you that our margins are going to increase. So part of it is going to show up in greater efficiencies in the business. The other part is going to come that all these investments I mentioned earlier would have a capacity once they are installed is somewhere around $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, and over the period, I expect to use it. Some of it will take three years or more.","Unknown Speaker","And, Eric, in the quarter we had for the total company productivity improvements for all three segments of about $35 million. Now a portion of that is from capital that we're investing and a portion of it is from process improvements, but to Jeff's point, we're driving productivity throughout the business with what we're investing back.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And then a follow-up, you talked last quarter about incremental SG&A investment in an effort to drive market share. Curious on how that's playing out. I know some of it is 4Q, some of it is 1Q and throughout 2016, but in terms of the traction and getting payback from that incremental investment, how would you evaluate how that's going so far and what is your outlook for payback on that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The bigger part of the investments are in salesmen's samples and displays but salesmen's a big part of it. And it takes a while to ramp those up, so we're expecting those to help us through next year. But we didn't expect to see dramatic improvements in the short-term. You have to build the relationships and pieces as you go through and we think it's one of the reasons it's going to help us achieve our goals in 2016.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","I think, just if I could add one more thing to that, we do think that as we move into 2016, our SG&A as a percent to sales will be down compared to 2015% to sales.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","For the full-year.","Unknown Speaker","For the full-year.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for that clarification.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning. Fantastic finish to a great year for you guys. Tremendous execution. Just wanted to ask you ...","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, we're just getting started.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Well, I was going to ask you, I was kind of surprised and also thanks for the great detail, but you guys had huge progress on the margin front. If you look for a thing on a like-for-like basis adjusting for currency and days, it's an incredibly strong year in what I would kind of view as a muted environment. How much more is left, like are you guys halfway done with your objectives? When you think about margin performance and all the investments you are making, you did a great job of detailing how you're spending money both through the SG&A line, a lot of plant capacity expansion. What does this look like in terms of margin performance coming up in the next couple years. How should we be thinking about that, given what you're putting back into the business? Maybe that's for Frank.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Listen, there's two parts to it. One is improvement in the cost structures, the other is top line growth to support and we go through. If you look out over the term, we believe we'll be able to continue growing the margins from year-to-year. However, just like everything else, we have to compete in the marketplace with whatever is changing. We think our cost structures will allow us to do that. In 2016 we're expecting both improvement in the margin percent and the top line and we hope to continue it.","Unknown Speaker","And I would just add Bob to that that as we go through the year, each quarter we're expecting to see margin improvements.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Over the prior quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Correct. Over the prior year.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Prior quarter of last year, last sequential quarter (52:32).","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. So you are going to see sequential improvement as you move through the year. You had a...","Unknown Speaker","Let me just clarify that, Bob. So in each quarter when we compare it to the prior year comparable quarter, we'll see improvement.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. That's clear. Can you just give us a view on you had a $163 million of acquired revenues. We're hoping you could give us like a split for in which segment those revenues fit?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I thought we did that when we gave you the legacy growth in each of the different...","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You did. Give it to him again.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Between the three, sorry.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, yes, yes. So our legacy growth in the \u2013 and so this is constant exchange rate and constant days. Our legacy growth in the Global Ceramic was up 4%, our legacy growth in Flooring North America was up 3%, and our legacy growth in Rest of the World was up 7%. And on the Rest of the World segment, this was unusually high due to higher laminate wood, LVT and IP sales which we don't think are going to continue.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The rate won't continue at that rate going into this year.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. So, that's the timing shift. And then if you're thinking about Global Ceramic on a constant currency basis, you also had $50 million of higher sales and I was trying to think about how to split that between acquired revenues, volume and price in the ceramic business?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","I maybe need to follow up with you after the call on that one, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it, gentlemen. Great quarter and good luck in 2016.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. First is just stepping back and looking at more from a cyclical standpoint, based on your experience and you've been through quite a few cycles, what were the earliest signs of the market fundamentally slowing versus merely seeing a pause? And how does this compare to what you're seeing in your business right now?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In prior cycles, the thing that led the downturn always was a reduction in the remodeling business, because it's done as needed and as consumer confidence went down as they got less comfortable with the future, they would postpone remodeling pieces and we haven't seen that.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. Perfect. And then could you quantify what the raw material tailwind was for fiscal 2015? It may be easier just to do it for the North American segment? What your expectations are for fiscal 2016?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","At a high level for the year, we think that the raw material cost will be fairly stable versus last year is our expectation, but there's a lot of questions in that. In the short-term, you want to give more of a short-term?","Unknown Speaker","Well, so again what we're doing, Kathryn, is comparing how input cost impacted us in this quarter compared to fourth quarter a year ago and that's about $30 million tailwind, which was the same benefit that we saw in the third quarter.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Offset by...","Unknown Speaker","And offset by price\/mix, so we had about a negative $10 million price\/mix in the fourth quarter, again, comparing where we are at the end of the fourth quarter this year compared to the end of the fourth quarter next year.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But the numbers we gave you left out other inflation that also went against it of different types.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to stick with the Flooring North America segment and some of the margin color for the first question. So I think part of the segment realignment was trying to get better efficiencies out of the relationship between the carpet side of the business and the hard surface, and it seems like just based on the improvement we've seen in margins that that's been successful so far. But just wondering if you can give us any sense of how much that is contributing to the margin performance magnitude wise? And have you fully realized the benefits of that at this point, or do you still think the hard surface has some catch up left in terms of margin performance?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There's a lot of moving parts in the business. The major synergies between the business, you have the back end which is the distribution being able to get it from the marketplace through the distribution piece, you have the sales personnel that are helping each other push products into the marketplace, you have innovation ideas that are crisscrossing the business better, and then you also have the ability to use the brands differently across the different pieces as you go through.","So we just introduced the Pergo brand into LVT, laminate and wood, which is a new way of getting it to marketplace. So there's all kinds of different ways of helping the business as well as you have just the engineers and the production people passing best practices between the businesses, all help.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. So, I guess, it sounds like you think there is still some runway left though on that side, Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, there is always room. We have a saying here, no matter where you are, you're halfway there.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right, okay. And then helpful color around the CapEx and just laying out how much the contribution from the investments will generate as far sales over the next couple of years. But I guess just a clarification, was that inclusive of the expected 2016 spend? And then as we think...","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What we did was take the capacity as of 2015, 2014. Where did we start from?","Unknown Speaker","2015, 2016.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think, we started the capacity in 2015 \u2013 the capacity that we were at the run rate of 2015 and compared it to where it would be when everything was up and running from the 2015 and 2016 investments, some of which happened within a year and some of it won't get optimized for three years.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on the CapEx and acquisitions. You're spending a lot on organic CapEx this year. Is this a result of a thinner acquisition pipeline or do you believe that there are still a lot of good potential acquisitions to be had?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","One has nothing to do with the other. Our goal is to have a balanced approach between the two. Our balance sheet we believe could handle another $1 billion or $1.5 billion worth of debt. So I mean, under the right thesis, we're ready to go and acquisitions in addition. But those aren't easy to come by when you want them.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Totally understand. And then switching gears a little bit, oil and energy as a whole has a lot of varying impacts on cost and on the pricing environment as a whole. Could you talk a little bit about what impacts you are seeing and maybe if you can help us quantify those impacts?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It depends on what moments in time you start and stop. On a going forward basis, our present belief is that the raw materials will be relatively stable with 2015, but that's making a lot of assumptions on what's going on. But we think that's going to be \u2013 that's our best guess at this point.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And on the pricing side of the equation, are the lower oil prices impacting any particular products or are those different dynamics that are impacting prices?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The lower oil prices have been impacting the average selling prices of the carpet piece as well as the opening price commodities; by definition commodities are more price sensitive and so, much of that has already occurred.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. So it's pretty much behind us at this point, is what you would say?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's what we'll have to see. I can't control my competition.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Fair enough. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks very much, guys. I wanted to talk a little bit about your patent income out of Unilin. I think one of the things that's lost on some people is that Unilin didn't just have a good invention, but they developed the intellectual capital to be able to monetize their patent. And so they kind of have a platform with which they can monetize other patents. And so my question is what's the prospects for you to be able to grow from your base of $30 million to $35 million excluding Uniclic. Is it mostly dependent upon new patents that you would have to file or do you think you'll be able to grow, let's say, advisory fees from helping third parties monetize their patents, kind of like you did recently with your Novalis relationship.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let's see. Let me clarify it a little bit. The $30 million to $35 million for other installation things is usually the patents we sell is a package. So as one starts and one stops, we have to go out and do things to maintain that $30 million to $35 million; it's not a gimme off the start as we change it. We think that we have the right things in place to execute that. You are correct, we have unique knowledge in how to manage and create value for patents. But having something that's unique, that's saleable, I mean, it's not that easy or everybody would have it. So we think that the $30 million to $35 million is what we know of today; if we come up with more, we know what to do with them when we get them.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'm sure you do. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for that. The second question is a little bit of a broader one, I'm kind of thinking about your North American distribution and sales network. In the context of two realities that I've been thinking about. First, there's been a quantum leap in recent years with respect to visual productions, the ability to achieve visuals. And it's allowed customers to achieve remarkably similar looks across a variety of flooring materials.","And the second thing is that Mohawk seems to be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this convergence or flexibility in design across many, many different products, given that you're a major manufacturer of all of these products, and nobody else really is. So I guess kind of a two-part question with that. One, do you think, longer-term that the improved visuals is going to introduce negative mix shift as people sort of achieve those visuals with cheaper materials, or instead, do you think, it's going to lead to a desire on the part of consumers to spend more money, more of their design dollars on the floor given the innovation. And the second question is what are some of the unique ways you can use across product sales and marketing strategy to get better profits and sales, in ways that your competitors simply can't because they don't make all those flooring materials?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let's see. The first answer to your question which was an either\/or is a yes. And the yes means that in some of my product category \u2013 in all my product categories having better design and better features, you can get a premium for which you hear us talking about all the time. On the other hand, by having better looks and different product categories, in my personal view, which I can't say everybody agrees with me, is like wood that sells at higher prices I think that given there's more alternatives for wood, there's a possibility that people use those in place of wood, and those things they're using are lower price, and I have no idea how the mix is going to change between the categories and neither does anybody else. Is it.","On the use of our various asset, it is a huge benefit, because all the similar looks are selling in all the different product categories. And we are unique in having capabilities between laminate, wood, vinyl and ceramic that the same technologies and same style and designs fit all of them. And then with the acquisition we have of Marazzi, the Italians with style and design are way ahead of the rest of the world. We use that to apply to every other one, and then I have to tell you, we get ideas from \u2013 our Russian business is different than it. They come up with different ideas and we have meetings where we put the different groups together, and they all go about it in different ways and it gives us a unique perspective not only by product, but by worldwide geographies that ideas transfer back and forth, and I think it puts us in a unique position that nobody else can compete with.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. That's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks a lot, guys, and good luck.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Just to go back to the patent issue real quick. The $30 million to $35 million in 2017, is that exclusive of the Unilin patents that are going to be expiring or does that include some of the ones you will see in the early part of that year associated with that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That is the ongoing rate after the existing Uniclic patents conclude.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, so did that...","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And we tried to give you a forward annual rate, not an amount for a given point.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And as Frank had said, the patents expire or the ones in question expire in the middle of that year. So, the number for the full year should be some level higher than that, is that correct?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The first half will be different than the second half and we tried to give you a way of getting to it.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good deal. Jeff, at the beginning of the call here, you talked about process improvement in carpet, what exactly are you referring to there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's not just in carpet, in all of our businesses, we are pushing how to use technology different and how to change the processes, how to simplify the businesses, how to increase quality, service and there are hundreds of opportunities that every department is working on. We have each of those are lined up. They are assigned to different people in each one. There are monthly quarterly calls to see how we're going against them. Some of them require investment and some of them require just innovative ideas and we're doing it everywhere. The productivity in 2015 was what? The number for the whole year?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Whole year productivity.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","For the whole company.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","For the whole company was in total including CapEx about $135 million.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So the $135 million in capital of improvement, some driven by capital and some driven by bright ideas.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And would that include in carpet, within that framework, more cost takeout potentially, whether it's backing phase five or things like that from what you are doing now?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me say it differently. It includes the ideas for how to create different engineering and raw material usage to make things better at advantageous cost across all the different things.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're always looking for those.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","All right. Final question for Frank. I believe you had a bond issue that came due in January, was that just rolled over in the revolver?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","It was rolled over into our commercial paper program, Keith.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Commercial paper, so what is the commercial paper running at right now in terms of interest rate?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Well, in Europe, we just issued some at a zero rate, but it's probably running in the mid single-digits in Europe and then over here I think it's running around...","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","0.7% I think.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","I think it's around 20 basis points or 30 basis points over here, Keith.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And the bond issue was 6 1\/8% I think or something like that?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, yeah, it was 6 1\/8%. Yeah, we're expecting about $25 million to $30 million in interest savings this year compared to 2015 as a result of what we just talked about.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I thought the U.S. rates for commercial paper were higher than yours. So let us check that.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","We'll come back to you on that.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","It's virtually nothing, so it doesn't really matter. Thanks.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Chan with Baird. Your line is open.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. You guys have done a great job on productivity, and I was just wondering, with kind of this continued investment in CapEx should be think of the level of productivity contribution is sustainable or even accelerate?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't have that number to give you at this minute. There's productivity, I mean, they are all built \u2013 they're built into our program, they're not built into yours. The reason we're going to have higher earnings next year and the year after is a combination of all these things. And they are all built into our increasing margins that we talk about. So, we haven't given you a number for those since we only give one quarter forward.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, my second question is on, kind of the order cadence, given some of the more headline volatility in terms of macro and in terms of the stock market early in 2016. Have you seen kind of a change in your order cadence or has demand been pretty steady in the first two months of this new year?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Our first two months in the industry, are really hard to read all the time. We have markets going on that change time. We have a seasonality that consumers want to go through Christmas with spending, and you have the winter weather, the harsher weather and others. So, when we are in the first January, February, it's really difficult to read relative to an ongoing trend. We have to get more through March to see how the thing levels out, because people buy inventory sooner or later, the weather can change the peace. So I mean I can't say we have a good clear view at this minute.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right, thanks guys. Great quarter.","Operator","I'm showing that there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to the presenters.","Jeffrey S.

Jeff?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank.","During the first quarter, Mohawk continued to deliver a strong performance. Our earnings per share were $1.70 excluding unusual charges, an increase of 38% on a constant exchange rate. The highest first quarter adjusted EPS in the company\u2019s history. During the period, our adjusted operating margin was approximately 10%, an increase of 170 basis points compared to the prior year as a result of new products, higher volume and numerous productivity issues across the enterprise.","Revenues grew across all segments with first quarter sales increasing approximately 6% at a constant exchange rate adjusted for additional days and disposable \u2013 disposed ceramic plant. Our results were even more outstanding when the impact of the strengthening dollar is excluded as EPS would have been approximately $1.90 per share.","During the period, we improved SG&A as a percentage of sales by 90 basis points across the business, even as we expanded our sales organization, introduced leading product innovation and implemented merchandising systems that showcase our product value. We further enhanced productivity, efficiency and inventory management across the business to reduce our costs and improve our service levels.","All of our segments introduced new products with unique features and benefits to differentiate our offerings and improve our mix. As the global economy improves we are well-positioned in each of our markets to expand our sales and margins with our leading brands, product offerings and expansive distribution.","During the period the U.S. economy showed some improvement with housing sales and remodeling investments softer than predicted. Consumer confidence rebounded in March with the improved job market increasing personal income. In April, the National Association of Home Builders reported a rise in builder confidence and gains in new housing starts.","In March, about one-third of new home purchases were made by first-time buyers, a stronger trend that could further improve housing growth during 2015. The National Association of Realtors reported that existing home sales in March rose to the highest rate in 18 months. And Harvard\u2019s LIRA index is forecasting improvement in residential remodeling. The consensus among commercial construction forecasts is for continued growth in 2015.","The Mexican ceramic industry continues to expand as government support of manufacturing and construction sectors has contributed significantly to the country\u2019s GDP growth. Europe is showing signs of improvement as the Central Bank lowers interest rates and provides greater stimulus for the economy. The Russian economy continues to slow and the government is lowering interest rates and subsidizing home mortgages. Local manufacturers are benefiting from a significant decline in higher cost imports and consumers are using their savings to purchase products before inflation impacts.","Turning to a review of our first quarter performance by segment, sales in our Carpet segment grew approximately 4% on a comparable daily basis. Our adjusted operating income increased 20% with a margin of 5.5%, up 40 basis points over the prior year. Our sales of commercial carpet, rugs and hard surface products increased more than our residential carpet sales which improved as we went through the quarter. We have completed our Continuum manufacturing expansion and are increasing sales in this faster growing polyester category.","As consumer demand shifts to lower priced polyester products, it is de-mixing our residential selling prices. Sales of our Mohawk branded LVT, wood and ceramic products continue to grow in both residential and commercial sectors. The business continues to drive improvement through product innovation, while enhancing our productivity with process simplification, improved product management, leading-edge technologies and material optimization. SmartStrand Forever Clean, the next generation of our exclusive SmartStrand franchise, was launched in the first quarter and continues to gain momentum in the marketplace.","During the period, flooring retailers voted Forever Clean as the best new carpet introduction and the most innovative flooring product in any category.","Our new residential products have been well received with commitments for over 12,000 display systems, increasing sample investment in the period. Our expanded Karastan distribution and new product introductions have increased our sales in the luxury carpet category. The dealers across the industry also chose our new Karastan Studio display as the industry\u2019s best merchandising system.","Our participation in the builder multi-family channels increased as we expanded our relationships with leading accounts. In rugs, our sales mix improved in all product categories by leveraging our unique fiber technologies that differentiate our products in the marketplace. In commercial carpet, we continue to improve our sales and operating margin through innovative designs, process simplification and material optimization.","To strengthen our presence in the growing educational sector we introduced the Get Smart collection which coordinates broad loom, carpet tile in squares and planks, as well as LVT to meet the needs of any institution. We are further enhancing our position in the fast-growing hospitality sector with expanded hard surface offerings, complementary carpet tile collections, and our new Definity technology as an alternative to traditional woven carpets.","During the period, we reduced SG& A as a percent of sales by streamlining administrative and distribution functions while investing in additional salespeople and point-of-sale merchandising. We have completed our Continuum fiber expansion and aligned material flows to improve cost, service and inventory turns. Across this segment we delivered productivity improvements from enhanced processes, distribution efficiencies and reengineered material strategy. During the quarter, our raw material costs were higher than in the same period last year.","We anticipate material costs improving in the second quarter partially offset by greater promotions, competition in commodity, and higher freight costs. All of these factors have been built into our future estimate.","For the quarter, our Ceramic segment sales rose 9% with a constant exchange rate and comparable days excluding a disposed ceramic plant. For the period, our operating margins increased to approximately 12%, up 290 basis, as our product mix, manufacturing costs and SG&A improved. Our regional ceramic organizations are outperforming our competitors on a local basis as we leverage our product innovation, manufacturing expertise and distribution advantages.","Our U.S. ceramic business continues to strengthen as we introduce unique products in all of our channels. In the period, new product introductions represented 25% of our total sales. We increased our average selling price in all product categories with enhanced visuals and larger formats across the range. We are supplementing our domestically produced collections with products manufactured across our global operations from Mexico, Italy and China.","Our statement ceramic shop concept is improving our customer sales and margins. And we anticipate having 250 installed in the most successful ceramic retailers by year-end. As the commercial renovation market gains momentum, we are expanding the specifications of our products with major accounts across the country. Our new Tennessee ceramic manufacturing plant remains on schedule with the construction of the building now underway and staffing strategies being implemented.","Across the business we delivered productivity gains to enhance material formulations, reduced labor costs and improved quality control. We have consolidated our distribution network and enhanced our logistic system to drive efficiencies and improve delivery times. For the 11th consecutive year, retailers voted one of our ceramic collections as the best in the industry, underscoring our leadership in design and technical innovation.","The ceramic market in Mexico is expected to grow 7% to 10% this year and we are gaining significant share as a result of our styling and expanded distribution. Our margins are improving as we enhance our product mix and lower our costs. We\u2019re expanding our customer base as well as our participation in commercial and new construction channels.","Our European ceramic sales and margins were stronger than we anticipated with growth in all of our markets except France and greater improvement in our export markets. Our focus on bringing more differentiated products to market has expanded our distribution and improved our average selling price. We have completed the installation of about half of our production upgrades and anticipate the completion of our plan in the third period.","We are benefiting from the realignment of our plants and gaining efficiencies from our investments in new manufacturing technologies. During the period, new introductions accounted for almost 40% of our sales in Europe as we eliminated older products to focus on our higher value collections. We anticipate continued margin improvement throughout 2015 as this year\u2019s introductions gain traction and our cost position improves from productivity gains and material enhancements.","Although the Russian ceramic industry and overall economy continues to decline, our ceramic sales on a local basis rose significantly as we gained market share from imports and increased participation in new construction and DIY channels. The strong performance of porcelain collections improved our mix and volume, yielding higher operating profits in rubles than last year in a difficult environment. We raised prices in the region 10% to offset the inflation of our costs.","Almost half of our sales during the period were from collections introduced since 2013. Our new product introductions this year are being well received. We are opening new franchise stores and aggressively pursuing new construction projects to enhance our market share this year while continuing to improve productivity, logistics and material optimizations. Our performance in Laminate & Wood segment was better than anticipated during the quarter on a local basis.","Net sales for Laminate & Wood segment increased approximately 5% at a constant exchange rate and days basis. The segment\u2019s adjusted operating income was 14%, an increase of 280 basis points over last year. The segment\u2019s improved results were driven by positive volume and mix, productivity improvement and successful product introductions, offset by the stronger dollar.","On a local basis, our European laminate business showed improvement with strong growth in the UK, Australia and Russia partially offset by lower sales in France. Sales of our new Impressive laminate collection have grown rapidly during \u2013 due to the product\u2019s richly detailed surface and exclusive water resistant technology. Greater initial sales than we anticipated constrained some early shipments. However, our production has been expanded to support the higher projected volume. Russian laminate sales increased significantly as consumers purchased locally produced goods rather than higher-priced imports.","During the period, we implemented a 6% price increase in Russia in response to inflationary pressures. Our European LVT sales continue to expand as we increase our presence in this fast-growing category. We are aggressively marketing new LVT collections produced at our facility in Belgium to achieve our product expansion goal. We are leveraging our Pergo and Quick-Step brands to increase our Czech wood sales and improve our product mix. We have increased automation at our Malaysian wood facility which is reducing our costs.","In the U.S. new laminate product launches featuring our most realistic visuals and textures drove sales across all channels with retailers selecting one of our new collections as the best new laminate product, the fifth consecutive year we\u2019ve received this honor. Our Style My floor app was voted by retailers as the best consumer sales tool across all product categories. Sales of our engineered wood collections increased in both our retail in new construction channels and we announced a price increase for this category during the period.","Across all our U.S. Laminate & Wood operations we offset higher costs by implementing new productivity initiatives while increasing investments in merchandising and sales personnel. We continued the integration of our Belgian board business with Spano with the closure of higher cost assets, equipment upgrades to improve productivity, increased use of recycled raw material. Margins have improved from our expanded product offering, reduced SG&A and increased volume. We are introducing new insulation products, which will expand the types of applications and price options. We are adding dedicated sales personnel to increase the distribution of our insulation products.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $1.881 billion, up 4% as reported, or 6% with constant exchange rate and days. As Jeff mentioned earlier, the first quarter this year had approximately four more days and the fourth quarter will have four fewer days than last year, which had about a 6% impact on sales. All segments grew in local currency with FX reducing sales approximately $137 million compared to last year. Our gross profit margin as reported was 27.2%. Excluding restructuring it was 27.7%, up 80 basis points from last year with increased volume and productivity driving improvement. Our SG&A was $468 million or 24.9% of sales. It was 18.1% of sales excluding restructuring which is a 90 basis point improvement even after investments we\u2019ve made back into the business.","Restructuring and unusual charges were $138 million for the quarter of which $10 million was in cost of goods sold and $128 million in SG&A with the majority related to a previously announced settlement of a lawsuit and the balance in the Laminate & Wood acquisition restructuring and carpet plant closures. We estimate $25 million to $30 million of additional restructuring in the last three quarters of this year. Our operating margin, excluding charges, was 9.6%, up 170 basis points with FX translation impacting results approximately $21 million compared to last year.","Our interest expense came in at $16 million, that\u2019s down $6 million primarily due to last year\u2019s redemption of $254 million of the 2016 bonds and the implementation of our new commercial paper program. Also, we\u2019ve improved our working capital management this year to drive lower interest expense. Other income was $1 million which increased $6 million \u2013 which improved $6 million, primarily due to foreign currency gains.","The income tax rate was 25% for the quarter compared to 22% last year and was higher than expected this quarter due to the timing of certain deductions. We are still estimating a full-year rate of 21% to 22% in 2015. Our earnings per share excluding charges were $1.70 per share, which is up 38% from last year. If we jump to the segments, in the Carpet segment sales were $739 million, up 10% over last year, or 4% in constant days with volume increasing in rugs and hard surface products.","Our operating income margin excluding charges was 5.5%, that\u2019s up 40 basis points with productivity and volume supporting higher margins, partially offset by raw materials, lower mix and higher sample replacements.","In 2014, the full-year margin was up 140 basis points from a year earlier, 2013. We expect the rate of improvement in 2015 to increase as we move through this year. In the Ceramic segment, sales were $720 million, up 4% over last year\u2019s reported or 9% using constant FX and days on a pro forma basis. FX impacted sales approximately $67 million, compared to last year.","Operating income margin excluding charges was 11.9%, that\u2019s up 290 basis points from volume, productivity and improving price mix. FX impacted results in this segment approximately $10 million compared to last year.","Our first quarter margin growth however is not sustainable, but margins will improve for the full year above last year\u2019s margins. In our Laminate & Wood segment sales were $448 million, which is down 4% as reported. However, sales were up 5% on a constant FX and days basis. The declining euro reduced sales approximately $7 million versus last year.","Our operating income margin excluding charges was $14.3%, that\u2019s up 280 basis points due to higher volume and operations productivity with the weak euro negatively impacting results by approximately $11 million. The margin growth rate in the first quarter will not continue throughout this year, but we do expect full year margins will improve year-over-year. In our corporate and eliminations segment, our operating loss was $10 million in the quarter and we are expecting a $30 million to $35 million loss for the full year.","If we move to the balance sheet, receivables ended up at $1.159 billion with DSOs at 54 days, slightly up from 53 days last year. Inventories ended at $1.506 billion with our days improving to 112 days compared to 115 days last year. Fixed assets were $2.619 billion, which includes CapEx of $106 million in the first quarter with depreciation and amortization of $86 million. We estimate the CapEx \u2013 we estimate CapEx of $450 million for the full year in 2015 and depreciation and amortization at $375 million, excluding acquisitions. Our total long-term debt was $2.4 billion with leverage at 1.9 times debt to EBITDA.","Jeff, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you at this point.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. We were pleased with our progress during the first quarter and anticipate improving U.S. economy and a stronger flooring market will benefit our business for the remainder of the year. The U.S. continued economic and income growth, low gasoline prices and interest rates, and increased home values should drive our business throughout 2015. In Europe, we are seeing improvement in some areas as the market slowly recovers from a prolonged downturn. We expect our European sales in local currency to improve slightly with new product introductions enhancing our mix along with manufacturing and productivity initiatives improving margins.","In Russia, our leading brand and product positions combined with efficient manufacturing will improve our market share in a challenging economy, while increased inflation and competition will impact our margins. Throughout the business we are introducing innovative new products across all categories that are being well received in their markets generating higher growth in margins.","Foreign currency will continue to negatively impact our results during the second quarter with the euro approximately 20 weaker and the ruble approximately 30% lower than last year. This will partially be mitigated by our sales and productivity initiatives, SG&A reductions, and cost improvement projects.","Taking all these factors into account, our guidance for the second quarter earnings is $2.51 to $2.60 per share excluding any earnings from acquisitions or restructuring charges. Our second quarter earnings guidance would have been approximately $0.25 per share higher on a constant exchange rate relative to last year. After the close of the transactions in the second quarter, we estimate the IVC and Kai acquisitions will add $0.06 to $0.08 per share earnings in the second period.","We anticipate significant opportunities in our IVC acquisition, which will expand our participation in LVT and fiberglass sheet vinyl categories in the U.S. and Europe, and our Kai acquisition, which will increase our ceramic participation in Eastern Europe. These acquisitions will improve our future growth, broaden our geographic coverage, and solidify our position as the world\u2019s largest flooring manufacturer.","We\u2019ll now be glad to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Andrew Brown","Hi, guys. This is actually Andrew Brown on the line for David. We were wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on your comments on the increased participation in the builder and multi-family channel. Specifically is that just the result of more feet on the street, new product introductions or something else, and whether the strength has been specific to any region or more of a national trend?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","It\u2019s just a national strategy to make sure that we participate fully in the channel. It\u2019s been doing better during the period, so we\u2019re putting more effort into it across the different divisions.","Andrew Brown","Okay. So no regions have been particularly strong?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I don\u2019t understand the question.","Andrew Brown","I was just saying no regions within the country have been stronger on a relative basis than another?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I don\u2019t have it by region here, but there is more hard surface being sold into it. We\u2019re participating more with it and making sure that we\u2019re focused on the growing accounts across the country.","Andrew Brown","Okay, great. And then on the commercial carpet side, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the growth you are saying there. Which verticals have shown relative strength or weakness?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","The commercial business during the first quarter outperformed the residential business. What we see is that our margins have improved from our offering that we\u2019ve created, our productivity that we are doing on new fiber innovation. Tile is growing faster than the broadloom business and the corporate category is growing faster than the others. And then we are continuing to expand our participation in the LVT business in the U.S.","Andrew Brown","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Dahl","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start out with a question on the carpet margins. I think you mentioned that the mixed polyester, it\u2019s negatively impacting selling prices. Wondering if you can comment on just what the margin impact has been there? And then also kind of what the impact from raw materials was in the first quarter and how should we think about that going forward?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","In the first quarter, our income was up 20%. The biggest parts of it were from volume and productivity partially offset by raw material costs compared to last year, a lower mix and then higher sample placements within it. The polyester products sell at anywhere from 5% to 15% cheaper than an equivalent of nylon. So as the market moves, our selling price moves down along with the industries. Just to remind you that our 2014 margins were up 140 basis points from 2013 and we expect continued improvement as we move through the year in the segment.","Frank Boykin","And Mike, I would just add, you\u2019ll see in our 10-Q which will come out in a little bit, in the bridge that we do by each of the divisions that input cost inflation, which includes raw materials, was about $# million for the quarter.","Michael Dahl","Got it, okay. And then, Frank, my second question, you highlighted just the amount of improvement you\u2019ve seen in SG&A, which is really \u2013 it\u2019s pretty impressive when you consider absolute SG&A dollars have still been falling year-over-year despite rising sales. So just wondering your thoughts on how sustainable that is from here, especially as we start to layer on some of these acquisitions?","Frank Boykin","Well, so first off I would say our SG&A as a percent to net sales will continue to improve as we compare year-over-year as we move through the year. The other thing you have to take into consideration is if you look at SG&A on a constant exchange rate basis the value would actually be up a little bit year-over-year. So we will continue to reinvest back into the business to grow the top line, but we will be able to leverage that top line growth with a lower percent to sales.","Michael Dahl","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi, thanks for taking my question today. Just tagging onto your commentary on the Carpet segment and the input cost headwind in the quarter, conversely when you look at your guidance on a go-forward basis for Q2, how much of raw material is benefiting that segment?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We are not giving out a specific amount for the raw materials. Oil, which everyone is focused on is a component of the raw materials we use that make up the chemicals and resins that we use for us. Now in addition we have others like natural gas, corn, soda bottles and other raw materials we use, so it\u2019s one of a myriad of components. The oil prices have started to rise somewhat and we are seeing some changes in our raw materials. Our raw materials are basically purchased on a market basis or on a cost plus basis, so they change continuously. But we expect benefit in the second quarter and beyond, but we haven\u2019t identified a specific amount.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay, great. Thank you. And then on the IVC acquisition, is there any risk to that not closing in Q2? I know it\u2019s very difficult to quantify that, but to what you can comment, what risk would there be to not closing the quarter?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Listen, I can\u2019t guarantee what the government does. We think there is a very low risk that it doesn\u2019t go through, all the antitrust filings except the EU have been approved and we anticipate the EU approval sometime in June.","Kathryn Thompson","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. A question on LVT, are you starting to see any price moves particularly in the deflation and pricing at LVT given the capacity that\u2019s starting to come online either in the U.S. or in Europe?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","First I have to start that the LVT market is really growing rapidly and we are expecting it to be up somewhere 15% across the world in the different markets we are in, so it is absorbing it. The LVT prices was primarily driven by the Chinese across the world markets as different ones, and we don\u2019t see significant changes in the pricing of those at this point. There is more capacity coming into the marketplaces. We expect the markets to evolve. There is going to be more innovation and styling of performance in the category.","We believe there are going to be different features and benefits added by the new participants, us included. There will be more differentiated products and those will have higher margins than other ones. We anticipate that our plant and others will improve manufacturing efficiencies costs over time and all this will be reflected in the market.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Switching it to carpet, you called out the mix in polyester, this has been going on for a long time. Is there anything new that\u2019s come about, or is this just a continual gradual mix shift down?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","It\u2019s the same thing that\u2019s been going on for some period.","Keith Hughes","There\u2019s no news step down or anything like that?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","It\u2019s just that it keeps increasing in its proportion of the total, so it makes up a bigger part of it.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baugh from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","John Baugh","Thank you for taking my questions, and good morning, congratulations. Carpet segment, there\u2019s so many pieces that aren\u2019t carpet. It sounds like residential units were down, I don\u2019t know, were commercial units down also? Then you mentioned you were trending up in the quarter residentially sort of what would be your volume pure carpet, excluding rugs, for the rest of the year, Jeff?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We did not say what you said. We said that our surface products in rugs were up more. We don\u2019t give out specific pieces about each. The industry volume in carpet showed up, I think, about 3.5% in total, but the industry numbers we believe \u2013 not we believe, the industry numbers don\u2019t take into consideration changes in calendars. And we know that our calendar as well as others change, so we think that the number is a little higher than the actual pieces on comparable days that will offset itself going into the \u2013 it will take through the year to get it back in line because of the calendar changes.","John Baugh","Okay. And then my follow-up to that, but I had a question on the timing of the acquisitions as well. The follow-up to that would be any thoughts about how volumes in carpet go through the year? And then, Frank, on the two acquisitions assuming they close, any thoughts about earnings impact to the back half of the year? Thank you.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I think that the carpet unit volumes will be up a limited 1%, 2% maybe; it would be more or less as we go through.","Frank Boykin","And, John, on the two acquisitions, we said 6% to 8% accretion assuming, we\u2019re assuming that the Kai acquisition closes in May and the IVC acquisition closes in June, so $0.06 to $0.08 accretion.","John Baugh","Yes, I know. Any thoughts on the back half?","Frank Boykin","Oh, sorry. We haven\u2019t really quantified that, Jeff.","John Baugh","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","In our carpet business, we believe we are going to improve our mix by increasing our SmartStrand sales with our new introductions and differentiation with SmartStrand Forever Clean.","John Baugh","Great. Good luck. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Stephen East","Okay, yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Jeff, just sort of to follow on a little bit, you gave some fairly good detail about what you all are expecting in Europe. As you look at the U.S. with your guidance, it sounds like just sort of a general market improvement that you\u2019re counting on, or is there some more that\u2019s going on specifically in the US related to your business that you think will drive your business a bit faster than maybe the industry?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We are optimistic about the industry in total and where it\u2019s going and what\u2019s going on in the different markets. And in our business we have a lot of initiatives including \u2013 we mentioned that the new introductions in carpet. We have commitments for over 12,000 new display systems which will improve our retail business, which is the part that has better margins because it\u2019s higher quality products. We are expanding our ceramic business and our other categories and all the businesses are doing the right things to improve more than the industry in general.","Stephen East","Okay, thanks. And then if you looked at the ceramic op margin, you talked about, okay, don\u2019t expect a similar type improvement as you go through the year. But can you talk a little bit about how much the U.S. was driving your op margin in ceramic versus Europe? And then you\u2019ve talked a lot about the commercial side of the business for carpet, but can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on with the \u2013 on the ceramic side of commercial?","Frank Boykin","I will address the margin question and then let Jeff address the other part of the question. So in all four of our regions, Mexico, U.S., Russia, and Europe, the margin percentages improved year-over-year. Now the translation of the rubles and the euros had a negative impact obviously on Russia and Europe coming back in dollars, but the margin percentages improved in all of them. They were all \u2013 strong performance in all four.","Stephen East","Okay.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I forgot the other part of your question?","Stephen East","The other part, just what\u2019s going on with ceramic on the commercial side? You talked about carpet, but an update there. Is that driving that business?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I think the ceramic business, the ceramic commercial business we have more difficulty in actually breaking it out, because a lot of the products go both ways and you can\u2019t see them. Our general belief is that the commercial business with us is growing slightly less than the other \u2013 than the residential business because so much of it\u2019s going into new construction and you get higher growth rates in the new \u2013 it\u2019s a much bigger part of the total category.","Stephen East","Okay. All right, thanks. And one last question, any markets giving true pricing power other than Russia with the inflation?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","The pricing is really driven by mix and products, so in Europe we are increasing our pricing, but we keep talking about the product introductions. In our categories we try to differentiate the products so more of it\u2019s coming from product innovation than it is coming from raising the pieces above inflationary pieces and\/or reducing our cost through productivity improvements.","Stephen East","Okay. So the raw material pressures that you felt really aren\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t truly pass them through, but only with a different product if you will?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","No, I didn\u2019t say that. We try to pass through the raw material changes. What I thought you are asking me is \u2013 was I raising prices unrelated to raw materials.","Stephen East","I was, but then I assume that you weren\u2019t really changing pricing just due to raw materials, though.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","So we raise prices as the raw materials change in all the marketplaces, because raw materials make up such a large part of all our categories.","Stephen East","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Robert Wetenhall","Good morning and congrats on a very nice quarter, very strong on a like-for-like basis. Hey, I just wanted to get your thinking right now on IVC and Kai acquisition in terms of how significant is this and how should we be thinking about synergies as you close on these acquisitions in May and June and any other kind of update around these transactions.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Well, let\u2019s start with IVC. IVC, the first to repeat what it is, they are the leading manufacturer of ceramic in the Bulgarian and Romanian marketplace and they have the low-cost positions in the marketplace. With the Kai business we are going to focus on improving their product offering in the marketplace, implementing best practices from product design to manufacturing costs et cetera and then exporting products to Western Europe to supplement our business, as well as helping them expand within the categories and regions they are in. On IVC, the main categories are leveraging the Mohawk relationships, brands and design both in the U.S. and the European markets. In the U.S. market we can help drive their products through the commercial market. There are best practices we can learn from both and then just leveraging the strong management and efficient manufacturing they have to improve those across everything and best practices in everything.","Frank Boykin","And Bob, I would just add with regards to how big or how significant they are, we had guided the EPS accretion in the first 12 months because we never know exactly when they are going to close \u2013 for the first 12 months of $0.25 to $0.45 for IVC and $0.10 to $0.15 for Kai. And we obviously always try to do better than that and improve, but that\u2019s what we are guiding right now.","Robert Wetenhall","That\u2019s really helpful. And I think, Jeff, you had said that LVT as a product category is growing 15%, which is a pretty rapid clip. And it sounds like there\u2019s a lot more domestic production and now with IVC you\u2019re going to have greater capability in Europe as well, I guess two plants under Mohawk. And I just wanted to ask, is LVT from your perspective a game changer in flooring? And is it going to be the fastest-growing product category? And do you see this taking share from competing products? And how does that kind of unfold in the next 12 to 24 months? Thanks very much and good luck.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","LVT is a product that brings certain values to certain uses, which is what\u2019s driving it. We believe it\u2019s going to continue to expand in its style and design as well as performance features and other things. All those things are helping it grow. It\u2019s starting from a relatively low base. We think it will continue to grow and take market share and it\u2019s going to take market share from all of the different categories because the flooring market is not increasing because you have a new product category coming into it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Dennis McGill","Hi, thank you guys for taking the question. Frank, just to push you a little bit more on the carpet margins to make sure we understand the moving pieces here. When you look at the last few years, the margin expansion call it somewhere in that 130, 150 basis points has been without the same type of raw material headwind that you\u2019d expect this year. And volume seems to be accelerating, demand seems to be accelerating as well. So, is there any reason you couldn\u2019t see the same type of lift on an annual basis that you saw in the prior year\u2019s? Or is there something on the efficiency or caustic outside that would be different?","Frank Boykin","Yes. I mean, I think we will continue to see good improvement year-over-year and full-year margins on the carpet side.","Dennis McGill","I know you don\u2019t want to give guidance, which I\u2019m not really asking for. But on the fixed cost side is there anything that would be different about how that would play out this year versus the last couple years?","Frank Boykin","Well, as Jeff has said earlier, we have seen some improvement that we think is going to impact our P&L in the latter part of the year on raw materials. We are continuing to put in place productivity improvements that will benefit us, taking out both fixed and variable cost and so margins should improve.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","And mix should continue to improve as we go through the year if we don\u2019t get any surprises. At the same time the raw materials are volatile we don\u2019t know where they are, so we\u2019ll have to see where they end up.","Frank Boykin","And we don\u2019t know what competition is going to do with regards to processing either.","Dennis McGill","I guess that\u2019s why I was kind of asking more so on the productivity side, as far as what you are budgeting this year. Is that somewhat consistent with what you\u2019ve been able to generate the last couple years?","Frank Boykin","We will continue to generate good productivity.","Dennis McGill","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. You line is open. Please go ahead.","Susan Maklari","Good morning.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Good morning.","Susan Maklari","I wanted to know, in the carpet side, it sounds like the residential consumer business has definitely slowed and you\u2019re doing some more promotions there. Can you give us a sense of maybe what would drive some more improvements in that or what the trends are?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","As I said earlier, the U.S. market and the economy wasn\u2019t as strong as anybody thought it was going to be in the first quarter. And we are assuming, like everyone else with the economy, that it\u2019s going to improve in the first quarter. We are assuming that the housing part will do better, we\u2019re assuming remodeling will improve. So we are looking forward to the category improving as we go through. We think that with our new product introductions and our new commitments for sampling we\u2019re going to improve our business within it and we think we are well-positioned for the rest of the year.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And then in terms of the new product, can you give us any sense of how we can think about the pricing or maybe the profitability on those relative to some of your legacy products?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","It is really more related to price points. The higher priced items have more differentiation and you get more margin off those because of the differentiation. And the lower more commoditized products tend to be more price conscious and we have lower margins on them. So the displayed items tend to be mid- to high-end for the most part. So the new introduction we\u2019ve been talking about tend to create a higher mix for the products. On the other hand, we want to fully participate in the home marketplace including in the commodity products.","Susan Maklari","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie Group. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Ryan Hunter","Hi, this is actually Ryan Hunter filling in for Mike. First question on CapEx, your CapEx has been running at around $500 million, $600 million for previous years and you guided to $450 million for this year. Is this the start of a shift back towards the $300 million level of CapEx over the next several years? And can you give us your take on the pipeline and pay-off opportunities still see?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","The part of the CapEx in the past is dependent on a few things. One is it was higher as the carpet industry shifted to polyester. We have been putting more money in all our businesses with the acquisitions and putting those together. So this year the CapEx is now around $450 million. We haven\u2019t put the plan together for next year. There will be some additional CapEx with the new acquisitions that are required for them and managing those. We\u2019ve been more aggressive with interest rates being low. We are putting more new capital in the businesses. We are also investing in other areas such as we are putting up a new ceramic plant in Tennessee as we speak. We have a lot of major things going in this year. I can\u2019t tell you what it\u2019s going to be next year until we get further in the year and start focusing on it.","Frank Boykin","The only thing I would add to that would be that the $300 million number you quoted was back before we had the Marazzi and Pergo and Spano acquisitions, and the size of the company was much smaller. Our G&A now is running $375 million, could go up to $400 million next year. So it\u2019s hard to imagine that we\u2019d hit a run rate of $300 million CapEx over a long period of time. But we can \u2013 if the economy changes, if situation circumstances change, we can make adjustments pretty quickly as we showed over the last few years.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We are going to continue investing. I mean, we believe the economy is going to be relatively good for a while. We continue investing to take advantage of it and position the company to improve its margins. The margins keep going up not because we just show up every day.","Ryan Hunter","Yes, awesome. And you guys have had some positive commentary in the U.S. flooring industry growth, which has lagged other building product categories over the last several years. What are you guys seeing that tells you that we\u2019ll see North American growth accelerate? And do you envision a period of cyclical catch up that you talked about previously?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","What we said was we thought it would be better than last year. Whether it\u2019s equal or better than the other things, I don\u2019t really have an opinion on. I think it\u2019s has lagged. Part of it has been that we\u2019ve said is that people that own existing homes haven\u2019t been investing in them as they had in prior times. We are hoping as the housing prices go up people get more comfortable about putting more money in their homes as their incomes go up that they put money in them. And we don\u2019t see any reason why that won\u2019t occur over time.","Ryan Hunter","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steven Kim from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Steven Kim","Thanks very much. I wanted to ask another question on margins, but wanted to particularly talk about it from the perspective of productivity. Our sense is that much of the margin improvement and the improvement in productivity has been related to investments that you have been making as opposed to things that you might categorize as cost-cutting. I was wondering, obviously within the cost cutting there were some related to the acquisitions, Pergo for example and Spano I assume, and you also closed the ceramic facility. But I guess is there a way you could help us think through how much of the margin improvement we\u2019ve seen and maybe how much of the groundwork set for future growth has been achieved in your view through investments as opposed to cutting?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We have the information I don\u2019t have in front of me. We gave \u2013 it is significant of both and it\u2019s more than just cutting and investment. So you have one part that\u2019s coming from new equipment that\u2019s allowing us to do things. Another is consolidating the existing facilities to make them more efficient. Another is strategies in our raw materials and processes to make them more efficient. Another is reengineering our raw material strategies to lower our costs. We have done things to improve productivity with systems.","We have reduced our cost of distribution by improving the processes, the fill rates of the trucks and different things. So it\u2019s all parts of the business. When we go into every year, every one of the business functions has a cost savings plan and efficiency and productivity issues that start from the bottom-up and top-down and they are set up with hundreds of actions to be taken during the year and implemented in a very disciplined manner. Typically out of the list we probably achieve about 75% of what\u2019s on the list as well as add more things to it. It\u2019s very disciplined how we drive change through the organization.","Steven Kim","That\u2019s great, that certainly seems to be coming through here in the results. I wanted to ask \u2013 my second question I wanted to ask regarding products and the differentiation there. I think on the call you mentioned in ceramic that the U.S. was seeing 25% of its sales from new products, Europe 40%, Russia 50% that kind of thing. I wanted to see if you could give us some comparison to what you think is standard in the industry. Is that just sort of par for the course in the industry? I assume not.","And also maybe some historical perspective. Is this an accelerated rate of sort of new product contribution versus what we\u2019ve seen in the past? And then a quick follow-on. Is it true that roughly half or even more of your carpet sales are \u2013 really don\u2019t have direct competition?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","It\u2019s not easy to give you a flat answer. What happens is in the product life cycles we have commodity products that can last six, seven, eight years. We have very high fashion things that three years could be in some of them and the average depends on the product mix and pieces and comparing one business to another depends on your participation in the different markets and ages. I think what we were trying to do \u2013 so if you took the 25%, that would mean that we turn the whole thing over in four years with the lowest number we gave you and 50% means that over a two- or three-year period you\u2019ve changed it so it shows how much growth the new introductions are causing and changing in the marketplace.","We\u2019re also using those, as we said, to drive simplicity in the operations as well as trying to differentiate performance features and value add to the customers. So again, like our capital expenditures, we have very disciplined processes within each business to say what are we going to do different to bring value to the marketplace which includes, A, differentiation, on the other side is cost-cutting which we hope the customers don\u2019t see it as we go through and improve value. I forgot the last part of your question.","Frank Boykin","Maybe if you could clarify that second question for us. I\u2019m not quite sure what you are asking, half of our carpet products don\u2019t have direct competition. Maybe give us a little more color on what you\u2019re trying to?","Steven Kim","Yes, sure. So we know that with the Continuum innovation, for example, that\u2019s something that is a differentiated product fundamentally. We know that with the SmartStrand and the ever clean now, we know that\u2019s obviously something which you can\u2019t just get from somebody else. And their Karastan brand similarly had got a unique niche in the marketplace and things like that. That kind of thing is what I was addressing. These kinds of sort of \u2013 I would say sort of step function changes are materially different type of products within the carpet segment. Would it be fair to say that that represents the majority of your sales in that segment?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","It\u2019s a large part, but \u2013 so Continuum is our way of participating in the polyester category and adding something other than my price is different than someone else\u2019s. So it\u2019s an entire strategy around how can I add value to the customer? How can I have a differentiated selling story so when they make choices they prefer ours? Now to say that there\u2019s no alternative polyester products that can be used for the same customer is incorrect. So there are incremental differences of how you differentiate things in a common marketplace and we spend a lot of time doing that and those things help our customers give reasons to their customers why they should buy it and help their margins and help them say you should buy from me, which is why it has value.","Steven Kim","Okay. I didn\u2019t hear a number there, but that\u2019s fine. Appreciate the help and good luck.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Eric Bosshard","Two questions for you. First of all, Frank, you commented that the margin progress in laminate and tile in the first quarter wasn\u2019t sustainable through the balance of the year. Can you give us a little bit of color what may have incrementally benefited 1Q that doesn\u2019t recur through the balance of the year? Just a little color behind that statement would be helpful.","Frank Boykin","I think the best way to answer it is our business doesn\u2019t move in a straight line. We\u2019ve got puts and takes in all of our businesses every quarter. And we try to look at it on a full-year basis and, like I\u2019ve said, I think all of our \u2013 we believe all of our segments are going to improve margins year-over-year. Those two segments just performed much better with all things clicking \u2013 all eight cylinders clicking this quarter.","Eric Bosshard","Secondly, in terms of tile sourcing, it sounded like you commented that there were some Europe tile export opportunities. Could you just expand a little bit on if there are opportunities to benefit from a lower euro in terms of your tile manufacturing assets?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We commented in two different areas. In the U.S. market, we bring product into the U.S. market from Mexico, China and Europe and we bring different products in based on the economics of what they are and\/or differences in the equipment or pieces as well as supplementing our other things. For the most part the European imports tend to be very high end differentiated products. They tend to go into the commercial business and in some differentiated residential products, such as in Europe we are making ceramic wood looks 6 feet long. The market here is limited so making them there and bringing them in is a good idea.","Mexico we have low cost manufacturing and we tend to bring in certain products there, but as we have bought Marazzi and putting in a new plant we are using more of that to satisfy the local market, but we\u2019re bringing them in. China has very specific products that they make low-cost because of what \u2013 they sell a huge amount of them and they are set up to make them differently. So we are bringing in specific products for different reasons. The other thing we mentioned was with the new acquisition of Kai, our business in Europe in ceramic we\u2019re focused on the mid- to high-end. Kai is a low-cost producer in a low-cost area where we have access to the water to move it relatively cheaply.","And we believe that we can use those assets to participate more in the lower part of the marketplace which tends to come from Turkey and Poland in Europe now. So it using our worldwide assets to maximize what they\u2019re good for and then as the markets change we\u2019ll change and move around.","Eric Bosshard","Great. And then my second question, in terms of the carpet investment in samples, Frank, that sounded like third in line as you explain the carpet margin performance in the quarter. Any way to frame the magnitude of that or if that is sustained through the year or more focused on 1Q?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","It will be higher for the year because we are investing more in it. However, what we have done is cut other overhead costs. We\u2019re making other arrangements to cut costs in our carpet business on things on the backside and invest more into new samples, new products and more sales personnel which should help us drive the top line.","Eric Bosshard","Great. Thank you.","Operator","There are no questions on the phone lines. So I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mr. Lorberbaum for closing comments.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We had a very good quarter in the first quarter. We are anticipating the year continuing to get better. And we are enthusiastic about our position and the marketplaces. We appreciate you joining us. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mohawk Industries Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded, today, February 24, 2012. Thank you. I would now like to introduce Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and CEO. Mr. Lorberbaum, you may begin your conference.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Good morning. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2011 conference call. Joining me on this call is Frank Boykin, our CFO, who'll review our Safe Harbor statement and later our financial results.","Frank H. Boykin","I would like to remind everyone that our press release and statements we make on this call may include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This call may include a discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release at the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Our fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.62 as reported or $0.72 excluding unusual items, an increase of 9% over 2010. Volume and price increases, as well as cost reductions, contributed to our earnings improvement over last year. Sales grew by 9% as reported or 10% on a local basis with all segments showing sales growth over the last 3 quarters. Price increases across many product categories are being implemented in the first quarter to offset higher costs. Excluding unusual items, we reduced SG&A to 18.9% of sales, holding spending flat with last year by overcoming inflation and specific growth investments. ","Our leverage is at historically low levels with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 2x, and we have liquidity of more than $900 million available to redeem our 2012 bonds and provide flexibility for future opportunities. In the U.S., both our residential and commercial categories expanded, but the commercial category continued to expand at a faster rate than residential. Builder sentiment rose in January for the fourth consecutive month. In 2012, forecasts for existing home sales expect growth of 5% and for new home starts improving about 15%. The trend has been improving for both U.S. consumer confidence and employment. Our long-term outlook supports a rebound from the present low level -- sales levels experienced by the flooring industry with future growth projected to outpace the overall economy. Frank, would you give the financial report, please?","Frank H. Boykin","Sure. Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We ended the fourth quarter with net sales of $1.378 billion, 9% up over last year. Sales increased in all segments with both residential and commercial gaining over last year. Our gross margin as a percent of sales was 24.3%, down from last year's 27.1%. Raw material inflation impacted us during the quarter, with price increases that were going to be implemented in the first quarter of 2012 to offset the inflation.","SG&A was $269 million or 19.5% of sales as reported. It included noncash charges for an estimated change -- included noncash charges for an estimated change in lease accounting and restructuring activities. Excluding the charges, the fourth quarter SG&A improved by 140 basis points over last year. Our team did an excellent job of managing SG&A. Our full year dollars were actually flat with last year. We were able to offset inflation with productivity improvements. Our emphasis on cost control continues to benefit the business. Charges included $8 million for restructuring and $6 million for a lease accounting change. Dal-Tile results included $3 million of the charges with the balance going into the Mohawk segment. $5 million of the charges were included in cost of goods sold and the remaining $9 million in SG&A. Our operating margin excluding charges was 5.8% compared to 6.9% last year. Interest expense was $24 million, an improvement over last year's $30 million. We had better rates and a new bank facility that resulted in a lower interest expense. We're estimating our 2012 interest expense to be approximately $90 million. Income tax rate excluding charges was 9% during the quarter. We're estimating our full year rate in 2012 to be 20%. Earnings per share excluding charges were $0.72 compared to $0.66 last year, representing a 9% improvement. ","If we turn to the segments, the Mohawk segment sales ended the quarter at $724 million or a 9% improvement. We had a strong fourth quarter this year with improvement in both volume and price. Our SmartStrand and polyester products both performed well. Operating margin excluding charges was 5.7%. The margin was down as a result of higher raw material cost, which impacted our results. We've got productivity improvements that partially offset these higher cost. ","The Dal-Tile segment sales came in at $349 million or a 10% improvement over last year. Our business both in the U.S. and Mexico improved year-over-year. We had one of our strongest quarters in the Dal-Tile business over the last 3 years this past quarter. Our operating income was $22 million or 6.2% of sales. Operating income is up about 10% over last year with our margin percent flat. In raw materials and transportation cost, we had some headwinds during the quarter. We're putting in price increases in the first quarter to offset this inflation. ","Our Unilin segment sales ended the quarter at $326 million, up 10% over last year as reported and on a constant exchange rate basis. Our sales during the quarter were benefited by the Australian distribution acquisition that was closed during the third quarter of 2011 and price increases that we put in place earlier in the year. Operating income for the quarter was $22 million or 6.6% of sales. Our operating income is up slightly over last year as we were impacted by declining mix, as well as start-up costs with our Russian laminate plant. ","Corporate and eliminations segment showed an operating loss of $4 million, which is in line with our expectations. If we move to our balance sheet, our cash ended the quarter at $312 million. That compares to $382 million a year ago. The decline is due to bonds that we paid in the first quarter of 2011. Our receivables were $686 million and continued to be in good shape. Our days sales outstanding ended at 46.7 days, which is about flat with the year ago. Inventories were $1,114,000,000, up over last year with our inventory days showing slight improvement over last year. We were impacted this year in inventory by a prebuy in raw materials, inflation and in the Australian acquisition, which added about $10 million to our inventory. We're continuing to focus on increasing our turns as we move through the year and expect to show improvement through the year. ","Our fixed assets ended the quarter at $1,712,000,000, including CapEx of $93 million during the quarter and depreciation and amortization of $75 million. We're estimating that our capital expenditures for 2012 will be $235 million with depreciation and amortization estimated to be $300 million during 2012. Our long-term debt ended the quarter at $1.586 billion. We increased our bank facility by $150 million in the first quarter of 2012 with pricing that's consistent with our previous bank deal. This will improve our liquidity for any growth opportunities and provide us liquidity for payment of our 2012 bonds that come due in April. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage of 2x is at historical low levels. We're finishing this year with a strong balance sheet and excellent liquidity. Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Our Mohawk segment sales grew by more than 8% with both residential and commercial channels showing improvement. Operating margins were compressed by higher raw material costs and the delay of our price increase until the first quarter of 2012. A price increase of 5% to 7% is presently being implemented and will partially offset material inflation in the first quarter. We continue to lower our manufacturing cost with improved productivity and reduce our infrastructure with efficiency improvements and restructuring activities. ","In our Residential business, we introduced 2 brand extensions in our exclusive SmartStrand product category. SmartStrand Ultra is a unique brand for the specialty retail channel with a collection of new soft stylized products with enhanced warranty that complement their value position. We also introduced the next generation of soft carpets, with our new collection called SmartStrand Silk. No other carpet compares to SmartStrand Silk's soft feel, performance and environmental position. SmartStrand Silk is being enthusiastically received by the market and will begin shipping in the first quarter. Our EverStrand and Wear-Dated Revive polyester products grew significantly, driven by fashionable products, excellent value and industry-leading recycled content. The expansion of our polyester collections with new styles and price points are being well accepted by our customers. We're integrating our premium carpet cushion into our carpet-selling systems to enhance the mix and margins of our customers. Sales of our Mohawk hard surface products grew with engineered hardwood showing the greatest gains, particularly our domestic, exotic and distressed surfaces. We also launched a new line of luxury vinyl tile with our patented Uniclic technology for easier installation. A 2% to 6% price increase for our vinyl products is being implemented this month. ","Commercial sales posted strong year-over-year gains for the sixth consecutive quarter with both broadloom and carpet tile increasing. We've expanded our specifications with national accounts and have realized the strongest growth in corporate hospitality and retail channels. ","In our premium Belize brand, we introduced a SmartStrand collection that leverages its stain resistance and environmental benefits. Our Duracolor collection with premium features and more economical prices was also introduced. We've improved our delivery time on all our commercial products and expanded our quick ship offerings. In addition to the carpet price increase, we also raised delivery charges to offset transportation costs. We believe our prices will align with material costs when they're fully implemented in the second period, and we'll respond to future inflation as necessary. Inventory levels were increased in the fourth period in anticipation of higher material prices in the first quarter. During the quarter, we completed the second phase of our 2011 extrusion expansion to satisfy the growing demand for our SmartStrand and EverStrand products. We're increasing our carpet tile production about 35% with the majority currently operational. We implemented a new soft-surface printing technology with enhanced design capabilities and productivity to strengthen our hospitality in printed rug lines. We re-engineered our existing backing systems and consolidated our offerings to provide better performance, service and value. ","During the year, we deployed new technologies to increase our recycled content, supporting our commitments to sustainable manufacturing. Our Mohawk segment improved productivity yields and performance of our overall infrastructure. We completed the closure of a staple yarn mill and associate extrusion assets in a commercial carpet manufacturing facility. By improving product flow, we further reduced regional warehouse capacity and improved our costs. ","Dal-Tile sales grew about 10% during the quarter with increases in commercial sales still exceeding residential. Hospitality, healthcare, retail and government sectors led the growth of our Commercial business. Our residential sales continued their positive trends for the third consecutive period. Our investments in design technology, product expansion, marketing and distribution sustained the growth of our business. In the first quarter, we're anticipating price increases of 3% to 5% on certain products to cover the higher material and transportation costs. Our statements retail program is selectively adding retailers who want to be the preferred destination for ceramic and stone products. American Olean has replaced 3 distributors in smaller markets to improve our service and market position. We increased our presence in the Home Center channel with expanded offerings in both floor tile and wall tile. We're broadening our design alternatives for larger ceramic tiles at all price levels to meet the expanding demand. Our new ceramic introductions replicating wood finishes are being well-received for use in areas that require high durability or resistance to water. ","In Mexico, we're significantly growing our sales with the expansion of both our customer base and product offerings in anticipation of the completion of our new facility in April of this year. This facility's red body tile will complement the higher value products, which have been our primary focus. ","The new sales we're presently developing will be converted to red body and provide higher margins when the plant is operating efficiently. At the most recent show in Mexico, Mohawk received an award for the best ceramic tile product in the industry. Price increases of 3% to 5% are being implemented to recover increasing material energy costs in Mexico also. In both the U.S. and Mexico, we're increasing the sales of products manufactured by our Chinese JV. In China, new product introductions using our Reveal Imaging and other high-performance technologies are improving Sanfi\u2019s styling and product mix. A new showroom concept is being introduced to enhance the effectiveness of our retailers improve -- and improve our distribution. Changes in government policies to reduce real estate inflation have caused the ceramic industry to slow. We are adjusting our cost structures, product lines and business strategies to accommodate the present environment. Recent banking policy changes to encourage economic expansion should help our industry. ","During the quarter, Dal-Tile reduced cost with improvements in production speeds, yield and process controls along with reductions in waste and energy. With recent investments, we're recycling a higher level of internal waste back into our processes. Sales of our Reveal Imaging continue to strengthen, and we\u2019ve added capacity in the U.S. and Mexico to meet the demand. Our natural gas consumption per unit improved to an all-time low in 2011. Logistic improvements increased shipments from our manufacturing sites directly to our customers, and we implemented lower-cost transportation methods to minimize costs. ","Unilin sales grew 10% as reported and on a local basis. Operating income was reported at $21.6 million, up slightly from last year. Unilin's margins were impacted by material inflation, declining mix and the start-up of several major initiatives. ","Our laminate and wood flooring products continue growing in Europe, supported by the success of our new product introductions, expansion of our DIY strategy, the addition of our Australian distribution and Russian manufacturing. ","In Europe, we're implementing a laminate price increase of 2% to 3% in the first quarter. In the fourth quarter, U.S. wood sales grew, laminate was slightly softer, and we saw reductions in inventory by customers. In the U.S., we received additional commitments with Home Centers for both laminate and wood, which will begin shipping in the first quarter. Our new laminate introductions are addressing today's fashion trends with larger formats in both wood planks and tiles. Visually, our new introductions have more character with new rustic, antique and reclaimed looks, complemented with precise embossing to enhance their realism. Our wood products are following similar design trends using soft scraping and multiple color applications to achieve rich appearances. We're introducing more luxury vinyl tile and incorporating our patented click systems where suitable. ","Our U.S. solid wood facilities are being modified further to improve our productivity and lower costs. The consolidation of our wood plants in Malaysia is on track for completion in the first quarter, reducing costs and increasing capacity. Our Russian laminate plant is in the start-up phase and has begun delivering products comparable to our European production. We will increase production at the Russian facility during the first half by offering more locally produced products. We completed the acquisition of an Australian wood and laminate distributor at the end of the third period. Activities to improve processes, coordinate supplies and increase market penetration are ongoing. In the future, other product types may be distributed in Australia. ","Our Board business in Europe is improving our top line growth from our cyclical bottoms, and we have raised prices to recover higher material costs. However, there is significant pressure on our margins due to limited construction and continued excess industry capacity in many of our products. We're combining our 2 board sales forces to increase distribution, product penetration and efficiency. Additional strategies to increase sales, reduce the infrastructure and increase productivity are being executed. Our Insulation Board business, which initiated production about 2 years ago is exceeding our expectation and is presently being expanded. We have also purchased another site in France to manufacture insulation boards, which will be operational in the second half of 2013. Our click furniture rollout is progressing in Europe, and we have made additional investments to communicate the features to the retail consumer. We entered into our first licensing agreement for manufacturing click furniture with our patented technology, and new products have been designed to sell components to other manufacturers of furniture. ","Mohawk's strategy to have a healthier workforce and reduce cost for both the company and our employees is succeeding. We're improving the health of our employees and their families by providing on-site clinics, disease management and education on assessing quality care and shopping for the best value. Our Your Choice Healthplan will be fully implemented in 2013 and should further advance these trends. Training magazine recently recognized Mohawk as the fourth best organization in the country for employee-sponsored training and development programs. In the past 6 years, Mohawk is the only manufacturing company to be selected as one of the top 5 recipients of this award. Throughout this cyclical decline, we have driven significant improvements in our business strategies, organizational talent, product innovation and process enhancement. Improving consumer confidence, a positive employment outlook and lower housing inventories are cause for future optimism. In the first quarter, we anticipated additional sales growth but at a lower rate than the fourth quarter, which had easier comparisons. Presently, we're raising prices on many of our products to recover the inflation of our materials. These increases will not be fully implemented until the second quarter, reducing our first period margins. The start-up expenses on our major projects will impact our short-term results, and additional costs will decline as they ramp up. We expect continued sales growth, higher pricing and productivity improvements will impact favorably our 2012 results. With these factors, our guidance for the first quarter earnings is $0.47 to $0.57 per share, excluding any restructuring costs. The flooring industry should continue its improvement throughout 2012. We have many initiatives to strengthen our product offering, expand our geographic reach, recover raw material inflation and reduce our costs. Our financial structure is strong, and we can take advantage of new opportunities. ","With that, we'll be glad to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The first question I had was on the top line expectations. You'd said in the release that you expect growth in the first quarter but to a lesser rate than the fourth quarter due to easier comparisons you had in the fourth quarter. I was interested if that kind of slower growth rate you expect to be uniform across all 3 segments or with the initiatives that you're having, for example, with the Home Centers with the laminate and wood if Unilin could maybe benefit from that, or if there's any type of company-specific trends that might allow one segment to maybe do a little better than another. And I guess, that question is also more broadly for 2012.","Jeff Lorberbaum","We typically don't get into the exact details of each of the segments in the 4 pieces. I can tell you that for the -- if you look at the full year 2011 growth, we expect those trends to continue going on into 2012. And what happened in '11 though, we had, in the second half, the comparisons were a little easier so they\u2019ll be a little different in '12. But we think that the present trends we're seeing will continue in all the different categories.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I guess the second question is on the margin side. With Unilin kind of lower than where it's been in the last previous few years, and I think you guys have talked about some of it being a negative mix. I guess going forward, over the next 2 or 3 years, I mean, should we expect a 9% to 10% type of level as the new normal? And also if you could give us any thoughts around the royalty situation, if that should change the profitability of the unit over the next year or 2?","Frank H. Boykin","Where to start with that one? The margins in the Unilin segment are depressed as the whole market has gone through a downturn. The market continues to remain difficult, so the margins have been compressed. We see the market remain difficult in the period. As we look forward into next year, we see slowing of the European economy in general. The compression, I guess, relates back to -- in Europe there's more excess capacity in the marketplace as the economy really hasn\u2019t -- in the building segment, things haven't bounced back yet, and there are still customers trading down. What\u2019s happened to ours in the short-term is that our portfolio growth has been more in the non-laminate products, and that growth is that -- and the non-laminate products don't have the same margins as our differentiated laminate products. If you look over the long term, we expect the margins to improve as we come out of this thing going forward. But I think that they'll probably be in the mid-teens rather than we're up in the 18% range -- 16% to 18%, probably be in the 14% to 15% when we come out of this thing.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's actually Susan for David. It sounds like as we go through 2012, you\u2019re focusing more in terms of new products and expansion and those kinds of efforts versus taking cost out of the business. Is that -- should we expect that you're primarily done with a lot of your restructuring and that most of that is sort of behind us as we go through the year?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We've done a lot of restructuring in all the businesses. We don't have any planned at this point. But I have to tell you, we're always looking to better position the business, if we identify opportunities to do that that we'll do it. We will take short-term charges and implement those as we go forward. If I left you the impression we're through with cost reductions, I made a big error. It is on top of the list of each of the divisions. It's pushed down through the pieces. We have developed over the last few years really good systems of identifying potential opportunities. They are all aligned by business, by -- all the way down to the department levels. There are monthly reviews of those pieces, and we're driving them hard.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I just meant more in terms of the bigger trends that we're seeing. And then can you just give us -- has there been any change in what you're seeing in terms of maybe M&A opportunities? Are you seeing more attractive things come up as perhaps the market stabilizes a bit?","Jeff Lorberbaum","There are some conversations going on. As is typical when you're in these points in time, you're sort of at an inflection point where the sellers of businesses believe that they want to get paid for the future improvements, and the buyers want to pay for what the business is presently doing. So in those times, we're in a time where there probably be more acquisitions going on in the marketplace over the next year, but we have to move through those where they profit the line with expectations on both sides.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","Jarrod Rapalje - Longbow Research LLC","It's actually Jarrod Rapalje filling in for David. My first question is on margins. You listed a lot of start-up expenses that are expected to weigh on margins by segment. Can you just talk about where you expect to see the brunt of this affect margins, maybe some quantification about how much of an impact you can see? I know you're just talking about raw material inflation being neutral starting in 2Q. Can -- so what kind of pressure can we expect to see from the start-up costs?","Frank H. Boykin","In the fourth quarter, there was about $3 million of start-up costs. I don't have it by the quarter. For next year, it's probably going to be an additional $8 million to $10 million with most of it front-end loaded in the first half.","Jarrod Rapalje - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And is that -- can you talk about where most of that is going to be seen by segment?","Frank H. Boykin","Most of it is going to be in the Dal-Tile, in Unilin businesses. The Dal-Tile is starting up the Mexican plant and the Unilin putting more investments in the Russian plant getting it off the ground. And then there's a lot of smaller things across all the businesses.","Jarrod Rapalje - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. With the Mexican plant, you mentioned it's going to be up and running by next -- by April. What -- how quickly or how much of a bump can we expect to see from that? And in terms of profitability, how quickly will it be accretive to the P&L?","Frank H. Boykin","The capacity put in Mexico, the average selling price of the material is about half of what it is in the U.S. because of the different materials, as well as we don't have the same distribution margin in it as well. The plant, as it's set up, will probably have a capacity for around $50 million of additional sales when it starts up. It can be significantly expanded from that point. It should impact the margins when it gets running sometimes towards the end of the year. We expect the cost to come down. And as we move to production from our either northern plant, which we're actually shipping higher-cost products at lower prices getting prepared for that, and as we bring other products in, it should impact positively the margins in Mexico a few percentage points.","Jarrod Rapalje - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. If I can sneak one last one in there, within Mohawk this quarter, with -- can you break out the volumes of Residential and Commercial and tell us what you're seeing in the Commercial business? If you -- any slowdown over the last several months?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We'll break out the specific pieces, the -- I think in last year, the commercial carpet grew as an industry somewhere at about 7%. Part of that is driven by a shift to higher-priced tiles, so that's actually growing -- the dollars are growing faster than the units in the whole industry. As we look at the Residential business in our thing, we see the industry as a total, we think, is probably flat to off slightly but improving. Our view going forward in '12 is that the residential piece is going to continue strengthening with the employment and the economy, and we really expect the Renovation and Building businesses to improve, what\u2019s built into our own forecast.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if -- because you're talking there about the switch to some higher-priced tile. Within all the segments really, are you seeing much of a  -- any of a positive mix shift occurring? Over the past couple of years, there was definitely a shift towards more commoditized lower-priced items. Are you seeing anything of that and any thoughts in terms of a positive impact on margins from that?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We're not seeing a significant change at this point. We believe it's bottomed out. And we're optimistic about it improving with the economy, but I can't say we\u2019ve really seen it yet.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then a second question, I'm just wondering when we think within the Mohawk segment, what do you think about the ability to push for further price increases if needed, given input costs and such, after sort of seeing some challenges with pricing last fall? How do you look at that if there's a need for further price increases?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We have -- in the last years, we've gone through significant inflation in the carpet industry. We have been able to pass it through. What you saw last year was not that we weren't able to pass it through, is that the timing was moved 1 month or 2, which is not exactly the same thing. I see no reason why if the raw materials go up that we won't pass them through because they're such a high percentage of the total cost when they go up.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","I guess my first question is similar to the pricing announcements. I think within the Mohawk segment, I believe the announcements you made last year will get you to a double-digit type increase, but the realized price adjusted for mix is somewhere in the low-single digits. So I was just hoping to square those 2 if you could talk about how much of the drag was mix, what the effective pricing really was and anything else that's maybe causing a diversion from that timing or something else?","Jeff Lorberbaum","There's a lot of moving pieces. So first, you have the price increases that went in. I don't have it in front of me the average pricing went up. But what happened is not only you're having those go up, you have a change in mix from nylon to polyester. So there was a mix change so you bought similar value products out of lower raw materials. There's a dramatic shift going on in that, offsetting some of the price increase that's going on. In addition to that, you have the consumer trading down from our higher-priced products to a lower one, so what you -- the realization to the price in total is different. I don't have that by segment. If you look over the whole business, I would guess that about 4% of the total was price increase across all the various businesses -- of the total dollar increase, about 4% of it is pricing across all the various businesses.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Would you expect that the Mohawk business was above that average?","Frank H. Boykin","I don't really know because -- it was probably a little bit, but I don't know for sure because of that -- the mix change was so dramatic.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay, got it. Separately, you touched on this a little bit, but just curious on your thoughts as best as you can quantify it, share across the different segments what you think you did plus or minus in 2011? And then as you move into next year, it sounds like the share gains are most pronounced in the Dal-Tile and Unilin business, but any other expectations that you'd have for share growth?","Frank H. Boykin","In most of the businesses, we don't have specific numbers to get them at this point. The industry numbers aren't available in most of the different pieces. I think that in the Mohawk segment, we turned a corner, and I think that we did slightly better than the industry. We put a lot of things in place to improve our share over the past year through enhancing our sales team, expanding our polyester and SmartStrand offering, improving our commercial offering on those. In the Dal-Tile business, we keep expanding our presence and broadening our product line in the United States. The commercial business has improved in the U.S., and we have a large -- a larger share of the commercial business and the residential business in the Dal-Tile business. I think we're set up to grow faster than the industry as it picks up. The Unilin business has a lot of different parts in it. I think that our laminate business we improved share in, but we're in a lot of businesses in Europe that are highly depressed. And I don't know exactly when they're going to come out.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays Capital.","John Coyle","It\u2019s actually John Coyle filling in for Stephen. Just want to try and understand the nature of the homebuilder relationship. Do you guys have an idea like what your share is with the top 20 builders, how the relationship would work between you guys and a builder? Is it exclusive, or does it vary regionally? And then if you can maybe quantify your leverage to new single-family starts?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes, we do have the information. No, I don't have the information. We track all of the major builders in each of the different relationships we have. The major builders we have multiple ways of getting to them depending upon how they want to do business. Some of the builders have specifications that they specify the products to it. Some have national specifications. Some have regional specifications. Some buy through contractors that they make arrangements for. Some control the purchases that the contractor provides them. Some of the contractor provides them, so we develop relationships with the various contractors within it. And there's -- then you get to the smaller ones, there's then 100 other ways to do business. So there's all types of ways. I think that we have good relationships with most of them. We're doing things to increase the specifications in all of our businesses with them. I think we're well-positioned in the marketplace, and we'll continue to do things to try to maximize our share. When we look at it this year, it's going to improve. We're guessing about 15% or so. So 15% of a relatively low level versus historical, and we hope to participate more than our share of it.","John Coyle","Got it. Then just in the event of a -- sorry, of an increase in volume, just trying to get a -- just trying to get an idea of the margin leverage across the various businesses. Could you maybe talk about them in order of magnitude, how you look at each division on like an incremental-margin basis?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, at the operating margin level, I think we're looking at the Mohawk division at maybe 15% incremental margin. And then Unilin or rather Dal-Tile at about 25%, and Unilin at about 30%.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bob Wetenhall with RBC.","Steven Bachman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Steven Bachman in for Bob. Given the increasing confidence for both builders and investors over the past couple of months, I mean, has anything specifically changed in the broader market to give you guys confidence that the price increases can be successfully implemented versus a couple of months ago?","Frank H. Boykin","I mean, the price increases for the most part are well being executed already. So it's not like we don't know where they are. They're going through the marketplace and being implemented as we speak. We understand the competitive market at this point, and they're basically in place moving forward.","Steven Bachman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess as a clarification, is there something that has changed that you think is the reason why they're going through? Or is it just kind of this is the way the market works?","Frank H. Boykin","I don't see anything unusual about it. This is the way it works.","Steven Bachman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Make sense. And as a follow-up, can you give an overview of how much of some of your key raw materials have increased on like a percentage basis over the fourth quarter, be it propylene or something else? And if there's any incremental view on the extent to which they're rising in the first quarter?","Jeff Lorberbaum","On specific items you're asking?","Steven Bachman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, like propylene, for example.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I don't have those in front of me, but there are charts that show market prices of them that are readily available. What happened in last fall, the polypropylene were high. They took a dip, and then they came back up where they are. The prices going forward, they're anybody's guess. They're driven by oil prices on one side, their chemical capacity on the other and worldwide demand, and they can be going opposite directions. So far my forecasts, I mean, they're not worth the paper they're written on 3 to 6 months from now.","Frank H. Boykin","But we do believe our current price increase that we've got in place that we're implementing now is going to cover any present raw material cost. And as Jeff said earlier, we'll adjust further as we need.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Baugh with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if we could look at raw materials in calendar '11 in full. And you mentioned, I think, that you estimated 4% pricing for the year. What would raw materials have been? And what I'm trying to get at is, you keep talking about catching up with the prices that you're going to implement now. I'm wondering sort of what the dollar spread was between how much raws went up in 2011 across all of your businesses versus how much your prices went up.","Jeff Lorberbaum","We don't have the exact numbers. The raw materials in total across all the different businesses probably went up approaching $200 million across the various businesses. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me. And what happened is that we passed through a lot of it. On the other hand, a lot of the productivity and improvements we made went -- offset that, which is why the margins didn't jump dramatically.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So -- but if that were true, I mean, you did, what, $5.16 billion in revenue, and you said 4% of that was maybe pricing.","Frank H. Boykin","And mix, John. We can't separate those 2. So mix is a negative in that equation, right?","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And not in terms of what's going to flow through your P&L here in the first quarter because I anticipate there's still margin pressure there, but what's happening right now with the key raw materials on the spot market, if you will? We\u2019ve seen oil move dramatically here. Has there been a recent spike in any of those or not?","Jeff Lorberbaum","There's not enough time past to see the impact of that, and we're still waiting to understand it. And what the erratic part of it is, it's hard to tell what it's going to be a month from now.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And my final question would be on Unilin. If we were somehow able to separate off just the European Laminate business, Jeff, has the margin there pretty much held up? Have the volumes pretty much held up? I understand all the Board issues and other things, where it sounds like it's pretty depressed.","Jeff Lorberbaum","In Europe, you have the same thing that's going on here is that there's been trading down of the quality of the products. So that as you traded down, some of the margins were compressed with the trading down. We've been able, through the expansion of our distribution into the DIY channel, that our product to, we think, do better than the marketplace. And volume -- on the other side, we think our margins are much higher than the rest because we have no commodity business in the -- in that business where there's other participants that have huge commodity businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions here that are left. Specifically, related to Dal-Tile pricing, I know historically that it's been difficult to get pricing in ceramic tile because of all the input pricing pressure. Do you anticipate there being issues with this particular price increase? Are the importers seeing the same inflation in the opacifiers that you folks are seeing? What's the sense of the ability to jam that one through?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I can't speak for all the importers. I can tell you that we're seeing it in Mexico, in China and the U.S. So the raw materials in every market I\u2019ve seen are going up. They have the same suppliers across the world. So all markets are having those. The other part is that you got to keep remembering in Ceramic is that a large part of the costs are moving it to the destination in transportation, and I don't care where you buy it from. It goes up.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last question then, you're talking about your liquidity being $900 million, and you have the bonds coming due. I guess that leaves about $600 million-or-so in free liquidity to make an acquisition if need be. But there's more than half of that would be, I'm guessing, tied up in Europe. So does that mean that if you were to make a deal that you would lean more towards looking in the European theater for acquisitions because that's where the cash is tied up?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We are looking for places to use the cash in Europe, but you're assuming that I don't have any other options to raise capital, which I don't think is correct.","Frank H. Boykin","And let me just clarify, the money that is outside of the U.S., we can use it anywhere outside of the U.S., not necessarily just in Europe and not have tax consequences.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","As you look at the organic growth, I believe you had different days in the fourth quarter of 2010. Is there an adjustment we need to make to that to get to the, kind of, core number?","Frank H. Boykin","The days in 2010 and 2011 fourth quarter, Keith, were about the same in those 2.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if we look specifically in the U.S. carpet market at the big surge in polyester product. I guess have we seen that peak in the last couple quarters? Is it still continuing? What's your view there, Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We think the trend's continuing, and it's going to continue. Polyester products are being able to be put in a broader selection of products. The customers are looking how to provide the most value to their consumers. They're trying to offset the price inflation of the raw materials, so we believe that polyester will continue growing, which is one of the reasons we invested almost $100 million in expanding our extrusion capacity to support it and our SmartStrand. The 2 things are different. The SmartStrand is going into higher-value products, and we really believe that we have a huge opportunity in the high end with the new silk products we're introducing. There is -- there are 2 trends in the marketplace. One is cheaper products in polyester, and the other is softness. And our silk products are a dramatic step change for the marketplace.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","When we get a stronger economy, most likely, the mix will go back to the other direction back to the high end of the market. It appears you have a lot more competitors at the low end, particularly in polyester, one particular new entrant. When we go back to a shift to the high end, will that be a sheer gain opportunity for Mohawk?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I mean, we always try to improve our position in all the pieces. We participate in all the parts in the marketplace. I think that as it shifts -- it's going to shift back because nobody wakes up in the morning and says they want the cheapest thing in their homes. They all aspire to have better. And there's been a compression through the entire channel about the retailer trying to present a value to the customer to get a bigger share and the suppliers trying to meet those needs, so that compression has made it much worse. At some point, it's going to turn, and we think we're positioned to participate in both.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Cook [ph] with Voyant Advisors [ph].","Unknown Analyst","What percentage of the increase in inventory related to raw material concentration and what percentage related to inventory quantities?","Frank H. Boykin","The raw material inflation was about $26 million. But -- I'm sorry, $44 million. But we also, as I mentioned, we bought ahead. We make -- we strategically increased our carpet raw material inventories about $26 million to get ahead of some cost increases.","Unknown Analyst","And that's on a year-over-year basis?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then you guys mentioned a change in lease accounting, but in the earnings release, you guys called it a correction of an immaterial error. So was this a change in lease accounting, or was it an actual error?","Frank H. Boykin","It's a -- let me just kind of go through that for you. It's -- first, to make it clear, there's no cash impact on us. The accounting rules here require that uneven lease payments be expensed on a straight-line basis. And we were previously estimating the amount. We put in a new lease accounting system that gave us a more precise number, and that's what we're recording now so it's a true-up to get us to a more precise number.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then one last question. You'd mentioned that there would likely be restructuring charges in FY '12. I was wondering if you could quantify what the restructuring charges would be in Q1 and in FY '12?","Jeff Lorberbaum","What I said was there was no restructuring at this point and that we're always looking to better position the business. And if we find things we could do, we would do them.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Tom Mahoney","This is Tom Mahoney calling in for Eric today. Just quickly, what are you guys seeing in January and February versus the 10% organic number in the fourth quarter?","Frank H. Boykin","We're seeing continued trends at the sales level. What we said was that the second half of last year and the fourth quarter in particular had easier comparisons because the prior year, the volume went up in the first half and was under pressure in the second half. From there, we said as we look forward into this year, we think that the overall growth for 2011 will continue into there, noting that the comparisons will be a little more difficult though.","Tom Mahoney","Okay. And then what's the best way to think about the 1Q comparison because if you take out the calendar impact from 4Q, sales were up 2% -- from 4Q '10, sales were up 2%. And then you move into 1Q '11 and organic sales were flat. What's the best way to think about the comparison in the first quarter?","Frank H. Boykin","I'm not sure we followed your numbers there, your percentage increases.","Jeff Lorberbaum","They don't sound like they're aligned with ours.","Tom Mahoney","Okay. I will -- we can follow it up after the call.","Frank H. Boykin","Yes. That might be better.","Operator","At this time, there are no other questions. I will now turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you very much for joining our call.

My name is Heather, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mohawk Industries First Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, Friday, May 4, 2012. Thank you. I would now like to introduce Mr. Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and CEO. You may begin, sir.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2012 conference call. Joining me on the call is Frank Boykin, our CFO, who will review our Safe Harbor statement and later our financial results.","Frank H. Boykin","I would like to remind everyone that our press release and statements we make on this call may include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release at the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Our first quarter earnings per share were $0.58 as reported, an increase of 38% over 2011 adjusted results due to volume increases, price increases, cost reductions and lower interest expense. Our sales grew by 5% as reported or 6% on a local basis, with year-over-year sales growth for the past 4 quarters. Price increases in the first quarter will offset the material inflation in our current costs in the second period. SG&A improved by 90 basis points as a percent of net sales. During the first quarter, we generated operating income of $72 million, an increase of 14% over 2011. We paid our 2012 bond obligations using our short-term facility at lower interest rates. Standard & Poor's upgraded our credit rating, and Moody's elevated our outlook to positive, reducing our interest rates on our bonds.","Our balance sheet remains strong, with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA at historically low levels of 2.2x. We have almost $500 million available for strategic opportunities. In the U.S., our residential categories reflect the generally positive trends in the housing market. The National Association of Home Builders Index is at one of its highest levels since June 2007, with a positive outlook from record low interest rates and increased approvals. The mild winter weather contributed to the strongest existing home sales for the period in 5 years, which support greater remodeling and renovation in this year. Our commercial outlook is for moderate sales growth in line with the AIA Billing Index for commercial construction.","Frank, would you give our financial report, please?","Frank H. Boykin","Sure. I'd be glad to, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Net sales for the quarter were $1,409,000,000, up 5% or a 6% increase on a constant exchange rate basis. Both higher volume and pricing benefited our results. Gross profit was $359 million, with a margin of 25.5% flat with last year. Price increases, volume and productivity improvements offset inflation. SG&A was $287 million or 20.4% of net sales. This was an improvement of 90 basis points over last year. We're continuing to control our cost, holding our dollars flat and leveraging on higher sales. We expect the SG&A dollars to be flat for the full year.","Our operating income was $72 million, with a margin of 5.1%. Our margin grew 40 basis points over last year. We continue to drive profitability improvements throughout the business. Interest expense was $22 million. It was lower than last year, with lower rates from our new bank facility and a rating agency upgrade. We estimate our quarterly expense to be $20 million in future quarters.","Our income tax rate was 20%, which compares to a 17% rate last year. We expect the rate to improve slightly over the rest of the year. Earnings per share were $0.58 per share or a 38% improvement over 2011.","If we move to the segments. The Mohawk segment sales were $700 million or 1% better than last year as we implemented carpet price increases to offset inflation. Our carpet sales are up, in line with the carpet industry, which increased 3% year-over-year. This was offset by lower rug sales. In the rug business, deferred customer promotions, channel inventory declines and mix reduced our rug sales. Our operating income was $25 million, with a margin of 3.6%, which was flat with last year. Raw material inflation partially offset -- was partially offset by lagging price increases.","In the Dal-Tile segment, sales were $393 million or up 14% over last year. We had a strong quarter this year, with improvements across all of our channels. Operating income came in at $26 million, with a margin of 6.6%, up 150 basis points over last year. Volume and productivity improvements drove higher margins.","In the Unilin segment, sales were $337 million, up 4% as reported or 7% on a constant exchange rate basis. Both the U.S. and Europe gained over last year. In Europe, we offset the slowing economy with new products and new regions. Operating income was $27 million, with a margin of 8%, which was flat with last year. We were impacted by both mix and start-up costs in this segment.","In our Corporate and Eliminations segment, the operating income was a loss of $7 million. It was a bit higher in the first quarter of this year due to timing, however, we expect our annual expense to be in line with last year.","Turning to the balance sheet. Receivables came in at $782 million with DSOs at 47 days, were in line with last year. Inventories at $1,165,000,000 are up in dollars, with continued raw material inflation and increases due to sales volume. Inflation accounted for $50 million of the increase, with acquisitions and pre-buys ahead of inflation accounting for about $25 million. We expect improvements in inventory as we move through the year.","Fixed assets ended the quarter at $1.718 billion. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $43 million, with depreciation and amortization of $73 million. We continue to estimate $235 million of capital expenditures for the full year and depreciation and amortization at $300 million for the full year. Our long-term debt ended up at $1.7 billion. Operations this year used less cash than last year. Cash from operations improved almost $25 million over last year.","In April of this year, we paid off bonds of about $340 million and rolled that into our bank facility. Additionally, Standard & Poor's upgraded us to investment grade, and Moody's improved our outlook to positive. All of this has reduced our interest expense. Finally, we purchased a minority interest in our Oklahoma tile plant joint venture, eliminating our noncontrolling interest. Also, we'll be -- this will eliminate the minority interest charge that we've been recording in past periods. Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. The Mohawk segment sales grew 1% as we executed price increases that should cover material costs in the second period. Higher carpet sales were in line with the 3% industry growth, offset by lower rug sales from deferred customer promotions, inventory reductions in the rug channel and lower rug product mix. Operating income increased 6% over 2011, even with compression from raw material increases. Throughout this segment, we continue to reduce manufacturing costs with improved efficiencies, enhanced productivity and realigned assets. We anticipate improved margins from the price increases and growth of our popular SmartStrand and EverStrand lines.","For the third consecutive year, Mohawk's SmartStrand carpet won the industry's Dealer Choice award for new carpet introductions. We launched our revolutionary SmartStrand Silk collection in the period and sales of its premium fabrics will benefit the second quarter. SmartStrand still represents the next-generation of soft carpet with the inherent performance, ease of care and unique environmental features that have made SmartStrand successful. SmartStrand Silk has been embraced by the retail community, and its initial sales trends are tracking very positively. In the second quarter, we're expanding our silk offering further with additional styles and price points, which enhance our product mix further.","Our EverStrand and Wear-Dated Revive polyester sales continue their expansion due to the value proposition they offer, fashion appeal and the differentiated green position with industry-leading recycled content. Our relationships with specialty retailers continues to broaden as our products satisfy the changing consumer preferences, supported by marketing, merchandising and training, which improves their results. For Mohawk branded hard surfaces, we introduced solid wood with soft scraped surfaces, ceramic with Reveal Imaging, laminate and exotic species and luxury vinyl tile planks. We announced a price increase of 3% to 5% on our vinyl and other selected hard surface products. Our Mohawk hard surface products are gaining position in the builder channel, which is beginning to show improvements. The commercial category, our hospitality and core business improved, offset by some weaknesses in our premium products as customers traded down. To offer greater value, we introduced new high-end Duracolor products with improved styling and performance at lower price points. We've also extended our SmartStrand brand with differentiated features into our commercial business. In hospitality, we introduced new technology that provides improved definition and design capability. In the period, commercial price increases have been implemented to cover higher raw material costs. Our 2011 investments continue -- contributed to productivity gains across the business. Our increased fiber capacity is supporting our growing SmartStrand and EverStrand products. Other investments have enhanced our production costs and material yields. Our carpet tile expansion, product reengineering, process simplification and reduced complexity improved our productivity, yield and service levels. As part of our ongoing commitment to sustainable manufacturing, we increased the utilization of recycled materials, reduced our waste and lowered our energy consumption. All of which is good for our business, our customers and the environment. Additionally, we're improving sales force effectiveness through implementation of CRM tools to identify customer and product opportunities in the marketplace.","Dal-Tile posted sales growth of 14% during the quarter, with double-digit increases in both residential and commercial sales. The segment grew primarily through increased residential remodeling, and commercial renovation, successful product launches and significant growth in the Mexican market. Higher production volumes during the quarter created better cost absorption and margins. Selective price increases of 3% to 5%, along with energy surcharges are being implemented to cover raw material and freight cost increases. Residential ceramic sales continued their improvement which began a year ago, with growth in both renovation and new construction. Consumer's discretionary spending remains constrained and consumers continue to trade down to lower value products. We've expanded our specialty store position by improving distribution with our new products and enhanced merchandising. Sales grew in all channels driven by expanded wall and floor tile placements, new tiles with Reveal Imaging, larger sizes, realistic wood designs and a new premium commercial collection. Commercial sales continued strong, with remodeling in retail, restaurants and hospitality showing the most progress. For our Dal-Tile band, commercial sales representatives are being added to target large projects and expand our specifications. Additional large-sized tiles are being introduced to satisfying growing commercial trends. For the premium commercial market, we're introducing a new luxury collection which offers unique textures combined with high style patterns and colors. We've also increased our American Olean commercial offering and added new sales personnel in selected areas for it.","In Mexico, we opened our new plant in Salamanca ahead of schedule. The plant is producing red body tiles specifically designed for the domestic Mexican market. Salamanca will reduce our ceramic tile cost and freight expenses when the plant is fully operational by the end of this year. Sales in Mexico are growing dramatically due to our expanded offering of designs, sizes and price points. Polished porcelain tiles greater than 2 feet in size are being imported from our Chinese joint venture for the premium commercial market. We're achieving increased distribution for our products with new commitments from our existing customer base, adding new distributors and home centers. Results for our Chinese JV were impacted by a softer Chinese economy, normal seasonality and extended shutdown as a result of lower market demand. Our sales were bolstered by new product launches, new retail showroom displays and strong retail participation in our recent conventions. Our export volumes are growing as we increase sales to Dal-Tile U.S., Canadian and Mexican markets and add new customers worldwide. We have concluded the joint venture of Muskogee ceramic production with the purchase of our partner's interest for $35 million based on our previous agreement. During the quarter, Dal-Tile's lowered manufacturing costs through higher productivity, reduced waste, improved formulations and increased production speeds and recycled content. We're increasing SKU productivity by utilizing more disciplined components, dropping low-volume SKUs, consolidation of outsized suppliers, all to drive manufacturing and inventory efficiency. The Tile Council of North America has certified Dal-Tile under its Green Squared program, confirming our leadership in sustainable manufacturing.","Unilin's first quarter sales grew by 4% as reported or 7% with a constant exchange rate. Both our European and U.S. business grew in the period despite challenges in the economy and continued pressure on our product mix. The impact of the European debt situation on our business has been limited due to lower exposure in the Southern European markets. We continue to gain market share through the expansion of new products, channels and regions offsetting the impact of slowing national economies. Laminate wood flooring sales in Europe continued their growth despite pressure on our product mix as customers traded down. We've expanded our participation in the DIY channel with value added laminate products under our Quick-Step brand. The growth of these have compensated for decreases in the specialty retail channel. We've implemented laminate price increases of 2% to 3% to recover higher raw material costs. We introduced a collection of new larger-sized tiles and wider 8-inch planks featuring reclaimed and rustic designs. Our strategies to expand internationally are progressing with our new Russian plant increasing production and Unilin integrating our Australian distribution. We entered into a joint venture with a South American board company, which had a limited laminate flooring business. In the joint venture, we're developing new products with enhanced features and styling, and we utilize our Quick-Step brand to differentiate the premium products. Our Unilin North American business grew as we expanded our home center distribution of both laminate and wood. In the U.S., we introduced wider laminate that replicates weathered oak and distressed surfaces in fashionable colors, a collection of distressed solid wood and new luxury vinyl tiles. New processes on our U.S. wood facilities are enhancing our visuals and reducing costs in both engineered and solid wood products. Consolidation of our wood plants in Malaysia has been completed, increasing our capacity and reducing our costs. We do have some headwinds resulting from a strengthening Malaysian currency. Our wood panel volume improved in Europe, but pricing remains under pressure from excess market capacity. Roofing panel sales declined from lower home sales and more severe winter weather. Our insulation panels grew significantly with our costs improving from higher utilization. We increased our insulation production capacity and preparing to add another facility in Southern France next year. We're implementing 2% to 3% price increases in most panel products to recover material increases. Mohawk's reputation for innovation and design was reinforced at the flooring industry's largest annual show in the U.S. New introductions in each of our carpet, rug, ceramic and laminate flooring categories were all recognized as the best in the show by the dealers attending. We received Supplier of the Year for Excellence from Wal-Mart. And the North American Laminate Flooring Industry Award for Best Manufacturing Company. Southeastern Corporate Sustainability Rankings designated Mohawk, UPS and Coca-Cola as the best companies for sustainable performance for 2012.","Low mortgage rates, increasing home sales, higher employment should sustain the industry growth this year. Our emphasis on product and process innovation, cost management and selectability has resulted in a stronger company. In the second quarter, we anticipate continued sales growth and improving margins as selling prices align with material inflation. We believe our new-product launches will improve profitability and sales growth. Improvement in productivity, inventory management and interest expenses will favorably impact our results. With these factors, our guidance for the second quarter earnings is $1.07 to $1.16 per share, excluding restructuring charges. Our recent investments in new markets, technology, R&D and production capacity will continue to improve our results. We have a strong financial position to pursue new strategic opportunities.","With that, we'll be glad to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question on the price increases that you expect to more fully benefit in the second quarter. We've seen, I think over the past 2 or 3 years, this kind of constant lagging effect in terms of following the higher resins and oil-based materials. What do you think ultimately this means for margins for the segment over the next couple of quarters on a year-over-year basis as obviously on a longer-term basis, people are looking towards return towards a more normal high-single-digit type margin for this -- as this business has historically done?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Most of our raw materials are bought at market based on either some -- either market prices or some contractually agreed-upon basis. And so our raw materials go up and down each period. We try to cover what we believe to be the raw materials based on our best guesses, and we think we've done that at this point. The future raw materials are going to be based on, if something dramatically happened with the oil and depending upon who you listen to, it could go to $120 or go to $80. We have no idea which. We're going to continue watching them and if it requires additional changes, we'll make them. Our best guess at this point is that we're expecting stable material prices in the future, but that could change.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But just to make sure I understand it correctly, looking forward into the second quarter, can you give us a sense of -- given that you expect the fuller impact of the price increases from the first quarter, would you expect there to be 50, 100, 150 basis points of expansion for the Mohawk segment?","Frank H. Boykin","Our margins, Mike, will be up compared to second quarter a year ago in the Mohawk segment as a result, not just the price increases, but also some of the productivity improvements we've put in place. But they will be up year-over-year in the second quarter.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The amounts [indiscernible] will do to the estimate. You're going to have to decide what you want to put in each segment.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. I appreciate that. Just one last one on Unilin -- I'm sorry, on Dal-Tile, great results. You face a little bit of tougher comps in the back half of the year. Based on current trends, do expect to continue to grow at this double-digit rate into the back half or would that moderate due to the comps?","Frank H. Boykin","I don't believe that we're going to continue at the double-digit rate going forward. That's a significant improvement over the market, and I would be delighted if it happens, but we're not building that into our forward projections.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Pollard with Goldman Sachs.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You made a comment in your prepared remarks and on your press release about pursuing new strategic opportunities. You talked as well about it in new joint venture with a South American board company. I'm really ultimately trying to understand how deep, how broad and how far you guys want to go with some of these strategic opportunities out there? Are you guys looking to make larger acquisitions given the strength of your balance sheet right now?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Yes. We -- historically, we grow the business through acquisitions. We believe we're well-positioned in the marketplace. We believe that we have the infrastructure in our business to support what's going on in our businesses. We continuously look at new opportunities in the marketplace. Typically, in the -- as you go through downturns, there are more people looking to exit the business as you come out of the business. And we constantly look at whatever comes available to the marketplace in all parts of the world.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess one quick follow up to that. It seems that you guys talked a lot about the international side of the business, but as things stand right now, it's less than 20% of your business. Is it right in assuming that you guys are looking outside of the U.S.? And then from a management standpoint, I remember when I first looked at the company a few years ago, I was surprised to see that the distribution base and some of the management of the different merged pieces were sort of still intact and it wasn't necessarily all one sales force, all one distribution. When you guys think about bringing on new companies, is there anything that leads you guys towards doing more consolidation on the operations of the business?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We take each one and each business, and we decide what to do with it. What you see is that we basically have broken the U.S. business into 3 parts. We have a carpet and rug business, we have a laminate and wood business, and we have a ceramic and stone business. Each of those we operate relatively separate from each other. We do get advantages in the distribution system. We do get advantages in the customer relationships. We do get advantage in finding opportunities in the marketplace. The reason we don't meld them together further is that the different products actually have different attributes. In many cases, different customers buy them, even when they're going into the same building. The ceramic -- many planks [ph] is bought by someone different than the carpet, and the timing and the installation and shipments are done at different points in time. So we use only intellectual pieces that we have. We use the knowledge of manufacturing, but in each case, it's unique.","Frank H. Boykin","Just to address your question on international. We are looking at international opportunities. We also look at domestic, but we probably look at it more international I would say than domestic.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","But if there are tile [ph] acquisitions in the U.S., we're willing to look. And if they make sense, we would like to buy them.","Frank H. Boykin","The right strategic fit and right valuation.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Well, glad to hear you guys are out there hunting. My other question is around your productivity improvements compared to last year. You called out $100 million last year, I wanted to see what you guys were thinking for full year 2012, and how much of that was realized in 1Q?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I'm not sure I have that in front of me. Frank, do you have it?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, I think we need to get back to you on that one.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We'll have to get back to you on the piece. I can tell you that every division has significant internal savings that they're doing based on productivity increases, improvements in the raw material costs and product innovations to upgrade the mix as we go through. Frank will have to get back to you with the number for the total.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays.","John Coyle","This is actually John filling in for Steve today. So conversations we recently had with the builders, they're kind of indicating that consumers are spending more and more for upgrades and in the showrooms and whatnot. So we're just trying to get an idea just since negative mix seems to have been a theme quarter. On balance over the last 2 to 3 years, how much margin pressure have you guys seen just from consumers trading down or negative mix?","Frank H. Boykin","It's hard to pull mix out as a separate item because with price and mix working, we let them combine. So it's difficult to pull that out and give you a specific number.","John Coyle","Got it. All right. Well, following up to that, could you maybe quantify just the material cost inflation that you guys saw this quarter, year-over-year?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, material inflation was about $27 million -- say about $30 million for the whole company.","John Coyle","Got it. And was that more heavily weighted to one segment?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes. Primarily in the Mohawk segment.","John Coyle","Got it. And then just recent trends, could you maybe comment what you've seen since the end of March?","Frank H. Boykin","With regards to inflation?","John Coyle","No, with regards to volume.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We're seeing the normal seasonality that we expect. We're still optimistic that the industry will grow at a reasonable pace as most people are using about a 4% number this year. It could be higher or lower overall. We see the commercial maintaining the growth rate in the mid-single digits as it did last year. And residential looks like it's improving. The big question is, what's going to happen to the building segment, how fast it's going to grow. And with existing home changes, are people going to be more aggressive in their remodeling pieces? We're optimistic they'll be better than they were last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just diving into Dal-Tile. Are you starting to see any new commercial construction orders or backlog starting to build? Your comments called out commercial renovation.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Remember, when new construction, the flooring is the last thing that goes in. So what we're getting now is what was started a year ago or in some cases 1.5 years or 2 years ago. So the commercial, just in the trend as it comes out, once they start building, we're 6 months to a year after the thing start building before we even start seeing it.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","The second question in the Mohawk segment. We start -- for the full second quarter, will you be trued-up on raw materials or is there still a little bit of a drag at the beginning of the quarter?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","In the Mohawk segment, we think we're going to be pretty close to covered.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Last quarter, you talked about increasing your modular flooring capacity, we wanted to get some update on that. And also just a discussion of what trends you're seeing in modular flooring and the market share gains you are taking?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We did complete the increase of our modular capacity. We increased it about 35% to prepare the business for future growth. We see modular -- our modular businesses continuing to grow. We continue to expand the price points and styling that we're offering in the marketplace. And it's going to do a significant portion of our total specified commercial carpet business.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Maybe digging [ph] a little bit more once again, in your Mohawk segment. Could you discuss the differences in growth rates between residential versus non-res? And just on a percentage basis or round numbers would be helpful. And also, if you could compare that versus the industry growth rate over the same time period?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I don't know if I'd give you that detail. The industry in the first quarter grew somewhere around 3%. We grew in line with the industry. And our business, the residential business grew slightly slower than the commercial business. The commercial business still outgrew it a little bit. I'm sorry, the commercial business outgrew the residential.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Two questions. First of all, Frank, I think you said that SG&A dollars would be flat for the year. Can you just talk a little bit about how you achieve that in a improving volume environment? And also knowing how you've been taking costs out of the business in the last couple of years when things were contracting.","Frank H. Boykin","As we've talked about several times, Eric, we have been focused on what we can do to improve productivity, improve efficiencies and how we can do more with less, and we're looking at opportunities from a lean standpoint in consolidation of different functions. And we've done -- our team has done a great job of taking out cost and combining different activities and reducing cost across all different functions. And we're continuing to focus on that. That's at the top of our radar screen today.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The SG&A got leveraged down as the business went down. We're trying to hold the cost where they are and the productivity improve. And the SG&A in the first quarter was 0.9 basis points below the year before. So I mean, we think we're going to continue dropping the SG&A cost as a percent of sales.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","But also just to make sure I understand it. I understand the percentage of sales leverage. But from a dollar standpoint, is that also what you're suggesting for the year? You'll spend the same amount of dollars as what you did last year.","Frank H. Boykin","I think the spend will be about the same. I mean we're not going to be -- the objective is to hold it flat or maybe a little bit up, but it won't be up much.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Unless the sales go up dramatically more than we expect, which would be a good thing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's actually Susan. First question, you noted that you had sort of deferred some of the promotions in your rug business. As things are starting to stabilize a little bit, are you finding that you have a little bit more breathing room perhaps in terms of your promotion? The timing maybe and the types of deals that you're offering?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think -- let me change the question. What we said was that our customers were deferring their promotional activities, not us. So what happens is, some of the customers that had promotions in the first quarter pushed them out later in the year. Therefore, we didn't have to ship them in the first quarter.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then you also noted that you are gaining some traction with the larger builders. Can you talk about maybe how you're achieving these gains? And some -- maybe in terms of the pricing, are you seeing a lot of price sensitivity with these guys or how things are going there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","There's always price sensitivity. So that's not a new activity. I think that we're focused on having the right products for the individual markets. We're focused on creating specifications within each one that adds value to them. We have a series of good, better, best products that make it easy for them to trade the customer up and satisfy the needs. And I think we're aggressively going after all the channels.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick question here. With the new products introductions that you have both in the Dal-Tile and in the Unilin segments, it seems that you're certainly going for a more targeted niche, likely higher margin. And if you can quantify that? If you can provide some color in terms of expected margins on some of these new product offerings and just thinking about the continuing mix shift going towards those 2 segments and a bit away from the Mohawk segment where there's been the more trading down? How do you think about the overall impact on company-wide margins?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I'm not prepared to give you specific margins, but you did interpret it properly that in all the businesses, there are commodity parts of the business. We are supporting those commodity pieces in the Dal-Tile business. But in Dal-Tile and Unilin, we are really focused in improving the mix and improving the products to achieve more margin as we go through, which is how we intend to enhance the margins as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Any chance of having you quantify the impact of the start-up costs associated with your various ventures that are ramping?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","On an annual basis, we estimate it to be about $15 million this year. The big chunks would be the Salamanca plant start up, the Russian plant and then other expenses just associated with all the other capital investments we're putting in.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Of the $15 million, what do you think we saw in the first quarter.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Some 25% of it. It'll be close.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","It's pretty linear, okay. Second question is just, looking at the Mohawk segment margins, I realize first quarter is always difficult to interpret due to the distortion of the seasonal patterns and everything. But first quarter, you put up a 3.6% margin. Certainly, in better times you got that margin in first quarter up to 5.5% to 7%. And obviously, there's a big volume difference between now and when you were peaking out margins. But I guess the question is, how much unrecovered cost inflation are you seeing in the Mohawk segment since the peak?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Since the peak?","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. How much unrecovered cost inflation?","Frank H. Boykin","I have no idea off the top of my head.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I wouldn't even know how to calculate it.","Frank H. Boykin","A lot.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The 2 things that's happening is there's been a tremendous decrease in the volume of the industry, there's been a huge decrease in the mix of the trade ups where we used to sell much higher proportions of higher value, higher-margin products. And as the retailers tried to attract customers, they started selling prices the reason to be rather than trying to sell the thing that fits the need the most. It's going to change. I don't think we've seen a lot of it yet, but we're expecting as the consumers get more comfortable with the marketplace that we'll see a significant improvement in the mix and all the businesses as the economies improve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions here. I know you said that your customers with the deferred of the promos in rug, they deferred it to later in the year and they also drew inventories down. Are you still seeing that activity or the effects of that activity here in the second quarter or will that dissipate? And then I've got a follow-up question.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We're anticipating that the second quarter will be more normalized, but you don't know until they send you the orders.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. But you would always see it in April though, wouldn't you?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","So far we believe the second quarter is going to be more normal, but you never know until it's over. But we're anticipating more normalized results in the second quarter.","Frank H. Boykin","This is our rug business were talking about.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Correct, I understand. Yes. And the second question, prior to this quarter, in the carpet segment, you had been pretty consistently gaining share over the past few quarters and then maintained share largely in this quarter in carpet. Based on the fact that Bolyu struggled getting a price increase, I would have thought that the share situation might even have been better than the maintenance. Can you talk about market share trends in the industry, what you're seeing, and prospectively what you would imagine to see over the next few quarters?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Yes, I mean. Some of the things that makes it hard is that as the -- as we all increase prices, we're all trying to identify the future cost of the business and passing through. We think there was some confusion in some of the competitors of what the raw material prices were going to be. So when all those things, it impacted some of the pricing strategies going into the year and some of the competitors tried to raise prices again at a later point. And so all has to do with how the pricing is, the mix is, so it did impact, it could have impacted our sales volume a little bit. But we think that we're set up properly for the future. We think that we are bringing products to the market to add value to it. We believe that we're capturing a greater share of the premium market with the positions we're taking and innovation we're bringing in the marketplace. So we're happy with our position for this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit more about the carpet volumes. I think you said overall, it sounds like carpet volumes are pretty stable, and I think you said that commercial or nonresidential outgrew residential. So I just wanted to confirm those numbers? And then on the residential piece, if you could maybe break that down between what you're seeing on the retail side versus any builder business?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","What we said was that the industry grew about 3% and that in our business, the commercial business was slightly stronger than the residential business. And that's as detailed as we're prepared to give you.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","But just that 3%, that's dollars or that's units?","Okay. So you're not willing to talk about just generally even how you're seeing the split between retail and non-retail within the residential business?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Retail and non-retail.","Frank H. Boykin","You mean builder and the rest of the business?","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Right, right.","Frank H. Boykin","I'm not sure we are able to...","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I'm not sure.","Frank H. Boykin","I can't give you an accurate number.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I mean, when you get it, we get it. Internally, we track some of it, but the same products go through both. We think that the -- there's some strengthening of the builder. But again, you have to remember that when you build a new house, we're the last thing in it. So when they start, you got to add close to 9 months before we see it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I mean this in a serious not funny way. How are you going to hold SG&A flat? I assume there's going to be a material increase in executive bonuses, compensation? I knew you'd laugh, but seriously, have we got other decreases that are going to offset that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I mean, we've made a lot of changes in the past 12 months, and we continue to change the business to reduce the cost. We continue to change the business to find productivity. We continue to manage the investments we put in better. And our goal was to try to hold it flat with increasing volume because if you want to have higher margins, you're going to have to get leverage in the -- as the business grows up, you're going to have to leverage the fixed cost and pieces [ph] we go through. And we're doing everything we possibly can. If the business grows more than we think it is, we're going to have to put more investment in, but we put the actions in to try to hold the cost.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The second question, it kind of relates to the bigger picture. And we've talked a lot about the Mohawk division on this call. I'm curious on the Dal-Tile and Unilin. Could you revisit again, Frank, the sort of where you think margins can go to question in light of Mexico, which is a lower-priced product, some of the things you're doing in laminate or DIY. Just trying to get a feel for how that margin peak years ago compares to where it might go back to in light of some of the changes in the business?","Frank H. Boykin","So yes, John, if you just take each of the 2 separately. First, Dal-Tile. We still believe we can get margins back up to kind of 13%, 14% range there. You talked about Mexico. And our margins in Mexico once we get that Salamanca plant up and running and move the production down out of Monterey down into Salamanca, we'll be in line with the rest of the tile business in terms of the margins there. And then on the Unilin side, we've talked about margins 14% or 15% in that range when we get back to a normalized environment. And that's lower than where we were at the peak. But we talked about we're trying to increase our market share and improve our position both in the U.S. and in Europe getting -- moving into the DIY channel a little bit more. And that'll impact us favorably from a margin dollar standpoint, but we'll see a little bit of decline in the margin percentage from where we were at the peak.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC.","Steven Bachman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Steve filling in for Bob. Were there certain geographies or segments where price increases were less effective and maybe unable to keep up with some of the raw material inflation?","Frank H. Boykin","I'm sure they were, but I mean -- I don't know if we go down to individual customers and pieces or markets. I mean, we have to meet market competition where it goes. We adjust them, but we think we're going to recover about what we needed to recover.","Steven Bachman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And kind of a follow up. Were there any raw materials that increased in price more than you had expected going into the quarter?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We're in the Mohawk division. In the Mohawk piece, it's pretty -- up and through the end of the first quarter, the raw materials were similar to what we had anticipated in the marketplace. And we spent a lot of time trying out guess them. And so far, we were close to the first quarter. Now what happens from here forward, we'll have to see.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lane with Morgan Stanley.","John Lane","I just had a few questions about the -- your pay down of the April maturity. My question is, do you plan to come to market to refinance that in any way or do you think that you'll just pay down the revolver with free cash flow?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, we'll do the latter. We rolled it in the revolver, and we'll just pay down the revolver with free cash flow.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Research","This is Adam in for Mike. Just a quick question on Unilin. Can you talk about maybe the core growth in that segment stripping out on any new products? I know you kind of called out FX or any price or anything like that?","Frank H. Boykin","Your question is, what's the organic growth if you pull out new products and acquisitions?","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Research","Yes.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I don't know if we can pull it all out. We can tell you that about 1.5% of it came from the Australian acquisition, the net sales increase. A large part of the sales in that Australian business, we were supplying as a supplier, so you have to deduct that from the piece. So that was about 1.5%. The rest of it I can't put a number on.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We appreciate you being on the call. We think we're well-positioned in the marketplace, and we're taking the right actions for the business for the coming year. Have a nice day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Mohawk Industries first quarter conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14856":["Mohawk Industries, Inc.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor conference call. Today, we'll update you on the company's results for the second quarter of 2015 and provide guidance for the third quarter.","I'd like to remind, everyone, that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers.

Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Frank. During the second quarter, Mohawk's performance was strong, particularly when considering the currency headwinds we faced. For the period, our earnings per share were $2.69, excluding unusual charges. The highest quarterly adjusted EPS in the company's history. On a constant exchange basis, revenues grew across all segments with second quarter net sales increasing approximately 7%. Our adjusted operating margin was approximately 14%, an increase of 21%, or 240 basis points, compared to the prior year, due to the performance of our differentiated products, higher volume, improved productivity and costs across the enterprise.","In May, we completed the purchase of Kai, the leading position in the Bulgarian and Romanian markets as well as positioning us as a low-cost producer. In mid-June, we completed the acquisition of IVC, providing us with leading position in luxury vinyl tile, and sheet vinyl on both sides of the Atlantic. For the periods of two acquisitions were more accretive than we anticipated to EPS. The IVC and Kai acquisitions have compelling long-term potential and expand our business into new product categories and new markets. In both acquisitions, we gained the best in category management team, to implement our strategies and optimize the years of Mohawk's assets and knowledge across the enterprise.","To maximize our growth, we've invested more into the businesses, including developing differentiated products, hiring more sales people, increasing our product sampling and merchandising. Our capital investments are adding capacity where needed to meet growing demand and increasing our margins through improved efficiencies and reduced costs.","Even while we significantly invest in the business, we're generating higher cash flows. We continue to refine the management of our inventory, which improves our working capital turnover, and benefits our serviced levels. As expected, material prices improved, allowing us to recover some of the margins, we previously lost to inflation.","Going forward, our investments and acquisitions in our existing businesses will position us to further expand sales and improve margins with design leadership, operational efficiencies and distribution advantages.","During the period, the U.S. economy strength was reflected in an increase in new housing construction. In June, existing home sales rose to the highest level in eight years, which supports the Harvard LIRA projection for stronger remodeling investments in the future. And improving U.S. job market continues to support strong consumer confidence and should increase consumer spending. The consensus among commercial construction forecast is for continued growth with hospitality, office and retail sector leading overall spending. Mexico's GDP growth is projected to continue with a rebound in residential construction contributing to higher ceramic sale.","Now that the immediate Greek crisis has been addressed, Europe appears likely to maintain the momentum created by lower interest rates and more private sector loans. The Russian economy remains challenging with significant inflation. Although government actions including lower interest rates, subsidized mortgages and new infrastructure investments should provide some benefit.","During the second quarter, the company realigned its reportable segments organizing its carpet, wood, laminate and newly acquired vinyl operations by geography into Flooring North America segment and the Flooring Rest of World segment. Our Global Ceramic segment remains unchanged with the addition of Kai in Eastern Europe. The management of the business has been realigned with this change and will allow us to optimize our operations and sales by region, while coordinating our technology, manufacturing and product development across the enterprise. We expect to gain synergies through enhanced customer relationships, better utilization of our assets and distribution systems, and the implementation of best practices. And with that, I'll review the second quarter performance by our segments.","As I mentioned earlier, we continue to operate our Global Ceramic businesses in the past with all of our locations under one umbrella in order to optimize our design and technology resources and balance our manufacturing capabilities around the world. On a pro-forma basis, ceramic has become the largest product category in our portfolio, constituting over 35% of our total revenues.","For the quarter, our Global Ceramic segment's adjusted operating margin was approximately 16%, up 220 basis points as our mix, volume and productivity improved. The segment sales were down 1% as reported, or up approximately 8% on a constant exchange rate, including two months of Kai's results in the quarter. Our U.S. Ceramic business continues to build momentum across all channels with stronger growth in residential, new construction and commercial sectors.","Our Marazzi acquisition has now been completely integrated and all functions in the business are working under a unified strategy. By utilizing the expertise of our global talent, we're leading the market place in innovative design, which is differentiating our products and improving our mix.","This year, we're on track to place our statement ceramic boutiques in more than 250 of the country's top retailers. We're continuing to expand the exclusive agreements to supply the nation's largest builder and multi-family businesses. Our broad product offering is allowing our distributors to meet customer needs without the inventory burden required with importing products. Home centers are increasing their focus on ceramic and we're gaining share in the channel. As the economy improves, the commercial category continues to gain traction with hotels, restaurants, shopping centers and schools investing more to improve their facility. We are adding sales personnel, service centers and showrooms to maximize our U.S. sale and are utilizing our worldwide assets to supplement our local production. The construction of our new Tennessee ceramic facility continues to progress. And the installation of equipment has begun. We have recently completed the acquisition of a small ceramic plant in Baja, Mexico, which will expand our position in Western Mexico and in the Southwestern United States market.","In Mexico, our sales continued their rapid growth as the economy expands and we grow our market share. During the period, our new product introductions positively impacted our mix and margins. We're leading the market in realistic wood and stone designs, larger sizes and specialized designs. We continue to grow our distribution footprint and increase the specification of our products on new projects.","In our European ceramic business, our investments have significantly improved our product offering, sales and margins. During the period, our new collections represented 40% of sale, as we continue to aggressively discontinue older, underperforming collections. Three new production lines in Italy started up during the quarter and are operating well as volume and yields increase ahead of our plan. We anticipate that the second phase of our planned equipment upgrades in our European ceramic will be completed in the third quarter and we have ordered additional equipment for the next phase.","Just as we led the industry in the introduction of wood ceramic planks, we are now setting the styling trends with smaller sizes and blocks and hexagon shapes and creating an increasingly popular outdoor thick tile that competes with natural stone.","The KAI acquisition expands our Eastern European business and creates opportunities to ship Kai products into other markets. A new production line with digital printing has just been installed in Bulgaria and we have identified process improvements and best practices to refine the capabilities and efficiencies of the KAI operations. We are planning to implement our existing business systems into KAI to provide greater control, identify opportunities and increase responsiveness to customer needs.","The Russian economy continues to decline, creating pressure on the country's ceramic industry. Our second quarter revenues were up on a local basis as we grew market share in a contracting environment. Inflation caused by the weak ruble has reduced European imports into the Russian market, increasing our ability to gain market share through greater participation in the DIY and new construction channels and by pursuing additional sales in the value categories.","We have increased prices in the market by 10%, but have not covered all the inflation we have incurred. Our new product introductions are enhancing our average selling price and we are seeing significant growth in our higher-end porcelain products. We're investing to expand distribution in our franchised and company-owned retail stores and we're planning an expansion of our manufacturing capacity of larger sizes and premium commercial products.","During the period, our Flooring North America segment adjusted operating income increased 40%, achieving a margin of approximately 12%. All product categories contributed to the increase through productivity and lower cost offset by mix and the start-up of costs related to our new U.S. LVT plant. Segment sales increased by approximately 3%, including about three weeks of IVC North America results.","Raw material prices have not changed with the recent oil decline and we anticipate that the second half material purchase prices will be stable. Compared to last year, we expect to have a margin benefit as costs flow through. Our SG&A was slightly higher in this segment as we increased investments in both our residential and commercial sales forces as well as new merchandising to showcase our products. We continue increasing our investments in new sales personnel and product samples throughout the second half of the year.","During the period, sales of carpet, tile, laminate, wood, rugs and vinyl increased, with broadloom carpet down slightly. Mohawk's soft surface sales performed in line with the industry, but were slower than anticipated as soft surface residential remodeling continue to lag and the growth of polyester lowered our average selling prices. Our commercial broadloom sales were temporary impacted as we transitioned from a high-cost manufacturing process to a more efficient one. This change enhanced our margins but temporarily reduced sales growth, as we dropped a higher number of products.","Our premium Karastan builder of multifamily product categories in hard and soft surfaces are performing better. Our new residential carpet introductions are gaining traction and should improve our remodeling business. We anticipate these products will enhance our performance at the mid to high-end price points and improve our mix in the second half.","As the market gains traction from increased consumer traffic, our rug sales improved due to innovative designs and proprietary fiber technology. We're implementing a new mat technology, which will extend our product offering and increase our participation in the commercial and utility mat category. We continue to deliver strong growth with our carpet tile squares and planks. The sales of our new Duracolor high-performance carpets are expanding rapidly and improving our margins. At the recent NeoCon show, we were recognized for our new introductions in both broadloom and modular tile, and we won the top product design award at the National Hospitality Show.","Our service levels as well as internal and external quality continue to show improvement. This quarter we announced the closing of a yarn manufacturing facility, initiated the consolidation of our woven manufacturing and eliminated four regional warehouses. These initiatives should be complete by the end of the year.","Our logistics organization continues to improve the speed of our service while improving load factors and vehicle utilization. Our commitment to safety has reduced our OSHA recordable rate to world-class levels, lowering our costs and, more importantly, reducing the number of people hurt on the job. As a reminder, this segment now includes our North American laminate, wood and vinyl operations as well as rugs and carpet.","Sales of our hard surface products are growing faster than carpet due to their increasing use in new home construction and residential remodeling. In all of these hard surface categories, we are increasing our participation in the home center channel and expanding our partnerships with national and regional builders. The marketplace has embraced our new product introductions, including longer and wider engineered wood planks, laminates featuring deeper more realistic textures with water-resistant technology. This month we are launching our new high-end double stain wood collections that offer rich multicolor visuals. Our hard surface margins benefited from higher volume, plant productivity and cost containment initiatives.","Our acquired and legacy U.S. sheet vinyl and LVT business performed well during the period. With IVC, we are leveraging Mohawk's relationship to expand our vinyl sheet and LVT sales in all channels. We're investing in innovative products with market-leading designs and features, including new collections with more realistic visuals, as well as phthalate-free vinyl collections with lower emissions. Our new LVT plant in Georgia is starting up and we are training personnel to support the operation. We continue to improve the productivity and yield as we refine the manufacturing processes.","For the period, the Flooring Rest of the World segment's adjusted operating margin was 18.5%, an increase of 250 basis points over last year, driven by improved volume, productivity initiatives and lower costs, offset by the start-up expenses of our new Belgian LVT plant and a translation impact of the stronger dollar. Net sales for this segment were down approximately 7% as reported, but were up approximately 13% on a constant exchange rate basis, including about three weeks of IVC sales in Europe.","Sales of almost all product categories improved over the prior year with our new laminate introductions enhancing our market position. Improvements in our laminate manufacturing facilities drove down cost and expanded our capacity, which had inhibited sales of our new collections earlier this year. During the period, we had strong sales growth in Eastern Europe, Australia and Russia. Although, we are announcing a slowdown in our Russian laminate business, as the economy weakens. Across Europe, we are investing in consumer advertising, this fall to promote our brands and new collections.","Our Czech wood plant is now operating near capacity with improved cost and margins. Although, currency translation of wood products shipped from Malaysia impacted our costs. Our Belgian LVT sales continued to increase as we broaden our product offering, increased production and improved manufacturing cost and quality. Additional equipment will be installed at the end of the year and during the first of next year to increase the plant's capacity. Our insulation board and roof panel sales and margins are improving. We're implement \u2013 equipment upgrades in our board manufacturing facilities to optimize our Spano and Unilin assets.","We have numerous projects underway to enhance the mix and cost of our board offerings to increase our margins. The IVC acquisition has a strong management team, leading manufacturing capabilities, and new market opportunities that we're going to optimize with our existing business. We have realigned the sales and manufacturing organizations and identified best practices to enhance our combined laminate, vinyl and panel businesses.","I'll now turn the call over to Frank, to review the financial performance for the period.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $2.042 billion, slightly down at about 0.3%. They were up 4% on a pro forma basis using a constant exchange rate. All segments grew in local currency with FX reducing sales of approximately $141million in the quarter. Our gross margin was 30.1% as reported, or excluding charges 31%, that's up 260 basis points from last year with increased volume, better productivity and lower cost driving the improvement.","SG&A, as reported, was $359 million, excluding charges, it was 17.2% of sales. That's up 20 basis points over last year as we are investing back into the business by expanding our sales force, and increasing sampling, and merchandising. Restructuring and acquisition costs were $27 million with about $19 million in cost of goods sold and $8 million in SG&A. Of the total, $14 million related to the IVC and Kai acquisitions, with the balance for plant closures in the Flooring North American segment and continuing integration plant closures with the Spano and Unilin businesses. We estimate $35 million to $40 million of additional restructuring in the last half of 2015.","Our operating margin, excluding charges was 13.8%, up 240 basis points with FX impacting results by approximately $25 million, compared to last year. Our interest expense was $17 million, it's down about $4 million, due to the redemption of $254 million of our 2016 bonds last year, and the introduction of our U.S. commercial paper program, both yielding lower rates. Other expense was $3 million, unfavorable to last year by $4 million, due to transactional FX impacts.","The income tax rate for the quarter was 24.3%, compared to 24.5% last year. We estimate the full-year tax rate to be 22% to 23% for 2015. And in 2016, we're estimating 24% to 25% as our full-year tax rate. Earnings per share, excluding charges, was $2.69, that's up 22% from last year. EPS would have been $2.95, or $0.26 higher using a constant exchange rate.","If we turn to the segments, in the Global Ceramic segment, sales were $790 million, down 1% as reported, which includes $18 million from the Kai acquisition. And we were up approximately 6% on a pro-forma basis using a constant exchange rate. FX was a $69 million headwind to sales in the quarter. All regions were up on a local currency basis, compared to last year. Our operating margin, excluding charges, was 15.6%, up 220 basis points from positive volume mix and productivity. FX was a headwind here by approximately $12 million.","In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $920 million, up 3% and this includes $10 million from the IVC acquisition. We had increased volumes in all of our product categories, except for broadloom carpet. The operating margin, excluding charges, was 11.7%, up 310 basis points with productivity, lower costs and higher volume increasing margins. In the second quarter, our North American segment included a $14 million benefit from input costs of raw materials, labor, energy and SG&A, which had different impacts on the margins.","We anticipate additional margin benefit in the second half of this year, compared to last year from further FIFO inventory flow through, which typically takes one to two quarters. In the Flooring Rest of World segments, sales were $332 million, down 7% as reported and this includes $28 million from the IVC acquisition. Sales were up 5% on a pro-forma basis using a constant exchange rate.","The declining euro reduced sales by about $72 million, compared to last year. Operating margin, excluding charges in this segment, was 18.5%, up 250 basis points, due to higher volume, lower cost and productivity. Again, with the weak euro, negatively impacting results by $13 million. In the corporate and eliminations segment, the operating loss, excluding acquisition charges, was $10 million. We're expecting a full-year loss of $35 million in the eliminations segment.","If we move to the balance sheet. Cash ended the quarter at about a $170 million, that's up from last year with residual cash from the acquisitions in Europe. We will use this residual amounts in the third quarter to pay down our European revolver. Receivables ended the quarter at $1.388 billion with days sales outstanding at 54 days, slightly up from 52 days last year. The days were primarily impacted by channel mix changes during the quarter. Inventories were $1.592 billion. Our days actually improved to 106 days, compared to 109 days last year, as we are focused on inventory management.","Fixed assets were $3.015 billion, and these included CapEx of a $123 million for the second quarter with depreciation and amortization of $88 million. We estimate CapEx of $515 million for the full year of 2015, with depreciation and amortization estimated at $370 million. These both include the IVC and Kai acquisitions.","Long-term debt was $3.5 billion at the end of the quarter, with a leverage at 2.6 times debt times EBITDA. We recently executed a $1 billion commercial paper program in Europe, which will allow us to replace our current $600 million European revolver with lower rate debt in the third quarter. Based on current rates, this equates to approximately $5 million to $6 million in annual interest savings.","With that, I'll turn it back over to you Jeff.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Frank. The U.S. economy should continue to improve, strengthening both the residential and commercial flooring markets. During the third quarter, we anticipate that U.S. sales and margins and all our product categories will improve over last year. In Mexico, we expect our sales and margin expansion to continue and our ceramic market is growing strongly.","Our European business should continue to improve with the economy, as we benefit from our new ceramic manufacturing asset and other investments we've made. Even though Russia should be more difficult going forward, we expect to gain market share by expanding our position in all channels.","In the third period, we will continue to absorb start-up cost related to our many investments, including two new LVT plants, a new ceramic plant, a major upgrade in equipment across the enterprise, our new acquisition of vinyl in the U.S. and Europe and ceramic in Eastern Europe and Western Mexico will improve our results and long-term value.","Taking all these factors into account, our guidance for the third quarter earnings is $2.91 to $2.99 per share, excluding any restructuring charges. Our third quarter earnings guidance would have been approximately $0.24 per share higher on a constant exchange rate relative to last year. Our business is benefiting from years of thoughtful investments in new equipment and acquisitions.","In addition to being the world's largest flooring manufacturer, we have the most comprehensive product portfolio with the best brands and assets. Our management team is the strongest in history with well-developed strategies and the expertise to fully execute them. The foreign currency is creating headwinds, most of our markets are improving and we are growing on a local basis. We anticipate continued improvement of our performance through further new investments and carefully selected acquisitions.","We'll now be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of James Armstrong from Vertical Research.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter. First question is, in U.S. flooring, costs were down in the quarter, like you said, for many of the grades. Did you see the impact of lower wood costs and do you expect to have to pass those lower costs along, or do you anticipate keeping the delta in those costs for the foreseeable future?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Was that a wood question or carpet question or both?","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Wood question. It's a wood question and a little bit of both. So, if you could address wood and oil as well maybe.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Our U.S. wood sales and margins are growing. We're seeing growth in the engineered woods with new products improving our sales and mix. The market prices in the wood and carpet seem to be relatively stable at this point. Although, there are continued promotions, as well as competition in the commodity categories, as well as some mix decline in the various categories.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","We had a slight benefit from input costs in that segment.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, so just a slight one. That helps. And then switching gears a little. In the Russian market that you compete in, what do you believe your market share has grown to at this point? And do you think there's still room for significant market share gains in that region?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, the market in Russia is fractured. And we're the largest and we're somewhere in the mid-teens or a little more. So there's huge opportunities over there to grow the business.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. That helps. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much guys and congratulations on a strong quarter. My first question relates to the acquisitions that came in this quarter, KAI and IVC. I was curious if you could give us a little bit more color about what drove the upside to your previous guide. If you could give us a sense for \u2013 maybe update us on what you're expecting for the remainder of the year from the combined two.","And with respect to IVC specifically, do you think there's the kind of operational improvements similar to what we've been seeing you doing in Marazzi at IVC? Or is it a different kind of a story there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So the acquisition results were slightly better than we expected. But our expectation, there is a lot moving parts when \u2013 at the time, we hadn't even closed the piece and knew what it was. So to give you a better view of the future, the acquisition earnings for the third quarter embedded in our guidance is about $0.20 a share to $0.25 a share to give you some basis to understand the future.","With that, the organizations are really working well together. We're implementing best practices in-line to cross it. At the same time, we are absorbing start-up costs for the new LVT plant and new laminate manufacturing plant in the IVC acquisition. The IVC acquisition will not have the same synergies out of taking costs out. They were a highly efficient organization, so increasing the market share, broadening the business and selling more with it. We think the synergies, there are synergies, though, in leveraging the business relationships, the design capability, the transportation and distribution and then all the best practices across both businesses we'll learn from each other.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. I appreciate that color. And then I guess the second question relates to your commentary about the sales growth. I think you had mentioned that you expected to see sales growth improving in all your segments. But did you mean if you zoom in on the Flooring North American portion, do you think that you're going to see sales growth in, let's say, resi commercial, resi remodel as well? And that comment about sales growth improvement in all three segments. was that ex-acquisitions or inclusive of acquisitions?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think that we'll see sales growth in all the categories. We've put a lot of effort into the carpet business to put out products and things that are improving. I think we're well positioned going into the fall with the pieces. So we think the rugs and hard surface categories are growing in the marketplace and we're growing our share within them. Offsetting that a little bit is the polyester products. The more we sell polyester relative to other products that swap them out, we and the industry end up with a lower revenue line because they sell at lower prices. So that's impacting both us and the industry.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much, guys. Good job.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Excellent execution, guys. Over the past three years, your SG&A has gone up by less than half of the sales increase. I imagine that's driven by a combination of that capital spending you've done and also integrating the acquisitions. I guess the question is, with SG&A having leverage over the past few years, what inning are you with the pay-off of that CapEx? I guess it's been about $1.1 billion over the past two years. And what attractive returns are you seeing in the proposals that the division presidents are giving you today from when you first started this accelerated CapEx?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","CapEx projects across the piece, some of them are in the expanding the capacities of the business like the new plant in the ceramic business or somewhere else. We also put in new capacity to manufacture more polyester product. So a portion of it's going to align the business with the revenues and the mix changes that are going in them. Then over the pieces, the projects range anywhere from typically two-year paybacks to five-year paybacks across the business, and they're all over. We think that we'll continue getting benefits from all these things over the next year.","The large projects typically take x months to put them in plus get benefit. The ceramic business for instance, you start putting in a plant, it takes a year and half or so to put it up, it takes another year to ramp it up and get the benefits out of it on an existing business where we have the sales. You go into a new product category, like you do in LVT, not only do you have the same start-up pieces, you have to build the market and customer base to go along with it, so you start out with losses that last a while until you get the volume to go through it and then you start getting the benefit when you get it up to the appropriate level for each investment.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And then I think in the past you've said that 5% to 7% is a more typical organic growth in a cyclical recovery for flooring. And you're doing 4% now but it sounds like you're, just based on all the initiatives you're doing, it sounds like there's some market share gains there. Just curious what you think is holding that recovery back from getting to those more normal growth rates?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think what's happening is the flooring industry is probably growing my estimate somewhere close to 4% this year is about the whole industry. However, we have larger participation in the carpet business and the laminate business, which are growing les Also, those categories don't have as much participation in the new home construction as the other ones do, so there's a channel mix going on as well. And then the laminate business had almost none in the commercial business. So there's a channel mix difference as well as a product mix difference going on.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Laura Champine - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Good morning. If we go back just for a hot second to the old segments, would the carpet business have shown a greater EBIT margin improvement, or would that be the Unilin North American business with stronger margin improvement in Q2?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Laura, what we tried to do to stay out of this scenario here is to give you guys in the 8-K we filed restated prior quarters in the current format so that you can understand the business a little bit better. And we're not getting into that level of granularly in terms of different product categories within the new segments right now.","Laura Champine - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. I guess the point of the question is to see, and I know this \u2013 you get a bigger benefit in later quarters, but is to see how much the benefit of lower costs in your carpet business in the U.S. helped you into kind of gauge that versus the productivity improvements, I think you're seeing in other parts of the business in North America. So any comment you could make on that would be great.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Yeah. Let me try to address that. So, we're in the North American segment, the largest driver of the margin improvement was productivity with input cost being the next largest. And we expect that business in all of our segments actually from a margin standpoint to improve as you compare year-over-year this year to last year. And then, I think the other thing is that the raw material benefit, the input benefits that I'd mentioned earlier in my comments in that segment was about $14 million, and we're expecting the input benefit from carpets to improve as we move through the year.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just as a comment, the inputs include labor, they include materials, they include energy, they are offsetting up and down in all the different pieces.","Laura Champine - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","Hi, thank you. I just wanted to go back to the comment you made on the accretion from the acquisitions. I think you said $0.20 to $0.25 in the third quarter. And I guess taking an assumption on annualizing that, it would seem like a 50%, 60% increase from your initial guidance. I just wanted to confirm then if that's directionally right. Maybe you could piece out a little bit what's so much stronger now, whether that's revenue or expenses now that you've been in the businesses?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It has increased significantly from where we started. At different points in time, we have the accounting that you have to do and where you apply it and what the costs are going to be and what the depreciation and things are going to be. So we now know what's it's going to be versus a few months ago we were guessing at what it was going to be. And then at the same time, I think that the businesses have done a little better than we anticipated, than we had expected in the various pieces.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","I would just say be careful about just taking that number times 4 to come up with a full year accretion \u2013 number of accretions we've got, seasonality and things such as that that would impact that differently.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","Yeah, I was getting to a smaller multiple, but I guess when you think about the accounting differences there or adjustments that you talked about. Is the cash or kind of the core cash flow basis a lot stronger as well?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Your question is are the revenues and the margins better, I guess with cash? And from what our original estimates were, I think probably a little better.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay, very good. And then just one other, if you think about the incremental margins that you've talked about, Frank, in the past, even with all the investments that you've highlighted today and in prior quarters in the business and a lot of different sales efforts and so forth, the incremental margins I think continue to be very strong, even if you back out any raw material benefits. I'm just wondering if, as you look forward over the next couple of years, is the incremental margin opportunity stronger than maybe what you've talked about in the past as you brought a lot of these organizations together? Or is the investments, that you are making, going to be something that's consistent and so the incremental margins remain at these levels?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","I would say our current thinking on incremental margins for the three segments today, as we've restructured them, is in the North American segment, those margins would be kind of in the low 20% range. Ceramic stays as is at about 25% and rest of world is around 30%.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for taking my questions. The first question I had is just on the recasting of segments. You've talked about how there are some benefits across kind of the combination of management and distribution and capacity. Can you size up the overall benefit that you are expecting from this realignment? And how much is purely management or head count related as opposed to some combination of distribution and other assets?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The reason we changed the segments was because we felt that with the product categories we could coordinate the sales groups better. They were different of the \u2013 there were \u2013 before in the segment, one segment will be making the product and then we have the sales group in another segment and coordinating those two together to optimize them, was not that easy to do. And so by putting them all together, we should be better coordinated in optimizing the assets better. In addition to which, when you have lines of responsibility driven, something gets fixed and so by putting together the things in distribution, the things in engineering staffs, the things in purchasing, they can overlap each other in distribution. So, we think there's opportunities in all of those \u2013 it's just a small part of a whole piece to make the whole place work better.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. And then second question, I think, in the opening comments, you noted that home centers are increasing the focus on ceramic. You are obviously growing share there. I think they've also increased the focus on things like vinyl. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on what's this coming at the expense of? Presumably it's soft surface still and how you're trying to kind of counterbalance that and thinking about kind of the residential carpet business.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The ceramic is one of the faster growing categories in the market. The vinyl is growing fast, but it's starting from a relatively low base, you can't really compare the two. We think that will both continue as far as we can see at this moment. As we've stated before and continues consumers in residential are using carpet and less places as they like the looks of the hard surface categories, we participate in all those. So, that we believe it's going to grow less than the flooring industry in total, and from our business, we're aligning ourselves to be able to compete in various categories to have low costs to reduce our SG&A structures, which we're investing more in right now, to try to expand the business. I think we're well positioned as anybody in the industry.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions today. First, on LVT, obviously it's been a fast growing product category, particularly in the U.S. And with that increased demand, you're seeing a greater capacity being brought up in the North American market. Could you pass some thoughts on how you manage pricing in an environment where you have greater capacity coming online and just to clarify for listeners, where you participate in the price scale for LVT products? Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The market is somewhere approaching a $1 billion. It's expected to grow at about 15% compounded rate in the U.S. to be more or less. There is new capacity coming in. So what we expect to happen is that the local producers will supply most of the growth, as well as reduce imported products into the marketplace.","Within that, you're going to have different competitors with different strategies and different strengths going after different parts of the marketplace. And we see China losing share. So all that's going to be going on over the next, I don't know, two years or three years as the capacity comes in and changes. We think we're well positioned. We have the most knowledge in the category. We have a plant that's significantly larger and more backward integrated in the U.S. than others. And we have unique knowledge in \u2013 from our total businesses of creating style, design, and performance attributes that we think will give us advantages in the marketplace. So, I like where we are with it. In most new categories, as you go through the productivity increases and style and design increases and the same thing's going to happen here.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","As we've seen with some Chinese produced products for wood flooring, laminate flooring, could that bear a scar or could that be a black eye and be a benefit to the LVT product category too?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, that is a concern of some people. At the same time, you have the \u2013 we believe that we will be more focused on what the consumers want in this marketplace, to be able to bring the style and design that they expect. You take out the long lead times and working capital required to do it. The obsolescence costs and things, so we think we'd bring to the market competitive things and if you look at our products, I mean, in ceramic, almost, I don't know 50% of the market's imported. I mean, we well understand how to compete against imported products.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay, great. Final question. We know that operating and cost efficiency is a constant process with any business. But that said, given the tremendous work that you've done in Europe to that end with your acquisitions, what inning are we in terms of the broad stroke production and efficiency changes and what could we expect as we look forward over the next 12 months to 18 months?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The big ones we're still implementing are we're replacing \u2013 we've just replaced a chunk of the ceramic assets. They're just getting in the second phase that we have. Those will pay benefits mostly next year. We have another phase that we're looking at that we have \u2013 are getting ready to put in in that one. We have closed plants in the board businesses, we're putting new assets in those as we speak. And then there's hundreds of projects below those as we go through. We have a saying in the business, congratulations you're half way there, and that's where we are.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of John Baugh from Stifel.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you and my congrats as well. Just a couple of things quickly. Could you \u2013 I know IVC is ramping capacity both in LVT, and I believe in sheet vinyl. Could you help us? I think they did $735 million in revenue last year and then I realized there's some FX headwinds on the European part. But the U.S. part, which I think was 20%, could you give us a feel for how that's going to ramp in, say, 2015 and 2016 with the expansions coming on?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The startup is progressing. We're in the midst of training employees and speeding up the piece. So the volume of the plant is going to be approaching $175 million to $200 million when it's running, when we're utilizing all of it in the U.S., so that's ramping up. It'll take, I don't know, through next year and probably into the next year is that to go through. It depends on various strategies and how we modify the imports that we're doing or not.","In the European business you have, the Mohawk plant that's ramping up and they're helping ramp it up faster and reach higher capacities and we're going to put more investments in it, and then it'll take the same \u2013 it'll take at least a couple of years to get through it. The sales in that one is the smaller plant, will be probably about a $125 million over time and that one as we go through, and then we're going to be looking for other alternatives to invest in the business and grow it even faster in all categories and geographies.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. I'm halfway there with my questions. Russia local currency EBIT, is it now trending south year-over-year, even though you're gaining revenue there locally?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","In local currency, the EBIT was slightly up over last year, both sale and EBIT were solid.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But I don't want to mislead you. We are doing, what we have to do to grow the market share and we are so that EBIT in the quarter was up slightly, but the margin percent is going down as we do what we got to do to take market share and we're going to continue going down that path.","Now at the same time, you heard we're considering adding new capacity. So as we look out, we're looking out with the capacity about two years out, so to keep driving market share and then have the capacity, when this thing turns to support it, at the same time, we have a large share of the mid-to-high end marketplace, and so, with the imports from Europe, which is most \u2013 a lot of high-end, we see other opportunities in driving the high-end piece. But you do have to understand that the market is in complete turmoil.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Understood. Thanks. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. In the prepared segments, you discussed Marazzi and some of the big manufacturing changes going on there. And you made a reference to the next phase for them. And I was going to ask you a question. What is the next step for Marazzi after all the work that you've already completed?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We changed almost all the assets in the Italian plants. There is some other assets in our Spanish plants that we're going to upgrade. And then what've been doing up to now is trying to do a good job, the goal was to basically try to maintain the volume and get out of the bad products and bad margins and drive up the margins. We're only partway along achieving it, but we have made the changes in the product, we're bringing new innovation to the marketplace, we're changing the mix within it and we're lowering our things substantially. So all those things are happening will continue.","And then now for the first time since we owned it, we're looking at, do we want to increase either our capacity or go into some different markets that have opportunities and products and volume where we've been constraining it a little bit? Now, we have the new Eastern European business with KAI and there is a lot of synergy between the assets there and they tend to make low to mid-end products. And the other assets we're focused on mid to high-end products.","So we think that there's opportunities to export products from Bulgaria into other parts of Europe. And we have some new capacity coming in now, just came up with it. So we think there's a lot of opportunities to dramatically increase the margins. And now we're just looking at things, how to move to top line in the market that we're hoping just getting ready to start improving.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Jeff. Second question. As your answer talked about, a lot of stuff going on in this company right now. We're heading into the cash rich part of the year in the second half of the year, so leverage should fall. Are you still open in the market for the right acquisition? And is there a size limit which you would not go above given a lot of moving parts in Mohawk at this point?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In our models, we believe the marketplace that our business is going to continue getting better. Our margins are going to increase, our profitability is going to continue to increase. We should be able to generate a lot of capacity to invest and our ratios of debt to cash flow will go down quickly.","So our balance sheet will handle a lot of debt if we choose to use it. More importantly is, I'm not interested in being big, I'm interested in having a right businesses and getting the returns we want. So we have to find the right things and the right businesses that we like, and we're always looking. Some of them take years to get together when you do it and some take months. But we just finished the other ones, and we're starting to focus again on future opportunities.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Robert Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is actually Collin (55:30) filling in for Bob. Thank you for taking my questions. A real quick on the margins for each of the new segmented categories. In the past you laid out long-term goals. Do you have any long-term goals that you could share with us for each of these categories?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, higher.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say in the North American segment, low to mid-teens in ceramic. And Rest of World segments in the mid-teen range.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you. And then on the potential for future acquisitions, are there anything in the pipeline you guys are looking at? And are these going to be like more bolt-on or maybe the same scale as the past acquisitions have been?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, we're open to anything. We don't have a formula to do it. We look for the best businesses in the category and new things, be it new geographies or new products. When we go into areas where we have strong management, either geographically and\/or within a category, we will look at businesses that are under great stress and we're quite confident that we can improve them. So we're willing to do either\/or.","We've proven that we can move into different international markets and help those businesses and drive them and help them better, so getting into the new geographies. We're open to anything as long as we can compete on an equal basis with non-U.S. public companies in those geographies. So we're very careful about deciding where we go into it because, on an equal basis, we're quite comfortable and compete with anybody. But we don't want to be constrained with different rules than they do, is a significant part of how we think about things.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Stephen East from Evercore ISI.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Frank, I guess the first question for you around some raw materials. One, could you clarify, the $14 million in North American flooring, you said that that had gives and takes. So they weren't all positive contributors to that $14 million bump?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Correct. I was saying that the different items that are included in there, which is raw materials, labor, energy, SG&A, some benefited and some went the other way.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then on ceramic, one, was nat gas a meaningful benefit, or do you expect it to be? And I know you all haven't seen any incremental from the drop in oil prices. If you look at more recent cycles, how long would it take for you all to start, if you were going to see some purchase opportunities, how long after oil drops would that come through? And then I just had one follow up on product mix.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It depends on each product and category. It can take anywhere from a two months to six months for it to show up for us and then it can take anywhere from one quarter to two quarters or more to flow through our piece. It all depends on what it is and where it is.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Got you. Okay. In the nat gas, was there any benefit on that? And then, Jeff, the other question I have is, you're seeing mix shift up on the ceramic side in North America. You're not seeing it in the carpet side. Why do you think the consumer is willing to mix shift up on ceramic, but not on the carpet side?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There is higher selling products going on. Part of the difference is that the carpet business, the growth is coming in the new construction and multifamily businesses, where the remodel is slower. And so what's happening is you're getting a mix change there. And then at the same time, you're getting the polyester prices as we shift from nylon to polyester. We're reducing the selling prices of the industry's products with both.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","And then on your question, Stephen, for nat gas, they have declined somewhat, but those declines have been offset by increased labor and healthcare and freight costs.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks. I appreciate that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Susan Maklari with UBS.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Hello. Just in terms of Russia, you've mentioned in your comments that you're raising prices about 10% there but you're still really not fully offsetting the inflation that you're finding. How do you think about your ability to continue to raise prices, especially while you also want to gain share? And how long do you think that that can sort of hold for?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I mean the reason I also said that my margins declined, so as we're trying to gain share, but even without gaining share, our market is in turmoil, people lower prices. So, the margins are coming down. We are positioned as the leader in the industry in the mid to high end part of the business place, which is a good place to be. With that, our new introductions are doing well, and our higher margins on the other hand to drive share, we're competing more in lower value products than we have historically.","And, so that's offsetting some of it. You should expect that my competitors are going to get under more stress, and the prices are going to get under more pressure, and our margins will have to absorb that. Now I believe that, we're a very low cost producer in the marketplace, and I think, when this thing, whatever it turns out on the other side, we're going to have a much bigger, better business when we get to the other side, because of all of this, but the margins in between are going to be what they are going to be.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then as we look out longer-term, how should we think about CapEx going forward, given all the acquisitions and the investments that you're making?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm going to invest in anything that gives me the returns I want, given the cash flow we have, I mean we are looking to find internal projects, which gives the highest returns, the lowest returns, at the lowest risk. And so, we're going to keep investing on. We haven't set the level for next year yet, so the last two years, it's been about $450 million to $500 million as it's been, and we'll invest more if we can find the right places to put it.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","You know, Susan, as Jeff had mentioned earlier, we think we're going to generate a lot of cash flow and also our debt capacity should go up over the next few years. So we'll have a good bit of dry powder to invest in CapEx Greenfield projects or M&A.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great, thanks.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Okay.","Operator","The next question is from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah, good morning, congrats on a great quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. Just Jeff, or Frank, I'm sorry, you gave that $14 million number for North American flooring and input benefits. Is there any way you could share with us numbers for rest of world in ceramics?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah the input cost in ceramics was a positive $4 million, input cost in rest of world was a positive $7 million.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Positive $7 million. Okay, thanks. And then I realized just late in the call, but I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about competitive environments. You discussed the competitive situation in Russia in some detail. But just as you go through your other segments, obviously you're gaining share. You've got a lot of commercial momentum right now. Can you just talk about how competitors are reacting to this? Your thoughts there would be great, would be appreciated. Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't have too many markets that aren't competitive. As everybody is trying to get their share of the different marketplaces. Let see now. I'll walk you through it, the North American market is typical. I think that a lot of the companies including us, over the last five years when we were in the downturn, everybody is trying to get their margins back to where they were before historically. I think we're doing better than most, we're well positioned. So, having the competitors wanting to improve their margins is a good thing in the marketplace. At the same time, everybody is got capacity they're trying to use.","In the Mexican marketplace, we're growing our share significantly, as we expand our distribution footprint. I think that we're bringing to the marketplace new style and design, which is giving us something to sell other than price. There are also some large players and we provide another really strong alternative in the marketplace in Mexico.","In European business, the ceramic business, we've been moving our business from where they were at a significant share in the lower end part of the marketplace. We're focused on driving our product mix up and significantly lowering our costs both of which we're doing. In that marketplace, we're leading the marketplace in wood designs, which is growing rapidly, and we've been doing that, we're bringing in new style and designs and really small thing at the same time. So we are selling new looks and leading looks in a marketplace, while at the same time lowering our costs. As competitors get into those different categories, we're bringing out new product categories and then as you'd suspect that things get more competitive, we're maintaining our market share by moving the prices as acquired.","In the European marketplace, the laminate business is still competitive. There is a lot of excess capacity, but less. Board businesses, it seems to be some volume moving up and there is opportunities for the margins to expand dramatically as people get more comfortable with the asset utilizations over the next few years, it could happen. Russia, we already talked about, what did I miss?","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","No, that was pretty thorough. Do you expect any sort of exit of capacity from any of these major markets for you? Are there players that are going to get shaken out because they are just too high up on the cost curve?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think in Russia, there's several under stress in it. And the answer though is typically assets unless they are really bad, just change hands, is it, so for assets to get out is rare, is that they just change who owns them.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Thanks very much for the detail.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Phillip Lewis from Security Capital Brokerage.","Phillip Alexeev Lewis - Security Capital Brokerage, Inc.","Hey guys.

He helped grow Mohawk into a $5 billion flooring company prior to his retirement in 2004.","Moving back to the earnings call, joining us today are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Glenn Landau, who joined Mohawk this month as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for his opening remarks. Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. In the first quarter, our results came in line with the high end of our expectations. We delivered sales of $2.4 billion, up 1% as reported and up 6% on a constant exchange and days basis. Our adjusted operating income for the period was $207 million or 8.5% of sales in a difficult environment which we anticipate improving.","The U.S. dollar strengthened significantly versus the prior year reducing our translated results for the period. During the period, the economies were softer in most of our regions. Housing markets were weaker, and material and energy cost escalated around the world. Uneven demand impacted volume increasing pressure on pricing and mix as competition increased.","To align our inventories with demand, we reduced production rates to manage working capital. In the U.S. flooring retails reported that after a disappointing results in January and February, activity was improving by the end of the quarter. During the first quarter, we raised prices in many of our markets to cover inflation. And each of our businesses are taking specific actions to adapt to the present environment.","We are introducing new products to differentiate our offerings and enhance our margins. We have replaced higher cost assets, consolidated operations, enhanced manufacturing processes, and reduced overhead expenses. We will take further actions across the enterprise as we move through the year to grow our sales and improve our margins. While we are managing through the current conditions, we are continuing to strengthen the long-term value of the business.","The integration of 2018 acquisitions in Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil remains on track. And we are further investing to enhance their performance. Our products and geographic expansions continue to ramp up as we increase sales. We will realize the potential of these projects through 2020 and beyond.","For more detail on the performance of segments, I'll turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Wellborn","Thank you, Jeff. For the quarter, our global ceramic segment sales increased about 2.5% as reported. And we are up about 7% on a constant days and exchange rate. Our operating income was about $90 million or 10% of sales including the acquisition of Eliane and headwinds from slower markets, pricing pressures, and inflation. In the U.S., the ceramic industry faced continued pressures from LVT as well as imports from a stronger dollar.","A group of ceramic tile has recently filed dumping claims against China, the largest ceramic exporter to the U.S. If confirmed, tariffs could significantly increase the delivery cost to Chinese imports and change competitive pressures. Due to earlier interest increases, U.S. home sales and construction slowed although both have recently improved as mortgage rates declined.","To enhance our position, we have begun many initiatives across the business. To cover inflation and transportation, we implemented price increases across many categories. To compete with imports, we have begun offering private label programs and shipping direct truckloads to reduce the delivery cost. We have improved service to our customers with new mobile systems to make ordering and picking up faster and easier.","We are enhancing our value proposition with unique features such as slip resistance, greater durability, and bacteria-resistant technology. We have added high end decorative tile collection and thick porcelain outdoors tiles as an alternative to stone. We are testing a fast installation technology. And we are pioneering a porcelain roofing system that offers the beauty of traditional slate with greater value. The start of our new quartz countertop plant is on schedule and will complement our sourced stone and quartz program. The plant produces slabs that are about 30% larger than the industry, which reduces both installation seams and waste. We are also expanding sales of our porcelain slabs made in Italy that are used on floors, walls, and countertops.","To reduce operational expenses, we have enhanced body formulations and improved manufacturing efficiencies, maintenance costs, and freight strategies. We have also reduced both our administrative and selling costs with system enhancements. In Mexico, we are outperforming the market by broadening our customer base, expanding our polished and technical porcelain offering, and supporting stores that exclusively sell our brand. We continue to grow our exports to Central and South America with our leading design. In the period, we implemented price increases to recover higher natural gas, electricity and transportation costs, we anticipate our Mexican business improving from these actions.","As the new Brazilian government implements policy changes the country's economy is in transition. We have recently implemented price increases to offset the dramatically higher cost of natural gas, which is regulated by the government. We are upgrading our mix with high-end porcelain in large sizes and began producing wall tile for the U.S. market, which replaces other source products.","To support higher sales, we have restarted an existing production line that was idle. New investments in Brazil will expand our porcelain production by the first part of 2020. We have reviewed best practices between Eliane and our other ceramic businesses, and we are implementing improvements across all groups.","The European ceramic industry has weakened with the regional economies. Competition in the market has increased and is pressuring industry pricing. We believe we have grown our market share in this environment. Our sales were driven by commercial, outdoor, and porcelain slab products, as well as higher style mid price offerings. During the period, we temporarily lowered our production rates to reduce our inventory. We are realigning the production in our European plants and reducing staffing to improve our cost, distribution, and service. We have consolidated management to increase our productivity, reengineered our formulations, and refined our maintenance processes. To reduce transportation expenses and enhance service, we have reorganized our Eastern European logistics system with new warehouses and technology. We are investing in energy saving initiatives and adding co-generation to improve cost this year.","Our Russian ceramic business is gaining momentum with sales improving significantly, driven by our premium national distribution network and 365 owned and franchised stores. The strength of our brand and breadth of our offering has made us the market leader, for new residential and commercial projects we've expanded our specification organization which is the strongest in the industry.","Our product mix continues to improve and we are increasing prices to recover inflation. During that period we completed our porcelain floor and wall expansion to support further growth this year and we've begun construction for additional slab production and the manufacturing of premium sanitary ware to expand our offering.","For the quarter our floor in North America segment sales were down 3% as reported and 1.4% when adjusted for one less day in the period reflecting the 2018 mortgage increases and more severe weather conditions. The business improved as we moved into the second quarter supported by higher retail activity and an improving housing environment. As expected, operating income for the segment declined due to lower volume, inventory reductions, higher material costs and LBT team manufacturing variances across the segment we are taking many actions to improve our sales, cost and margins.","To address changing consumer preferences, our new residential carpet introductions included more blended, multicolored collections and sophisticated patterns. Our new color Max technology which blends earth tones was voted the best carpet innovation at the National Show. As polyester products gain share we have differentiated our continuum collections with enhanced color visuals. The carpet price increases we've implemented are being partially offset by declining product mix. To ensure that each of our products in the market is priced properly, we have instituted better practices and controls.","We've replaced high cost assets in our consolidating four inefficient operations which will reduce our overhead and cost structures. We are enhancing planning strategies increasing production outputs and reducing process variations to facilitate this realignment, these actions are being completed with additional improvements are being reviewed. Our commercial business improved during the quarter due to new soft and hard product launches and channel segmentation. We are increasing our product benefits with new soft service collections featuring advanced soil and stain protection, unsurpassed durability and a proprietary moisture resistant backing.","Our hard surface sales increased dramatically with new product introductions with unique features for different commercial channels. We are adding sales reps to expand our specialization to increase our soft and hard service penetration in education, healthcare and hospitality channels. We have improved the performance of our soft service commercial facilities with investments in new technology and process enhancements. We're the North American leader in laminate flooring and our recent investments in advanced technology are expanding our market and upgrading our mix.","Our unique waterproof technology had revitalized the laminate market and extended the use of our products in the home. We've improved the production of our premium products including those with deeply embossed surfaces, to improve our efficiencies, cost and service, we have consolidated operations in warehouses.","Our sheet vinyl margins have improved due to better mix and manufacturing performance even as we discontinued the sale of non-Mohawk branded products. We are expanding our sheet vinyl distribution and introducing new products to expand the market. Our LVT continues to grow substantially and we have a complete offering under our key brands at all price points.","Our Mohawk smart select and solid tech collections provide unique features with different value propositions. We've introduced a premium rigid LVT collection called Pergo Extreme which is being well accepted due to its leading style, performance and brand recognition. We will extend our high end LVT collections as the year progresses. Engineering modifications to our LVT manufacturing are being implemented and we'll substantially improve our output and costs throughout the year. Most of these changes have already been proven in our European operations and we're confident in our long-term position.","For the quarter, our flooring Rest of World segment sales were up 6% as reported and up 16% on a constant basis and currency basis. Our adjusted operating income for this segment was about $95 million or 15.3% of sales up 11% on a local basis including our acquisitions.","The economies in Europe, in Australia, New Zealand have been slowing, putting pressure on our revenues and margins. In this climate, we outperformed in most of our businesses. We have been increasing prices on selective products to offset inflation and currency changes. We are expanding both our residential and commercial sales organizations to enhance the distribution of our products. The segment was impacted by startup cost and under absorption of our new LVT sheet vinyl laminate and carpet tile operations. Our strategic acquisitions of the flooring leader in Australia, New Zealand a mezzanine flooring business in Europe and regional hard service distributors enhanced our market position on our first quarter results.","In the laminate, we outperformed the European market with our unique technologies that make our products the preferred alternative to wood. Our new introductions are elevating the design and features of our brands at all price points. The acquisitions of our regional distributors are enhancing our market position and customer base. We have specialized European laminate plants, so they produce either luxury or volume products to improve our efficiencies and cost.","In Russia, we are also introducing similar premium alternatives on our new state-of-the art equipment. During the period, our LVT manufacturing substantially improved reliability and production. We're introducing more rigid LVT collections across our brands. We're making additional equipment modifications to relieve process restrictions as throughput has increased. We will continue to drive enhancements in our processes, formulations and features throughout the year. To increase our sheet vinyl sales in Europe, we are introducing innovative products with unique features and expanding our commercial offering and sales organizations.","The new Russian sheet plant has opened up capacity in Europe and we are pursuing new customers and channels. In Russia, the new plant is operating ahead of our initial plan in both volume and yields. We're expanding our customer base and over time, we will increase market share to optimize our results. Our installation results improved as last year's material shortages have been resolved and cost declined. The product category is growing significantly since our costs and selling prices have normalized.","Our volumes have exceeded prior peaks and we're taking share from other installation alternatives. To extend the use of our products, we have introduced a new installation product used out of floors that complements our ceiling and wall products. Our Board businesses are operating well as a result of our prior investments. The slowing European economies are impacting the industry and pressuring our volumes and pricing. We continue to enhance our processes, reduce our costs and increase the use of recycled materials. In Belgium with government assistance, we are constructing another power plant that will convert waste wood to energy and improve our competitive position.","Our new carpet tile plant in Belgium is operating well as we continue to build our specified in transactional sales. Our business continues to grow as we expand our customers, product offerings and our sales organization.","The Australia, New Zealand market is under pressure as the economy and housing slow. We are raising prices to offset increased costs primarily from a weaker local currency. We are introducing new products with enhanced styling and performance to extend our leadership in the market. We are closing high cost extrusion assets and supplying yarn from our U.S. operations and other sources around the world. We're broadening our hard surface collections to expand our share of the foreign market. Leverage and U.S. capabilities we are constructing a new carpet tile line to grow our position in the commercial channel.","I'll now turn the call over to Glenn, who will review our first quarter financial performance.","Glenn Landau","Thank you, Chris, and thank you Frank as well for the introduction and support over these past weeks. I'm pleased and excited to be a part of the Mohawk team and look very much forward to engaging with you our current and prospective shareholders and the broader investment community to build on an already strong relationship.","Now to the financial performance and the year-over-year bridges, first quarter net sales were $2.4 billion up 1.3% as reported compared to prior year were up 6% adjusted for days at a constant FX basis. Organic growth in legacy businesses measured in net sales per day on a constant FX basis was positive despite slowing markets and weather in North America up nearly 1% versus prior years.","One point of clarification for those of you who have picked this up who may not have picked this up already in our last earnings call it was stated that there would be one more day in the first quarter this year versus last year, while in actuality there was one less day.","Correspondingly, there will be one more day in the fourth quarter this year. I hope that clears up any questions. Back to the financials, as this at the segment level, Legacy Flooring Rest of World showed the strongest growth largely offsetting continued weakness in Flooring North America.","Gross margin adjusted for special items came in at 27.1% in the first quarter, a decrease of 280 basis points versus prior year. The decrease was driven primarily due to inflation and input, so $45 million weaker price mix of $12 million and market related downtime of $7 million partially offset by higher volume including acquisitions of $21 million and lower startup costs of $9 million.","FX impact on gross margin dollars was $22 million on favorable. In terms of overhead, SG&A per net sales was 18.7% excluding unusual items up 90 basis points due to investment in samples, displays and marketing to drive sales.","Special items in total were $41 million for the quarter of which $15 million was cash, of the total $6 million was acquisition related and the remaining $35 million was restructuring made up of charges for replacing high cost assets and consolidating manufacturing and warehousing facilities in Florida, North America as well as workforce reductions in global ceramic.","Adjusted operating margin was 8.5% down from 12.1% last year as inflation and input costs headwinds of $51 million, weaker price mix of $12 million and lower productivity of $4 million hit the bottom line.","Increased market related downtime and softer volumes of $9 million were offset by reduced startup costs. Additionally, FX translation of $11 million further reduced income and more than offset the transactional FX positive $4 million below the line in other income expense.","Adjusted EBITDA was $348 million or 14.3% before interest expense of $10 million up $8 million last year from last year. The $2 million increase due to additional debt from acquisitions and share buybacks. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23%, and is expected to move into the range of 20% to 22% in the second quarter, while still maintaining guidance of 22% to 23% for the full year.","Finally, adjusted net earnings per share was $2.13 in the quarter, down from $3 and a penny or 29% versus last year. Now, let me turn to the segments, global ceramic has solid quarter. The sales of -- with sales of $898 million, an increase of 2.5% as reported versus last year, with legacy sales per day holding at 1% on a constant FX basis.","Adjusted operating income was $90 million or 10% of net sales down from 13.3% margin last year. Inflation and input cost headwinds were $21 million. Software volume and market related downtime amounted to $7 million and additional costs for product development, sales personnel and marketing were $5 million. Improving productivity of $8 million and lower startup cost of $2 million were partial offsets and FX translation was unfavorable by $3 million.","In the Global Ceramic segment, in the flooring North America segments, sales of $922 million decreased year-over-year by 3% on an as reported basis, or 1.4% on a daily rate. Adjusted operating income dropped to $31 million, or 3.4% of net sales in the quarter as input costs of $35 million and other inflation of $4 million, combined with weaker volume of $15 million and lower productivity of $13 million growing modestly offset by $3 million in price mix. With that said, raw material costs peaked in the quarter with improvement expected in the second quarter as lower cost inventory works its way through the process. And we also expect seasonally stronger sales.","Now moving to Flooring Rest of the World, the segment performed very well as sales improved year-over-year by 6% as reported with legacy sales per day up 4% on a constant FX basis. Acquisitions added 12% of the top line or $69 million. Adjusted operating income came in at $95 million or 15.3% of sales up 11% including acquisitions and on a constant FX basis as relief on overall inflation of $10 million driven by lower input costs and improve volume totally $14 million driven by acquisitions and strong performance in LVT, laminate and installation in Europe were only partially offset by lower price mix of $16 million. FX translation was unfavorable by $8 million. Corporate expenses and eliminations driving operating loss of $10 million with the full year estimate in the range of $35 million to $40 million.","Speaking now to the balance sheet, receivables ended the quarter at $1.7 billion with day sales outstanding improving versus the fourth quarter to 56 days roughly in line with last year, inventories ended the quarter at $2.3 billion or 126 days, slightly better than prior quarter and higher year-over-year by $293 million due to the ramp up of new plants, acquisitions, and higher raw material costs. As shared in the segment detail, inventories were adjusted in the first quarter with plant downtime. Going forward we will match our production with demand while continuing to try to optimize the supply chain.","Fixed assets for the quarter held at $4.7 billion compared to the prior color on capital expenditures of $137 million in the period for 100% of depreciation in line with plan. Guidance for the full year continues to be CapEx spending within a range of $550 million to $580 million, again, roughly in line with depreciation of around $570 million. So wrapping up total debt was $3.3 billion at the end of the quarter with leverage at 1.9 times debt to EBITDA. The balance sheet is strong, and free cash flow of $33 million in the quarter improved materially over the same period last year by $100 million underlying expectations of a very solid year in terms of cash generation.","With that, Jeff, I'll turn it back over to you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Chris. All of our businesses are taking actions to enhance our results with our major focus on LVT manufacturing, U.S. corporate performance, managing ceramic headwinds and increasing the utilization of new investments. In the U.S. flooring sales started out weaker and recently began to improve. Outside the U.S. most markets have softened and we are adjusting as required.","Across the business, we are enhancing our offerings, reducing our costs, and ramping up new plants to expand our portfolio. We continue to realize increases to offset inflation and restore our margin. Our LVT sales are expanding significantly. And we are making equipment modifications to increase our volume and productivity this year.","We are restructuring our U.S. carpet and laminate assets, and realigning our European ceramic operations to improve our cost results. Our recent acquisitions are positively impacting our results as we integrate them into our business. Taking all this into account, our EPS guidance for the second quarter of 2019 is $2.81 to $2.91 excluding any onetime charges.","We are investing in new products and geographies to drive growth and strengthen our organization. To improve our execution, we are taking the necessary steps to adapt to the present conditions and deliver greater profitability in the long term. We will now be glad to take your questions.","Simon? Operator? Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Go ahead, your line is open.","Stephen East","Thank you, and good morning, guys. Jeff, as you look at the demand both in Europe and the U.S., U.S. is rising, Europe is starting to slowdown. Could you talk some about the magnitude of each? Is the U.S. acceleration offsetting Europe or not? And do you think Europe -- the way you'll are forecasting now, do you expect Europe sales to remain positive for the year?","Jeff Lorberbaum","In the U.S., the industry we are anticipating with housing and what's going on in the market to be slower this year than last year, but we really don't have a good visual into how that's going to evolve. Depending on the different estimates, some people have it picking up dramatically as we go through the year and others have it still hesitating. Our estimates aren't any better. In Europe, the economies are all slowing across Europe and the competition is increasing as that occurs. And in that environment, we outperformed it in the first quarter. We think we can continue to outperform it for the rest of the year.","Stephen East","Got you. Okay. And then, as you look at flooring North America, the big issue is obviously on the margin side versus the revenues. But margin down about two thirds versus last year and it actually your op income sequentially declined more than revenues decline. So I guess if you all could rank order the causes of the drop in your op income? And any color on how you expect those to continue through the year?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Industry sales were weaker. The production was lowered in order to reduce the inventories. We had high material cost flowing through from prior which impacted the margins. The price increases we put in are helping to offset except the mix is going the other direction. We see lower material cost and higher prices improving margins going into the second quarter. To improve the cost, we talked about replacing high cost assets, closing inefficient operations. We are consolidating multiple warehouses and we are reducing headcounts and overheads to improve the results.","Stephen East","All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Tim Wojs","Yes, hey, good morning everybody. I guess just maybe my first question on LVT, is there any way to provide any sort of kind of numerical update may be and just how the LBT performance is in North America maybe relative to last quarter or six months ago and how does that compare if you look at Europe maybe as a proxy since that capacity set up a little longer than North America?","Jeff Lorberbaum","What was said is that the global capacity was operating where we expect will be over a $1 billion when the plants are optimized as we go through in Europe the LBT line is ahead of the U.S. line and the process has stabilized, the productivity and wastes are continuing to get better. We have identified equipment modifications which are being executed as the volumes going up to eliminate bottlenecks which are holding it up. We are introducing products across our brand and rigid products to use the capacity and we're expanding our customer base in Europe.","In the U.S., we are making engineering modifications similar to ones that have already been put in Europe the U.S. is making progress in it. We are shipping rigid products in the marketplace as we go through and I don't have any specific numbers to give you but we're confident that the LBT deal provide us advantages and through the year continue increasing as we increase the volume the overhead absorptions and the returns will get better.","Tim Wojs","Okay. Is there of $1 billion of capacity I mean is there any way to think about what the utilization is today on a run rate basis.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I don't have to give.","Tim Wojs","And then I guess on the production side of things, how are you kind of thinking about production as you kind of move into Q2 and I guess if you look at the market for 2019 what market growth level are you assuming in your production expectations. Is it flat is it up slightly, I'm just trying to think about how you guys are thinking about top line growth in '19 organically?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It's really different by market by market. Then you have the acquisitions going through I think.","Tim Wojs","May be to the U.S.?","Jeff Lorberbaum","In the U.S. the numbers are now for last year yet but we're estimating that the industry grew 3% to 3.5% and our assumptions are that with what's going on it'll be slower than that and be less than that even with the price inflation that's occurred overall that's our sort of thinking about it. The carpet industry sales in the first quarter were down and so were ours with LBT impacting on as we go through and that's also being impacted by mixed economy as we go through so that would help you a little.","Tim Wojs","Okay. That's helpful, so maybe kind of on a volume basis in a flattish sales growth for the market isn't a bad assumption.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good morning everybody. My first question is just how should we think about productivity in the US and especially given the initiatives that you have within carpet consolidating some of those assets? LVT obviously coming online laminate all these different kind of projects that are coming through. How should we think about those coming together and perhaps improving the productivity over time?","Jeff Lorberbaum","So productivity across the business was impacted by lower manufacturing, levels higher costs for the employees and the ramping up of these new projects all end up in productivity improved the cost we talked about replacing assets and restructuring different parts and operations and we've reduced both direct labor and overheads. We think the productivity will continue to lag in the near term due to the inefficiencies and higher costs but we expect to see improvements continuing throughout the year.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And then as we do think about the inventories and going into maybe a seasonally stronger period. Do you think that you've fully rightsized the business? How are you thinking about your level of utilization going into the second and third quarters?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The inventory levels were up in the period but almost all the inventory increase was up to two new plants that require inventories to support them. The acquisitions that we did last year the inventory flowing in and then with the tariffs that were expected. The products we're importing from China would dramatically increase the inventories in the period, for the most part most of our inventories in the ongoing businesses were kept under control with lower production rates and we're going to match the demand the production with the demand for the most part going forward.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much guys, I appreciate the time. My first question relates to the role that mix played in the quarter and what we could expect him to heading into 2Q in the rest of the year. In particular we noticed that the price mix number was pretty big negative in flooring Rest of World. And I know you also include mix by product type in your volume numbers and so I wanted to and I noticed that in flooring North America that that volume no impact was a little higher than we expected. So I guess my question is essentially. Can you help us understand what the mix dynamics product mix and channel mix were the main drivers in flooring North America and Flooring Rest of World. And should we expect those trends to be longer lasting throughout the rest of this year.","Glenn Landau","With the mix, the mix in flowing North America Steve is this is the same thing that's been going on for some time. First let me just say what we disclose and talk about is a combination of price mix. We have a difficult time pulling apart and separating, the mix in North America has been negative has we have seen a couple of things, one, product changes where we've seen product changing from higher price point nylon to lower price point polyester and then as we started putting in price increases that also drove some negative mix as well. And then I think you're referring to the on the on the floor in rest of world the number you're speaking to is price mix combined right not mix itself, correct?","Stephen Kim","Correct.","Glenn Landau","Yeah. So I think what's happening in flooring Rest of World Is in some of the categories over there product categories we're seeing raw materials go down and that's impacting pricing. Jeff I don't know if you want to add anything to that or not.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Last year in the insulation business there was a shortage of raw materials and the prices spiked about 30% or more and the prices have in the recent time come back down. So a major part of that is those prices coming down but at the same time it drove our selling prices up impacted the volume of the industry and us and with the costs coming down we're lowering the selling prices along with the decreases but the volume of the product category is going up and it's doing reasonably well right now.","Stephen Kim","Got it. Okay that's helpful. My second question relates to some of the management changes that we've seen recently. Obviously Glenn it's nice to have you aboard and Frank we're going to be sorry when you're not as present on the calls but we've also had some other questions regarding sort of deeper within the organization. And so my question relates to number one in what is your point in the global ceramic business and particularly Daltile in terms of running that business or you going to have any differences in how you manage that business.","And then secondly in Flooring North America, I wasn't sure if you had yet ahead of the resilient business in within Flooring North America. I know you broke down into five categories reported and so wanted to get a sense for how we're doing in terms of staffing on that?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We have a really strong organization in the North American ceramic business is operating well and continues to operate well at the moment we've chosen for Chris to operate as the interim President and we haven't selected another person at this point. There's no rush the Chris if you remember operated the business for many years and the organization is continuing to go forward. We have selected someone else to run the other business and everything's like we would like it.","Chris Wellborn","Steve, I would just comment the throughout this ceramic segment now the organization is extremely strong, Europe, Russia, Brazil, North America and of course JP and I sat beside of each other for 20 years I've put him in that job and I just want him time to get in the business again and it's working really well.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I just wanted, Chris, to work another day a week.","Stephen Kim","Excellent. Okay, thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mike Dahl","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question, a lot of company is across building products have called out a number of headwinds in the quarter but one in particular has been de-stocking at large retail. Could you comment about kind of what the inventory levels are in your or your sense of where the inventory levels are from your larger customers. And have you seen any changes in order patterns as part of that comment you made about improvement?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Well I can just comment on that. In some cases in the ceramic side with large customers, we have a lot of new products coming in and they are at the same time taking all the old products out. So that's causing some of the de-stocking that you're talking about where it's just product changes.","Chris Wellborn","And some of the other ones, there were some pushing out of it as it went through also.","Mike Dahl","Got it. Okay. My second question Jeff it's a bit bigger picture, if I step back and think about the moving pieces and what you're talking about in some of your global operations. Clearly, a big focus for you and the company has been expanding internationally over the past decade and increasingly the growth has come in countries that are emerging in nature and it seems like you're adding volatility to the portfolio alongside this global push. And I wanted to just ask you how you're thinking about your global strategy at this point based on kind of how the past 12 months or so have informed your results?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I don't think it's changed anything. Nothing's come as a surprise. You have periods of time where the U.S. dollar strengthens and then the translated results are impacted as part of the European businesses, we're investing in, we're trying to grow into other product categories as we've talked about to expand our footprint in Europe.","There was strong organization that we think are outperforming the market in Russia. We expanded our presence, we have the leading ceramic business in Russia where we expanded the laminate business and Russia is doing well, we've put in new equipment to expand it and we're putting more investments in as we grow our market share in Russia.","We've entered the Brazilian market with the new acquisitions we made last fall. We hired one of the best, we bought one of the best businesses and got the talented management alongside it to operate it. There will be more volatility in that marketplace but I think we're well positioned to do well within it. And so as a general rule, I would throw in Australia to Australia. We knew that the marketplace was due for a slowdown and we bought it. That was based on what we paid for it, we think we paid the right amount for it given that we knew we were headed into it and no surprise that Housing was overbuilt and softening right now. The results are still good and they're changing the strategies as we go forward. So I think we're doing the right things for the long-term of the business.","Chris Wellborn","And I would just add one more thing just to make a point. Russia we've been in since 2013 with the Ceramic acquisition and we've got a really good strong management team there and they've done a phenomenal job managing through the ups and downs and staying ahead of the market through both increasing and declining environments. So overall, I think we've done a pretty good job of managing the complexity of the geographic footprint around the globe.","Jeff Lorberbaum","But there is more volatility, I mean the one you just talked about the translated results from Russia 1.5 was Ruble is collapse but our business is still strong there and still growing.","Chris Wellborn","And I would just add one more thing, even when we go into a market like Brazil, we've known Eliane for 20 years. We know the management team very well, the President very well, and so, we've done a lot of work before we make an acquisition like that.","Mike Dahl","Okay. Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. There was a comment earlier in the call about reducing capacity specifically in Florida, North America, can you talk about what specifically you're doing and what's the timeline to get that completed?","Jeff Lorberbaum","So what first thing is we installed some new low-cost extrusion capacity, which still is leading to closing to old extrusion operations, we're also closing a yarn plant, a small tuck in plant. In laminate, we built a new warehouse to take off and we're closing two other warehouses and consolidate another plant with that move all of the things have good paybacks based on reducing the costs.","Keith Hughes","So Jeff, are you taking? Are you lowering your overall extrusion capacity by these moves? Are you just planning at a corporate life or just exceptionally weak, the last six months?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We took out some high cost extrusion and it will be slightly less but not; it won't keep it from meeting the ongoing demand.","Keith Hughes","Are you running extrusion below where you need to run it to make good profits?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We consolidate this together. So the new assets we have half of it in and running now. And the other half going in the next month, I think and I guess through the costs of our extrusion costs will come down. That's the\u2026","Keith Hughes","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Justin Speer","Thank you, guys. This first question Frank or Glenn, can you walk through or give us your free cash flow expectations for the year. And within that your expectations for working capital drag as you map towards a full year number?","Glenn Landau","Sure, this is Glenn speaking. Like I said earlier, free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $33 million, it's $100 million better year-over-year. And our outlook is very good. And that's based on the fact that capital spending as we spoke to, in our outlook will be down materially year-over-year and that is all upside first versus last year. So again, we're quite confident in a very strong cash performance and cash generation and ultimately, we believe, we can whittle down that working capital during the year on efficiencies?","Justin Speer","But I think the number was like $600 million or $700 million that you related last quarter is that still intact?","Glenn Landau","I think, it's north of that.","Justin Speer","And in terms of that working capital, just looking at that, the working capital as a percentage of sales is quite elevated 25%. I think the highest we've seen in quite a while and you mentioned a few of the puts and takes there, most of the takes, but how should we think about that as the year progresses? And is there any risk of obsolescence within that number?","Glenn Landau","Well, the big driver on that is inventories. Justin and we've been working as Jeff mentioned, to get our inventories down for some time I think that made good, we've made good progress with that. The inventories are if you look at it from the end of last quarter to the end of this quarter, about $50 million. However, days actually improved by one and a half days. If you compare inventories to a year ago, they're up over just a little bit over $290 million. And most of that related to the new plants, all the investments we're doing that we're putting out, how to get the inventories up before ahead of the sales. The acquisitions that we've done, and then the higher Chinese inventories that we came in, came in to get ahead of the tariffs. So I think\u2026","Justin Speer","And then, the last question. Oh, sorry.","Glenn Landau","I'm just going to say, I just say, I think we're managing our inventories. Well, we're making progress, and we'll be in line where we need to be by the end of the year.","Justin Speer","Thank you. The next question is that the implied guidance and the sequencing of guidance, I know it's an improvement in terms of year-over-year degradation. But the second quarter guidance is below what most we're expecting particularly giving the lower inputs that we saw with oil collapsing into January. I know it's sensory accelerated but oil inputs down quite a bit, pricing still good. Why is it the margin profile better next quarter and when should we see the year-over-year become more neutralized in your mind as we think as we started thinking about potentially a better back half in terms of underlying demand.","Glenn Landau","As you said the results for the first quarter were at the high end of our expectations. We expect the second quarter results improved with higher pricing and volume and lower raw material costs. At the same time, as we look out, we see the economy slowing and we see housing growth under pressure. We also are having difficulty anticipating what the inflation is going to be for the rest of the year. What we've continued to say is that the year-over-year decline in margins will improve throughout the year and keep getting better. And the future periods will have higher production rates, will have increased pricing, they'll be less startup costs in them. And it will start getting some of the benefits from the restructurings that we've been talking about.","Justin Speer","And can you quantify any of the restructuring benefit this year. The following this year that you've just announced in the press release?","Glenn Landau","We'll get some, the activities will be ongoing through this year, and then we'll see a much better benefit, larger benefit full-year benefit as we move into next year.","Justin Speer","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Baugh","Thank you for taking my questions, and my condolences on Chatsworth's passing, sad news. My question is to two different ones. One, did you have a material increase in the amount of imported LVT to sell either year-over-year or sequentially. And then, is there any update on the accretion from the acquisitions you've done? Any update with macro slowing, particularly in Australia to that guidance. Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The important LVT sales are going up significantly. We also brought in more inventory based on thinking there could be a 25% tariff increase ahead of it. Also, the sales of our own manufacturing products are also going up as we go through.","John Baugh","Do you have the guidance with the\u2026","Jeff Lorberbaum","Well the accretion guidance hasn't really changed John; I think we said for early on at a Brazilian acquisition. We expected annual EPS accretion in the first year of about $0.15. And then, on Godfrey Hirst, I think we had said accretion of $0.15 in the second-half of last year, so about $0.30 for the full-year, so that those numbers haven't changed.","John Baugh","Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Your next color or your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng","Hey, guys, I think part of the path ordering improvement going forward at some point productivity would flip positive, you start laughing on this price cost headwinds. And you're done drawn down inventory, just curious, it'd be helpful for you to kind of give us a sense, if any of these pieces you're expecting to flip positively in the next few quarters or just any color on some of the time frame would be really helpful.","Chris Wellborn","I think, we do expect those at the same time we are having difficulty estimating the economies in the housing pieces we go through as well as the inflation right now. And the only guidance we've given is what we keep saying that the Euro decline in margins will improve and get better as we go through the year.","Philip Ng","Okay. And these on the product just in terms of production and inventory, it sounds like, it's a work in progress. Should we expect that to be a big headwind going forward, just because it's been a drawdown dynamic throughout last few quarters? Did you have any better line of settling that trend?","Chris Wellborn","Most of it's behind us, but there's still some of it left because the first quarter wasn't quite as strong as we thought, but for the most part, as we said will be manufacturing and most of the businesses similar to the demand.","Philip Ng","Got it. And then from a capacity standpoint, just curious if you could give a little color in terms of where your capacity utilization is shaking out with some of the initiatives you've done in North America going forward whether it's carpet, is there an opportunity for you to kind of repurpose maybe some of your vinyl capacity into LVT? Thank you.","Chris Wellborn","The different assets manufacturers different products and so you can't relatively, can't easily switch them between one product category in another. Next question operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Michael Wood","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask the margin question in other way. I understand the pressures to 2Q year-over-year since you're still de-stocking, and there's a lot of price mix pressures, but in third quarter, you begin to lap some pretty major headwinds. You know that we're supposed to be temporary. I'm curious by third quarter, what are the major pressure points to margins? If you can, is there going to be lower productivity or higher, mix, negative mix, or cost pressures?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The problem we're having is you're asking for specific ongoing guidance, which we continue to say we giving the general piece of where it is. We think that we have a lot of actions in place to improve our position in the business. There's some questions about what will happen in the different environments, such as, depends on who you listen to the dollar strength could go up significantly, depending on somebody or could go the other way dramatically, depending on who you listen to. The oil price hit recent highs lately, it could be at $55, or it could be to $80, which impacts the prices. There's a lot of variables, which we don't know how to put into the specifics. And we don't want to lead you astray.","Michael Wood","Understood. Okay. And you talked about price being implemented across the product categories. Do you know yet whether or not they've been successful taken by the market and any quantification in terms of what that incremental benefit could be?","Jeff Lorberbaum","There are price increases and most products and most geographies that have been implemented on the prices are flowing into the business, which is helping the second quarter. Also, this increases in various prices you mentioned, Brazil. The gas prices have gone up astronomically. We have the same thing in Mexico as yet. So the pricing is covering -- in some cases, it's covering the changing pieces and other cases, it should help the margin, which is why the second quarter is going to be better.","Michael Wood","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The final question is from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew Bouley","Hi, thanks for taking my question. On the inflation side, Jeff, understanding it's not your business to predict commodities. But how does that oil price rebound kind of impact your thoughts around price increases, specifically, in carpet? You know, do you think that further price increases would be necessary, just kind of looking at where commodities are at this point? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","It's too early to tell. The price is highly volatile. It could drop significantly or stay the same or go up. In general, it takes anywhere from two to three, four months to pass through to our purchases. And that also changes depending on supply and demand dynamics of the various steps in between. So we're watching it and we'll have to see. The move has been recent. And we have no idea whether it's going to going to be maintained or if it's going to go up or down from here quickly. As if so our guests are no better than anybody else in the oil business and the chemical businesses as you go through.","With that, I'd like to make sure everybody understands that we're taking the actions to improve our results. We're confident that our new investments will give us the returns we want in time as we wrap them up. We're taking actions to improve the existing businesses. And we appreciate you joining us for the call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, April 27, 2018. Thank you.","I would now like to introduce Frank Boykin. Mr. Boykin, you may begin your conference.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Erin. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries' Quarterly Investors Conference Call. Today, we'll update you on the company's results for the first quarter of 2018 and provide guidance for the second quarter.","I would like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Jeff?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank.","In the first quarter, we generated sales of $2.4 billion, up 9% over the prior year, with our businesses outside the U.S. growing faster and their stronger currencies benefiting translation. For the period, our adjusted operating income was $292 million or 12.1% of sales. Our adjusted EPS was $3.01, an increase of 11%.","Mohawk is benefiting from its diverse geographic footprint and product portfolio. Our performance in the first quarter accentuated this strength, as we realized significant growth in LVT in our largest markets, and sales and profits grew strongly in our ceramic businesses outside the U.S.","We are leveraging our global organization's strength to initiate manufacturing in new markets and extend our development of innovative products. Our global decentralized structure enables us to simultaneously manage numerous internal investments, while also executing new acquisitions.","For the quarter, our operating income grew at a greater rate when adjusted for the loss of income from expired patents and higher start-up costs of new facilities and sales initiatives. In the first quarter, material and freight inflation increased more than we anticipated and impacted our costs. We are initiating selective pricing actions by product and region that, combined with improving mix and cost reductions, will offset expected inflation.","Throughout the rest of the year, we anticipate higher growth rates in all segments, as we introduce new products, add capacity, implement price increases and complete acquisitions. Many of our operations are currently initiating new production, including Mexican, Italian and Russian ceramic, U.S. and European premium laminate, U.S. and European LVT, Italian porcelain slabs and European carpet tile.","In addition, by the end of this year, we anticipate commencing production of quartz countertops in the U.S. and sheet vinyl in Russia, as well as expanding polyester carpet in the U.S.; ceramic in Poland; and laminate and ceramic wall tile in Russia. We anticipate finalizing the acquisition of Godfrey Hirst as early as the end of May, adding the largest flooring producer in Australia and New Zealand to our global portfolio.","To prepare for the integration, we are assessing the sales, product and raw material strategies of Mohawk and Godfrey Hirst in the markets to optimize revenue and profits.","Long term, our investments in new products and markets around the world will significantly enhance our profitability. Some of the projects will require significant onetime cost to start up the assets and build sales before higher utilization rates will deliver the margins and income we anticipate.","This contrasts with acquisitions such as Godfrey Hirst, but we are investing about $450 million and we'll see an immediate increase in our annual EPS of $0.35 to $0.40 per share.","In the U.S., strong job creation and continuing wage growth is supporting our ongoing economic expansion. A strong March retail report suggests that recent tax reductions are translating to increased consumer spending. The National Association of Home Builders reported that March housing starts rose 11% year-over-year. And the organization is predicting single family home growth escalating with higher construction.","Harvard's Joint Center for Housing study predicts stronger remodeling gains spurred by increased home values, low rates for home improvement loans and high consumer confidence. The American Institute of Architects' index remains positive, projecting higher nonresidential spending as reduced corporate taxes encourage new construction and renovation projects.","Outside the United States, continued economic growth is forecasted for the European Union as interest rates remain low. Business investment increases and employment improves. In Mexico, the economy was sluggish during the first quarter and is predicted to strengthen going forward. The Russian economy remains challenging amid political uncertainty.","Now, Chris Wellborn, our Chief Operating Officer, will review our first quarter performance by segment. Chris?","Christopher Wellborn","Thank you, Jeff. In the quarter, our Global Ceramic sales increased 12% as reported, with greater sales growth outside the U.S. First quarter sales sequentially improved and we anticipate increased growth throughout the balance of the year, supported by greater capacity and new product introductions.","We are implementing sales actions to increase our customer base and market share in both the residential and commercial sectors. Our two acquisitions in Italy and Poland are progressing as planned as we integrate their operations and expand their product offering.","Our North American ceramic business improved from the prior period as we introduced new products, increased promotional activities, and the home center channel improved. Our business is stronger in the Southern and Western U.S. for new home construction is expanding faster. Our home center customers are focusing more on ceramic and increasing product commitments to enhance their sales.","Increased sales in the builder and home center channels are impacting our overall product mix. As our distributors consolidated operations, they have made inventory adjustments that have temporarily reduced our sales. We are aggressively pursuing new commercial projects with retail hospitality and healthcare sectors the strongest.","In the U.S., LVT is being utilized more broadly and is impacting the industry growth rate of ceramic and other products. We are taking many actions to increase our ceramic share, including launching innovative slip resistant tile, introducing higher styled designs in all price points and marketing ceramic's durability and ease of care to consumers.","During the second quarter, we are leveraging our recently implemented systems to cut our overhead costs by $5 million on an annual basis. Our new service center and countertop distribution are ramping up and will enhance our results as sales increase.","Our countertop growth is increasing with quartz products taking share from natural stone. The building of our new quartz plant is nearing completion and equipment installation should begin this quarter. We are finalizing material formulations and designs to begin production at the end of this year.","We're also introducing porcelain slabs made by our Italian operations for countertops as well as offering large sizes for flooring and walls. Specifications for these products are increasing as designers are inspired by the beauty of natural stone in large sizes with the value and easy care of porcelain.","Our sales in Mexico grew during the period, significantly outpacing the ceramic market. The increased new capabilities of our Salamanca plant are allowing us to expand our customer base across Mexico and grow exports to Central and South America. We are introducing new higher-end collections on top of increasing our participation in medium and value-oriented price points.","Over time, our product mix will improve and expand our margins in Mexico. The European ceramic business continues to integrate our recent acquisitions in Italy and Poland. Our product mix is improving as we capture a larger share of the premium market. And our new product launches will increase our average price.","To grow our sales in the retail channel, we are adding about 100 Marazzi-branded shops within our leading customers this year. We're developing regional manufacturing strategies to optimize production, for transportation significantly impacts our costs.","Since completing the upgrade of our color body porcelain - color body manufacturing, sales of our higher-end commercial products are increasing. And we are expanding our specified sales-force to increase our participation in the new construction channel.","Our new porcelain slab production started in first quarter, providing industry leading visuals and performance features in sizes up to 5.5 by 11 feet. Building construction has commenced in Poland to install the production line that is being transferred from our Italian operations. It will be operational in the third quarter, so that we can expand our offering and better satisfy the Central European market.","In Bulgaria, we have upgraded equipment to produce 48-inch tiles giving us a competitive advantage in the market. The productivity of our European ceramic operations is improving and we have dramatically enhanced the safety performance of our plants. We are upgrading our warehouse management and transportation system to increase our efficiencies and lower our costs.","With the integration of our new businesses and consolidation of our systems, we reduce our overhead by $4 million by the end of the third quarter. We will complete the integration of all of our European ceramic systems by the end of 2019.","In Russia, our investments in product, distribution and branded retail stores along with enhancements of our organization and systems have created a significant competitive advantage. We continue to grow our leading market position in a challenging economic environment. At the recent Russian national tradeshow, we further expanded our high styled offerings, reinforcing our position as the design leader with the broadest array of sophisticated collections.","We're starting at new porcelain capacity this quarter, and by the end of the year we will convert part of our commodity flooring production to higher value wall tile to enhance our mix. In the first quarter, our Flooring North America sales were $950 million, increasing 1% with adjusted margin of 10%, including the startup for our new LVT line.","During the period, we implemented the carpet price increase, we announced last year. In the first period, our raw materials and freight cost escalated more than we had anticipated. We announced another carpet price increase of 6% to 7% to cover inflation, along with the freight increase and the industry has supported it. Bitterly cold weather disrupted the energy supply to some of our plants resulting in lower output and higher cost.","Our residential carpet sales increased during the quarter led by the retail replacement channel. Our SmartStrand Silk Reserve collection extends the success of the premium super soft carpet we pioneered, and our luxury Karastan line is accelerating from trendsetting designs and luxurious cashmere nylon introductions. We are gaining sales momentum with our proprietary Air.o unified soft flooring due to its luxurious feel, hypoallergenic properties and ease of installation.","Our patented Continuum polyester carpets are growing as a value alternative, and we are expanding our capacity late this year to satisfy higher demand. In mainstream commercial we have introduced a new carpet tile technology called ECO-MATRIX [ph], which is more versatile for installation on a variety of subfloors. These nylon and polyester products are styled to coordinate with our LVT collections.","Our commercial carpet sales during the period were impacted by the late construction dates and the substitution of LVT on projects. Projects bookings improved sequentially through the period and have continued to strengthen in April. We have realigned our commercial sales structure so that we can provide greater expertise with complete flooring solutions for each end use market. We are driving commercial design trends through complementary soft and hard surface collections that provide style and performance advantages.","The hospitality sector was our strongest channel and our Divinity collections are growing as an alternative to premium woven wool products. LVT sales continue to expand in both residential and commercial, to support our increasing manufacturing capabilities, we are expanding our collections of both flexible and rigid LVT. We are upgrading our original LVT manufacturing line to increase its output and product features.","The new rigid LVT production line, we'll be commissioning during the second quarter following the launch of identical line in Europe. We have begun training personnel, refining operational processes and developing new products for the market. Our new laminate production is working well and has unique capabilities to make products indistinguishable from natural wood with superior visuals and performance.","Our revolutionary RevWood Plus, a new water-proof wood product, is rapidly gaining acceptance with longer planks and contemporary finishes. Our investments in new technologies and automation are enhancing our service levels and cost structures.","By the end of the second quarter, we will cut administrative and indirect costs by a $20 million run rate. We continue to initiate hundreds of productivity projects to improve our efficiencies, quality and service due to limited common carrier capacity, we are purchasing additional trucks to expand our transportation fleet to provide higher levels of service.","During this quarter, our Flooring Rest of World segment performed extremely well, with sales growing 18% and adjusting - adjusted operating income up 19%. The European market continues to do well, and the operating income of our ongoing business is up substantially on a local basis. LVT is the fastest growing product in the segment even though sales were constrained by our capacity during the period. We are starting new LVT and laminate production in Belgium, and we are launching new carpet tile and rigid LVT products.","The price increases we implemented last fall are covering raw material increases from 2017, and we are selectively increasing prices to offset further inflation. Our mix, volume and pricing are increasing our margins in most categories. LVT in Europe is growing in acceptance, and we are the market leader.","Our new production line is operating five days a week, as we refine our manufacturing processes. The line is presently producing existing products to satisfy growing demand. Through testing, we've validated the capability of our new technology to manufacture rigid LVT with enhanced performance and innovative features. We anticipate introducing new products during the second quarter and ramping up production just seven days a week by the end of the third quarter. All the equipment and process enhancements are being replicated in the U.S. to shorten the startup process.","Our sheet vinyl assets in Europe are running at capacity, and we are seeing the Russian market to build demand for our new plant. The renovation of the building in Russia is progressing and equipment installation should be completed in the fourth quarter to initiate production. Our sales organization is collaborating with major Russian customers to develop new products and programs to utilize our new productions.","At our new carpet tile facility, we are running trials to establish operating procedures and refined new products. We're in the process of assembling and experience commercial sales force to expand our sales of LVT, sheet vinyl and carpet tile across Europe.","Our laminate business continues to perform well with our new product innovations improving our results. We lead the premium market in realistic design and water resistant products. Our new laminate press capacity is now operating, and we are introducing additional premium products to extend our market leadership.","In our Russian laminate plant, we are installing a new line that will double our capacity in the third quarter. We are developing new sales and warehousing strategies in Russia to optimize the distribution of our laminate and sheet vinyl production across the country.","Our wood panel sales are performing well as a result of investments that expanded capacity and improved our costs. Our insulation business is recovering as raw material supply increases and costs moderate. We anticipate insulation sales improving, as declining material cost allow us to be more competitive with other product alternatives as we progress through the year.","The Godfrey Hirst acquisition is progressing as we expected along with our other smaller acquisitions in the segment. Plans are being executed to integrate and optimize the performance of all these acquisitions.","I'll now turn the call over to Frank, who will cover our financial performance for the first quarter.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Chris. Net sales for the quarter were $2,412 million, growing 9% over last year, of which 4% was from currency and 2% from acquisitions. Our gross margin as reported 29.2% or 29.9% excluding charges with price, mix, productivity, currency and volume all offsetting inflation and lower IP. SG&A as reported was $436 million or 18.1% of sales, with 17.8% of sales excluding charges, which improved 40 basis points over last year. As we leverage our cost against higher sales and continued to control costs.","Unusual charges for the quarter were $23 million, and primarily related to plant consolidation and integration of acquisitions across all three segments. Our operating income excluding charges was $292 million, up 5% over last year with a margin of 12.1%. Price mix of $38 million and productivity of $31 million offset inflation of $52 million. Our operating income was up significantly when adjusted for incremental startup cost of $9 million, patents that expired in 2017 and higher depreciation from our increased investments.","The income tax rate improved to 20% from 25.6%, as the 2017 tax reform drove the overall rates down. We estimate our second quarter rate to be between 20% and 21%. Earnings per share excluding charges, was $3.01, an increase of 11% over last year.","Turning to the segments. The Global Ceramic Segment had sales of $877 million growing 12%, of which 6% was from acquisitions and 4% from currency. Our operating income, excluding charges, at $117 million with margin of 13.3%. Productivity of $14 million and volume of $11 million, offset $13 million of inflation and $7 million of price mix decline.","In the Flooring North American Segment, sales were $950 million compared to $939 million in 2017 with good growth in residential carpet and LVT. Our operating income excluding charges was $91 million compared to $94 million of operating income last year. Price mix of $14 million and productivity of $13 million, offset inflation of $25 million.","In the Flooring Rest of World Segment, sales were $585 million with solid growth of 18% over last year, 14% of the growth was attributable to currency gains. We had strong growth that continued in LVT as our leadership position in that category advantages us over our competitors.","Operating income excluding charges was $93 million and increased 19% over last year. Price mix of $31 million, currency of $6 million and productivity of $4 million, offset inflation of $14 million along with lower IP income. In the Corporate and Eliminations segment, the operating loss was $9 million, and we expect the segment loss to range between $35 million and $45 million for the full year.","Jumping to the balance sheet. Receivables ended the quarter to $1,690 million with days sales outstanding of 56 days. Inventories were $2,045 million with inventory days at 116 days, which improved over the fourth quarter. Inventory turns continue to be impacted by increasing inflation and our backwards integration.","Fixed assets ended quarter at $4,461 million. Our first quarter capital expenditures was $251 million with D&A of $123 million. We're estimating CapEx for 2018 of approximately $750 million with depreciation and amortization of about $525 million, which exceeds last year by $75 million. Long-term debt ended the quarter at $2.9 billion with leverage at 1.5 times debt-to-EBITDA.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Around the globe, we are starting up a number of large investments that will significantly enhance our long-term results by expanding existing sales, adding product categories and entering new markets. As anticipated this year, we'll have non-reoccurring reduction and operating income of $70 million to $75 million, comprised of $30 million to $35 million from higher startup costs, $40 million from patented expired in 2017. In 2018, incremental depreciation of $75 million will curtail our operating margins until our sales reach a level to fully absorb these investments.","Changes in the U.S. tax law will reduce our adjusted tax rate from 26% last year to an estimated 21% this year. Taking all of this into account our EPS guidance for the second quarter is $3.89 to $3.98, excluding any one-time charges.","During the balance of 2018, our sales growth should improve as we increase the use of our new production, introduce additional products and complete the acquisition of Godfrey Hirst. We estimate that Godfrey Hirst acquisition will close by the end of May and will increase revenue by $180 million and EPS by $0.25 per share this year.","In the third quarter, higher prices, mix and productivity should increase our adjusted operating income above last year, even with the lower margin. In the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating income and margin should exceed 2017, as the impact from startups and patent decline.","We are confident that our new investments will create significant opportunities, with potential to have equal or greater profitability than our present businesses. We are adding $500 million of LVT with huge growth potential; $400 million of new product categories or geographies, including countertops, sheet vinyl and carpet tile; and $500 million of new capacity in constrained areas including ceramic outside the United States, laminate with new capabilities and polyester carpet.","With the strength of our organization, we can execute additional acquisitions if appropriate risk and return can be achieved. The market is focused on the next two quarters, where we are absorbing material increases, startup and IT expiration. And overlooking the significant impact of our actions, we'll have on our sales and profitability in 2019 and beyond.","Our management, cash generation and balance sheet will enable us to continue our aggressive growth strategies. We'll now be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Wood from Nomura Instinet.","Michael Wood","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First question on ceramics, the price mix decline that you called out, how much of that was from the distribution and retail mix shift? And can you just give us some color as to whether or not that's temporary or does it bleed over into second quarter and beyond?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Our product mix declined in the U.S. due to higher sales in home centers and builders, as well as increasing promotions. We had incremental startup cost of $3 million from our new quartz plant. We're introducing higher styled products and reducing our annual fixed cost by $9 million. And sales and margins outside the U.S. are strong.","Michael Wood","But, yeah, can you just elaborate on whether or not that negative mix shift that you called out, is that a one quarter temporary issue or does it continue?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","It continues.","Michael Wood","Okay, got it. At a high level, looking at your guidance for second quarter, the earnings growth is lower than what you actually achieved in first quarter. Now, I would have thought we would have seen some headwinds start to fade like the UNILIN patent, startup cost. And you would have time for price recovery. So could you just give some color in terms of what's offsetting some of those headwinds that may be starting to fade in 2Q that's limiting that earnings growth?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Your assumptions that they are fading are wrong. The IP continues as a big decline. The startup costs grow in the second quarter. And what else - and the material inflation is getting impacted. And we've hardly - and we haven't got any price increase at all. And we won't start getting price increase till the end of the second quarter and then into the third quarter.","Michael Wood","Okay, that's very helpful color. Thank you.","Frank Boykin","The other thing I would point out to there, remember we got incremental depreciation of $75 million this year spread across all four quarters.","Operator","Our second question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan.","Frank Boykin","Hello.","Operator","You may go ahead with your question.","Frank Boykin","Maybe we should go to the\u2026","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Got to the next one.","Frank Boykin","Let's go to the next one.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley from Barclays.","Matthew Bouley","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on Jeff, what you kind of quantified at the end of your prepared remarks. You've separated out some of the capacity that's currently initiating production and ramping, and then the several areas that are set to commence. And it sounded like you quantified $1.3 billion across some of the new capacity.","So are you able to just kind of separate out, where you are on the utilization of the plants you have that are currently ramping, as well as the outlook for the timing of that new capacity that you've mentioned will be opening during this year? Thank you.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","The problem is there are about 20 different activities going on. The activities range from starting up new plants that was never operated before and have no sales which will take long periods of time to get them ramped up. It could be sheet vinyl in Russia or carpet tile in Europe. And those are startup projects from ground up, with no sales and marketing to begin with. And then we have other projects that we have significant sales already that will be added to, those will come up different.","And then you have no new plants such as quartz countertops. We haven't manufactured before, but we've assembled experts from around the world. We have LVT product lines that haven't been run before, they're starting up. So I mean trying to get down to a month by month and quarter by quarter doesn't really make any sense.","Matthew Bouley","Understood, that's helpful. So, I guess, on the new LVT line specifically and, obviously, you've highlighted that LVT is taking share across categories here including ceramic in the U.S. Are you able to kind of outline how your margin profile differs between the U.S. ceramic business and the U.S. or the new lines on the U.S. LVT business? Just trying to think about how that margin profile will shift as you do ramp on these new facilities here. Thank you.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","In the remarks, we were trying to say that our expectations for the total of all these should be equal or greater than our business average in the margins and profitability. And they're going to be different from one to the other, as well as what part - where they are within the startup strategy over time.","Matthew Bouley","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good morning.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Good morning.","Susan Maklari","The first question is around, you made a comment in your opening remarks on some efforts to increase your customer base in Global Ceramic. Can you just give us a little bit more color there on what you're doing in any specific geographies within that?","Christopher Wellborn","Well, we're doing things in all geographies. We're introducing new slip-resistant tiles and large sized commercial projects. We're expanding our builder and commercial distribution. We're increasing our sales in home centers in Mexico and South America. We're ramping up new tile and stone centers. And we will soon begin manufacturing quartz countertops with the opportunity to become a leader in the category.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Thank you. And then second question is just on the productivity. It sounds like you're off to a pretty decent start there. Any updates on that as we're now past the first quarter how we should be thinking about it for the year?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I think we said the last time that the productivity would approximate 140 and with some of the niche - the new initiatives, we're thinking it's going to be a little higher, but some of the benefits that you don't all get in this year.","Susan Maklari","Okay. So still around 140 for this year, but potentially higher as we exit the year. Is that how we should think about it?","Frank Boykin","I think it will be for the full year a little bit higher than the 140, and then we'll have some projects like Jeff was saying that start this year. And then you get part of the benefit this year and part of the benefit next year.","Susan Maklari","All right, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. The $52 million you gave on inflation impact for the quarter. I just want to confirm that includes transportation costs. And do you expect a similar number for the next quarter or two, based on where\u2026","Christopher Wellborn","The inflation does include transportation. And inflation is a moving target and it's hard to say what the number is going to be as we look down the road. And it's\u2026","Keith Hughes","Okay. And\u2026","Christopher Wellborn","Any kind of estimate we got is - any kind of guess we got that is built into our estimates right now.","Keith Hughes","Okay. And on the negative price mix and ceramic that you listed out, can you break down how much of that was price, how much of that was mix? Hello.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","No.","Keith Hughes","Hello.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We don't have that, because the introductions of our different products in different categories, it's difficult to separate it into specific things and the estimates become so large it doesn't make sense to try to separate it.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Is that something that - I know you talked pretty possibly in the release about the new introductions that are going to be coming in, the new capacity coming in. That seems like that's something that would turn around given the history of ceramics. Is that your view for the year?","Christopher Wellborn","Yeah, what we have is LVT is impacting our business in North America. And we also had the higher freight and startup costs. Our ceramic business grew in all regions. And in North America, we increased our share in that new home construction and home centers. We're launching new products and reducing our costs, which will improve our margins going forward.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We were trying to get across in the statements that when we put out introductions, we know the margins of those relative to our average. So our - the average into - the introductions are at higher points, which we assume as we push those in the marketplace will help offset part of it.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Wells Fargo.","Stephen East","Thank you, and good morning, guys. Just to follow up on the raw materials. Frank, could you maybe rank order which raw materials where you're seeing the biggest impact including transportation if that's a big one? And then, as you look at - are you seeing some ongoing escalation of any of those or do you think the pricing that you're putting through now is going to cover what you see as you move through the year?","Frank Boykin","Let's see if I can sort of get you directionally. The chemical costs are the biggest parts in the materials and the ones that use chemicals to go into them would have the highest one, which are carpet and vinyl. Now, it doesn't mean that the other ones aren't there. But those have much higher percentages of chemicals then, let's say laminate, which just the top is affected. And in the freight rates, the United States - it's the freight rates in the United States, there are all kinds of things going on with the transportation, because capacity was tight to begin with.","The regulations that they put through reduce the capacity even further, with the regulatory changes. And with that we're also investing more in our own trucking fleet to take a higher percentage of it with all those going on.","Stephen East","Okay. All right, that's helpful to me. And then, if you look at your ceramic in North America, you gave a lot of examples of what was driving your business. Your core sales were up 2% and 1%. Where are you seeing the offsets in your business that you probably need to redouble your efforts on those two categories?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Well, again, LVT is taking a portion of the market. And what we've done is increased our share of the new home construction and home center business. The biggest impact right now is in the re-modeling business in the retail stores, but it's growing - I don't know - it's growing in all the parts.","The good news is that we have huge capacities coming on. We're introducing new products to participate in the LVT. And we'll maintain or grow our shares in the other categories.","Stephen East","Okay. So retail is where you think you're seeing the biggest. I wouldn't call it disruption, but\u2026","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I don't want to - it also goes into all kinds of commercial installations. I mean. LVT in the United States is not like any other part of the world. It's probably approaching almost 15% of the industry. And we haven't seen anything do this since carpet in the 60s.","Stephen East","Okay, all right. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh from Stifel.","John Baugh","Thank you. Good morning. I wondered about the comment that ceramic improved in the first quarter sequentially. Was that a March quarter to December quarter comment or was that January through March as well?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","The comment was from fourth quarter last year compared to first quarter, the rate of growth improved.","John Baugh","Okay. And then - and this is a question that maybe is U.S. focused, and not just ceramic, but overall. We heard about a tough start to the year in January and February. But we've heard that business in general has picked up in March and April in the U.S. again. Have you seen that yourselves, any color there and Chris you walk through a whole bunch of things, you're doing in ceramic domestically, and of course, there was some noise last year with the home centers. I'm just curious, if you can give any color, I don't know, on the progression you see in U.S. ceramic sales as we go through 2018 and\/or into 2019? Thank you.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I would say also that the first part of the year, when it started, it started off a little slower than we had expected. But we're presently still with the same estimate of 3% to 4% growth for the industry for this year is our best estimate at this time.","Christopher Wellborn","Yeah, I'd also add besides just the impact from LVT that we're doing a lot of new things in the U.S. with this slip resistant products, with the quartz coming on, so we have a lot of areas where we can grow our business.","John Baugh","Great. Thank you and good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies.","Philip Ng","Hey, guys. As we look at 2019, appreciating that your IP earnings and the headwind from the startup costs should start reversing. Can you talk about how you're positioned on a productivity standpoint? And you get back each on track to delivering the type of operating leverage we've seen in your business in the past?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","What you should see is, as you said, the IP changes should be behind us. The startup costs, we haven't put a plan together for next year, so I can't tell you what it's going to be. But the startup costs should be down with $35 million more this year than we were last year, and last year was probably the highest on record. So we would expect it to come down assuming we don't come up with more new projects, but I don't know that yet.","The same time this year not in the startup costs, is that once the plant gets turned on and turned over to the operational group. You get 100% of the depreciation even though you're running at limited amount. So as that ramps up, the cost will fall and allow us to expand the margins going forward, and all of those things will start happening next year and we should get a significant jump in all the pieces.","Philip Ng","Okay. That's helpful. And then Jeff, I think last call you mentioned, you're seeing good operating and deploy your capital internally and M&A. But given the big pullback in your stock here, can give us a sense how you're thinking about that? And we would certainly agree with the market being a little more too focused about some of the near-term headwinds you're seeing? Thanks.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We believe that our business isn't doing really well. We are - our cash flow is significant, and we believe that - you can see this year, we've announced acquisitions, we've announced significant spending on capital. And by the time, we get to the end of the year we hope to find more new projects for the future. There's always companies who want to sell. The question is not if there's companies wanting to sell. The question is can we find the right valuations, and we have the right things, we can do to help it. So we get the returns on it.","As we go forward, we still have the capability of our management to execute multiple acquisitions at the same time, and we're always looking. And we don't see any limitations in our ability to continue growing our business and all the categories. And at the same time, you see as this year we're doing more Greenfield operations, and I would consider more of them in the future in addition, if all of things come together and we can find the right investments. At some point, we would be quite comfortable buying our own stock back.","Philip Ng","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Rednor from Zelman Associates.","Scott Rednor","Hi, good morning. Jeff, in the Rest of the World business it's very hard for us to see kind of what the underlying growth rates are just given the patent headwind and various other things. It sounds like in Europe, the LVT markets growing double digits. Do you guys think, you're getting your fair share of that in the international scheme?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","LVT is really primarily a U.S. business, and it's starting - in Europe, it's probably three, four years behind could be more. Out of that, we have the largest participation in it and we intend to grow the most in it, we believe that our strategy unlike others, of having low-cost, high-volume capacity gives us competitive advantages in both marketplaces and with best position in Europe than anybody.","Scott Rednor","So I guess more broadly recognizing that you went through the shift from soft surface to hard surface prior to last housing cycle and margins today are significantly higher. I think you alluded to this as the largest shift from - towards LVT from other products. How do you leave investors confident that you can leverage your current assets to continue to drive margins higher over the next three to five years?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","So - at the moment, it's a U.S. question, because you don't have the same growth in LVT. But to start with, we have over $ 1 billion, we'll get through not long of LVT capacity. And as the market will absorb it, we'll keep growing the capacity further. So we're well positioned and where it's going. In the existing assets and businesses, I think that we have the premium positions in the categories. We have low cost market, but production assets. And whatever the competition is going to be, we're going to get our fair share or more.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Loop Capital Markets.","Laura Champine","Good morning. So you mentioned that LVT is growing very rapidly to 15% of the industry. And my question is, whether or not you see that once your capacity is fully ramped out, what you've got planned anyway. Do you think that your Flooring North America Segment will also be 50% or more devoted to LVT? Or will you still under index here?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Listen, I'd like to have more, is it. There is no constraints on our ability to expand capacity. So it takes - now with where we are, probably it takes a little over a year to execute it. So we'll go for four, five months, and see what happens. And if we see we're going to be able to grow up further, there's nothing that's stopping us from keep going on capacity in the United States.","Laura Champine","But more directly, Jeff, once you're fully ramped on all the LVT capacity, you've got planned approximately what percent of your total North American Flooring capacity will that represent?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I don't know that off the top of my head. I don't even know my present North American capacity is off the top of my head with all these businesses. It will be - I would guess it's still going to be less than our market share of everything else of the average. We have much higher market shares in the other pieces, is it.","Now, what's happened is we made a conscious decision to hold up going after the marketplace as aggressively. Our sourcing some, but almost everybody else is sourcing almost everything they're buying from China. So we made a decision to put in capacity and we didn't want to spend all the marketing cost and then throw it out six, nine months later. So it's held us up a little bit from being as far along as we would like.","But I believe that we're going to be the best position in the marketplace, when we get through, and we'll keep growing it as the market will accept it.","Laura Champine","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America.","John Lovallo","Hey, guys, thank you for taking my questions. The first one is, you mentioned that most of the - or a lot of the raw material inflation is in carpet and vinyl. Just curious, are there opportunities in your recycling business to step up that to be a bigger positive impact.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We're running all of our recycling pieces that capacity, so it's hard to push much more through it. We have announced to put an investment in this year that will be running the end of the year to increase our recycling and extrusion capacity relative to that, we'll be running in, and I don't know if it's the third or fourth quarter, is it. So we're expanding it, but we're utilizing all that we have presented.","John Lovallo","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess the follow up would be can you just remind us what freight is as a percentage of your COGS in North America?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Anybody know the answer?","Frank Boykin","Low to mid-single digits as a percent.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","The problem is, it's really different based on product and pieces you go through, so I don't really know what the number is off the top of my head.","Frank Boykin","And I think that percentages is not a cost of goods, but of sales I just gave you there.","John Lovallo","Low-single-digit?","Frank Boykin","Yeah. Low to mid.","John Lovallo","Low to mid. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","But it's different by products ceramics higher than others. Carpet is - you go into different distribution channels, they pick it up and we don't have anything to do with it. So everyone is different.","John Lovallo","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird.","Timothy Wojs","Hey, guys, good morning. Maybe just a following up on that last question. Frank, I guess, specifically in ceramic, when you think about freight. Is there an ability to put through any sort of freight surcharges? Or have you done that? I'm curious just how you can maybe offset some of that inflation on the freight side?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We already do that. We have surcharges on it that we move up and down with the freight costs trying to recover it, as we go through. But it depends on the market conditions and where you are. Sometimes, we recover all, and sometimes, we recover less.","Timothy Wojs","Do you feel like you're recovering more of it today?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","It depends by product category and region. I have to give you different answers. It depends on the competitive situation in each product, in each market of where it's going. But we try to recover all of it back. In some cases, we can get more and in some cases we get less, and we hope it all works out.","Timothy Wojs","Okay. Fair enough. And then just maybe in carpet, have you guys seen any changing competitive dynamics at all just within the carpet business. I know, you guys have put through a fair amount of pricing offset raw materials. So just any sort of resistance from customers or anything like that, any color there would be helpful.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I haven't met a customer yet that likes to pay more for anything. What happened to it all, but we're trying to align the raw materials with our cost better and the increases. So we started in the fourth quarter, we saw it coming. But we underestimated dramatically what was going to happen. We announced an increase, the rest of the industry followed. We got into the first quarter and we saw getting worse. We announced another increase, the industry followed. So we're all acting rationally.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of the David MacGregor from Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning, everyone. Just to pick-up on the discussion on LVT. I guess, as you ramp the LVT plants, how much more profitable is the manufactured product versus the sourced product?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We aren't really looking at - we weren't able to compete with sourced products. And - we're using sourced to either give us products that are slightly different from where we are once we get it up or to act as buffers as the business changes, and we need more capacity as we go through. We made a conscious choice, as I said before, we're lagging the industry a little bit, we started from a low base. And we're lagging, because we postponed the aggressive introductions. But starting about last - the end of last year, we're moving into every market and every product category as fast as we can go to use up all this capacity that we're putting in.","David MacGregor","Right. But as you bring up that manufacturing capacity, you substitute that out for the sourced product, the unit margin should be up. Shouldn't it? Is that 20%, 30% lift? I'm just trying to get a sense of what that might be?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I don't know. We're not going to get that granular detail I can just tell you that we can be competitive with whatever we need to be.","David MacGregor","Okay. Is that - the second line, it becomes more fully ramped, how will you mix between residential and commercial?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I'm not sure, we're starting out with a preconceived idea. The - typically, commercial is lower run sizes and lower units. But higher margins in the residential is higher volume at lower margins. And then you have with the product category, rigid LVT, which is what the new plan is going to do, is growing at the top end, and it's a limited portion of the commercial business. So we'll just have to manage the assets to whatever the customers want.","Our new facilities will make any other product types that customers desire, and we'll just balance it between them as they go forward and we'll optimize - once we\u2013 if we ever get - if we get to a point where we're constrained. We hope to either put more in, or we'll manage the mix based on what makes the most sense for our business and operations.","David MacGregor","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard","Hi. Two questions for you. First of all on the U.S. ceramic business, last quarter you talked about, I think, North America was down but improved through the quarter. Could you just give us perspective on the U.S. ceramic growth rate in the quarter, and how it performed in the quarter?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Well, we improved our growth rate in the quarter as we took more business in new home construction and home centers.","Frank Boykin","So it improved as we went through the quarter.","Eric Bosshard","Is it still down? Or is the business now growing in total here on a year-over-year basis?","Frank Boykin","The business is up. It's not up as much as I'd like it to be, though.","Eric Bosshard","Okay.","Christopher Wellborn","Our ceramic business grew in all regions.","Eric Bosshard","Okay, great. Thank you, Chris. The - secondly on - Jeff in terms of the LVT business, I'm curious your thoughts on how the category is evolving in two areas: one in terms of the changing designs of the product; and then secondly the import capacity that's been added. I'm curious how you view those two dynamics influencing the LVT effort of yours in the U.S.?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","You have to start from that up to now, the category is growing so rapidly, I mean, it's absorbing anything and everything, is it. There's more capacity coming on in China to support it, which is where most of its coming. As you'd expect, as things mature, the prices are getting a little lower in some cases depending upon the product category. And the designing, everybody keeps coming up with different designs to do differently.","And in anything that's in this stage you have a lot of innovation going on both in materials, product types, designing across the board, and it's all part of the maturing process. The question is, how big - as the base gets bigger, what rates are going to grow and when is it going to peak out, and I have no idea.","Eric Bosshard","Related to that, as you think about your opportunity the capacity you're adding, will there be a third and a fourth U.S. facility, and when would that happen? How do you think about, I know you commented on this earlier, but how do you think about the timing and opportunity in regards to that?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Depending upon what we see over the next three to six months, we could make a decision to put more in.","Eric Bosshard","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of the Alvaro Lacayo from Gabelli.","Alvaro Lacayo","Good morning. I just have a question regarding the pricing actions that have already been taken. If you could maybe comment on just price realization and has it met expectations? And maybe if you could provide some conjecture in terms of product categories, where you're seeing better realization than others? And then on the comment regarding industry rationalization everybody increasing price would that include product that's being imported and how does that impact your ability to realize price going forward?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","So the major part of the price increases, we've been talking about is around carpet, which has had the biggest impact. And the carpet price increases, we've announced the increase and they're going up. We hope to have most of them in place in the third quarter to help offsetting - offset it. The price increases in vinyl with the increase in the LVT that's going on and the capacities that are coming in, there's a reduction in price rather than increase going on in pricing in it.","Alvaro Lacayo","Thank you. And then with regards just to the capacity that's coming online this year, I mean, over the last year that $1.4 billion has been the number that you guys have talked about, and it seems like most of that capacity will be coming online at some point during this year. It also seems like you're interested in continuing high levels of capital expenditures. But I'm just wondering with all this capacity that's coming online now, what are the CapEx plans beyond 2018, considering that at this point you're probably have some time to go before you could absorb demand with all the new capacity that's coming online.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","If I had to give you my best guess now, which is it has no value, is that I would assume that the capital expenditures would decline next year, because we won't need all this new capacity, unless we can come up with new projects, new greenfield things. And at the same time, when we do acquisitions, when we buy the business, typically we try to figure out ways to make them better than they were before we got them.","And it's not unusual to significantly invest in either upgrading the assets or putting them into new product innovations or pieces, so it's not unusual that we buy something. We'll put $50 million in it without even thinking to help it get to the next start. So it all depends on all those things as we go through it.","Alvaro Lacayo","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good afternoon now. Thanks for taking my question, and sorry about the earlier phone issues.","I wanted to circle back and maybe ask the CapEx question from a different perspective. If you look back at the last cycle, your Cap Ex as a percent of sales was pretty consistent around a 2% to 3% of sales type of average. And obviously, in the last five years it's been more in the high single digits as a percentage of sales.","So kind of asked a different way and understand that, obviously, there's a lot of capacity expansion investment in the acquisitions and so forth. But from an industry structure standpoint, I was just curious if there's anything that's kind of changed in the industry or the way that you have to be competitive within the industry that requires a higher level of capital investment.","Jeff, you just said that you would expect Cap Ex to maybe decline next year. But would it still be in something of a mid-single-digit percent of sales range, because it certainly appears very different than the last cycle in terms of the level of required investment.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Let's see the best way to try to answer it. Our assets are among the best in the industry in every category. We have low cost high efficient assets. And we're constantly looking to improve them from there to stay at the leading front business. Anything that we can do that makes economic sense, which gives us returns and paybacks, that meet our expectations, we will put on and continue doing, because we have the capital to do it. And it will enhance our performance both short-term and long-term.","At the same time, we have a huge organization that can take on a lot of things. And if we can find new products such as quartz countertops in United States, such as sheet vinyl in Russia, such as carpet tile in Europe, I mean we're building new businesses from scratch as you go through. And I know sometimes from the outside it's a little uncomfortable, because you guys would like it predictable by quarter. These things that have our startups, you find things that happen good and bad. And you can't exactly get them.","The customers aren't sitting there, waiting on you to show up. And you have to give them reasons and build relationships to do it.","Now, in the long-term these things over five years will be much higher returns than anything I can do other than my internal investments that I turn on and start up almost immediately. So to answer the question is we have a huge cash flow that's growing. We have an organization that's creative and executes well. And if we can continue doing these things, these are what is going to allow us to grow our earnings and our share value higher than the market over time.","And they all come back to return on investment and risk. And I don't know how to give you specifics. And the answer is, if we can find those opportunities and it makes sense and they have reasonable risks, we're going to use our capital to do them. And they will give you higher returns to me giving the money back to you.","Michael Rehaut","Understood. And, again, we're just coming - I understand all the rationale behind the investment. But I was just curious from a - I guess from another angle, from a structural angle so. But I appreciate that, Jeff. That's helpful.","I guess, secondly, just drilling down a little bit on the Global Ceramics segment, you highlighted that some of the year-over-year margin decline driven by a mix - increased mix towards home centers and builders. But just to focus on the home centers or kind of a two part. Number one, if you can give us a sense of how much mix accounted for the 150 bps year-over-year drop in margins.","And in terms of the home centers, higher sales for the home centers for the ceramic business, if that's something that we should expect to continue over the next one to two years, I think for a long time you've talked about, if I recall correctly, being a little under indexed to that distribution channel, just any thoughts around that.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Let's see if I can get close to you. If the industry growth slows down, we have to go take share in the pieces that are growing the most. The builder channel has the most growth in it. And then, we're going to be more aggressive in all the pieces.","Now, in - in the typically the specialty channel uses higher value stuff that's more differentiated, that's prettier than the other channels. So if we're selling more into the other channels it affects our product mix as we go through, as if. We manage the business based on utilizing the assets. And at the same time, we have to balance it with our margins, as if.","I don't know if you know. When we go into recessions we change strategies and we start selling much lower value products. We go in and start taking in ceramic. I don't know if you know, about 50% or more of the industry is imported. So when things slow down, we go after the things where they make a home in it. And that's just to use the capacity and as we come out, we change the mix again.","So we're just in this part where we anticipate it and growing more the whole industry, that LVT is taking it. And we're now readjusting our strategies to get more of what's left.","Christopher Wellborn","The other thing, Michael, I would add is that while LVT is impacting it in the U.S., when you get to markets like Mexico, where we're growing fast, Russia where we're growing fast, and even in Europe we've been able to improve our product mix, so the ceramic sector is a global business with a lot of levers.","Michael Rehaut","And the impact on the mix, on the margin for the quarter?","Frank Boykin","Yeah, I think I had mentioned it earlier. It's about $7 million.","Michael Rehaut","Right, so that's true. Thanks. Sorry about that. Great, thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim","Yeah, thanks very much, guys. I appreciate it. I just wanted to revisit the $1.4 billion number, Jeff, that you talked about. I mean, a year ago you were talking about a sales opportunity at $1.4 billion from planned capacity additions. At that point, it was off of the base of 2016 rev. Now, even though you're a bigger company than you were - have more sales than you had then, it sounds like you're still looking for another $1.4 billion in potential sales.","Just want to confirm that this $1.4 billion is growth over what your annualized run rate of sales is right now. And also, if you didn't have all these capacity additions planned, do you still think you'd be able to grow sales 1% or 2% per year anyway even without those expansions?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I think what you're asking is, there's two parts. One is that the reason it is hard to talk about capacity is it's a moving target. So if you go back a year ago, I was putting in - a year ago we were ramping up a ceramic plant in the United States. That was in the number a year ago. And now this year that's off the list. The plant is running pretty good and that one has dropped off and something new has come on. So that number happens to be the same as a random event, as if.","Stephen Kim","Yeah.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","If I can tell you. Second from that is, in the growth of the business all of this is - as you were right, all of this isn't going to be incremental. And at all points in time we have businesses increasing sales, business decreasing sales. And you have profits going up and down. So it's - 100% of this isn't going to fall to the bottom line but major parts of it are, as if.","I mean, if you take the thing and just take our average EBITDA 20% times 1.5, you got $300 million of EBITDA if it all fell to the bottom. I'm not telling you it's all going to fall to the bottom. But the numbers are so big. I mean, I don't think the group is focusing on the opportunities that we're investing in. And if you look at it, the $1.4 billion - don't hold me to this. I think it might put it, just the incremental in capacity we're adding might be equal to with the top five or six flooring producers in the world.","Stephen Kim","Yeah. All right, I appreciate that. The second question I had related to the rest of world business, we saw kind of a noticeable slowdown in volume growth in 1Q. You had made some comments about laminate capacity sort of running full out. I was curious whether or not there was a particular thing you could highlight as to maybe why the volume growth was little slower this quarter.","And in particular, it looks like if it was sort of a - if this run rate kind of thing continues, it looks like we might expect over tougher comps, maybe a negative volume number in rest of world volume. I just want to make sure that we understand that properly.","Christopher Wellborn","I can answer that. So our ongoing business had good growth with LVT and wood panels performing the best. Our LVT was constrained in the period and the new production will increase sales and add new products. Our investments in laminate, carpet tile, sheet vinyl will further enhance the business. So we have a lot of things that's going to improve it going forward.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","And then the Godfrey Hirst acquisition is going to go under there also, as if.","Stephen Kim","Sure, sure. Yeah, I will talk about volume executing Godfrey Hirst. So, Chris, it would be your expectation that some of the things you just mentioned should elevate 2Q volumes.","Christopher Wellborn","Well, I don't know exactly by quarter. But I can tell you that the capacity we're adding in LVT is coming up, plus later on in the year we'll have these investments in laminate, carpet tile, sheet vinyl, all things that should increase the sales of the business over time.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","And so, we don't think as narrow as you guys by month, as if. These things, you start setting them up and putting them in. I mean, it may be two or three months longer or it might be two or three months shorter than our plans. That's just part of the deal.","Stephen Kim","Yeah. All right, I appreciate that, guys. Thanks very much.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Thank you.","Christopher Wellborn","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call back over to Frank Boykin.","Frank Boykin","Listen, we appreciate you guys joining us. We are excited about our opportunities. We believe we're doing the right thing for the long term of the business as well as the short term. And we think in long term, we're going to have a much stronger business. Have a good day."],"14982":["Mohawk Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MHK) Q2 2018 Earnings Call July 26, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Frank H. Boykin - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Jeffrey S.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mohawk Industries First Quarter (sic) [Second Quarter] 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.

Mr. Boykin, you may begin your conference.","Frank H. Boykin - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries second quarterly investor conference call. Today, we'll update you on the company's results for the second quarter of 2018 and provide guidance for the third quarter. I would like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Thank you, Frank. In the second quarter, we generated sales of $2.6 billion, up 5% compared to the prior year. For the period, our adjusted operating income was $343 million, or 13.3% of sales with an adjusted EPS of $3.51. Our second quarter results fell short of our expectations and we are taking actions to improve the performance of our U.S. businesses.","With the overall economy, our results were negatively impacted by input inflation, higher transportation costs, a stronger dollar and a tight labor market. We were also affected by changing product mix, timing of price increases, lower production units, startup of new projects and the delayed Godfrey Hirst closing. We are raising prices, expanding and growing channels and participating in new products and geographies.","Our businesses outside North America showed significant improvement and our results improved more without startup costs and expired patents. Although the economy in Europe slowed somewhat, the results in most of our non-U.S. businesses improved substantially with LVT, Russian ceramic, wood panels and insulation leading the growth.","As the dollar strengthened in the period, the euro fell from $1.24 to $1.16, reducing our translated results in U.S. dollars. Our company and industry are absorbing significant inflation. In the U.S., rising material costs had the greatest impact on our carpet business. This year, we've had two carpet price increases and recently followed with a third increase to offset additional material and freight inflation. We are taking pricing actions in most product categories impacting inflation, including our higher-value ceramic products.","The cost increases have come at a faster rate than we are passing through to our customers, which is impacting our results. These price increases occur in every cycle and we are managing our business strategies by product and geography to offset. We've also increased freight charges to mitigate higher transportation from increasing fuel, labor and common carrier costs.","We've expanded our fleet of trucks and trailers to improve service to our customers and better control our costs. We have become more active in the value price points and promotions, which is increasing our residential, new construction and commercial sales and reducing our pricing and mix. In addition to pricing actions, we're introducing new product innovations, implementing process improvements to enhance our competitive position and service levels.","During the period, our U.S. LVT sales growth was limited by capacity constraints. To expand sales faster this fall, we are ramping up our new manufacturing and have secured more LVT from outside sources as LVT continues gaining market share.","In Europe, we are the premier provider of LVT with leading style, brand, value and service. Our new European LVT line is operating as anticipated, producing existing flexible products and new rigid LVT that we are preparing to launch. Our expertise in LVT will establish a similarly strong position in the United States.","During the quarter, our new expansion projects had startup expenses of $15 million as we continued investing to broaden our product offering and geographic penetration. The costs for projects that have started up will decline, while expenses for new projects will begin.","In LVT, we are commencing production of rigid products on new production lines in both the U.S. and Europe. We're starting up new ceramic capacity in Russia to alleviate constraints and adding capacity to Poland to grow our ceramic presence in the Northern and Central Europe.","In the U.S., Europe and Russia, we're initiating new laminate production that provides the next generation of visuals, performance and water resistance. We're constructing a quartz countertop plant in Tennessee to more fully participate in the growing $1.2 billion U.S. quartz countertop market.","In Europe, we've started a new carpet tile plant and are establishing a commercial sales force. As the Russian economy improves, we're constructing a sheet vinyl plant to add another flooring category to complement the success that we've had in ceramic and laminate.","The Godfrey Hirst acquisition provides a robust platform to create a total flooring presence in Australia\/New Zealand just as we have in the United States. These investments will enhance our sales and profitability with most of the impact occurring in 2019 and beyond.","Chris Wellborn has laryngitis, and I will review the segments. He will try to answer questions at the end, if his voice is strong enough.","For the quarter, our Global Ceramic sales increased about 3% as reported to $929 million. Adjusted operating income for the segment was approximately $140 million or 15.1% of sales. We expect our sales initiatives in the U.S. to expand our customer base in the faster-growing builder and commercial channels in the third quarter.","Across the segment, we are leveraging our leading technology and design to deliver larger sizes, creative shapes, unique visuals and performance, enhancing features to generate greater demand. During the period, our North American ceramic volume improved with our average price weakening from growth in lower-value products and channels. To offset inflation, we're implementing increases on higher-value products, energy surcharges and freight. During the period, we increased our relationships with regional and national builders, expanded our statement ceramic boutiques and secured additional commercial projects.","To increase our share in the ceramic market, we're delivering innovative products, enhancing our service and increasing participation in homebuilder, home center builder and commercial channels. We're reemphasizing ceramic's timeless beauty, performance and enduring value in our communications and advertising. We continue to invest in product innovation, including new plank sizes, three-dimensional wall tiles and decorative tiles that appear handcrafted. We've improved our administrative efficiency, consolidated regional service centers and piloted mobile platforms to make it easier, more seamless for customers to conduct business with us.","To better serve the Florida market, we've opened a new distribution center to provide overnight service and enhance our share. The strength of our manufacturing capabilities, product development, brands and distribution uniquely position us in the marketplace.","The countertop growth is accelerating, led by sales of our quartz products. We are leveraging our ceramic relationships with builders, developers and national accounts to expand our business. Construction on our quartz plant in Tennessee is on schedule with equipment installation and product development underway for production to begin the end of this year. Our porcelain countertop program is expanding with the growth of our slabs and custom-size programs. We've opened additional countertop centers to further our growth of the quartz, porcelain and stone slabs.","In Mexico, our sales increased as the quarter progressed, outpacing the market, which declined before the national elections. We've doubled the production in our Salamanca plant and introduced larger sizes to the market. We're extending our presence in home centers, increasing our distributor base, capturing more commercial opportunities. We're updating our distributor showrooms by highlighting our differentiated products to expand our presence. Our Central and South American sales are growing steadily with new distributors in a dozen countries.","European ceramic sales slowed slightly with the economy and the impact of foreign exchange rates, while our margins increased from improved price and mix and higher productivity. The modernization of our Italian plants has improved our efficiency and design capabilities. We're introducing new collections to enhance our residential mid-price offerings and expanding our porcelain slab options. We've completed 48 branded tile shops within our customers' stores. We're expanding product training and enhancing our commercial specifications. As we expand our Polish factory, we're preparing to realign our product manufacturing between our European plants to optimize our assets and improve our offering. We are progressing with the integration of our Italian and Polish acquisitions as we enhance productivity and consolidate administrative product development, sales strategies. We're introducing higher-value larger sizes in our Bulgarian operations, which is enhancing our mix and increasing sales in adjacent countries.","Our Russian ceramic sales and margins remained strong. We are the leader in the market with the strongest product offering and manufacturing assets, supported by a national distribution center and a network of retail stores. To support future growth, we're expanding our porcelain floor and wall tile capacity. Material, energy and transportation inflation has increased in Russia and will impact our income growth in the short term.","In the second quarter, Flooring North America segment sales were approximately $1.1 billion, increasing about 2% with an adjusted margin of 10.4%, including startup costs of $5 million. During the period, we began executing our second carpet price increase of 2018 to cover inflation. The realization of our price increases was later and our product mix declined more than we had anticipated. Our raw materials and freight continued to escalate and we announced another price increase to recover.","In the second quarter, volumes did not increase as we anticipated and we produced less than we sold to reduce inventory. Our productivity declined as we manufactured new products that had higher production costs. These issues have been addressed, but some costs will flow through to our inventory. Our U.S. LVT sales in the period grew less than we forecast due to a delay in shipments of our sourced products. We anticipate a significant increase in LVT sales as our new U.S. production ramps up and the supply of sourced products increases in the third period.","When completed this year, we will have the only fully integrated rigid LVT plant in the United States. With the closing of Godfrey Hirst, we are shipping out new product introductions in the American market to enhance their sales. For the second quarter, we accelerated sales of impaired Mohawk inventory to consolidate Godfrey Hirst U.S. warehousing with ours. We've already moved their U.S. inventory into our warehouses and integrated their U.S. business into Mohawk's, which will improve the service levels for their customers.","Our residential carpet improved, led by the builder, multi-family and Main Street channels. Our introductions in SmartStrand Silk Reserve, Air.O unified soft flooring and our luxury Karastan collection gained momentum in the market. Our proprietary Continuum polyester products offer consumers an appealing value option without any compromise. We are expanding our Continuum capacity to meet the growing demand for these collections. Our Main Street product offering has expanded to include easy-to-install carpet tiles that are being well received. Our RevWood collections with waterproof technology are growing rapidly in the retail and builder channels as an alternative to hardwood.","In commercial, our hard surface collections showed stronger growth and our commercial carpet bookings strengthened as we progressed through the period. The specializing of our sales force by end use is gaining momentum and broadening our reach as customers recognize that our complete flooring solutions will make their projects more successful.","As we enhance our systems and processes, we're improving the customer experience, while reducing our administrative costs. We've begun consolidating customer service into a single platform to make it easier to satisfy all of our customer needs.","Our U.S. LVT plant is ramping up as expected and producing both flexible and rigid LVT. We're implementing established procedures from our new European line, which is about 60 days ahead of the U.S. learning curve.","During the period, our Flooring Rest of the World Segments were $590 million, an increase of 16% as reported and 8% on a local basis. Our segment's second quarter adjusted operating income rose about 15% compared to last year and was even higher without startup cost and expired patents.","Our LVT sales were up dramatically and will increase more with our new manufacturing expansion. Our new LVT production line is ahead of the U.S. and performing above expectations. Until now, we've been producing flexible LVT and we have completed the initial production runs on rigid LVT, which we'll be launching in the third quarter. While these are being launched in the market, we will finalize additional collections to sell in other channels.","Unlike in the U.S., we are leading the U.S. LVT market as it continues to grow. We are presently staffing up the new line to run seven days a week as we refine our processes to increase output and improve our costs. In laminate, we're introducing new products using unique technologies and water resistance. These products are differentiating us from the rest of the market and improving our mix.","In Russia, we have increased our laminate capacity and we're introducing our latest European technology to increase our market share and margins. We're using our European sheet vinyl to build demand for our new Russian plant, which should start up by the end of this year. Our sheet vinyl products have been specifically designed for the Russian market and are being well received. To recover material inflation and currency translation, we're passing through price increases in Russia.","Our new carpet tile plant in Belgium is ramping up to penetrate the commercial flooring market. We're filling the pipeline with our unique carpet tile collections to build a new European product category to complement our existing LVT, sheet vinyl, laminate and wood offerings. Our wood panels and insulation products grew significantly from our manufacturing investments, better material supply and stronger market conditions.","We completed the acquisition of Godfrey Hirst on July 2, a month later than we had anticipated due to delays in the regulatory approval. We're developing strategies to become a total flooring provider in Australia and New Zealand as we have in the U.S. We're reviewing our combined sales, brand and distribution strategies for both soft and hard surface products. We can complement Godfrey Hirst's strong brands and market position and retail partnerships with our unique hard and soft products, operational philosophies and marketing strategies.","I'll now turn the call over to Frank, who will cover our financial performance for the first quarter.","Frank H. Boykin - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $2.577 billion, growing 5% as reported with our legacy business up 3% on a constant basis. We had growth in all three segments, but Flooring Rest of the World results showed the best improvement.","Our gross margin as reported was 29.7% of sales, or 30.2% excluding charges, and was down from 32.7% last year. Higher inflation and startup cost with lower year-over-year productivity and volume were the most significant headwinds this period. Price increases and expansion of sales across many of our channels will improve our results going forward.","SG&A as reported was 17.1% of sales, or 16.9% excluding charges. This improved 20 basis points over last year. Unusual charges were $16 million for the quarter and primarily related to plant consolidation and integration of acquisitions across all three segments. Our operating margin excluding charges was 13.3%, down from 15.5% last year as $23 million of price\/mix did not offset $62 million of inflation. We also had higher startup cost of $8 million over last year and incremental productivity of $12 million, which was lower than first quarter.","Our income tax rate improved to 20.7% from 24.5% as U.S. tax reform drove the overall rate down. We estimate a third quarter and full year rate of 20% to 21%. We recorded a $55 million one-time charge in the second quarter related to future payments of tax on past unrepatriated foreign earnings as required under the new tax law. Earnings per share excluding charges was $3.51, a decrease of 6% compared to last year.","Turning to the segments. In the Global Ceramic Segment, sales were $929 million, up 3% as reported, with our legacy business up about 1.5% on a constant basis. Our operating income excluding charges was $140 million with a margin of 15.1%, down from 18.1% last year. Negative price\/mix of $6 million and inflation of $25 million offset $9 million of incremental productivity.","In the Flooring North America Segment, sales were $1.058 billion, up 2% over last year. We had the strongest growth in LVT and residential carpet, even though LVT was less due to sourcing delays. Operating income excluding charges was $110 million, with a 10.4% margin compared to 13.4% last year. $7 million of price\/mix did not cover incremental inflation of $30 million. We also had negative productivity of $3 million with a lower production rate, new product inefficiencies and a tighter labor market.","In the Flooring Rest of the World Segment, sales were $590 million, a 16% improvement as reported, with the business up 8% on a constant basis. Our operating margin excluding charges was 17.2%, which was about flat to a 17.3% margin last year, even with startup and expiring patents. Incremental price\/mix of $22 million offset inflation of $8 million. We had incremental productivity of $6 million and startup costs of $5 million.","In the corporate and eliminations segment, our operating loss excluding charges was $9 million. We expect the corporate expense to range from $35 million to $45 million for the full year.","Turning to the balance sheet, our receivables ended the quarter at $1.738 billion. This included days sales outstanding of 56 days in the second quarter, which was flat compared to the first quarter. Our inventories ended the quarter at $2.061 billion. Inventory days were at 112 days, which was an improvement over the first quarter at 116. Inflation negatively impacted the calculation.","Property, plant and equipment ended the quarter at $4.421 billion. In the second quarter, we had capital expenditures of $247 million with depreciation and amortization of $127 million. We are estimating capital expenditures for 2018 of approximately $780 million with FX impacting us $20 million from our budgeted rate that we used at the beginning of the year, plus we've added some smaller investments. Depreciation and amortization is estimated at approximately $520 million for the year. Long-term debt was $3 billion with leverage at 1.3 times debt-to-EBITDA.","Jeff, I'll turn it back over to you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Thank you, Frank. We're taking a comprehensive approach to improve our performance and profitability in the United States. Our initiatives to improve pricing, increase sales and growing channels and reduce costs will benefit the remainder of the year. Given the impact on inflation, timing of price increases and other challenges, we do not anticipate our actions in the United States will offset the pressures that we're facing before next year. We expect continued strength in Europe and Russia, where inflation and shifting product preferences are less intense than in the United States.","Having closed Godfrey Hirst, we are already enhancing the largest flooring provider in Australia and New Zealand. In the recently announced Chinese tariffs \u2013 if the recently announced Chinese tariffs are implemented, they will enhance our U.S. market position and results. Around the globe, we're entering new product categories and geographies as well as expanding constrained categories. In the U.S., we're investing in growing categories such as LVT and quartz countertops. Taking all this into account, our EPS guidance for the third quarter is $3.54 to $3.64, excluding any one-time charges.","We are taking actions to offset inflation, raise transportation, reduce costs and expand LVT. In the fourth quarter, we expect operating income to approach last year, though inflation and exchange rate changes could impact. Next year, pricing should be more aligned, startup costs lower and we should benefit from our investments to improve our results.","We'll now be glad to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Really, two questions. First, Frank, you had called out a negative $3 million of productivity in Flooring North America. Could you talk about what all's in there? That's usually a positive number. I assume there's some slowdown of production in that, but what all makes up the negative $3 million?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Let me just give an overview. Productivity was impacted by lower manufacturing, new product inefficiencies and employee turnover costs. Improvements have come from cost cuts, product improvements, higher yields and lower inventory reductions in total.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, in your third quarter guidance, do you expect a kind of similar result to what we saw in the second, or will it improve?","Frank H. Boykin - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","I think the productivity is going to improve in the third quarter, Keith. We also had some \u2013 the manufacturing shutdowns we talked about, that was in there. We had some labor inefficiencies from the tight labor markets, that would have been in there. And we had some material yield issues with new products that we're putting in, that was in there. So, that's some color on what's in there.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And final question. You're coming at below your guidance here that you gave three months ago. What happened \u2013 or two months ago. Could you give us, in the intervening period, kind of what didn't occur that you thought was going to occur anywhere on the income side?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","In the second quarter, we had a stronger dollar and a delay of Godfrey Hirst closing, which impacted results by $0.10 a share. The results were also impacted by lower sales than we anticipated, input inflation, transportation costs, lower LVT supply and a tight labor market, which increased our costs. In addition, we had a lower product mix than we anticipated and we reduced our production volumes more than we had thought to begin with. We also had the timing of the price increases were later than we had anticipated.","Offsetting some of this, we're raising prices, as we said, in transportation. We're ramping up the expansions. We're expanding in growing channels. We're sourcing more LVT and cutting costs.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Sticking with the cost side, because clearly some things are happening in real-time and have accelerated faster than anticipated. I wanted to focus specifically on freight. And could you just help us understand and quantify how much freight represents as a percentage of other costs or revenues, and really how you're contracting for that and kind of what you can do aside from the surcharges to manage?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","The freight is different across different parts of the business. We run our own freight and trucking systems for a significant part of it. So, we have the same gas and capacity pieces in that one. In addition, we contract freight on a as-needed basis on a significant part, more in the ceramic side than the other, and it's going up with the freight rates across the country as is everything else, is it. We are also expanding our freight system and we're putting more trucks in and using more of it to have more control over the costs given the expansion of the margins that are going on in the freight charges.","Frank H. Boykin - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","And Mike, just to clarify, the freight issue is more U.S. than Europe. Our overall freight runs about \u2013 freight out runs about 5% of sales. But again, it's going to be split between U.S. and Europe. It's going to be higher \u2013 it'll be higher in some...","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Ceramics is going to be probably double that.","Frank H. Boykin - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","It'll be higher in some and lower in others, but that's the average.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Okay. Thank you. And then, with respect to those closing comments around 2019 pricing being more aligned, obviously, some of the startup costs and other things rolling off. I guess, two-part question. Can you give us kind of an expectation more explicitly around is that meant to convey confidence that margins will improve year-on-year next year? If so, by how much? And then, in the past, there have been a couple of times where you've been willing to talk about \u2013 of market expectations and how that should affect your organic growth portfolio or across the portfolio, I should say. At a high level, how are you thinking about what organic growth should be for your business given all the moving pieces underneath right now?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","We expect the income to improve based on what we know today. We expect the expansions to help our top line more. The margins, I'm not sure at this point. We haven't got the budget set out that we're ready to put out yet, but you have the ramping up of these lines that at some point they're going to add operating income, but the margins are going to be below because they're not optimized. And so, the margin percent is going to be different than the others as we're absorbing a lower-margin percentage as these plants are not \u2013 there's not enough throughput and they're not optimized completely as they start, but we won't be able to give you more detail till later.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. And on the growth side, any thoughts on just what you're thinking around just organic growth as you look out over the next few quarters?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","I mean, it's built into that \u2013 we gave you the results of what we gave you a fairly good direction for the next two quarters in our results. That's all we're prepared to give you at this point.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate the color you've given thus far. I guess my question, wanted to address the U.S. business specifically. Obviously, you've got a number of challenges that you've itemized there and some actions you've taken. Perhaps, I'm oversimplifying here, but I'm generally thinking about the impacts to your margin in the business in the U.S. portion of your business right now as being primarily dragged down by three things.","One is the cost and freight and price or relationship and the lag there, and that's probably a transitory issue here over the next quarter or so \u2013 a couple of quarters. The second is that you've had production curtailments to right-size your inventory, which also impacts your productivity and other things. And then, the third is a longer-term transition in particularly the area like ceramic, which LVT is cannibalizing to a lower-margin mix, which seems less transitory. That seems maybe more of a permanent shift. And so I was wondering if we thought about your U.S. business margin in that way, these three categories broadly, how big do you think those three components are? The two relatively transitory one and the one that may be a little bit more longer-lasting?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","They got to be different by product categories and pieces. I'm going to have a hard time averaging them all out for you. The ceramic business, we are participating in lower areas, which is reducing part of the mix. On the other hand, the ceramic business has a much \u2013 the majority of it is sold FOB local destination, so the freight charges are embedded in the pieces. So, you have both things happening at the same time is impacting margins. They will improve as we have raised the prices of the higher-value raw materials, but we're still \u2013 the mix is going down as we're increasing our share in lower areas as we go through it.","On the carpet side, we are chasing the raw materials up as you described and the price increases were later than we expected in implementation. And the amount of increases is increasing more. Part of the piece about the future is we're not sure where the raw materials are going to \u2013 they may have peaked already or they may not have. And we're having to watch it as we go, so that's impacting it. We're passing through the raw materials and prices. That will recover as we go through the year and it'll put us in a better position when we go into next year.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Maybe, Frank, do you want to try to take a stab at quantifying some of those pieces, as I laid out? Because I think that this is an issue that people are really grappling with. In particular, the longer-term effects of a shift towards a more builder and home center related set of customers being a bigger part, particularly the ceramic business. Is there a way to think about what the longer-term margin impact of that piece might be, because I think that's a pretty important factor in people's minds?","W. Christopher Wellborn - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Stephen, I don't know if you can hear me or not, but I'll try. Our product mix declined in the U.S. as we increased the home center and builder channel. In addition, freight cost and the reducing of production also impacted it, and I would say about 50\/50. 50% of it was price\/mix and 50% was the transportation cost and taking freight out.","The freight, we're passing through higher freight cost to the customers. We are able to raise prices on the higher-value products that are more differentiated and we're starting to see improvement from those actions.","The other thing I would say is that another area where we're increasing our sales is commercial channel, which will eventually have a higher margin and improve the mix. We're also introducing leading products and are selling, as we're introducing products, at our higher margin value. So, I think, over time, we'll start to recapture at least a portion of that margin.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","No, that's very encouraging. Chris, I appreciate the effort there and I appreciate the info. So, thank you guys for that.","W. Christopher Wellborn - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","I hope you could hear it.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Can you understand him?","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","I think I got it, basically, that it's not all that \u2013 the move to home centers and builders isn't the only part of the story. There's other aspects of the ceramic actions that you're doing, which will be additive to margin and so will offset that longer-term concern that people have regarding the longer-term ceramic margins. That's what I heard.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Correct.","W. Christopher Wellborn - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Exactly right.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","All right. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Appreciate it.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","Hi. Good morning, guys. Really appreciate you taking the time. I wanted to get back to the timing comment you mentioned in the fourth quarter I think on margins that you think \u2013 and I think it's important for you to clarify for us \u2013 you think you can match the margin profile on a year-over-year basis, then you get back to even versus the prior year on the margin side? And then, following up on that, why is the third quarter expressing such a negative margin implication in terms of deceleration in margin in view of the pricing actions that you're taking place? Is there something else under the hood that we're just \u2013 maybe you can give us some context there.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Well, the third quarter is still being impacted by the input cost flow-through and we're still chasing it. We still are not going to have the pricing alignment anywhere near where we need it. There's going to actually be greater startup costs in the third quarter than there was and we're anticipating a more significant FX impact as we go \u2013 in the third quarter and we're not sure what it's going to be going through, pieces we go through as we go through with it.","In the fourth quarter, we believe the price increases will be getting more aligned. They won't be perfect yet, but they'll be getting more aligned with the inflation as we go through. The startup costs, we're expecting to be a little lower. And with those things \u2013 and we should start getting some positive impact from some of the expansions we're doing, though, they'll be a long way from where we want them to be, is it. And with that \u2013 that's how we got to where we are.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","So, the flat comment is what you were saying? There's no other items to think about in terms of the fourth quarter. And so, just looking at the different domestic flooring businesses, I'm just following up on this recent question, and thinking about next year, how much margin do you expect you will recover as we look to next year relative to what you're seeing here in 2018 when you contemplate the raws, the under-absorption, the overhead, productivity drag, that maybe becomes a tailwind in 2019? Any context of the magnitude of the margin shave that you view as like temporary versus structural and setting that baseline for next year would be hugely helpful for investors, analysts if you could give context there.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","As we get the pricing in line, the margins are going to increase because we're absorbing the raw material pieces without the benefit of the pricing, both with the raw materials and the energy and the transportation. So as those things align, the margin should expand in the categories. And then, this year, we had thought the business was going to be greater than we think it's going to be at this point, so we're also running the factories at less rates than the sales are coming in, which next year should also be aligned. And we should be at least making what's coming in, where right now we're making less than what's coming in. So, all those things will help the present business.","Frank H. Boykin - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","And just looking, Justin, into next year, you're going to see like we mentioned lower startup costs. This year we're estimating startup cost around $65 million to $70 million and next year the total startup costs should be a good amount below that. We've also talked about the fact that we're going to have the IP headwind behind us that we had to deal with this year. And then, finally, with all the capital that we are putting into the business, we talked about an incremental depreciation of $75 million this year, which incremental depreciation next year is going to be significantly less than that. Those will all be helped as we move into 2019.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","And Justin, as the new expansion start up, the margins will be lower. But at some point, they'll turn from losses into incremental improvement. And as they keep improving, the margins are going to go up.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","And just to be clear, though, in the fourth quarter that you mentioned, is that EBIT being flat or margin? Just curious if that \u2013 was that EBIT dollar or percentage margin point that you mentioned for the fourth quarter (43:35)?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Dollars.","Frank H. Boykin - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Just dollars.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","Okay. Perfect. Thank you. That's better context. Thank you very much, guys.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Justin, we actually said that to be specific that it would approach last year.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","Perfect. Thank you, guys.","Frank H. Boykin - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, I guess, also just going back to pricing and just trying to better understand. Jeff, you mentioned I guess in prepared remarks and some of the answers here that one of the issues has been a timing issue around the implementation of the price increases. And I was hoping to just get a little bit better perhaps more granular detail around the cadence of those price increases. If you could kind of walk us through \u2013 and I think, specifically, the challenge has really been around North American carpet, but maybe you can tell me if there has been other areas or segments. But just to give us a sense for when those price increases were implemented so far this year and where you've had to delay, if that's the right understanding of it, where you've had to delay the more recent price increases from \u2013 I don't know if it was from May to June or June to August. Just give us a sense of the walk-through of how that's played out so far this year.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","There's multiple issues at the same time. So one is our anticipation at the time we start putting the increase in, and the other is the actual way it flows through. And we make assumptions in a given point in time and they evolve with the market. So, part of what we said was in the second quarter, our assumptions, the actual flow-through was later than our initial assumption.","The second is that we talk about that it happens on a given day. It happens over time as things work and it doesn't just turn on and off like a light switch. And so we're estimating those different flow-throughs at different points and when they're going to happen. And again, we have to act relative to market as they're going on in different pieces. So, those were happening.","In addition, you talk about pieces. It's not just the carpet piece and the ceramic piece. The freight, which is probably 10%, is a huge part of it and the pass-through of the freight in many cases in ceramic is not a freight charge, but embedded in the product charges. And so, we took actions to improve it. They're going in now, but we've been absorbing it through the period and we're trying to recover in \u2013 in the ceramic business, we get it in multiple ways. We get it in raising product prices. There are energy surcharges and there are delivery charges for some portion of the freight. And so, it's a combination of all three.","And then, the flow-through of one, so then you have multiple increases going on, which is really hard to manage from one to the second to the third and estimating how one is going to impact the next and how they overlap. It just makes the estimation hard. It doesn't change our implementation, but it makes our estimation. The more we have of it, the further off our estimates get.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It's obviously a complicated way to \u2013 a complicated process and probably even more difficult to measure. So I appreciate your thoughts and comments around that. I guess, secondly, just kind of moving to price\/mix for a moment. I think the discussion around the challenges in the ceramic segment are pretty well discussed. I guess, it seems like what's perhaps new this quarter as well is in the Flooring North America Segment, comment around price\/mix declining more than anticipated. And so, I just wanted to understand what product categories we're talking about there, and if it relates to some of the promotional activities that you had, I think, alluded to earlier. So, kind of like what product areas, what product segments, and perhaps what channels are you seeing that in?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","First, you have to start at the \u2013 the builder channel has been doing better than the other channels with new home construction growth. And it tends to be, in most cases, put in by a third-party, who was interested in getting the price per square foot more than the best quality. So as it grows more \u2013 as the growth in it is higher than the others, is that you have the similar things in the multi-family business, is also a lower-quality product of things that are going on. And then the mix between all that decreased. We expected it to decrease some. It decreased more than we had anticipated.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, are you saying that it's more of a mix within channels rather than the channels themselves on a like-for-like deteriorating?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","A large part of it's that, but I don't want to leave you. There is some deterioration even within the higher-value remodeling channel, as you have \u2013 again, in carpets, you have this polyester is increasing its share. And polyester is a lower-cost product than everything else, but we know that's going on and that's in our piece. It just grew more than we had thought.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. One last one, if I...","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","One more thing I want to put in.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","In the carpet industry and others, on the retail floors, people advertise price points. So as we raise prices on individual products, they will actually change the focus of their advertising because they want to maintain price points and they will swap a higher-value product for something that's less in order to maintain the price point is also going on. It's not new. It happens all the time, which is why if you look at the industry prices, the industry prices don't raise as much as the inflation over time, because the retailers trade the customers down, because they are focused on price points. It always occurs in every \u2013 all the time.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, understood, Jeff. I guess just one last one on clarifying the guidance for the next quarter or two. It seems like trying to back in a little bit, if you kind of look at the EPS guidance and make some basic assumptions on the top line that the year-over-year margin decline, 3Q versus 2Q, you had about 220 bps of a 2Q margin decline. Frank, it would seem that 3Q might be a little bit of a greater margin decline. And is that the case? It might be up sequentially, margins might be up sequentially but down a little bit more greatly year-over-year? And I assume, is that just because of some of the flow-through on currency and maybe some productivity or production inefficiencies?","Frank H. Boykin - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Yeah, Mike. The margin decline year-over-year in the third quarter will be larger than the margin decline year-over-year in the second quarter. And it's going to be a lot of the things that we've talked about in the second quarter; continuing inflation and how that's going to impact us, the delay of the price increases and such as that.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And then, in 4Q, operating income on a dollar basis will be flat year-over-year is the last part of the guidance.","Frank H. Boykin - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Well, I think what we said is that it would approach last year's number.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Very good. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. You're drawing down inventory in 2Q and 3Q for ceramics in North America, I assume partly that's due to weaker-than-expected demand. Was that driven by increased competition or just weaker overall demand? And it'd be helpful if you could quantify that impact for 2Q and 3Q.","W. Christopher Wellborn - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Well, we came into the year with higher inventories than we wanted to have and we started gradually taking those out, but we're still going to be operating at the 85% to 90% overall utilization rate in the company. And I think what we said, about half of our margin decline was lowering inventories and freight, and I would say a bit more of that half was freight.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, pricing historically has not been a big driver of ceramics. Can you give us a sense on the market acceptance of some of these price increases you guys have out there? And the traction you're seeing, is that coming largely from the high end of the market or just pretty broad-based? Thanks.","W. Christopher Wellborn - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Well, what we found is as we're trying to pass on these freight increases and we took pricing to do it, the lower end was more sensitive to those prices, whereas the higher end of the mix that would be driven by commercial and other things were more accepting of the price increases we took.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. But you've seen pricing across the board, but I guess just more traction on the high end?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","In the low end, we're just passing through the freight. In the high end, we're passing through the freight and additional costs on top of that.","W. Christopher Wellborn - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Yeah.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays.","Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to start out on the LVT business. First, the U.S. sourcing issue that happened in the second quarter, is that one-time, or is that something that can happen again? And then, just more broadly, you called out the improved mix expectation in Europe on the new capacity, but it wasn't clear necessarily what you're saying on the North American side. So, could you just please outline your expectations for North American LVT mix and margins going forward? Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","What we said was that we had \u2013 our suppliers had problems in getting us product in the second quarter. They have overcome those problems and the production and shipments to us are higher, in line with what we would like to have, but it didn't just start overnight, so it's going to occur during the third quarter. What we said also was that we anticipated both our European and U.S. LVT lines increasing their manufacturing as they come up and that production will give us more capacity to sell during the period. We're also introducing more rigid products off both lines as well as importing products as we go through, and we expect our LVT business to improve significantly with all these things.","In Europe, which is ahead, they focused on manufacturing flexible, which they had been limited in their capacity. So instead of starting it up trying to make LVT, which is why their sales were much higher, we've been producing flexible LVT for most of the time and then doing new product work with it. They are operating three shifts today and working towards adding a fourth one, where the U.S. is operating two shifts and working towards adding a third one is the way they're working out.","Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, Jeff. Thank you. I appreciate that. Second question, back in the ceramic business and the growth in the lower-value channels, could you address why you think you're seeing less market opportunity in the higher-value channels? Is that specifically a function of LVT taking share from those higher-mix products? And if so, at what point is there a resistance to that share shift, if we think about the areas of your portfolio that perhaps may be less vulnerable to a shift to LVT? Thank you.","W. Christopher Wellborn - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Well, I can answer that. So, the area that's growing the most for us right now is builder, which tends to be at a lower price point. We're also taking share in the home centers with our business. Slowly, our commercial business is growing. It is true that LVT has impacted the dealer business in particular.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Let me sort of \u2013 we all talk about LVT in the industry. Let me see if I can frame it in a way that it has \u2013 as well as sort of frame it as we go. The LVT, if you think about \u2013 let's back up. In 2017, there's broad estimates of it. So, we believe the range is somewhere from $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion. The best estimate we have of the increase in the category is about $500 million to $600 million. Now, if we assume that the LVT is going to continue growing at about that amount and the flooring industry is going to grow about 3% to 4%, the balance growth in everything else is going to be about 1% to 2% annually until the LVT matures and it will mature at some point in the not-too-distant future. And then, the growth will normalize across the categories. So, you have this mix that's going on. It's not the first time the industry has been through this. It happens a lot and you have to constantly adjust relative to these things.","You can go back with things like categories. Laminate, at some point, started and grew. You had carpet tile, started and grew. You had polyester carpet taking over pieces. So, these shifts are normal. It's just the size of this one is bigger. And over a period of time, it will mature and then the industry will go back to more normalized growth. And if it grows somewhat like we're thinking, it's not like everything else is going to go to zero. It's just not going to grow as fast, while it's maturing.","Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America.","John Lovallo - Bank of America","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call and I don't want to belabor this, I'm just trying to understand this a little bit better. Maybe if we just think about raw materials and freight costs and just assuming they stay kind of where they are today and let's assume that the current price increases that are in place all go through well, at what point next year, first half, second half, do you think that price-cost relationship will even out?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","I think it probably will be sometime in the first quarter will be close. But your assumption on inflation freight, raw materials, I don't know if it's right to assume it's over or we have more to come. It could be either, which is why you hear us hesitating. We don't know exactly where it's going to be.","John Lovallo - Bank of America","No, understood. That's helpful. And then, maybe just switching gears quickly and talk about the tariff that's been proposed. 10%, I guess, is a good start, but what do you think is the actual production cost advantage from producing in China versus maybe domestically? How big of a tariff would actually need to be put in place to kind of level the playing field?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","We think that we can compete with the Chinese without any tariffs. Now, what's happening is we have to get the plants up, the new ones up and operating with enough throughput in order to get the costs and margins down where we like them to be. The tariffs, I think, are a broader piece which says that on the list is almost every product we make, and we're about 95% of what we make is made in the United States or is made locally. So, anything that raises the competitive alternatives will help all of our different product categories in the United States that we have, which is practically our entire business.","John Lovallo - Bank of America","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi. Thank you for fitting me in today. Just wanted to follow up on LVT and just really instead of just looking at the quarter or even the next quarter, taking a step back and getting your strategic thoughts on how you approach meeting the increasing demand for North American LVT. And really, specifically, if you could clarify how much is currently sourced versus manufactured. And your thoughts given the changes in how this product is manufactured, where you're going to focus on your capital allocation sourced versus manufactured strategy over the next two to three years. Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","In the United \u2013 so let me \u2013 in Europe, we manufacture all of it today. In the U.S., we manufacture a much smaller amount than we import and source today. But what was happening is we're putting in approximately another $250 million of capacity with the new plant that's coming up, and we've been hesitating and sourcing more, because we thought we'd have to use a majority of our efforts to sell up the ramp-up of the other one. We've changed our view given the growth of the industry and we think that we can sell up the ramp-up as it's coming up and more sourced, so we're doing both.","The longer-term view is it takes us about 12 to 18 months to add new capacity and we'll make decisions on an incremental basis and we'll continue sourcing more and balance the two, and we really don't have to have a final decision. We just have to decide when we're going to increase more LVT and what rate we're going to put it in, and then adjust the sourcing strategy to go with it as we go through.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Assuming a low-double-digit growth rate over the next two to three years, against that scenario, what percentage \u2013 I mean, right now, we're estimating at least 85%, 90% is sourced, but does it get close to 50\/50? And just helping us understand that would be helpful. And I have one follow-up. Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","I don't normally think about the way you're approaching it, so I don't have it. I normally think of it on an incremental basis as the business is changing. And once we make the decision, then it's a matter of balancing the sales that we can grow with it. And we're trying going forward not to limit the sales, but just to balance the opportunities between the two pieces. I don't know how to give you a more defined proposition than that.","If we find that we want to source more, we just slow down the piece. If we want to add more, we can add two machines at the same time instead of one, so we haven't finalized the optimum solution at this point.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Yeah. I guess, the importance of it is just the capital allocation for adding capacity, for product category that is changing, and how it's made is different than meeting the needs of sourcing. So, that was the basic nature of that question.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","I think the piece is we're going to have a significant sourced portion no matter what. The question is, is it going to be 40% or 60%. I don't think it really \u2013 it doesn't change my strategy.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. Great. And just one final clean-up question. Appreciated the color you gave throughout the call on ceramic, particularly about the price point falling in the quarter, but results would imply that perhaps there was a slowing momentum in North American volumes, but we may be off of that. And perhaps, you may have commented on that in the call and I missed it, but could you clarify just about the volume momentum in North America for ceramic sales? Thank you.","W. Christopher Wellborn - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","North America volume has actually been strengthening a little bit as we've gone through the year.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Perfect.

I wanted to go back to the tariff question for a minute. And I guess, have you seen any change in behavior or willingness to work with you among some of the retailers that have been heavier on their sourcing for product?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","There are some discussions about how they can prepare for it not knowing where it's going to be. They are taking multiple approaches. Some are talking to us.

So, there's all kinds of preparation going on, not knowing what the end result's going to be.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then, I guess, the second question is, you noted that in your CapEx you've added some smaller incremental investments this year. I guess, can you talk to what those are? And broadly speaking, where are you thinking more about aligning your CapEx as we think about 2019?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Listen, I'll give you an example. A piece of property came up available adjacent to a large Belgian facility that's landlocked. And so, we bought a large chunk of the land to enable us flexibility in the future. For instance, there are other small things. So, I mean they're not significant to the piece. But it's those kinds of things. A big part of it came because of our assumptions on FX and what the purchases would be, both in translation and in the U.S., in both cases. So part of that, we had a lower \u2013 a different assumption for how it would \u2013 what would happen, so that was, I think Frank said, a $20 million part of the adjustment.","Going forward, we're going through right now our annual strategy plan of capital and investments for next year. So, the businesses are going through a process of deciding where they think the opportunities are, what the values are and where they are. My belief is that the number's going to be significantly less because of all the capacity and new pieces we have in it to go through it. The opportunities are going to be do we decide to go and expand in some places that I don't know at this moment. So, we haven't gone through it, which is why I can't give you direction for it. And then, we also have to put in how we see the risk of whatever utilizing them as we go through. Just as a comment, maybe on some of the old stuff, there seems to be some confusion over our ability to use it. So, let me see if I can clarify that with you while you bring up the subject.","The majority of our new investments, which I went through them in the leading remarks, are outside the United States either to relieve constraints or to enter new markets. And at a high level, if you just look at the additional sales, LVT is about $500 million of the total with the two lines we have going in. We have about $400 million where we're going into new products which we mentioned like sheet vinyl in Russia or like quartz countertops in here, and other ones that's going into new products or to the same products we have in new geographies is about $400 million. So, the existing products make up about $400 million of what I would call expansion, again, which a large chunk of that's outside the United States.","If you look at inside the United States, everybody is worried about us running it. The big investments in the United States are LVT, which the question is are we putting in enough; and quartz countertops, which is a $1.2 billion industry growing at least 10% a year, and there's huge opportunities in that one. So, I mean, we think we have the investments in the right area. And I know you like me to tell you about our next year. I mean, they could be zero for all I know right now. But I doubt it. I think we're putting the investments in the right areas that are going to help our growth and maximize our business.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Jeff, thank you very much for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet.","Mason Marion - Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.","Hi. This is Mason on for Mike. Is LVT sourcing issue specific to Mohawk? Or is it an industry-wide issue?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","I don't have enough detail to answer that. So, I don't know. I would assume that other people had some of the same issues, but I don't have news (1:11:49) of them.","Mason Marion - Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.","Okay. And then, are you able to quantify how much has impacted your LVT growth rate in the quarter?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Listen, that's like guessing how much I would have sold if I didn't have it. I think it would have been a significant number but, I mean, it's a pretty wild guess if I give it to you. It wouldn't be worth the paper it was written on.","Mason Marion - Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you and good afternoon. Jeff, maybe we can go back to the margin profiles a little bit. If you look at carpet in U.S. ceramic, when mix shifts down, is that a temporary decline in margin? Or the lower mix product, does that permanently carry a lower operating margin?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","It depends on \u2013 so let's just go. It depends if you shift \u2013 I'm going to make it simple. If you have low, medium and high, the low, medium and high operate at different margins, in general. So, if the medium shifts to low, that's going to push it down a notch. If it's just medium to medium, it's similar. Now, when you go medium to medium what you lose is, if you raise the prices, I'll just make it up, 5%, you lose the 5% revenues because they trade down to a lower total dollar amount, but the margin's similar.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Got you. Okay.","W. Christopher Wellborn - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","I would just add on ceramic is once this LVT levelizes and even if you get 1% or 2% growth in the top line, we're already operating at, let's say, 85% capacity, we're going to fill that capacity up over time and those margins will come up. The other thing that's happened in the category, right now, builder is what is hot and what's growing. Over time, the residential and the replacement, all that will \u2013 usually has leveled out.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. Okay. Thanks, Chris. And then, just a couple of quick questions on pricing. You said pricing is slower in carpet and ceramic. One is, is that because competition is greater \u2013 is not cooperating as much or is that customer pushback? And then, the second thing on ceramic, specifically, at the low end, is pricing actually compressing in the U.S.?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","What we were trying to say is, at a point in time in the past, we estimated what would happen. What we're trying to say is our estimates didn't match up with what we ended up doing or the industry. And so, it was later coming through. We're still getting the increases, it was just at points in time we estimate all the different stuff and it's a constantly moving target, which we adjust to.","What was the second part of the question?","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. And a follow-on to that, do you think that slower is because of competitive pressures or just the consumer? And then, the second question was on ceramic, specifically, at the low end in the U.S., do you think that market pricing is actually compressing?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Listen, there are some pricing that takes longer to get in, in the marketplace. And what happens is as the amount increases over time, the portion that comes in later gets to be a bigger and bigger amount, because it compounds on itself, is part of what's going on.","And then, what was the second part of it?","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then, just in the U.S. ceramic, do you think the low end, the pricing is compressing there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","The low end has pressure on it. As the dollar strengthens, it does create pressure on the low end, which is where most of the \u2013 the huge part of the imports are. So, the exchange rates impact it. But I mean we've gone through exchange rate changes for the last 20 years and the same thing occurs. As you would suspect, when the dollar gets much stronger, we have to react.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. All right. Thank you.","W. Christopher Wellborn - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Not been any fundamental change that the exchange rate that Jeff talked about was a change. And I think in general, us and other manufactures came into this year with a little too much inventory. And I think there's been some adjustment, but no fundamental change.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah. That's what I was getting at. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital.","Laura Champine - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking my question. It's about LVT and could you just give us what percentage of Q2 sales were in that category and where you think that could be a year from now based on the investments you're making?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","We don't normally give out sales by specific products and pieces. The two new lines what we said will add about $500 million of sales when they're optimized and then we have the option of supplementing that with increased sourcing products by whatever number. And then, within 12 months or so, we have the ability to add increments of whatever we choose if we decide to go ahead with them. I mean, that's about as close as I can get you.","Laura Champine - Loop Capital Markets LLC","And on the mix shift on ceramic, which look like it was certainly more than what we expected and I think more than you expected, how long will that trend likely last? I mean, will we see a continuation into next year as builder continues to grow?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Part of the margin difference is in freight, which we're making arrangements. If you just look at the margin, assume it's all it, part of it is in freight which we're passing through. And then, we've also said that the higher-value products, we've already announced price increases. So, we have pricing going on that's going into the third quarter that should help the margins in the third quarter somewhat and get more of the benefit in the fourth quarter, which is also helping the fourth quarter.","Laura Champine - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then, just a follow-on on our prior question. Can you give me as much as to say that LVT at this point is a double-digit percentage of sales overall for Mohawk? Or is it not that big?","Frank H. Boykin - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","I don't think we've looked at the total global LVT. It's probably a little bit less than a double-digit number.","Laura Champine - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel.","John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I didn't think we'd ever get to me. It's 12:20. I appreciate you hanging in that long. Quickly, Jeff...","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Listen, time's (1:19:56) ran out, it's over.","John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I really don't want to hear Chris talk and please don't take that personally. You mentioned sales were a little light of expectations in the second quarter. I'm just curious, is that because, for example, you didn't have as much LVT to sell? Or do you think the overall growth rate of flooring, whichever category it might be, may have slowed a little bit in Q2? And your expectation sort of on that macro level for the back half. Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","It's got to do with a lot of things. One is that LVT going back we sort of explained the high-level view. LVT is taking a large part of the growth, is one. The second is that the growth categories for us, you're losing some of the dollar value by trading down in different \u2013 by getting a higher amount of sales in lower-value categories, which is also impacting the growth. And then, in general, I think there were certain channels in the industry that didn't do as well as we had anticipated. But I still think the industry is growing in the neighborhood of 3% to 4%.","John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And is there \u2013 you've been helpful on the LVT front. I believe once the $500 million of production comes up, you're going to be closer to that $1 billion number that you can manufacture. Correct me if I'm wrong. And then, we'd think about LVT sourcing as something incremental to that, but probably specific to the U.S. market?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","We've said that when we get this thing running, we'll have over $1 billion of manufacturing capacity in place and then whatever sourcing we do on top of that.","John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Rob Aurand on for David MacGregor today. I guess just sticking with LVT. Can you talk about what you're seeing kind of in residential versus commercial and as these new plants come up, where your focus will be between residential and commercial product?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Are you at LVT-only?","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Focused on LVT.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","We are selling both \u2013 we have product lines aimed at both the residential and commercial markets. We have product lines aimed in each one at low, medium and high-value products. We are putting in new products to expand our offering in all categories in the marketplaces, and we think we have enough supply as our new capacity comes up and our sourced product to support both high to low in both categories.","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And I know there's been a few questions on the tariffs, and I realize that there's a lot of uncertainty at this point, but do you have any sense of if they do go through at these current levels, what kind of share could be up for grabs for you to benefit from?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Listen, the market moves based on relative values of products, and if you raise the imports, which are large in LVT, they're large in ceramic, what else is large? There's a wood piece that's fairly large. If you raise them all by 10%, there's going to be beneficiaries of all of those who are here. And we think we're one of the largest.","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning. Two questions. One, a follow-up. Jeff, you made a comment about if you were going to source 40% of LVT or 60% of LVT. Is that a long-term plan or is that just as you're working through the growth and managing the growth of that category?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Listen, I didn't give it more than about a minute's thought. In Europe, we're not doing any and what I keep saying is we are adding the capacity here. When we get it up and running, we will evaluate the benefits and detriments of adding more. And in 12 months, I have the capital, I could add two or three machines in 12, 14 months if I chose to.","So, it just depends on how it evolves and what we perceive as the value of doing it. And we have capital that's available, we have a strong balance sheet. It's just a matter do we like the economics and do we like what's going on. And then part of the decision has to be where do we think we are in the cycle and what do you want to invest based on the cycle. So, it's not a single view of the question.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Secondly, you have \u2013 what appears to be going on is a combination of input cost pressure and currency issues and investments in startup. You've endured these things before, but it's never added up to the magnitude of margin and earnings erosion as it is now. Why is this adding up to the magnitude of the step-down now, especially in a market growing 3% or 4% and it hasn't in the past? What's different that makes the impact more dramatic now than we've seen historically?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","I'm not sure I agree with your conclusion. We've been through \u2013 you remember when oil went to $140? I mean, we've had dramatic changes at points in time both of raw materials that we've lived through. We've had dramatic changes in, not of this magnitude with products, but in the last eight years, in carpet, polyester carpet's gone to 50% of the industry. It was about 10% when it started. You can go through \u2013 laminate didn't exist and it became 8% of the industry. I mean, we've lived through these in each piece. In the commercial carpet business, we had \u2013 I mean, basically carpet tile didn't exist and now we have a large position in carpet tile. In ceramic, seven, eight years ago these digital printing things didn't exist. There were no wood products. The wood products with digital printing are 25%, 30% of the industry today.","I mean, we live through these shifts and market changes in every category, and it's not do they occur. They occur about every 10 years in something and we have to continuously adjust our business to the changing environment. The companies that don't change, I can give you a long list that aren't here anymore.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah, I guess \u2013 and I probably stated my question poorly. Considering like that long list of what you mentioned, which is similar in ways to what is going on now and I've followed the company for a long time, none of those have translated into the magnitude of earnings erosion as you're experiencing in 2018.","And so, my question is why is the earnings impact of this transition so much more significant than when you endured all of those that you managed through with less earnings volatility?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","I don't remember the dates, but I can almost guarantee you the same thing happened and it probably was worse. I mean, I seem to think somewhere around 2000 there was one of these, but I don't know. I know there was one about 2008, maybe \u2013 I mean, I don't have the dates because I haven't gone back historically. But I mean, we've been through it multiple times. It's not if they occur, it's when's the next one.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. Perfect. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alvaro Lacayo with Gabelli & Company.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Good morning. I just have one question. In the past when you talked about all the new capacity that you were investing in, you talked about needing to improve to get utilization up in those plants and that would have an impact on mix. And over time, you would see improved mix driving through that new capacity. Maybe if you could talk about how the new capacity that has come online and in general across the portfolio has impacted mix in the quarter. And if you can sort of maybe put some dollars behind that, as well as the inefficiencies that you've seen from starting these plants up. Putting some numbers around that would be helpful, I think.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","So, let's see. When you start up a new plant and \u2013 I don't know, I'll take the LVT plant in Europe, I guess, it's further along. You start up on day one, and for a period of time \u2013 in day one, you start up with one shift. And at that point, you are trying to get out mechanical problems and other things and you're trying to devise the process in order to get it to operate. You have mechanical changes, process changes that have to be done.","You then go to two shifts, which allows you to operate around the clock. And in that time, you're still having unplanned shutdowns, you're still having production levels below where you expect and you're still making changes. You're training people, who are making errors in what they do and then you're adding things to the equipment in order to operate it better and get better results on it.","You then go to three shifts. Now you have to train people and you train more people that have to do it, and the training costs you much. And the training, the people make mistakes as they do it because they're all new and they haven't done it.","During those times, you try to keep the product production as simple as possible because you don't want to take all of those things that are going on and make the \u2013 and have to have them change products frequently and dramatically while it's going on.","You then get into the second stage, which you're somewhere in that one which we are in Europe and then you start introducing new products. So, we started bringing in the startup of more differentiated rigid products. You start bringing in features and pieces and you start manufacturing new products that have low productivity levels. You are managing the composition and the processes as you go through and you may even be making more physical changes to the equipment.","In Europe, we're in that stage and we have made new products in rigid and they are \u2013 we made production runs and they're being made into samples in order to introduce them there. While that one's going on, you then start adding more. We're in the process of getting ready to add more people and then we take the production and start making more products that are new. And you start trying to add more features and benefits to all those, and that's happening.","With all that happening, you're still running at higher waste levels. You're still running at lower throughputs than you would expect, and those are all impacting the margin percentage of the business as you go through. And at some point, you're going through all that and you go from an operating loss to an operating profit, but you're still running at low production rates and high waste levels and you keep going up.","Now, depending upon how big a business it is, in another case, you may not have the sales opportunities to ramp it up. So now you have to go build market share to ramp it up and it takes longer because the market isn't large enough to absorb the capacity overnight. And it's the combination of all those things that, over time, you end up with an optimized business that's making product at very low cost. You have enough throughput to get the fixed overhead down and it ends up operating at a margin that's typical of your business.","Now, when you get through with all of that, the positive of it is you end up with a business that you didn't pay for the sales and margins like you would in an acquisition. What you've had to do, though, is pay for (1:33:19) all those inefficiencies and startups during the period, but when you get through, you have a much lower investment collectively than you did when you bought the sales and cash flow of an existing business. Does that help?","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","It does help. And I don't know if you can, but maybe putting some numbers around that and maybe based on what you think normalized expectations from those plants are versus where they are today just to get an idea of what kind of room for improvement we could be seeing over the next 12, 18 months.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Listen, have you watched Tesla startup? The things don't go as planned in things that haven't been done before. Is it? So, putting an exact date and time on it is impossible. What I can tell you is when we get through that the margins on that $500 million we're putting in will be at least as high as the rest of our business. And it'll be in place and operating well sometime in the not-too-distant future and it could be a year, it could be a year-and-a-half. Hell, it might take us two years to get to the optimized piece, but I mean it doesn't change the result of where it is.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","And that's versus a current loss at the moment. Is that accurate?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","I don't know whether the thing's \u2013 listen. I don't know whether that one specifically is breaking even, losing money or making a little right now.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Lorberbaum for closing remarks.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Mohawk Industries, Inc.","The industry and we go through dramatic changes in raw materials. We go through changes in the products, as we discussed. We've handled the situations before. The business goes through temporary compressions of our margins and the business ends up stronger and better when we're through.","We're putting in place all the activities that we need to, to get to the other side. The investments we've put in, after the fact that we're now a year later with all these investment decisions we make that are going in, they are still the right things to do for the right reasons and they still help our business in the long term.","We appreciate the support and questions you give us.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mohawk Industries First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, May 6, 2016.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries quarterly investor conference call. Today, we'll update you on the company's results for the first quarter of 2016 and provide guidance for the second quarter.","I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include a discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Frank. During the quarter, Mohawk delivered an outstanding performance. Our earnings per share were $2.38, excluding unusual charges, an increase of 40% of the prior year and the highest first quarter earnings per share in the company's history. This is the eighth consecutive quarter in which the company has delivered record adjusted EPS.","For the period, our adjusted operating margin rose to a first quarter record of 11.6%, an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year, as a result of acquisitions, volume, productivity and input costs. Revenues grew across all segments, with first quarter net sales increasing 15.5% as reported to $2.2 billion, the highest sales figure we have ever reported for any quarter. All of these results were achieved with one less day in the period than last year.","We entered 2016 with an optimistic outlook. And our first quarter results exceeded our projections, with strong results from all three of our segments in both revenues and margins. Our recent acquisitions continue to improve our performance, with the synergies enhancing our existing and acquired businesses, and the lower impact of the U.S. dollar benefited our results.","After completing four acquisitions during 2015, we have the capacity to absorb additional opportunities if they become available. Our major capital projects initiated last year are progressing as expected, with: the first production line in our Tennessee ceramic plant now operational; our U.S. LVT production accelerating; the second phase of our European ceramic upgrade now complete.","Each of our capital expansion projects creates significant long-term value, adding new revenues by increasing our product offerings and our customer base. Typically, these projects take one to three years to achieve their full benefit. All of these investments could provide higher returns than our acquisitions, though start-up costs impact our immediate results.","In 2016, we have identified more opportunities to grow our business and have already approved additional LVT production lines in the U.S. and Europe, the doubling of our Mexican ceramic plant in Central Mexico, the final phase of our European ceramic upgrades and the expansion of our U.S. and European premium laminate production with new technology. We anticipate investing more than $600 million in capital projects this year, and we are assessing further internal opportunity.","Similar to 2015, the U.S. economy had a soft start this year, but continues to benefit from solid job creation and low interest rates. Despite sluggish new home starts in March, the National Association of Home Builders affirmed the recovery of the U.S. single home family market.","With home prices rising and existing home sales strong, the Harvard LIRA Index is forecasting residential remodeling to accelerate throughout the remainder of the year. An April home improvement survey indicated that half of U.S. homeowners are planning remodeling investments this year, and new flooring was the second most common project being anticipated. The consensus among commercial construction forecasts is for continued growth during 2016, with hospitality and office space sectors leading the category.","In Mexico, government spending has benefited the country's construction sector, which continues to drive high ceramic growth. In Europe, the Central Bank's latest round of interest rate reductions and its Asset Purchase Programme are supporting the region's economy. The Russian economy remains in a recession, with continued pressures from low oil prices. In 2016, we're investing in all of these markets to position Mohawk for future growth.","Turning to a review of our first quarter performance by segment, our Global Ceramic segment sales were up approximately 8% as reported. On a constant days and currency basis, the segment grew 11%, with the legacy business up almost 9%. Adjusted for operating income for the segment, it rose 18% on a constant currency basis over last year to an operating margin of 13%.","Our North American ceramic business, which constitutes the majority of the segment, reflects a strong U.S. market, where U.S. ceramic continues to gain share. Our business through our service centers grew the fastest of all our channels during the period, as we invested more in sales personnel, marketing and new product introductions.","Within that channel, the combined American Olean and Marazzi service centers had the highest rate of growth, as our consolidated approach expands our customer base. We're continuing to upgrade our showroom slab warehouses, and aggressively promoting business through user-friendly websites and social media. Throughout our network of almost 300 service centers, we're rolling out paperless sales and operation processes to improve customer service and enhance efficiencies.","We continue to expand our independent distributor base, which will improve our penetration in the market. Our new floor and wall tile products are gaining additional placements in the home center channel, as those as retailers place greater emphasis on the category. Our new product innovations in wood and stone looks, as well as smaller shapes, are growing our business and winning industry awards.","To support our growth, our new plant in Tennessee initiated production on schedule and the first line is running well. The plant's remaining two lines will be operational between now and August. To satisfy increased demand in the U.S., we are utilizing our worldwide ceramic assets in Mexico, Italy, Bulgaria and Russia to support our domestic production.","Our Mexican ceramic business is outpacing the market, and is the fastest-growing part of the segment. Our mix and margins continue to improve as we expand our distribution.","The plant we acquired in Western Mexico last year is operating well and continued to improve its productivity and cost position. We're finalizing the expansion plans to double the ceramic plant near Mexico City, with construction beginning in the second quarter.","We're continuing to increase our customer base in the market, adding new distributors, expanding home center placements, and increasing our participation in new construction projects. All of our plants in Mexico are improving their productivity and quality, as we introduce larger sizes, as well as specialized shapes.","Our European ceramic business continues to improve in line with our plan, with sales growing in the first period. We are increasing our investments in sales personnel, merchandising, retail training and brand advertising to enhance our distribution.","The second phase of our equipment upgrades have been installed and is operational, improving our cost and service levels. Additional investments have been approved to modernize the balance of the original assets that we acquired in 2013. We continue to introduce innovative products that will expand our margins, including stone looks, thin and 3-dimensional wall tiles and cement designs.","Our KAI acquisition continues to progress, as we enhance the product offering, organization and reporting systems, while expanding sales to Western Europe and the U.S.","Our Russian ceramic business continues to outperform the market, which remains challenging, as the economy contracts and investments in real estate decline. Our sales during the first quarter increased on a local basis, while our margins narrowed due to inflation and lower mix. We're introducing many new products and strategically opening owned and franchised stores. We're implementing equipment upgrades to optimize our manufacturing of new sizes. And this fall, a new production line will expand our premium offerings. We continue to approach the market aggressively, which will enhance our position when the Russian economy rebounds.","During the quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales were up 7% as reported. On a constant days basis, the segment grew approximately 9%, with legacy sales up 4%. Adjusted operating income for the segment rose 42% over last year to an operating margin of approximately 9%. Our first quarter adjusted profit margin for the segment improved, as a result of process efficiencies, investments in new technology, differentiated new products and cost improvements.","Last year, we began expanding our investments in sales personnel and marketing to broaden our distribution in carpet and hard surface products. To optimize their performance, our sales organizations are specialized by both product and channel, and we are supporting them with greater sampling, merchandising, and retail training.","Our hard surface products continue to deliver substantial growth as we expand our market share, as consumer flooring preferences shift. Growth in value priced polyester carpet and lower commodity pricing are reducing our average selling prices, as lower raw material costs are reflected in the market.","Despite these pricing pressures, the investments we made last year to differentiate our products and reduce our manufacturing costs are improving our margins. As a reflection of our investment and product innovation, Mohawk's new SmartStrand collections won all three major dealer awards at the national trade shows.","We continue to build on our strengths in premium residential carpet, with innovative products such as Continuum polyester with odor-eliminating technology and Silk Naturals, which replicates wool with a superior softness, texture and durability. These introductions are being well-received by retailers and should enhance our mix as homeowners seek luxurious softness and improved performance.","Our commercial margins improved with the success of our fashionable new product introductions and streamlined manufacturing processes. During the period, our retail hospitality and healthcare channels were the strongest, in line with industry trends. Our commercial carpet tile continues to grow, as we expand our specifications with large end-users as well as increasing our transactional business. We are completing the consolidation of our woven manufacturing into one location, which will improve our efficiencies and deliver better service and quality.","During the quarter, our hard surface sales increased across all channels as we leverage our carpet relationships. Our high style laminate collections are outpacing the market as consumers gravitate to realistic visuals, the enhanced texture and unique water-resistant technology.","Our engineered wood sales grew substantially in both new home construction and remodeling. Our longer and wider wood planks are being well-received by consumers as a higher value alternative with contemporary styling. We have announced a wood price increase of 6% to 10% effective on May 15.","We are increasing sales of our sheet vinyl under our Mohawk brand. Our LVT sales are growing dramatically in both residential and commercial sectors, as we ramp up production at our new U.S. plant. The plant is making significant progress, and its operation should be optimized by the end of the year. LVT remains the fastest-growing flooring product globally. And we are extending our U.S. leadership in the category with the further expansion of our Georgia facility. The additional capacity will be operational at the end of 2017. Our manufacturing plants and all products are improving process efficiencies and quality, as we are implementing equipment upgrades to extend our competitive advantages.","To support our business growth, this year we're expanding our capacity in premium laminate, carpet cushion and polyester carpet and rugs. We're adding another shift to our engineered wood plant, and investing in new capacity for longer planks.","For the quarter, our Flooring Rest of the World segment sales were up 56% as reported. On a constant days and currency basis, the segment increased 62%, with legacy sales up 4%. Adjusted operating income for the segment rose 70% on a constant currency basis to an operating margin of approximately 17%. The European flooring market is slightly improving, with the LVT and wood categories experiencing the greatest growth. Our laminate and wood business in the region outpaced the market trends due to our emphasis on higher-end product categories that are differentiated.","Our laminate sales are outperforming, as our deeply-textured water-resistant collection continues its strong momentum in the market. To meet growing demand for longer products, we're installing additional laminate capacity over the next 12 months to 18 months. We've completed the integration of the IVC business, which is reducing our costs and improving efficiencies. To offset currency changes in a number of European countries, we're implementing laminate price increases.","In Russia, we are focusing on the premium laminate market, and our plant is operating near capacity. Our engineered wood sales rose significantly during the period, benefited by expanded sales under our Quick-Step brand and our direct distribution. Our Czech wood plant is operating near capacity, with additional product for the European market being supplied from our Malaysian facility. We anticipate further investments in our wood plant this year to reduce costs and streamline operations. Our material costs during the period were higher, as we increased manufacturing to meet demand, and we will implement price increases to compensate for the effect of raw material inflation.","Our sheet vinyl plants are fully utilized in the period, and our margins improved as we increased our residential mix and commercial sales. During April, we experienced a fire at one of our Belgian sheet vinyl plants that will reduce sales in the second quarter by about \u20ac3.5 million and income by about \u20ac500,000 after the insurance recovery.","Our LVT sales are growing substantially, as our new Belgian production expands and we source products to grow even faster. Additional equipment will be installed in the facility in July to substantially increase our production of LVT. Due to the continued strength of LVT around the globe, we anticipate sales will exceed capacity of the two European LVT plants. To meet the higher demand, we have announced plans to further expand our LVT manufacturing in Belgium by the end of 2017 also.","Our insulation panel business grew significantly during the period, primarily through the acquisition of Xtratherm, which was completed at the end of last year. We now operate five regional insulation panel facilities in Belgium, France, the UK and Ireland, extending our geographic reach. As we integrate the Xtratherm acquisition, we have realigned our insulation organization and are improving efficiencies through the implementation of best practices.","Our boards and roof panel businesses are delivering improved sales and margins as we upgrade the mix and equipment.","I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $2.172 billion, up 16% from last year or 6% on a legacy basis using constant days and exchange rates. FX was a $26 million headwind in the quarter. We had one less day in the first quarter, and we will have one less day in the third quarter this year compared to last year. We will have one more day in the second quarter and the fourth quarter this year compared to last year. All segments and regions grew, with ceramics showing the strongest performance.","Our gross margin as reported was 29.5%, or 29.7% excluding non-recurring charges. That's up 200 basis points compared to 2015 results. Volume, productivity and input costs drove higher margins. SG&A was $393 million, or 18.1% of net sales excluding charges, which is flat with 2015% to net sales.","Sales and marketing investments made in the quarter were offset by leverage from higher sales this year. Our investments are benefiting both sales volume and mix for our business. Unusual charges were $7 million in the quarter, and were related primarily to acquisition integration and cost reduction through restructuring activities. We estimate $25 million to $30 million for the full year for these charges. Our operating margin excluding charges was 11.6%. The margin grew in all three segments. And our total margin grew by 200 basis points in the quarter, with volume, productivity and input cost driving improvement.","FX impacted our earnings negatively by $3 million. Interest expense at $12 million for the quarter improved due to lower rates after the $254 million 2016 bonds were rolled into our commercial paper program. We estimate our full-year interest to be in the range of $45 million to $47 million.","Other expense was $4 million, an increase over last year due to FX transactional adjustments. Our income tax rate was at 25.4%, which is 50 basis points higher than last year. We estimate our full-year tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5% for the full year, and slightly over 25% for the second quarter. Our earnings per share excluding charges were $2.38, an increase of 40%.","If we move to the segments, the Global Ceramic segment sales as reported were $774 million, which up 8% over last year, and our legacy sales were up 9% on a constant days and FX basis. On a local basis, all regions saw strong year-over-year growth. Our growth was driven primarily by volume and the KAI acquisition. FX in this segment was a $17 million headwind.","Operating income margin excluding charges was 13%, up 110 basis points, driven by volume and productivity, which offset SG&A increases and start-up cost. Investments made in SG&A and start-up costs will expand future sales and margins for us.","In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $906 million, an increase of 7% as reported. Our legacy sales on a constant days basis grew 4%. Our rise in sales was primarily from hard surface volume growth and the IVC acquisition. Our operating income margin excluding charges was 8.7%. That's an increase of 210 basis points from lower input cost, productivity improvements, and our acquisition.","In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales were $492 million, an increase of 56% as reported, with legacy sales, using constant days and FX, up 4%.","Foreign exchange was a $9 million headwind this quarter. The increase resulted primarily from our IVC acquisition. Our operating income margin excluding charges in this segment was 16.7%, an increase of 90 basis points from the acquisition, higher volume, productivity and lower input cost.","In the early second quarter, we had a fire in our sheet vinyl plant. The plant is currently running and fully repaired. And we expect our insurance to cover all property and business interruption loss, with the exception of the \u20ac500,000 deductible.","And then, finally, in our Corporate and eliminations segment, we had an operating loss of $9 million, and we expect a full-year loss of approximately $35 million.","Turning to the balance sheet, our receivables were $1.407 billion, with our days' sales outstanding flat at around 52 days, both this year and last year. Our inventories were $1.652 billion, with our inventory days continuing to show strong improvement at 109 days this year compared to 113 days last year.","Fixed assets ended the quarter at $3.224 million. And this includes in the first quarter, capital expenditures of $141 million and depreciation and amortization of $100 million. CapEx for the full year is estimated to be between $600 million and $650 million, and our depreciation and amortization is estimated at $400 million for the full year. Our long-term debt ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, and our leverage at 2.1 times debt to pro forma EBITDA.","I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Frank. Mohawk delivered another strong quarter during the first period, with all of our segments enhancing their position in the marketplace.","In the U.S., increased investments in marketing products and distribution should increase our sales and margins across all product categories. Though growth in Europe is limited and Russia remains in a recession, we're anticipating improving our market share and positioning ourselves for the future. We're investing in our businesses at the highest rate in history, to expand our product offerings, improve efficiency and increase capacity. Our recent acquisitions have been significantly integrated, and our financial leverage has been reduced. So we can pursue additional opportunities as they become available.","Taking all these factors into account, our guidance for the second quarter is $3.29 to $3.38, which would represent a 22% to 26% increase over 2015, excluding any restructuring charges. Our first quarter performance reflects the positive impact of the investments we have made in the business over the past three years. The incremental capacity increases planned for this year and next will support additional sales of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion across our businesses.","Our unique products, marketing and manufacturing position will enhance our operating results going forward.","We'll now be glad to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Please go ahead.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I'm wondering to start off with if you can talk a little bit more about some of the raw material cost. It seems like some things are working perhaps more in your favor, while others are becoming more of a headwind. Can you just give us some overview on what you're seeing there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The biggest changes in raw material are in our North American segment. Presently, the raw materials, we're assuming for the year, are going to remain about stable, given where we see the markets and the flow-through of the costs. Our mix in the cat in this segment is improving, but, at the same time, our average selling prices are coming down. As at the same time, the commodity prices have declined as the industry has passed through the raw material costs. Even with that, our margins are expected to increase from operational improvement and new product initiatives.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance","And I'll just add, because I know it will come up later. For the quarter, in the North American segment, if we look at the first quarter this year compared to first quarter last year, our input costs were a positive $25 million, which includes our raw material benefit, and then our price mix was a negative a $7 million for the quarter.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, as we sort of think about the investments that you're making this year, the $600 million or even higher than that, is that in any way reflective of sort of the pipeline of potential acquisitions that you're seeing? Has anything changed perhaps in terms of the size or the level of opportunities that you're seeing that is kind of causing a shift to more internal investment versus other opportunities?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. What we were trying to make sure we got across is that: we have absorbed the acquisitions to levels where we're doing normal incremental improvements; that the CapEx, where we've identified more of the normal projects that are in the basis and we're executing those; that the leverage has improved; that low interest rates are enabling financing of additional projects at low rates; and we believe the management and the balance sheet can take on more of both. And we're aggressively looking for them and we didn't want you to get surprised if we found more of them as we go through the year.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. The organic growth for the full company over the last year or so, it's substantially higher than we've seen in some time. I know your mix has changed as well. As you look out near-term, is there anything that would cause that to change from this kind of mid-single-digit number we've seen, either positive or negative?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We don't see anything that's going to dramatically change the trend. The investments we're putting in are trying to drive more of it. There's a timing issue between when we put them in and when they actually occur. And then, whatever happens to the markets happens and we'll adjust to it as we see it.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And I guess the follow-up question, on the investments you had referred to, is there any particular projects, you don't even have to name what they are, that are abnormally high in terms of the returns that we would see, kind of a spiky move in margins once they fully ramp in or would it be more consistent?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, listen, I'm going to try to give you a really high level which I gave in the thing I did before, but I'll try to summarize it for you. The $600 million is invested across almost the business. The major projects include a ceramic increase in the U.S. Mexico, Europe and Russia we're increasing capacity in all of the markets. We have plans to expand our LVT, wood, and premium laminate capacity in the U.S. and Europe. And we are expanding our polyester for both our carpet and rugs. I mean, those are the big high-level pieces.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance","Keith, I would just add that I wouldn't expect to see, as you described it, a spike in our margins. I think our margins, as we've said, related to all the activity that's going on in the business, we're going to continue to see them improve in each of the three segments this year compared to last year, but at a slower rate of change than what we saw in 2015.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks very much, guys. Kind of as a follow-up to that second question, or Keith's second question, you all have been doing a tremendous amount of productivity initiatives over the course of the last couple of years. And you made an interesting comment in the release about how typically you would expect to see these projects reach their fullness in one to three years. Given the number of productivity initiatives you have, I was curious if you could comment as to when you think, in aggregate, the projects that you've already undertaken are likely to see their biggest step-up. Was that in 2015? Would it be in 2016 or 2017, as far as you can see today?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There's no way for me to answer the question. There's so many numerous projects with all kinds of different timeframes in them. So and I'll give you examples on extreme. The new equipment that we're putting into our ceramic business in Europe is replacing old equipment. It's going in. We have trained people to do it. The market is there for it. So we shut down stuff. We put it in almost immediately. And almost immediately, it starts running close to what we expect.","On the other extreme, we're putting in an LVT plant that's coming up now. It's new equipment that's never been run. It's new technology that's untested. There are ideas that were put in it that haven't been utilized before. And then, you find out something and it takes you six months or more to get a new piece of equipment to replace whatever idea you had to improve it. And so, it could take a year and a half to get it optimized, or more, and you have all of the above.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance","And I would just add on to that, Steve, that in this first quarter, we had for the total business, about $29 million of productivity. And that includes, like Jeff was saying, large major CapEx projects, but a lot of smaller CapEx projects, and a lot of smaller process improvement types of projects.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","One other thing in optimizing the pieces, depends on what it is and how much capacity, it could take multiple years to utilize the capacity. So not only do you have the learning curve of going through it, it depends on the marketplace and what it is and what kind of step-change we've made in the capacity of the business, and what's going on, in the market.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So synthesizing what you're saying and trying to put it into, I guess, the language of investors, it sounds to me like you've got a number of things which are still playing out. It would certainly seem that, based on what you've said, that the lion's share of the step-up in productivity is likely not behind you, but certainly, in front of you based on the projects that you've currently got running. I mean, that's a safe assessment, right?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct. And then what we said is, we expect the margins this year to be incrementally better, but not at as a high a rate as they were last year. And then at the same time, don't forget as you're investing, there is also incremental inflation going on. Labor rates are going up. Insurance is going up. All these other things you're having the offset take away from it, in addition.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yep.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Start-up, there is a lot of start-up cost every year in the business that you're overcoming.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Yes, absolutely, I appreciate that. Second question relates to profit margins, in the IVC and Unilin businesses, I don't expect you to get terribly detailed in it, but, based on what we can see it, it seems, based on our triangulation, that IVC appears to be running at better margins in your Rest of World segment than we might have thought. And I was curious as, if you can comment, are you seeing generally similar margins at IVC to the rest of your base business in Rest of World? And if not, what do you think the timing is to sort of reach the mid-teens level that I think you've talked about for IVC in Europe?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So we don't get that granular in the information. The margins with IVC were good when we bought them. The opportunities were to leverage their knowledge in pieces across the rest of the business and to put more investment in the business to grow their different categories.","Immediately, they have helped us increase the productivity of our LVT plant in Europe. And you'll hear us that we've already announced to build another one. It'll take a year and a half to get up and going, so most of the opportunity becomes from expanding the business. They were operating fairly efficiently before we got there.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks very much, guys. Keep up the good work.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baugh from Stifel. Please go ahead.","John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. Let's see, I guess laminate expansion, I heard it was at the premium end. Given the growth of LVT and I assume the pressure it's putting on laminates, it's impressive to me that you feel you need more capacity. Could you maybe tell us what's going on? I assume that capacity is in Europe and not also in the U.S.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Our business in laminate, as we've always said, it's focused on the mid to high range of the business. Our laminate business is driven by bringing innovation to the marketplace that's differentiated. And we have led the industry in the next generations of innovation for the last 20 years. At this point, we're introducing new products that are higher style that take different equipment to make them. We have a different position in the visual looks as well as the length of planks we're changing as well as water-resistance technology. And for people interested in higher value and the best product in the marketplace, there is nothing to compare with ours. And we are expanding the sales of those businesses, even though laminate's under pressure, the higher end. And with our differentiation, we're gaining share in the marketplaces as those categories expand and people want to have better-looking products.","John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, as a follow-up to that, Jeff, and I'd also love it if you could comment on units of carpet within residential and commercial, but as a follow-up to that question, are your lower-priced laminate capacity, is that not getting fully utilized or how is that situation? Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure exactly your question, because we really don't participate in the bottom commodity part of the business. Our assets are made to take on complexity and create differentiated looks, not to make commodity products.","John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So you're running your laminate pretty full-out?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We are.","John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Any comment on residential and commercial units in the quarter? Thank you. Carpet.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The industry units I think in the quarter were about flat.","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Rednor from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Hi, good morning, Jeff and Frank. Quick question, how fast are your LVT sales growing across the business, since we can't see it with a lot of that in the acquired sales line?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We don't give out granular detail by product. To give you something as a long-term direction, we talked about the investments we have. We have three plants that are some of the biggest and most productive in the world. We're adding two lines to them. When we get all our capacity in, we'll have over $1 billion worth of LVT capacity in our organization, which I don't think there is anybody close to anywhere in the world.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Jeff, that would be including the 2017 investments that you alluded to?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct. That's correct.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","And then, just quickly on Xtratherm, you guys disclosed in the 10-K that it was a $160 million purchase price. Frank, can you give us some guidance around how much sales that asset has and levels of profitability that we should expect?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance","The multiple was about one, a little bit over one times what the selling price was. So, it's just below $200 million.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. Please go ahead.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning. I just had a question and then a follow-up. I guess the first question, Jeff, you came into the year pretty optimistic about the industry and the environment. Are you more bullish today than you were a couple months ago about 2016 and 2017?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think we're in the same position. We felt the markets were going to be reasonably good. We thought that our position in the markets were at the best it's ever been. We came in expecting to invest in all the pieces. And I think the biggest change is that these acquisitions take a while to get through and to assimilate in the business. And what you don't want to do is exceed the organization's ability to execute. And so the biggest change is the speed at which the organization has assimilated these things, and I think the organization can take on more than I thought it could six months ago.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. And then just, Frank, how should we think about the impact to FX now, just given some of the movement in rates for 2016?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance","Well, your guess is as good as ours of what the rates are going to do for the rest of the year, but with the euro at $1.13 or $1.14 right now, that's favorable to last year.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Keep up the good work. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Matthew Bouley - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, this is Matthew Bouley on for Mike. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on the earlier productivity questions. It seems like the productivity gains have been particularly strong in North America and in Ceramic. And you're starting to see some gains come through in Rest of the World as well. So just going forward, how should we think about productivity at a segment level? So, where do you expect to see the greatest gains this year and over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think we have that detailed information in front of us. I think what we keep explaining is that these investment we've been making aren't to look at. The investments are to increase our productivity. We have very strict strategies about return on investment and hurdles they have to overdo, on one side. On the other side, the margins we're getting is because we're also investing in equipment that allows us to differentiate the products in the marketplace and get higher premiums. We talked already a little bit about the laminate business. We're investing in our older equipment in our ceramic business to make bigger sizes and smaller sizes, which most of our competitors don't have the capability. And so, these investments are helping the mix, as well as the costs in all the different categories. And again, like I said, if we can find more of them, we'll do them.","Matthew Bouley - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then, just on the repair and remodel market in the U.S., just curious how you saw R&R play out during the quarter. So, if you saw an acceleration in the market and into April or if you've seen things maybe moderate a little as we exited the quarter? Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's still the slowest part of the different channels. The new construction and the commercial were better. Everything we read tells us that the consumers' going to spend more money on remodeling this year than before, all the projections we're seeing from others. We have not seen a huge upswing from the historical trends. We're still seeing the same trends we saw in the past quarters, but there is the potential that they improve significantly. And we would sure enjoy it, if it happened.","Matthew Bouley - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Okay. Thank you, and good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. Thanks and congrats on a good quarter, Jeff.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Just a question with respect to the commercial markets, what would commercial represent as a percentage of each of your three reporting segments? And can you talk about what kind of growth you experienced in the first quarter in each?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't have that detail here either. Off the top of my head, I would think that the ceramic business has the highest percentage of commercial in the segment. It would be the highest. And the lowest would be the laminate and wood businesses in that segment, because they tend to have limited amounts in the commercial business in both categories, which would leave the carpet business somewhere in between.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Once upon a time, your ceramic was about 40% commercial, but since Marazzi and everything else have come into the mix, would it still be at around that level or?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would guess it would still be in that area.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah, okay. And then, just a follow-up question, just you talked earlier about having fairly disciplined return on investment and hurtle rates with respect to internal reinvestment...","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And acquisitions.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And acquisitions, sure. I guess a lot of focus on your growth by acquisition, how that eventually becomes an organic growth driver, but as you invest CapEx back into your business, are the returns improving over the past few years or are they reflecting the pressure of the more global competitive situation?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Most of our internal investments, when fully executed, tend to be between two and four years. And most of the acquisitions tend to be more in the five year plus or minus ranges.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Your model's become so much more global over the last few years, I'm just wondering if that impacts your hurdle rates and your ROI discipline, just because it's a more competitive situation, I would guess. What's trending there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Are you talking about for acquisitions?","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Acquisitions and I guess I was approaching this at a higher level, acquisitions and internal reinvestment.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Our internal reinvestments, if they don't meet our hurdle rates, we won't invest in them unless it's something you have to have just to maintain the business. And so we have processes that we go through that say if they don't reach these rates, we're not going to utilize our money to go after it and find something else \u2013 and tends to be the fastest things are replacing existing equipment, because the risks are very low and you know that they're going to operate at fairly high levels as soon as you do them.","On the other extreme, probably the difference between putting in new capacity in new product categories and something you own, what happens is it takes a longer time to build up the sales on the front-end, so you have the cost and the learning curve on the front-end without enough volume.","So those tend to be a little longer, but the difference is the returns in the first year or two are lower, but when you get out to year five and six, they're much higher than the acquisitions as you go through. And then the acquisitions are all over the place. If you buy a really good business, you're going to have lower returns. If you buy one that's in difficulty, you're supposed to have better returns as you change the strategies within the business.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. The first, just pulling the string again on acquisitions and particularly in the ceramic business, you're moving from the floor to more applications on the tile. As you move up the value chain in terms of building products, as you expand your total product line, what is your openness to go beyond just the walls, but even to look at other product categories that are tangential or adjacencies to help fuel additional growth?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, we've already done it in multiple occasions. For instance, we're one of the largest countertop distributors in the country today. And we got into it because we started out with ceramic flooring. Then we went to stone flooring, then the next adjacency over was stone countertops. Hence, we moved into it. So, the countertop business is an adjacency we've already moved into. We get the largest benefit out of buying things that are in the categories we're in that we can leverage our knowledge and marketing and distribution across the new business, and we get the least synergies out of going into something that's brand new.","As we get further from where we are and we've done it when we moved from carpet to ceramic or ceramic to laminate or laminate to vinyl, what you see is, that when you see us move into the categories, we normally start by buying the best competitor in the marketplace. And the reason is we're buying the knowledge of the category as well as the business. And we start with the best. And then what we try to do it is feed it additional capital and try to see if there is other synergies between how we operate businesses, the information systems, the methodologies. And those things create more benefit. And then, as long as we're staying in things that go through the same customers and channels, we can actually pull their products into our channels and vice versa as we go through.","The extent past there is going into totally new geographies. And we've gone into them both ways. We've gone into them Greenfield. And we've gone into them by buying what we perceive to be typically best-of-class in the category, too.","On the other hand, we break our own rules. When we got Marazzi, we got a ceramic business in Europe that was performing horribly. And we put in a new management group in that and made that work. So, I think the only thing you can say about our strategy is we have the capacity to work in all types of environments.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","And taking it one step further, if you were to look two to three years out, and given the remarkable progress you've made in the previous, say, three years, but looking three years out, what percentage of your sales would you believe will be to flooring and the balance being to essentially all other categories? And how does that differ from today?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're beyond my known horizon. I can tell you that if I can find enough things to invest and the things that I have is core knowledge basis, I would prefer that over others. For me to go into the other ones, something that we don't know, we're going to have to find the right candidate that gives us the right knowledge base, and we have to be a strong base in what we do to do that, we would consider it.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on some sales and marketing investments, especially in the North American market, just wanted to get a sense, obviously,, on the sales side, those are more longer-term investments, but on marketing, how should we think of that? Are these more sort of one-time short-term investments in marketing or should we think about a higher overall level of marketing spend over the next year or so?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The biggest pieces of them are in expanding the sales force in order to get to more customers. And up until the point we said that our goal was to increase the margins and we were getting leverage out of it, we said last year, we're going to move from driving leveraging it to increase the margins to driving expansion, which we said we were going to do through expanding the sales forces, putting more investments in samples, putting more investments in displays in stores, and putting out more product categories and more differentiated products, which we would believe should help our business, margins, and market shares.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Okay, okay. And then, just a quick follow-up on that, you've talked in previous calls about, specifically about expanding their Pergo brand into different categories. I think I've seen it at some of the big box stores. Where are you in that process? And how are you feeling about how it's going?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're actually in the middle of expanding Pergo into the LVT and to laminate and engineered wood in different categories. And then we are looking at finding the right partners and distribution channels to do that, and we're at various stages throughout the year in implementing those things.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question....","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just to make a note, Pergo is the most known brand in the flooring industry. So utilizing it and optimizing it across different product categories, we think is a big opportunity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Good morning. Thanks. The first question I had was just on the overall outlook as it's coming together for demand for 2016. Jeff, you mentioned in your opening remarks that first quarter has exceeded expectations and also pointing to perhaps the potential for repair remodel in the U.S. to accelerate in the back half. So I was wondering if you could kind of give us a sense of how that kind of impacts your outlook for organic growth for the company for the full year. I mean, at this point, obviously, doing 6% organic on an adjusted basis is very, very solid. Would that type of organic growth, should we expect for that to continue throughout the rest of the year?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, you're clever. You're trying to get to give you future estimates beyond the one quarter I gave you. I think that we're going to see a good year in the category. We've said that we think that it's going to be the trends of the industry will be similar to last year. You said it right. The biggest opportunity is for the remodeling business to increase, because the big upside there is not only is it more volume, the mix of the products are higher and they're higher margin.","So, those are opportunities to go there. I think all things are in place to increase our mix, our margins as we go through. And I think what we've said is we anticipate the incremental increase in margins to be slightly less than they were last year. It gets harder and harder to keep pushing up the margins. And the sales we'll get to see with you when they happen.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No. I appreciate that. And second question, just on the investments, a lot of discussion around that, but when you talk about, again, just so I understand it fully, the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion that you expect to realize over the next three years, so I guess I'm thinking 2017 through 2019, is there a way to think about that amount of sales relative to just supporting your ability to grow with the market versus market share gains? In other words, given that you're at capacity in different of your plants, it sounds like part of this is just needed to meet the market growth itself. So, any kind of help on that $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion around what's, in other words, supporting the just natural market growth versus what might be thought of as in terms of share gains would be very helpful.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure I have an answer that's easy for you. I mean, you're right. At the size we're at, 5% of $8 billion is $400 million to grow 5% a year. We're putting in capacity for multiple years as well as going into new product categories, which takes further. So, I mean, if you say you're going to grow at these rates for time, it requires these investments to do it, and we're putting them in ahead in order to support it. How much we're going to take in share or not, I don't really know how to answer the question.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Maybe we'll circle back on that later. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jane (sic) [James] Armstrong from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First one is on the market share of LVT in general, what do you think the market share of LVT, as a percentage of total floor, has grown to and what do you think the trend is in the next few years?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, we're talking in the U.S. market. In the U.S...","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","U.S. and globally, yeah.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure I know all those numbers off the top of my head. I think in the U.S., it's probably in the 7%, 8% range today. We think it's going to grow mid-teens as a category. So, the 7% or 8% in dollars would be about $1.4 billion maybe today.","And you can figure $200 million a year, 15% give or take. So there is a lot of requirements as it's growing. The difference in it and laminate, for instance, it's in every market and every category where laminate wasn't. And we'll get to see how far it grows over time. As you can tell from our position, we think we have leading technology in the manufacturing of it. We think we have unique knowledge in the style and design of it, which we get from both our ceramic and laminate and wood businesses that we already have. And so, we're positioning ourselves to be a leader in it.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. That helps a lot. And then, switching gears, you talked about picking up market share in Russia and that should help when the market over there improves. What do you think your market share in Russia has grown to, and what do you think it can do in the next few years as well?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let's see. I think the Russian market has probably declined 35% in total since the thing started down. Our business is up, and so we're taking share from somebody. Some of it's coming from imported products that have gotten close to disappearing from the marketplace, which at one point were a large part. I would guess our share is probably somewhere in the 15% share as we start. Our strategy in Russia is we are focused on the mid to high end part of the marketplace. We have the only brand in Russia. We have owned distribution across Russia. We have about 300 and something franchise stores across Russia, which we own about 15%, 20% of.","So we're well-positioned in the high end part of the marketplace, and we think we can keep exploiting it. We're basically running all our capacity. And then we're putting in new capacity this year that actually makes a higher level of product that historically would have come out of Italy.","And our intention is to become the premium supplier of it. And that's where we are. And we think it is a good opportunity if the market ever turns around, we'll be in really good shape. And the negative at the time, though, is our margins are declining as we're driving our business through the market.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","In terms of the SG&A investment, the sales force and the sample investment that you're making, I think SG&A was flat as a percentage of sales for this last quarter. As we move forward, how should we expect that to perform, both in terms of how you're strategically managing it and how the timing of the investments lines up?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What you see is the total. So what you're really seeing is higher investments in certain categories offset by continued leverage in other ones. So presently, it's about flat. As we go through the year, you should see some improvement in it, even though we've been increasing others. So we expect the investments to level out and get some benefit from them as we go through the year, but you still have large parts of the business that are decreasing those costs as a percent of sales.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","In a similar vein, as you think about start-up costs for the capacity adds, where are we in that continuum? Does that number increase and then level off or is the 1Q representative of sort of what the peak of that might look like?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think...","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","I'm thinking about how that impacts the margin of the business.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let's see. I think this year, the start-up costs in the first quarter were around $10 million.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance","$10 million in the first quarter and we could see $25 million to $30 million for the full year.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","This year.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance","And we'll have more start-up costs in next year as well.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And then lastly, just to circle back on revenue, the payback from these investments you've talked about is to sustain or drive revenue growth. As you look at where you are now and where you've been, are these investments to sustain the current rate of growth or to create incremental growth versus where you are now?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes in both, in all categories. So let's talk about when my ceramic business in North America. I am selling basically all I can make. I am supplementing it with product out of my other manufacturing regions. We have a new plant coming up. And so we think that the ceramic industry could grow this year in North America 5%, 6%, could be more or less. And it takes about a year and a half from the time you start the project to get the capacity up. So what you see is our investments are supporting the things a year, a year and a half out or more. If we don't invest now, we won't have it then.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. My question's been answered. Everything was crystal clear. Thanks very much.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Starr from Nuveen Asset Management. Please go ahead.","Laura E. Starr - Nuveen Asset Management LLC","Hi. How are you? You answered a question earlier about those adjacency businesses, the non-flooring, whether it's wall or countertop businesses are growing. And I actually just had a question sort of on the wall surface businesses. I know that's growing very nicely. Is that all in the tile business or are there wall surfaces that are actually engineered surfaces? And where is the demand coming from mostly? Is it a consumer demand? Is it commercial demand, hospitality, office, healthcare, if you could just give a little bit more information on that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The business that we're putting on the wall is mostly ceramic tile. And ceramic wall tile is expanding. There is a trend in the marketplace to put decorative walls using various surfaces from wood, to laminate, to ceramic on the walls as we go through. It's a trend that's just starting. We think it's going to continue expanding. And we're trying to figure out how to push the strategy even faster with people decorating the pieces in there. There are some new technologies in ceramic to make really large wall spaces out of ceramic, for instance, could be a new opportunity down the road. Any of the product categories we make could be used as decorative pieces, but not as coverings over 100% of the walls.","Laura E. Starr - Nuveen Asset Management LLC","And in commercial versus consumer right now or where do you think it's going?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's going everywhere.","Laura E. Starr - Nuveen Asset Management LLC","Okay. And then, this decorative stuff, that's obviously going to be a much higher margin, right, versus just plain old tile on the floor?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It will be. When you start getting to create new markets and new things, they take a while to mature. So, when you go into new products, it doesn't happen overnight.","Laura E. Starr - Nuveen Asset Management LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lorberbaum. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We had a good quarter.

Today, we'll update you on the company's third quarter results for 2019 and provide guidance for the fourth quarter.","I would like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussions on non-GAAP numbers.

Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Ken.","Our third quarter operating results were in line with our expectations so we\u2019re not satisfied with our performance. Our sales were $2.5 billion roughly flat as reported on a constant basis. Our adjusted operating income for the period was $250 million or 10% of sales. Compared to the prior year, the U.S. dollar strengthened creating a $35 million impact on our translated revenues.","As anticipated, our U.S. businesses presented the greatest challenges during the period given soft retail demand, the impact of LVT, a stronger dollar, and excess ceramic inventories in the industry. Lower interest rates in the U.S. are positively impacting housing starts and home sales and many believe this could be the beginning of an improving housing market.","During the period, duties on imported ceramic tiles were increased by an additional 104% which will largely stop shipments coming into the market. Trends in our other major markets weakened creating a more competitive environment. In most regions significant political and trade uncertainties are affecting consumer confidence in spending. In response to economic concerns, Central Banks in many countries are lowering interest rates to stimulate growth. We expect the present condition to persist in the near-term, and we will further adjust our strategies as needed.","We're progressing on the initiatives to improve our business, with the most significant of these being aligning the ceramic production with demand in the U.S., realigning our North American carpet operation, optimizing our LVT manufacturing, and ramping up our new plant. In addition, we're entering new product categories, introducing innovative product extensions, and optimizing our recent acquisitions. We\u2019re investing in more sales personnel and marketing to increase our penetration in new and existing products. We continue to streamline our operations to enhance efficiencies and we're leveraging automation and process enhancements to lower our cost.","Our free cash flow for the quarter is up year-over-year and our balance sheet remains strong. Since the beginning of the third quarter, we purchased over 740,000 shares for approximately $91 million under our stock purchase program.","For view of our financial performance during the period, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn Landau","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.","Moving right into our financial performance and year-over-year bridges, as Jeff shared third quarter total company net sales were $2.5 billion roughly flat on a constant basis compared to prior year or down 1% as reported.","Year-to-date total company net sales were up 2.8% on a constant basis and flat as reported through the third quarter.","Organic growth in legacy businesses was down 2.5% in the third quarter on a constant basis, bringing our year-to-date legacy growth down 1.6% versus the first three quarters of 2018.","In terms of earnings, the company's adjusted operating income was $250 million in the third quarter or 9.9% of sales. This is off 242 basis points from the third quarter last year largely due to weaker ceramic volume as expected. With that said the company's year-over-year decline in margins improved modestly on a sequential basis by 15 basis points, which represents now three consecutive quarters of improvement.","Bridging from the prior year third quarter, adjusted operating earnings were impacted by one, lower overall volume of $16 million, largely in Flooring North America and Global Ceramics and associated market-related shutdown costs of $9 million all in our Global Ceramics segment to match our supply with our demand in order to manage our inventories in the U.S.","An increase of inflation of about $19 million due to higher wages and benefits partially offset by lower raw materials, an erosion in price mix of $15 million largely in our Flooring Rest of the World segment as input costs have eased, and $10 million higher spending in SG&A as other and other due to investments in sales and talent and marketing to drive sales, including product rollout initiatives and new start-ups.","Moving to the positive offsets productivity, including lower start-up costs swung positive by $8 million versus last year due to better utilization and non-repeating one-time costs.","Lastly, FX translation impact was unfavorable by approximately $3 million.","Still at the enterprise level, SG&A per net sales across the enterprise was 17.8% excluding unusual items. Special and unusual items in the quarter consisted of approximately $10 million in restructuring and integration costs impacting operating income, primarily in Flooring North America, of which most was for cash, and $65 million or $43 million after-tax write-down of our investments in a Chinese supplier in the other income line as a consequence of the September ruling by the U.S. Commerce Department imposing an incremental 104% countervailing duty on ceramic title, effectively stopping Mohawk purchases from this Chinese entity. With this partial offset by about $8 million due to transactional FX in other income for a total special and unusual items of $66 million before tax.","Back to our restructuring and integration for the full-year, we expect to complete the $94 million as previously disclosed this year, plus a further $15 million to $25 million, some of which may fall into 2020. And as we shared last quarter, the cash components of the restructuring of approximately $30 million to $35 million should be recovered in about a year as lower costs.","Adjusted EBITDA was $398 million or 15.8% before interest expense of $9 million, which was flat with last year.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.3% and is expected to move into a range of 17% to 19% in the fourth quarter, driving full-year guidance down to the 19% to 20% range.","Finally, adjusted net earnings per share was $2.75 in the quarter down from $3.29 or 16% versus last year.","Turning now to the segments. Global Ceramics delivered sales of $916 million, an increase of 4.3% on a constant basis versus last year or 3.5% as reported. Operating income on an adjusted basis was $86 million or 9.3% of net sales down from 13.4% margin last year primarily due to weaker demand and higher U.S. inventories associated with duties. Compared to last year, inflation was $18 million higher driven by higher material costs and wages. Volume was softer by $11 million inclusive of $9 million in downtime. Sales and marketing costs were up $8 million and price mix slipped $2 million. All of this partially offset by improved productivity and lower start-up costs of $6 million. FX was neutral in the quarter.","In the Flooring North American segments the business showed better overall performance with sales of $1 billion down 4.4% versus last year as continued weakness in soft surfaces were partially offset by solid laminate performance and continued significant growth in LVT. Adjusted operating income improved for the second quarter in a row sequentially as Flooring North America earned $84 million or 8.4% of net sales in the third quarter, cutting the year-over-year deficit to $20 million versus $47 million in the second quarter. Compared to last year volume accounted for the majority of the deficit down $17 million versus last year and inflation the rest of a net $7 million with improved raw material costs partially offsetting higher wages and benefits. Turning positive price mix improved $4 million and productivity less reduced start-up costs was also positive.","Moving to Flooring Rest of the World, the segment had sales of $601 million, up 2.5% versus last year on a constant basis but down 1.9% as reported, with legacy sales holding at 0.4% at a constant basis. Adjusted operating income came in at $89 million or 14.8% in the quarter off 100 basis points versus last year in a competitive environment. Compared to last year, the business continues to manage well in a more difficult environment supported by solid LVT, laminate, and installation performance.","The primary headwind in the quarter was an erosion of price mix of $17 million largely offset by relief in overall inflation of $10 million by lower input costs and modest improvements in volume and productivity totaling $4 million. Additionally, investments in sales and product marketing were $2 million higher in the quarter and FX translation was unfavorable by $3 million.","Finally at the corporate level expenses and eliminations drove an operating loss of $9 million with a full-year estimate holding the range of $35 million to $40 million.","Speaking now to the balance sheet receivables ended the quarter at $1.8 billion with days sales outstanding up due to changes in geographic and channel mix. Inventories ended the quarter at approximately $2.3 billion or 126 days flat with the prior quarter and higher year-over-year by $124 million through the ramp-up of new investments, acquisitions, and increased source products.","Fixed costs for the quarter ended at $4.6 billion down $100 million compared to the prior quarter on capital expenditures of $125 million in the period lower than depreciation which was $145 million and in line with the plan.","For the full-year, CapEx we are on track to spend about $575 million which is depreciation up to $595 million depending on timing. Total debt was $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter, down $300 million since exiting the second quarter with leverage declining to 1.7 times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. We also closed our efforts to renew our credit revolver for the full $1.8 billion for five-years plus two automatic one-year extension.","So wrapping up the balance sheet is strong and getting stronger with free cash flow of $286 million in the quarter, totaling $572 million year-to-date, giving us line of sight to our expected solid cash year, in addition to at $700 plus million.","With that, Chris, I'll turn it over to you.","Chris Wellborn","Thank you, Glenn.","In our Global Ceramics segment, our businesses around the world are under pressure caused by slowing economies. Excess industry capacities are creating more pricing and margin pressures. In most of our markets, commercial is outperforming retail as consumers are postponing purchases.","In U.S., ceramic retailers are promoting lower price points, consumers shifting to LVT, and inventories remain high in the channel. During the quarter, the U.S. imposed increased tariffs on Chinese imports and further anti-dumping duties are anticipated. At these levels, U.S. ceramic purchases will be shifted to manufacturers around the world and should benefit Mohawk and other domestic manufacturers. The excess inventories created by the tariffs will take time to be absorbed in the channel.","We expect the U.S. ceramic market to remain soft in the near-term and we are taking actions to improve our sales and costs. We are expanding our offering of stone looks and polished tiles and we are introducing additional value collections. We are adding more salespeople in major markets to increase our participation in commercial projects. We are rolling out new online processes to make our customer ordering and pick-up faster and easier. To complement our ceramic offering, we are selling Dovetail LVT for commercial applications and will introduce residential LVT collection.","We are initiating a limited launch of our new easy installation ceramic tile and we will expand more broadly at the beginning of the year. This patented system cuts the installation time in half with limited expertise and we are receiving positive feedback as we demonstrate the benefits. We're developing new markets for porcelain, roofing and thick landscape tiles which over time will create new sales channels for our business.","Our new countertop plant in Tennessee is ramping up processes and formulations are being refined and new products are being created. Utilizing state-of-the-art robotics, we have begun manufacturing premium countertops that will improve our sales and mix. We are presently staffed to operate three shifts and will expand production further next year.","We have outperformed the Mexican ceramic industry by expanding our product offering and growing our customer base. We are hiring additional architectural reps to increase our commercial sales and enhancing our collections with premium porcelain, large sizes and new wall tile products. We're supporting stores exclusively carrying Dovetail products and expanding our trucking fleet to improve service and costs.","The Brazilian market is showing some signs of recovery and we have outpaced the market with our premium brand and offering. We have a strong position in the new construction market which is outperforming residential remodeling.","We are replacing an old ceramic line with new porcelain production that is more efficient and will produce larger sizes when operational early next year. To meet present capacity needs, we have also restarted two previously idle lines.","The European ceramic industry has slowed with the overall economies and lower exports to other regions. Excess industry capacity and inflation is compressing margins as we are selling more lower value tile, which reduced our mix.","Commercial is outperforming residential and we are leveraging our comprehensive offering, expanding our specification team, and adding showrooms in major cities to grow. Declining consumer confidence is impacting discretionary spending and is compressing the retail remodeling channels. Our commercial technical tile, porcelain slabs and outdoor products are gaining traction and strengthening our higher value offerings.","We are reinforcing our leading design with larger porcelain slabs for walls, printed registration that delivers more realistic visuals, and slip-resistant styles for commercial application. Our resin ceramic business is the market leader and is gaining share due to our national distribution systems owned and franchise stores and project specification teams.","Our technology, design, and scale, give us the foremost position in the premium category as well as a cost advantage. To complement our tile business, we are constructing a small sanitary ware plant that should be operational in the first quarter next year.","In our Flooring North America segment, our margins have improved compared to the prior quarter due to increased sales, lower material costs, and operational initiatives partially offset by lower product mix and inflation in labor.","The business has been reorganized by product category to enhance our sales, product, and operational strategies and execution. By volume carpet still represents by far the largest category in the North American Flooring market though it\u2019s losing share to hard surfaces. Polyester carpets continue to gain share in the soft market which has reduced our overall product mix.","We have completed the expansion of our recycled polyester fiber to support continued growth in the category. We have expanded our offering of multi-colored and pattern carpet as consumer preferences shift from solid colors. We're preparing our new residential introductions earlier this fall, so they can be in the market sooner next year.","The realignment of our residential carpet manufacturing will be largely complete in the fourth quarter and will improve our cost, quality, and service. We are aligning our operations for lower residential carpet volumes and utilizing our best assets. We have closed higher cost extrusion and dying assets and consolidated yarn and tufting production. We have increased automation in upgraded assets to improve our backing and yarn costs. Beyond asset rationalization, we have enhanced our continuous improvement processes to increase efficiencies and process controls.","Our commercial business continues to outperform with carpet tile and LVT growing fastest. We are expanding our sales organization and increasing our carpet tile manufacturing. We have broadened our carpet tile offering with new pattern technology with unique visuals and value alternatives.","We are launching more flexible LVT options for commercial that provides acoustic advantages and are more comfortable underfoot.","During the period, LVT sales outperformed the other categories with demand remaining strong and LVT operations continue to improve production, volume, speeds, and costs. One of our LVT lines is specialized on rigid products, while the other is producing flexible products, with each providing unique features for different requirements.","In September, we set a record for rigid production levels, and the flexible line is now running at comparable speeds to our European operations. Our rigid LVT line is focused on the production of SPC which is the fastest growing category today. We continue to transfer operational improvements that have been executed in Europe to increase throughput and introduce additional features. We have specific ongoing actions that will further increase our output and lower our costs through the first quarter. To utilize our increasing production, we are introducing new products and features under our best brands for both the retail and commercial markets.","Our manufactured sheet vinyl sales continue to grow as we broaden our offering and expand our position in the multifamily and home center channels.","We expanded our waterproof laminate offerings and used our premium laminate collections is extending throughout the home in the remodeling and new construction channels. Our Redwood collection is providing a desirable alternative for both LVT and natural woods with a superior scratch and dent resistance, state-of-the-art visuals and greater value.","We have developed proprietary technology so that our laminate better replicates real wood and has superior water resistance. To support our laminate business, we are upgrading our HDF manufacturing to increase our capacity and improve our cost.","In a slower environment, our Flooring Rest of World segment delivered solid results driven by product innovation, cost improvements, new businesses, and acquisitions.","Our new LVT sheet vinyl, laminate and carpet tile operations are making progress in reaching our expected levels.","In laminate, we outperformed the market as our new premium products with waterproof features gain momentum and improved our mix. We have introduced the Signature collection, which sets the standard for the most realistic visuals and we're adding our waterproof technology to most of our products.","We have further increased our direct distribution footprint with the acquisition of our Eastern European distributor. Our direct distribution strategy positions us closer to our customers and provides them with greater service and value.","Our Russian laminate expansion is operating at expected levels and our sales are growing as we expand our customer base.","As our LVT production increases, we are expanding our product offerings and sales to grow all segments of the market. In rigid, we're introducing new collections with embossed and registration to utilize our increasing capacity. We continue to enhance our line speeds, yield, and formulations to improve our cost position. This process will continue into next year when we anticipate achieving our plant production rates and cost. To increase our distribution, we\u2019re offering retailers fashionable products with better value, service, and inventory turns to enhance their results.","Our sheet vinyl business is performing stronger as our new resin plant expands sales and volume increases. The new plant has freed up capacity in Europe, so we can expand our offerings and customer base.","Our installation business is performing well with volumes at historically high levels; our margins remain good even though pricing has declined, along with lower material cost.","Our panel business has slowed, reducing our pricing and volume partially offset by mix and lower materials. To further improve our cost this year, we are expanding our internal glue production. Next year we will increase our use of recycled wood and start-up a new plant that generates energy from wastewood.","In Australia\/New Zealand, the integration of our acquisition is largely complete, while the regional economies have softened, interest rates have been reduced, and there are some signs in improving housing market. To increase our market share, we are upgrading our hard and soft surface product offerings. We are investing to expand our retail distribution and commercial carpet tile production. We have completed the closing of high cost assets in Australia which will benefit our results moving forward.","With that, I'll return the call to you, Jeff.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you.","We see the present market conditions continuing, and we're taking actions to better position our business for the future. We're investing more in sales and marketing to expand placement of our products and increase the utilization of our new plants.","Our new Greenfield projects will progress as sales and costs improve. Our LVT production is improving and increased distribution will follow. Our U.S. and European ceramic businesses are being impacted by lower market demand and we're reducing inventory levels, expanding product offerings, and entering new categories. The restructuring of our U.S. corporate operations will be substantially complete this year and will benefit our costs next year. Taking this into account, our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter is $2.13 to $2.23 excluding one-time charges.","We will adapt our business strategies to the future circumstance as required. Next year our business will benefit from our new products, higher utilization of our start-ups, and cost reductions we have taken in 2019. Our results and balance sheet should improve with strong cash generation to take advantage of future opportunities. We have a strong Global Management team and they are focused on enhancing our results and optimizing our long-term profitability.","With that, we will be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Your first question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Baugh","Thank you. Good morning and I wanted to focus on the North American revenue performance which I think was down just a little over 4% in the quarter versus the prior quarter, second quarter where it was down 7%. Is there any way you could give some more detail on sort of what drove that in terms of laminate versus LVT? And then, was carpet down about similarly I guess? And then also, what -- where we sit today in terms of sourced LVT sales versus produced and I appreciate the record comment of rigid production but not sure how to quantify that? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The carpet industry remains under pressure and is losing share. The industry declined about 7% in units with commercial outperforming residential pieces but we see housing sales remodeling could improve as we go forward.","The LVT manufacturing, the other businesses, the laminate business is doing well as we introduced new products that are going into different markets and satisfying all the different markets and acting as an alternative to the other waterproof products in the category. The LVT continued to increase as the sales goes up, as the production goes up. We're increasing new products into the marketplace with different visuals and performance features, which will help us more next year than immediately as we go through. We think the throughput of plant is going to keep going up and we're lining new customers to use it next year as we go forward.","John Baugh","Jeff, on laminate, I thought I heard in there particle board expansion. It was right -- is that in the U.S. or in Europe, I've been worried a little about by the U.S. laminate production rate and it sounds like it\u2019s reasonably strong?","JeffLorberbaum","In U.S. it\u2019s a HDF board which we make the core products in, we have exceeded the capacities of the plants. So we are upgrading them in order to increase the throughput and lower the cost to support the business.","Chris Wellborn","John, just also a comment that premium laminate is growing as an alternative for wood and LVT, while the lower end laminate is declining. The technologies we use that make it very realistic as an alternative to wood, it has superior visual, scratch resistance, water resistance. So we're doing quite well.","John Baugh","Then lastly quickly, Chris. So what can you see or discern in terms of industry ceramic inventory in the United States, where do we sit? Is that getting better I appreciate you won\u2019t see a benefit until we get into 2020. But is there any improvement?","Chris Wellborn","Yes, I think it's a good idea to first explain the difference between our company and the industry. But let's answer your question first the industry. We don't really know exactly what the inventory levels shows, we only see import volume, not the actual inventory. What we know is that this year, the Chinese inventory spiked in front of these tariffs. And our customers are telling us that they have a lot of inventory. Going forward, that will be an opportunity for us as those Chinese inventories deplete, we have options to replace those with our internal production and we have a very short supply chain which should put us in a good position as the industry inventories deplete.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much guys, appreciate it, encouraging signs, particularly in Flooring North America. I just wanted to make a comment as well as a question, my comment both about making permanent adjustments in capacity. First, the comment you've been implementing what I would call a formalized restructuring program in carpet this year, and you've given a lot of qualitative commentary about the rationale and the actions you're taking. But unlike, we get with a lot of other public companies restructuring plans; the Street hasn't had a set of quarterly numbers to model with and track your progress --","Jeff Lorberbaum","Operator, we lost you. We lost you for a minute.","Stephen Kim","Oh, I apologize for that. I guess what I was saying is that we don't get from you a good sense of in this corporate restructuring, what the ultimate annualized savings opportunity is and how much should land and what quarter? And I think if you could do that, I think it would really help investors with a medium to longer-term opportunity, prognosis or making that projection. And so in a related way, my question is in ceramic. What would you need to see, Chris, with respect to your assessment or your ability to assess supply\/demand in the industry, to embark on a restructuring program in ceramic, will you take out some older capacity to accelerate the inventory decline? Much like what you are currently doing in carpet?","Chris Wellborn","Okay, yes, I can answer that. So this is what we have going on in our Global Ceramic, generally, we have slower economic conditions and greater competition in the market. If you look at the U.S., it's mostly impacted by LVT growth, excess inventory from tariffs and a stronger dollar. And if you look at Europe, it's impacted more by a slowing economy and lower exports to other regions.","And in that environment, as you know, which we expect to remain for some time, we have taken actions to reduce our inventories. And that's contributed to the favorable cash flow that you see.","Now going forward, we're taking a lot of actions to improve our business. We're adding sales people while we're continuing to reduce our internal costs. We're introducing products that are alternatives for imports. We're introducing pioneering really new easy installation tile, roofing and outdoor products. And at the -- what we're looking for then is we've got our inventories in good shape, we will by the end of the year, we're about to ramp-up with all these new products and salespeople. And we have the opportunity to take share from these imports. And I think as you go through the year, our hope is that these things kick-in, and that we are able to use our capacity.","Stephen Kim","Got it. So we really shouldn't be expecting a significant restructuring where you're taking capacity out because you think your inventories are going to be pretty much in good shape by the end of the year, that\u2019s very encouraging.","Chris Wellborn","Yes. Our inventories will be in good shape and we think we have opportunities to grow the business.","Stephen Kim","Yes, that\u2019s very encouraging. I appreciate it. If I could just follow-on in terms of LVT in Europe, you made some comments about how, when we went down there recently, Jeff, I think you mentioned that 90% of the market over there in LVT is actually flex-LVT, not rigid LVT. And I just wanted to clarify, from your press release, it sounded almost like you could make more rigid product over there than you can sell and so you're increasing your sales force over there. So that that was a little surprising because it sounds almost like that means that when you started making the facility building the line that since that time the market for rigid in Europe grew slower than you thought while in the U.S. obviously the markets grown way faster for rigid. So just wondering if you could clarify that?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes, the market in Europe is still primarily flexible and there's click and non-click. The rigid is a relatively limited share of the total market, but we think it's going to grow quickly. Our equipment that we put in will make either or as you go through. So we're introducing new products in rigid and we're going to try to push the market to sell more rigid as we go but our equipment will make both.","The other side is the marketplace is also selling much less of it. It has about half the market share in Europe. It does in the U.S. and the growth rates less than half also. So the markets are nothing alike.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First I just wanted to hit on just trying to get a sense of progress with LVT. And obviously, you mentioned some encouraging factoids about September production of rigid and also matching the European production. When you look at the incremental lines that you put together over the last year and as they've been ramping, where would you peg the capacity utilization of those lines given the progress that you've highlighted so far on your press release today in your comments, how should we think about the capacity utilization is it of the two lines in the U.S. and Europe, are we talking about 75% or greater and similarly from a margin standpoint, how should we think about where you -- what margins those that that production is producing is it still below average or is that a higher level of capacity utilization, is it more in line with the corporate average?","Jeff Lorberbaum","You have to separate U.S. and Europe into different pieces. The U.S. business is utilizing all the capacity as it's running now. And as it speeds up, we have avenues to use it as well as the substitute other product categories we have, as it ramps up.","In Europe, we don't source any products. So as it ramps up, we have to build the sales for it in front of it and you have to put the products in the marketplace. So in Europe, we're going to get ahead of the production rate, we're going to get ahead of the sales rate, and it's going to have to catch-up in the interim. On the cost, none of the costs are where we want them because we don't have the throughput and the material formulation where we want them and we've said we have ongoing programs, week-to-week, and it will go into next, into first of next year and we expect to hit our targeted cost structure sometime as we go into next year.","The other part is the mix on the products and the product mix, you start out with selling the products to use the capacity and then over time, you try to move the product mix up by selling higher value products, which takes time in the marketplace.","Michael Rehaut","Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate that, Jeff. And I guess just one other one if I could squeeze one in, please, on the price mix. I believe you said that, it kind of netted out roughly neutral maybe it's just a slight headwind year-over-year. I want to get a sense of sequentially how you're looking at price mix, how it went from 2Q to 3Q in each of the segments and if that's still kind of a moving target, and obviously, there's been some slippage there. I was hoping if you can address each of the segments directionally sequentially, where price mix particularly mix has trended in 3Q and how you see that playing out through the rest of the year?","JeffLorberbaum","Listen in general, all the businesses the price mix is declining as the volume and the different categories are under pressure. And as people -- as our customers tend to use price to attract cost consumers on one hand and on the other as we tend to sell more lower value products to utilize the plant hire. So they're all going lower.","Chris Wellborn","All I'd add to that is that for the enterprise, it's lower, like Jeff says $15 million, but that's largely in Flooring Rest of the World, but that's with lot of input costs easing. So I think offline we could bridge the quarter by segments. But the theme is essentially that is that there's competitive marketplace out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Phil Ng","Hey, guys, in the last 18 months or so you've obviously had a lot of headwinds, whether it's drawn down production with the downdraft in demand, price costs and start-up costs, way on profitability, when you kind of look at 2020, do you expect these headwinds to moderate and some of the self-help initiatives to kind of kick in and drop through the bottom-line where margins could actually be up your view next year, it would be helpful kind of tie all that together?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The market in general, as we keep talking about is under pressure. And we keep aligning the businesses with the markets. As we look forward, you see us investing more in sales and marketing to increase our share both in existing products as well as to get these new factories up and running.","The positive pieces are the North American restructuring is going to start benefiting the business next year. The LVT lines will be operating more efficiently. These other plants we\u2019re talking about will start adding value versus being a drag on the pieces. And the marketplace will have to keep reacting to whatever happens.","Phil Ng","Got it. And just one last one, Chris, I believe on the call you mentioned that you expect your inventory on ceramics to be in pretty good shape by the end of the year. If that's the case, obviously the back half of this year you've had a big drag on production curtailment for ceramics, should that become like a neutral event when you think about early next year then?","Chris Wellborn","Well, I think as we -- next year as we go into next year we've got all these things to drive our business and how we utilize that capacity will really depend on how fast they ramp up.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Michael Wood","Hi, good morning. I wanted to shift gears to carpet, particularly in nylon. I'm curious how small that\u2019s become as a portion of your mix in carpet and can you scale operation in nylon specifically enough to achieve the required returns that you have?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The nylon part of the business has declined in residential. And we have another category that we compete against nylon with we call smart strand, which is made out of Triexta. Both of those things compete in the higher end of the business. And we have a much larger business in Triexta than we do on nylon in the residential category. On the commercial side, you have the nylon makes up the majority of it and still does and isn't changing.","Michael Wood","Got it. Okay. And could you also just talk briefly about how you're running promotions in ceramics in terms of like how that would actually phase out once the inventory gets worked down? Thanks.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Well, what we're doing in ceramic in some cases, we're running promotions with but I won\u2019t even call value engineered products to go after build your business that was where they were previously using LVT. So that's one product that we have offered. We\u2019re also have products aimed at getting the products that the Chinese product that will stop coming into the United States. So those are the two main areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. Questions in ceramic, I think you said it was $18 million of higher input costs in the quarter, soon after that couple of quarters now specifically what product or what inputs are driving that up?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Well, in particular, in South America and in Europe, we had higher costs for energy, that\u2019s for one. And then also the material on a global marketplace in the different places around the world, there's inflation in energy and there's inflation in raw material still occurring in most of the markets.","Keith Hughes","And if we look back at 2018 ceramic you incurred about $100 million of higher inputs was at the same sort of things or was it different last year.","Chris Wellborn","Mainly the input cost is globally, like Jeff said, has been in energy, materials, labor, in several areas. One more on the material costs and ceramic in some cases, there's trucking costs that have also gone up to move the stuff to the plant, which has also impacted the material costs.","Keith Hughes","Okay. And I guess final question for Chris, you've been in this industry for a long time, it\u2019s going to be two years of just tremendous input cost of inflation, have you ever seen anything like this before?","Chris Wellborn","Well, I think the thing that, as Jeff mentioned, one of the costs that really ramped up last year was the transportation cost. That was a significant cost increase and also the material cost. We had both of those.","Operator","Your next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Truman Patterson","Hi, good morning, everybody. First, just wanted to touch on your fourth quarter EPS guidance, backing into it, it looks like that implies your operating profit is going to decline about 20% year-over-year on much easier comps from the second quarter. So it seems to me that operations look like they're going to take another step back in the fourth quarter. Could you just maybe walk us through what the largest buckets of what's causing this in that, it also appears that I hear the improvement in LVT North America and making some capacity rationalization, but it seems like implied in that guidance that North America margins might even take a step back as well, in the fourth quarter, just hoping you can help me wrap my arms around this?","Glenn Landau","Yes, I mean, I think the message here and this is Glenn is essentially the fourth quarter has played out as we expected. The dynamics in the fourth quarter are the same as the dynamics in the third quarter. And the biggest is in ceramics in volume. And ultimately, that and the downtime we're taking against that volume to manage our inventories in the U.S. So those are the two key buckets that that, that build that guidance. There's really no more new issues. It's just a seasonally different quarter in different amount of days and from there fill in the blanks.","Truman Patterson","Okay, okay, got you. And thanks for that. Digging into North America a little bit more, they bumped up, margins bumped up 200 bps sequentially. If you look historically that was kind of in line to maybe a little bit below the normal improvement. If you look at a couple of years, it looks like margins are backsliding a little bit further. You're mentioning positives in the North America, carpet restructuring that should benefit 2020; you've got better LVT manufacturing. We've also been hearing in channel, Jeff, there's, still some excess inventory. There's some increased promotional activity to pass the rationalization, I'm really thinking when you roll all the puts and takes up, should we expect third quarter margins to really be the floor and we can ramp-up and improve through 2020 or do you expect, the pressures to kind of more than offset the positives in possibly a flat to down margins?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes. I would think of this year is over. We're talking about 2020 right now. I think the fourth quarter is -- ","Truman Patterson","Right.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Transitional the dynamics are the same. It's the fourth quarter, but certainly as we've outlined, we're going to have a tailwind in the things we can control in Flooring North America, and LVT will turn profitable as Jeff said, we will get the benefits from restructuring and outside of economic conditions. There is a tailwind to improve margins from where they are today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Tim Wojs","Yes, hey everybody. Good morning. Just maybe shifting gears to the cash flow statement. I guess first any sense for what preliminarily cash CapEx might look like in 2020? And I guess secondarily how are you kind of thinking about just kind of using or kind of utilizing just some of the increased free cash flow that you should generate in the back half of this year and into 2020? Just wondering, you probably won't pay down debt, you've done a couple of acquisitions but is there an increased emphasis on potentially using some of that cash to buy back stock?","Glenn Landau","On the CapEx next year it will be less than depreciation. The biggest part of it's going to be spend on projects that have good pay backs and reducing our costs and each pieces with limited risk in them. And we think we have a number of those identified and able to do.","On the stock buyback we are going to complete the stock purchases over time as we have said and we haven't made any plans to add to it, we will decide that in the future when we get there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Justin Speer","Hi, good morning guys. Thank you. Just wanted to take a look under the hood at Flooring Rest of the World in the Global Ceramic business, you've touched on quite a bit, but we have these softer international market conditions. Can you give us a sense for how you see profitability trending in those segments as we look into the fourth quarter, particularly into 2020 given what you're doing in terms of productivity, given what you see? Is the Flooring Rest of the World business has been pretty sound little weaker into the third quarter, but just give us a good sense for how you view that business casting into 2020?","Chris Wellborn","So when you look at Flooring Rest of the World, the European economy is slowing little. But each of those countries and markets are different and our businesses are performing well in each of them. Our investment in innovation, cost, and new businesses are enhancing our results and we're well-positioned in each of those categories. Laminate, LVT and sheet vinyl are performing the best. And our new operations are making progress. That would be on the Flooring Rest of World.","And on the ceramic side, I think it's just like we talked about. So far Europe has been affected by slowing economy, particularly Italy, Germany, and there also the European ceramic business has been impacted by lower exports to other regions. Now in that context, we're managing our business well, commercial is doing better. And just like in the U.S., we're increasing our sales organization in new showrooms. And we're also selling more mid and low-end product to increase sales. So we're doing a lot but we think the economies will still be relatively weak.","Justin Speer","Okay. So that's it. In terms of line of sight in the inventory management you feel good about the direction, you feel good about some investments you are doing to kind of rev up growth, but I'm still trying to get a sense for how do you think that Flooring Rest of World margins and I know it's doing relatively well but in view of it, if trends remain soft as they are, do you think margins will be stable with where they're casting this year as we think about next year?","Chris Wellborn","You have also these new projects coming on you have LVT that the line is going to change from a drag to a positive. You have Russian sheet vinyl plant has come up and it's going to slip to a positive. You have the laminate businesses, which we put investments in a while that they're running well, and using the capacities and we have more capacity in Russia and it's doing okay. But there are drags from the economy. So you have the economy drags on one side and you have the various positive things we're doing on the other. We'll have to see how they all balance out.","Justin Speer","Excellent, excellent. And then lastly, kind of line of questioning on Flooring North America. I know -- we know you source LVT and we know you're bringing up your internal production, you're still sourcing quite a bit of LVT from what I understand, we have the tariffs in place, just thinking about the implication of a tariff on that source product on your North American margins this year and potentially in the next year. And in terms of that business, looking separately, after that at price mix, input costs and productivity what was that in the quarter? And what's expected going forward?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I will just make one comment on the tariffs. On the Flooring North America, it's not been nearly the issue that we had in ceramic. Ceramic the tariffs are 130% in North America; they were 25% some of which was discounted back. So I don't think the tariffs have been such a big impact.","Chris Wellborn","It's been an impact but not as great. You have the Chinese currency got weaker, and the suppliers absorbed the portion of it as you go through. And we're in the same position as the rest of the market. And there's also production moving, trying to move to other places to be made. So we're in the same boat as everybody else.","Justin Speer","Okay. And then just in terms of the price mix, input cost and productivity in Flooring North America, can you relate what they were in the quarter and what's expected going forward?","Glenn Landau","As I said earlier, price mix turned positive and productivity with factoring start-up costs also were positive. So yes, we have the volume challenges, but from a mix standpoint, was the biggest driver keeping the overall segment across the categories in a flat to positive mode of about $4 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mike Dahl","Thanks for taking my questions. First question is really focused on the European environment and one of your competitors earlier this week talked about how they were seeing excess Chinese LVT capacity and how that was starting to appear in Europe and causing disruption in Europe as that entered the market, can you comment to what extent you've seen LVT imports into Europe pick up and have an impact on your business?","Jeff Lorberbaum","LVT from China has increased as the market has increased. We believe we are positioned to compete against it. In Europe, we're manufacturing all of the product we're selling. And as our new line comes up and our costs come down, we think that we can offer retailers or buyers of the product competitive products with much shorter lead times and more flexibility and we think we can increase our position in the marketplace.","Mike Dahl","Okay, got it. My second question is two parts on ceramic, the first is just a little more color on the impairment on the Chinese asset post the anti-dumping ruling, can you just talk about how much you were importing through that business and whether or not there's a go-forward impact on how we should think about sales and margins in the ceramic segment, has that's been impaired and potentially redirected? And the second part is bigger picture around ceramic; I know you talked about the inventory levels, specifically to the Chinese ceramic. But, as you've had the anti-dumping go into effect, what have you seen in terms of import activity from other countries taking that place? And how do you stack up competitively compared to that?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Okay. So firstly, the investment that we wrote off is something that we've had since 2010. It's a factory where we brought imported products, and that has slowly decreased over time, and that production can be brought into our U.S. factories. So that's the only story about the -- that investment.","The Chinese inventories they spiked. As those tariffs were about ready to be implemented the last way, let's say a Chinese inventory was brought into the system, and that'll slowly work its way down. Now what will happen is that source of supply will get replaced by U.S. manufacturers will be part of it, but it'll also impact Brazil, Turkey, India, and right now, that's being made a little easier because the dollar is so strong. But we should benefit -- us and U.S. manufacturer should benefit from some of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew Bouley","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. You mentioned kind of seeing those signs of the residential market improving in the U.S. How should we think about how that might flow into your business timing wise? And if you could remind us, maybe which product categories obviously carpets, ceramic tile, et cetera on the homebuilder side where you might see kind of the greater benefits of an improving housing market in the U.S. Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I have always said in the last few months as you guys get the numbers we've seen an improvement in the housing sales and improving in the housing sales should benefit us. If you look at new homes sales, Flooring is the last thing that's put in before the house is complete. So if it takes nine to 12 months to build a house or 18 months, the Flooring is the last thing that's put in it. So different categories they\u2019re all the different categories are used in a homes as you go through. We're seeing increases in all the different categories, I mean increases. The -- all the different hard surfaces are used in, carpets used in it, and so if it goes up, it should positively impact all of the pieces.","Matthew Bouley","Okay, understood. And then just back to LVT, in the U.S. again, I think you mentioned, Jeff, that you've got some visibility to reduce costs in Q1. And you kind of also mentioned hitting the targeted cost structure at some point next year. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that around the timeline to turning a profit in that plant and what type of margin you can actually do with the LVT in the U.S.? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think what we said is that next year, we think that we\u2019ll turn a profit in it, we haven't put it by the quarter. In addition as the piece -- as our manufacturing improves, it has to flow through the inventory. So the cost improvements show up about four months later in the cost sheets as you go through. What we expect, also the year for it to keep improving. And then even further beyond that, we would expect the cost structures to continue to improve incrementally. And then over time you change the mix in the business. To get the business to a line you have to sell it at whatever price as you need to get it into the marketplace quickly. And then over time you upgrade the mix which will take more than next year as we do it -- as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Lovallo","Hey guys, thank you for filling me in here. Can you just help us think about the magnitude and the sales and marketing investments that you're making to expand the placement of your products and should we expect this to kind of ramp sequentially as we head into 2020?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We're putting in all the different businesses as you've heard we are putting more sales people on and we're trying to be more aggressive in the marketplaces as we go through. So there's a spike in it. We're going to continue to monitor it. And if we get the positive results we will continue spending at those levels. If we don't, we'll adjust the strategy and get it in line.","John Lovallo","Okay. And then maybe finally, what percentage of your ceramic offers today or -- would consider to be value oriented? And where do you think this percentage could go over the next year or two?","Chris Wellborn","We have price points -- we have price points up and down the spectrum in ceramic, and I wouldn't overemphasize these lower price points, where in selected situations where we have opportunities, we\u2019re targeting it because we are underutilized in our assets. But overall, it's not a huge piece of our production.","Jeff Lorberbaum","But it will get bigger and it will impact the margins. And we're doing the same thing in Europe, is that we're being more aggressive as the industry slowdown. We participate more in lower value products. So it does impact the mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research. Your line is open.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi, thank you for taking my question today. On carpets in the U.S., you last year was somewhat flattish to down a little bit and the overall industry expectation was worse is behind and the industry context and we've been very surprised by taking such as a bigger lie down this year. Wanted to get your thoughts on that dynamic? And what realistically are your expectations looking beyond just the next couple of quarters but what could the mix be as we look two to three years down the road?","Jeff Lorberbaum","If you look at the Flooring market in the United States, historically, it's grown greater than GDP over through the cycle. And I don't know what would have changed it the Flooring would not grow slightly more than GDP over time.","Kathryn Thompson","I was talking about carpet, carpet has not been growing as fast, I'm talking about a specific category, not overall Flooring. So we're talking about a secular change so --","Jeff Lorberbaum","Carpet has been decreasing, and we don't see it changing at the moment. What we believe is that the LVT at some point is going to plateau out. We believe that is probably slowing somewhat at this point from where it was, and it will plateau and then things will go back to some sort of growth rated for leveled over the piece but it's not going to stop tomorrow.","Kathryn Thompson","Yes. So just once again just to follow-up and see if I can clarify, carpet is taking a bigger step down this year, while the LVT has been growing at a pretty steady rate. What do you think the percentage reasonably carpet should be two to three years down the line as we look at this broad mix?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I don't have a number to give you. You can make up one as well, I don't have a number.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. On transportation, obviously the spend just shortage of drivers and it\u2019s been thorn in the side for so many industries in construction. What are you -- and in manufacturing? What are you doing to ensure the ability to keep drivers and to get some stability and that labor force in the long-term cost for that?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We have done a few things. One is that we have increased our internal trucking fleet in order to move a greater percentage of our products. We think that we offer, we've been able to staff our positions because of the consistency of the routes and the ability for people to make money. So we've done better than the market in general to support our own trucking fleets. And with that we've taken a larger percentage of it that it\u2019s been going in the open market as the costs have increased.","Operator","That's all the time that we have for questions. I will turn the call back to Mr. Lorberbaum for any closing remarks.","Jeff Lorberbaum","So I appreciate everybody joining us. We have a lot of actions we're taking to improve the business and our results. We think we have a lot of opportunities as we look going forward, and we appreciate you being on the call with us. Have a good weekend.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Sean, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mohawk Industries Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded today, February 22, 2013. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and CEO. Mr. Lorberbaum, please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Good morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2012 conference call. Joining me on the call is Frank Boykin, our CFO, who will review our Safe Harbor statement and later our financial results.","Frank H. Boykin","I would like to remind everyone that our press release and statements we make on this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release at the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank.  Our fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.95, as reported, or $1.01, excluding unusual charges, an increase of 40% over 2011. Price increases, productivity improvements, mix and lower interest all contributed to our results. Our 2012 sales increased 4% as reported, or 5% on a constant exchange rate. During the quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $165 million and cash flow from operations of $285 million.","For the full year of 2012, our sales were $5.8 billion, an increase of 3% over 2011 or 4% at a constant exchange rate. For the year, our adjusted operating income increased 15% to $398 million, and cash flow from operations was $588 million. Year-over-year, all segments increased earnings as a result of improved mix, productivity gains and price increases. We enhanced our carpet mix by introducing new premium products that offer customers an enticing value proposition with desirable features such as luxurious softness and superior stain resistance.","Our expansion into new geographies provides opportunities for additional growth. The opening of our Salamanca tile facility in Mexico broadened our product offering and our customer base. Expanding distribution in Russia grew local sales from our new laminate plant. Our Australia laminate and hardwood distribution business increased sales by introducing differentiated products into the market. We continued to optimize the assets by consolidating 2 mosaic tile facilities into 1 and shuttering 2 yarn mills.","We achieved significant improvements in safety across the enterprise, protecting our people and reducing expenses. One of the largest insurance companies in the U.S. recently recognized Mohawk as operating at world-class safety levels. Last year, across the business, we kept SG&A dollars in line while investing more in innovative marketing and products.","Today, economic indicators remain somewhat mixed, though evidence strongly suggests that Americans are investing more in their homes. In the U.S., January weekly new unemployment claims dropped to a 5-year low with steady job creation forecast for 2013. The National Association of Homebuilders projects single-family home construction will grow 22% this year. During 2012, remodeling activity was below its full potential. However, in the fourth quarter, the NAHB Remodeling Index was at its highest level in 7 years, suggesting higher future demand as in past cycles. Future U.S. commercial growth is supported by a positive AIA building index and the expansion of new project inquiries across all building sectors.","As the recovery gains traction, we have positioned Mohawk for long-term growth. During the past 5 years of the downturn, we focused on reducing our leverage and improving our infrastructure so we could take advantage of opportunities when the recovery began. Today, we have transitioned from a focus on conservation of capital to an expansion strategy. We're continuing to strategically invest in growing our core businesses, and since October, we have announced the agreement to acquire 3 businesses: Pergo, Marazzi and Spano. Each of these represents a different opportunity for Mohawk, and all have synergies that will improve our existing businesses. These acquisitions are aligned with our geographical focus on the U.S., Russia and Europe.","As the U.S. flooring industry continues to improve, we're investing in 2 of the leading laminate and ceramic players in the U.S. In these acquisitions, we can optimize the manufacturing assets, raw materials and sales strategies of the businesses to drive growth and margins in both product category.","Marazzi's Russian business expands our participation in this high-growth region. Through the acquisition, we will obtain the leading position in the ceramic market with an integrated distribution and retail infrastructure. Russia's lack of housing and -- is increasing construction and longer-term growth in flooring. We also see potential opportunities to leverage our Russian-made laminate flooring with our new ceramic infrastructure. To expand upon Marazzi's successful Russian strategy, we will increase investment in the region.","We are entering the European ceramic market with leading positions in Italy, France and Spain while the economy is at a low level. We anticipate Marazzi's results will improve as we complete sales, marketing and cost improvement initiatives and as the economy rebounds in the future.","In the European laminate market, Pergo expands our business in the Nordic countries and enhances Unilin's patent portfolio. Belgian-based Spano supports Unilin's unique position in boards in this European region. Not only is the business complementary with Unilin's, but Spano's facilities are located very close to ours. The combination of Spano and Unilin is anticipated to close in the second half of 2013 and will allow us to modernize high-cost assets, broaden our product offering and create a more competitive business model.","All of these transactions, in combination with our existing businesses, position Mohawk for growth. While each strategy will require time to fully execute, we have specific plans for leveraging the new acquisitions in our existing businesses. Over the next few years, we will focus on maximizing these acquisitions and reducing our debt levels.","In January, we successfully issued $600 million of 10-year bonds at a coupon rate of 3.85% and plan to use the proceeds to finance a portion of our Marazzi acquisition. Until the close expected in the second quarter, additional interest expense will be incurred without the Marazzi operating margins in our financial results to offset the interest. We have already received U.S. and German approval for the acquisition and are waiting on other countries where we have no ceramic presence to approve the transaction.","Frank, could you do our financial report, please?","Frank H. Boykin","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $1,436,000,000, up 4% as reported, or a 5% increase on a constant exchange rate basis. This was driven by increased volumes, both in Dal-Tile and Unilin, as well as pricing and mix improvement at Mohawk.  The gross margin was 25.7% compared to 24.3% in the comparable quarter last year. The margin improved 140 basis points year-over-year as volume, productivity and mix favorably impacted our results.","Continued focus on innovation, process improvement and cost yielded stronger profitability this quarter. SG&A dollars were $273 million or 19% of net sales. This compares to 19.5% of sales a year ago. SG&A dollars for the full year were flat even as we absorbed higher sampling and marketing investments back into the business. We will remain focused on controlling SG&A as the business grows.","Restructuring charges were $6 million for the quarter, all related to Dal-Tile, primarily in cost of goods sold for the consolidation of our mosaic tile plants. We will have additional restructuring cost in first quarter related to our other businesses, but we've not quantified those amounts yet. Our operating margin for the quarter was 7.1%, which compares to 5.8% last year. This is up 130 basis points year-over-year with our operating income dollars increasing 28% over last year.","Interest expense was $15 million for the year -- or for the quarter and was lower due to the payoff of 2012 bonds and the rating agency upgrade we received earlier. We expect our legacy interest in 2013 to be approximately $18 million a quarter. And as Jeff mentioned, we will have an additional $2 million each month of interest related to the $600 million bonds that we issued at the end of January for the Marazzi acquisition.","The income tax rate, excluding charges, was 17% during the fourth quarter this year, which compares to 9% rate last year. Last year's rate was impacted by onetime benefits that we did not experience this year. As we move into 2013, we expect to have a tax rate of 20% on our legacy business before the Marazzi acquisition. Our earnings per share, excluding charges, were $1.01 and represent a 40% improvement over last year.","Moving to the segments.  In Mohawk, sales were $726 million, slightly up with mix continuing to improve in this segment. Operating income was $52 million with a 7.2% margin compared to 5.7% margin last year. This is 150-basis-point improvement, which results from positive mix and manufacturing and logistics productivity.","In the Dal-Tile segment, sales were $402 million, up 15% over last year. We had strong growth in all channels and end markets. We were also impacted in the quarter by higher promotional sales to home centers that should not repeat in 2013. Operating income, excluding charges, was $27 million or a margin of 6.8%. This is up 60 basis points with higher volumes and productivity improvement offset by plant shutdowns to align inventory and then also promotional sales.","Unilin sales were $330 million, up 1% year-over-year, as reported, or up 5% using a constant exchange rate. We had strong growth in North America as well as our European insulation and wood businesses, which was offset by slower laminate and roofing in Europe. Operating income for the quarter was $30 million or a margin of 9%. We had lower amortization expense of $7 million in the quarter, which favorably impacted us. In addition, we had about a $1 million drag on earnings as a result of foreign exchange. And in the corporate and illuminations segment, we had an operating loss of $7 million for the quarter or $26 million for the full year, which is in line with our expectations.","Then moving to the balance sheet. Cash was $478 million. We ended with a strong balance sheet and good liquidity this quarter. Free cash flow was $216 million during the quarter, and this has positioned us to take advantage of strategic opportunities that we've talked about in our industry. Receivables at $679 million ended the quarter with DSOs comparable to last year. Inventories at $1,134,000,000 reflect inventory days slightly better than last year after adjusting for inflation and pre-buying activity. We believe we're in line with our expectations.","Our fixed assets were $1,693,000,000 and included CapEx for the quarter of $73 million and depreciation and amortization of $64 million. We expect 2013 capital expenditures, including Pergo, to be approximately $300 million during the year. We estimate depreciation and amortization for 2013, again including Pergo, to be approximately $255 million. Amortization in 2013 will be down $35 million as some intangible assets related to our Unilin acquisition will be fully amortized.","And then finally, net debt at the end of the quarter was $905 million, which compares favorably to last year of $1,274,000,000. Cash flow from operations was almost $290 million for the quarter with net debt declining by $369 million as our leverage ratio improved to 1.3x.","Jeff, I'll turn it back to you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank.  The Mohawk segment sales were flat with the fourth quarter with carpet sales performing better than rug sales. Our rug sales improved from last quarter, but they remained below the prior year as lower product mix and retail sales continued to decrease our results. Our new premium carpets have improved our overall selling prices and margins. However, sales levels were impacted by home center product transitions that we expect to be completed during the first quarter. We recently announced a carpet price increase of 4% to 6% to cover rising material costs.","During the quarter, we expanded our industry-leading SmartStrand Silk collection with 10 new fashionable products. By applying the innovative processes used to develop SmartStrand Silk, we introduced our Wear-Dated Embrace nylon collection at lower price points in the fourth quarter. This extends our leadership position in the ultrasoft premium category with carpets that provide exceptional durability and easy care. In 2013, we anticipate both the sales and mix will improve from broader distribution of SmartStrand Silk and Wear-Dated Embrace.","All categories of Mohawk hard surface products delivered sales gains through new product introductions, including new domestic scraped wood products, tile utilizing Reveal Imaging to mimic travertine and marble, our collections of laminate with unique visuals and GenuEdge technology. During the period, we announced 2 price increases on solid wood flooring totaling about 15% to offset rising lumber costs.","In the commercial category, we grew sales of our new carpet tile introduction made from our premium Duracolor fiber as designers embraced the styling with high-performance stain and soil resistance. Our hospitality sales were strong as we expanded our customer base, both in the U.S. and international markets. To support sales of our premium tile collections, we launched a new online tool called DesignFLEX so that designers can visualize unique commercial environments with multiple patterns and colors for the client.","We executed manufacturing productivity improvements across the business through waste reduction, enhanced recycled contents and improved efficiencies. We integrated SmartStrand cushion into our premium carpet offering, which enhances the performance of our products and differentiates our offerings.","Dal-Tile sales grew 15% during the quarter with gains in U.S. and Mexico supported by new product introductions with enhanced textures, sophisticated design and larger formats in both the residential and commercial categories. A portion of our sales growth was due to higher-than-usual promotional sales to better utilize our capacity during the quarter. Margin expansion came from higher volumes, enhanced productivity and improved yields, partially offset by plant shutdowns to reduce inventory as our new capacity ramped up faster than we had anticipated.","Sales grew across all residential channels with successful launches of our new Reveal Imaging, coordinated wall, floor mosaic collections, larger-sized tiles from our Chinese JV and new decorative assortments in the home center channel. We expanded our presence in the builder multifamily channels with new products manufactured in Mexico. We've reduced our ceramic SKUs while enhancing our offerings with more contemporary sizes and innovative styling aligned with today's decors.  To grow our American Olean brand, we upgraded our underperforming distribution partners, increased relationships with national retail groups and renovated our showrooms to present our products more effectively.","Commercial sales continued strong with the hospitality sector leading the tile category. We are expanding our commercial sales force to more aggressively pursue large specified projects. Our commercial tile collection called Next [ph] has been broadened with additional sophisticated designs and textures, contemporary sizes and fashion forward colors to excite the designers in the premium commercial market. The combination of additional sales resources and new products is growing our commercial specifications and account base.","In Mexico, we increased production at our Salamanca facility, and we're optimizing the plant's efficiencies and yield. To maximize our growth in the Mexican market, we've expanded our sales teams and increased participation in the home center, distributor and retail channels. We announced a price increase in Mexico of approximately 4% to be executed in the first quarter to offset inflation.","During the fourth quarter, Dal-Tile lowered overall manufacturing costs with higher efficiencies, improved material formulations, increased recycled content and effective quality initiatives. We're upgrading our wall tile facilities produce a wider variety of shapes, sizes and decorative styling. In Muskogee, we've installed a specialized kiln to more effectively produce unique premium products. We also reduced freight costs through rate increases, energy surcharges and favorable volume.","Unilin's fourth quarter sales grew 1% or 5% at a constant exchange rate. Increased laminate and hardwood sales in North America, growth in our insulation boards, expanded participation in the DIY channel and solid results from our Australian distribution contributed to our sales improvements. Our margins were favorably impacted by lower amortization charges, partially offset by material inflation and negative mix as European consumers purchased more value-based alternatives. We completed the final phase of the investment at our Russian laminate plant, which added beveled edge capabilities to our local manufacturing.","With the European economy reducing consumption, we partially offset a slower Western European laminate and roofing business with growth in wood flooring and insulation boards. Wood flooring also posted growth in Australia, Russia and India as we increased our laminate -- and we increased our laminate distribution in the German DIY channel. Two of our laminate collections have been updated with new embossing and structured surface technologies to provide more natural wood visuals and more accessible price points. We expanded our line of accessories and made installation easier.  To increase Australian sales, we're offering products specifically tailored to local design and color preferences.","As the luxury vinyl tile category expands in Europe, we're utilizing quickstep design and installation technologies to differentiate our LVT collection that was launched on a limited basis and is now being expanded across Western Europe. The Malaysian government has recently mandated wage increases for manufacturing employees. And to offset the costs, we'll invest more in new automation at our hardwood facilities there.","In North America, both laminate and wood flooring sales grew significantly across all channels. We expanded our presence in the home center channel with additional laminate places -- placements that offer high-end wood looks accentuated by our GenuEdge technology. North American sales to distributors were increased through specific promotions and new laminate products, such as reclaimed wood visuals and wide plank formats. We added Scotchgard and Armox Max protection to selected wood collections, providing the easiest maintenance and highest wear-resistant finish in the industry.  Two price increases for solid wood flooring totaling 15% were announced in Unilin this quarter to offset the rising lumber costs in the U.S.","To support continuing growth in our insulation board business, we've begun the construction of a new manufacturing facility in France. As Western European housing contracted, our roof panel sales have declined and reduced our workforce to balance.  We've licensed our patents for click furniture to additional manufacturers who are introducing new products that will increase interest in the technology.","During the period, a national contractor magazine ranked Dal-Tile #1 in the tile and stone category. And a national poll of designers recognized Dal-Tile for the best overall business experience. In the U.S., in 2012, we generated approximately 1 billion consumer impressions about our Quick-Step laminate from more than 5,000 special interest and mainstream media articles.","Through product innovation, expanded distribution, and process improvements, Mohawk delivered a solid fourth quarter results. We improved our mix with higher-value products gaining traction in the market. We're seeing some inflation on raw materials and taking the appropriate actions in the marketplace to address.","In the U.S., low mortgage rates, stabilizing home prices, improving employment should sustain the housing recovery. We believe that the U.S. residential remodeling should see improvement in the future and that the European economic conditions are near a bottom. We anticipate revenue and earnings growth for 2013 as the U.S. market improves and we realize some benefits from recent acquisitions.","The first quarter earnings are seasonally the lowest and represented a little less than 1\/6 of 2012's full year results. With this, our guidance for the first quarter earnings, which includes Pergo, is $0.77 to $0.86 per share, excluding any restructuring, acquisition costs and interest on new bonds from Marazzi. We will begin including forward estimates for Marazzi and Spano after those acquisitions are closed. In the second quarter, our carpet price increases will only be partially executed, and we anticipate that $5 million to $10 million of our increased costs will not be covered. In the third quarter, we expect carpet pricing will be aligned with raw material costs.","As 2013 begins, Mohawk has transitioned from a defensive posture to a more aggressive growth mode. Our strategy has shifted from managing through the economic downturn to expanding our long-term business. During the past few years, we strengthened our balance sheet, which enabled us to acquire 3 companies with outstanding brands and potential. We will drive our business strategies of innovative products, efficient manufacturing and expanded distribution across the enterprise to grow both our existing and new businesses.","With that, we'll be glad to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Your success finding deals in a variety of categories and regions in the fourth quarter obviously is very impressive. Do you think -- is your pipeline depleted? And\/or I mean, did you have a specific focus on Europe?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The pipeline -- I'm not sure the pipeline is depleted, but we've spent all the money we're going to spend for the near term. We've been talking with many of these companies for a period of years in different places, having discussions over long periods of time. And many of the companies, as you come out of recessions, you have to refinance the businesses so it creates opportunities as the business grows. We think there's more opportunity in the marketplace, but we're going to be focused the next few years, or next couple of years at least, on putting these in a condition we'd like them to be.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I -- this is kind of a little more macro, ties in, obviously, with carpet where you are facing input costs. You're going to ask for price. Given your history of recovery in kind of 2 quarters, I expect you'll get it. But from a macro perspective, if it's your wood flooring, if it's the tile in Mexico or any number of other building product categories, it seems like everyone's asking for price. And can you give us a little sense of where your conviction comes from, that pricing on wood, tile really will be flowing through given relatively low levels of demand compared to your conviction in carpet, which is tied as much to industry structure as anything else?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We are seeing raw materials move up. In many of the different categories, the raw materials were depressed somewhat during the downturn, so we're seeing inflation in raw materials in many places. In each of the categories, there are different drivers of it. In the carpet side, you have oil prices are going up, but there's also additional pressure from chemical costs rising more due to supply and demand and those companies trying to recover their margins as the industries occur. With that, we have announced a price increase of 4% to 6% to get it back. At this point, all the major carpet players have announced similar increases in those ranges. And we believe they're going to go through because the industry needs them to keep the margins at least where they are. On the wood side, you're seeing something similar, which is with the wood going up due to the housing recovery, the wood coming out of the forest is in shorter supply and the prices are going up significantly. And the industry has to pass those through. We have made announcement of 2 separate price increases because they increased more than we had anticipated, and we don't see any reason why we won't be able to achieve those given the cost increases we're incurring.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ahie [ph] from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's still Mike Rehaut at JPMorgan. First question, on the -- actually, I was wondering if we could just do a little bookkeeping for 2013, if possible, what you expect corporate expense -- and I know this -- if at all possible, to include some of this for your expected completed acquisitions of Marazzi and Spano, what you expect full year corporate expense and also the tax rate to be once those are completed.","Frank H. Boykin","Michael, on the unallocated corporate expense, it's in the corporate elimination -- and eliminations segment. I think we've historically run about $25 million, and I would expect to have that same run rate this year for the corporate and eliminations segment. And then on the tax rate for the full year, we're estimating around a 20% tax rate for the full year.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so neither of those changed, Frank, with the acquisitions?","Frank H. Boykin","No.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Product transfer?","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Also on Mohawk, if we could just talk about that for a moment, you had a nice 120 bps of margin expansion for 2012 on roughly flattish sales. So I was wondering if you could kind of break down, Frank, what were the drivers of that margin expansion? And when you talk about the delay in the price increases coming through, that it really -- you won't fully realize it until the third quarter, you'll start to realize it in the second quarter, what that might mean for margins year-over-year? The last couple of quarters, you've had around 150 bps or more of year-over-year margin expansion. What that might mean for the first quarter in particular if you might have some higher costs and not an immediate matching of the price inflation? So 2 kind of questions there, one on what were the drivers in 2012 of the margin expansion and how that recent expansion might flow potentially without the full benefit of the price increases in '13?","Frank H. Boykin","Let me start from an overview of what happened. The mix during 2012 began improvement. It improved because of the growth in premium products. It got improved because of the shift from -- to soft product and carpet. And it also had a shift in carpet tile -- the greater carpet tile from broadloom all improved the mix within the business. The margins, we believe, are sustainable, and we believe we'll continue to see improvements because we believe there'll be continued mix improvement this year. We have a lot of things that are still working on productivity and cost savings. We also expect some sales growth initiatives, which should all grow the margins this year from last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson, Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","First is on Pergo as that's integrated to the system. We have a pretty good sense of the revenue flow-through, but could you help us how we should \u2013 through how we should think about margins, particularly as Pergo is being integrated into Mohawk overall? And is there -- is this going to be seamless? Or what type of efficiency upside could we potentially see or, conversely, drag could we see for the short term in first quarter?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We haven't given any specific of how they're going to change. There are going to -- there's a lot of opportunities to improve Pergo. It's complementary to our business with our premium product positions. They have and we have together, different from each other, design and performance capabilities which will enhance both portfolios. There's significant opportunities to optimize the manufacturing in both the U.S. and Europe. We've already started making quality changes and productivity changes. There are many initiatives on the table that are going to take a significant period of time to implement during this year and possibly beyond it, and it will take a while to maximize those. There's opportunities to leverage their patents with our licenses, our license abilities to increase that and have it go beyond -- all the way through sometime in 2020-something. We haven't finalized the timing and the amounts of all the restructuring pieces it takes, the product changes it takes. But they're all being planned and designed so we can go ahead and execute them over the next 12 months.","Frank H. Boykin","So as Jeff said, we've got a lot of things we're working on here and expect improvements. It's going to take some time. However, for the full year, we still are expecting slight accretion from this. And it really was not a drag on our first quarter in the estimate we gave for the first quarter. It was not a drag on the earnings.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Great. And finally, in the Mohawk segment, could you break out as much as you can growth rates for volume for residential versus non-res? Particularly, I just want to get a breakout in the sense of how your modular business is doing relative to residential and any other changes on the -- we know what was going on in the broadloom side with pricing, but anything on the modular side, too, would be appreciated?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The residential and commercial growth rates were similar, not much different. What was the rest of the question?","Frank H. Boykin","Modular. Modular versus broadloom.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","What's happening in the commercial business with our business is the modular's growing, but we're -- but it's moving from the broadloom to modular. So it's offsetting a lot of the growth rate.","Frank H. Boykin","Price increases.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Price increases. In the commercial -- we talked about the price increase in the residential. In the commercial businesses, the price increases don't go -- or a lot of it is done on a specified basis, so it's on a job-by-job basis. And you don't see all the time the announced changes because every job is changed as it comes up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood, Macquarie Capital.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","On the broadloom side, you mentioned that you hope to achieve the cost parity by the end of the second quarter. I'm curious in your opinion what you think would be the trigger to get margins back up to their historical average in this sector and essentially get some accretive price actions in broadloom.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Well, to get the margins back up, we're going to continue doing all the things we're doing about cutting costs, managing the SG&A expenses, getting leverage on them as they go up, getting better product mix as they go through, reducing our cost structures. The -- we expect to start getting some top line growth, which will also help all the pieces. And then the price increases are dependent upon what raw material costs are and what the marketplace does. And we try to get -- we try to improve our margins as we do that, but it's dependent upon the entire marketplace.","Frank H. Boykin","And we've made pretty good progress, Mike, I think, over the last 2 years, 3 years of improving margins, as Jeff said, through mix and productivity improvements and initiatives. And as we've said before, our goal is to get those margins back up to the high single-digit range where they were before we went into this recession. And we think with volume and some improvement in mix, we can get back there. Meanwhile, we're going to continue to work on improving the mix and taking out costs.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Just another comment. On the price increase, some of it is being offset by the change to lower-cost products made out of polyester is offsetting some of the pricing increases the last year or 2 and will continue as polyester grows.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Okay. Also, on price in the Unilin segment, can you give us a sense of, by product in Unilin, how sensitive each is to the increase in lumber prices and where you can actually proactively substitute out products, like potentially in engineered wood, to lower-cost substitutes?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The price increases that we announced are in the solid wood category. There's been -- we haven't raised the engineered wood, which has lower-cost raw materials in it as much. And so the other one has -- the majority of the increase is in the -- we're passing them through. Alternatives to wood, there's all kinds of alternatives. It depends on what you're looking for. There are options in laminate, there's options -- there's actually ceramic looks that are made out of wood for the high-end wood marketplace. It doesn't scratch. There's new products we're introducing and others in LVT as we go through. There's a lot of options as it moves around. Wood tends to be an aspirational purchase for people, and the people that desire to have the best products tend to like using wood and won't change it. On the other hand, people looking for alternatives have moved already to things like laminate, which look a lot like it at lower price points.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg from UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, it's actually Sue. Looking out maybe a little bit bigger picture, you guys are definitely increasing your exposure to Southern Europe with Marazzi and also your new board facility coming on in France. Can you talk about how you think about the potential sort of opportunities or risks in this -- as you get more into this region, especially sort of your ability to adjust this as demand changes over time?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Sure. Let's start with the ceramic business. We believe we're entering the ceramic market at what we believe is a low point. We believe there's limited downside. There is potential for downside, but we believe there's much more upside in the ceramic business. Before we purchased the company, the company had already reduced its capacity, and they're running today at about 90% of their capacity. So the capacities are aligned with the business as it is today. We believe that we can impact the business positively by reducing their manufacturing costs further, by improving the product mix in the business, by executing best practices and reducing the overhead structures of the business with it. So we think we're buying at right spot. There is some short-term downside, but we think it's limited. And we think we're well positioned with the #1  position in Italy, France and Spain as we go through. The other businesses are further in the north, which don't have as much downside to them. We -- the Pergo business has opportunities with our European business of creating greater efficiencies, of new product introductions and broadening distribution of both businesses and taking costs out of the business as we manage those. It has a big opportunity to improve our position of both businesses as we leverage them together. And you have some of the similar things with Spano. Spano is a board business that is in the same communities as we are almost. And there's opportunities with Spano to reduce the cost structures significantly with synergies that make us more competitive in the piece. The businesses are complementary. They actually have some different focus on their customer base. We'll be able to maximize the productivity of each of the plants by moving products around so we have higher volumes of similar products. And so we believe again that also that we're in a good position to do it. We're going to put more investments in it throw out the high-cost assets in both of the businesses as we combine them together. And we think there's a good potential to be the low-cost provider in the marketplace and maximize our position with the best service in the market.","Frank H. Boykin","Yes. And I'll just add a couple points there, too. In Marazzi, if you look at sales, shipments actually made into Italy and into Spain, it represents a little bit less than 20% of the total Marazzi business right now. And then secondly, I think you had asked about the French insulation plant. And that insulation business is a -- about a EUR 1 billion business over in Europe, and it's actually growing because of energy requirements by the European governments over there. And it's got limited areas that we can sell it in before we start to run into distribution costs that are too high. So the opportunity to grow there is more growing with the industry as we expand out geographically.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The insulation business, our present plant will be just about fully utilized about the time the new plant comes up. So the new plant will allow us to broaden our distribution and keep growing, which we wouldn't be able to without it.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And so then longer term for -- especially for the Dal-Tile, the Unilin segments, are you still thinking that margins get back to, say, maybe 11%, 12%, somewhere in that range?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Yes, we're anticipating over time we get the margins back up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Frank, could you look at -- within the Unilin segment, I think volume for the full year was maybe plus 4 on an organic basis. Could you maybe split that out, positives and negatives, across the domestic laminate, domestic hardwood and then the international piece as well just to get the flavor of the puts and takes through the year?","Frank H. Boykin","I think if you looked at our North American business, it's -- the growth there was strong compared to the European business, stronger.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I mean, the European business -- Western Europe is down, could be down as much as 5% to 10% in different categories. The laminate business will be down less and the build and product things with it would be down more. We have a roofing business we talked about. I mean, the roofing business is off more than all of those. What? On the other hand, our U.S. business is growing as well -- the general business is growing, as well as we're expanding our share in various marketplaces. So we think there's big opportunities in the U.S.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And within U.S. laminate, how do you think about that category over the next couple of years and your ability to expand it in the face of LVT taking share overall?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think that the laminate business over time is going to have a difficult time growing much more than market, and LVT is going to grow at the expense of a lot of things. The laminate business in general sells at lower price points than the LVT at this point, so they should be able to coexist. But LVT, as it grows, will take from a lot of different categories.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So is your expectation that your laminate business has to grow through market share accumulation?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Our intention is to grow it with the market and to take share. I think that we're in the right position. We basically focus on the mid- to high-end part of the market. Pergo focuses on the mid to high end. And so all our assets are structured to have high differentiation, to create higher value. And we're really not positioned to participate in the commodity opening price points because we -- our assets are set up differently than those. But that differentiation allows us to bring products to the marketplace that make it difficult for other people to bring the same value propositions. So I think that we'll be able to grow ours, at least with the marketplace, and hopefully that we'll be able to merge the businesses together and create a lot of efficiencies and cost savings.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering in the Marazzi business, you talked about [indiscernible] despite demand being relatively low right now. As you think about the next couple years in recovery, what sort of your capital requirements do you think there'll be in that? How are you looking at that overall?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Is that relative to Europe or the whole business, your question?","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess you were talking about 90% in terms of \u2013 I was asking do you mean in Europe? Or how are you looking at that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The 90% was in Europe. And in the short term, we're going to invest some more to improve their efficiencies as well as to be able to improve their mix. And those plans are just -- are still being put together. At this point, we don't own it yet -- as yet, but we're -- we have plans which we'll have to confirm once we get closer to business. You have the Russian business, which is going to have to continue to have additional capacity to support its growth rate, which is in the low -- the high -- 10% or low-teen rate, we think, is the -- we can sustain over some period of time. And so with that, we're going to have to continue investing to support those growth rates. And then the U.S. business, we believe that we can grow the U.S. business and our Mexican business, which we use all the assets to support both of those together. As the U.S. business turns around long term, like we believe, and we can continue to invest in the business, we think that we -- a large part of the business is imported from other countries into the U.S., and we think we can provide greater value to our customers and outgrow the industry by producing more in the United States to support the industry.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the Mohawk segment just a little bit, you talked \u2013 you've done a great job in terms of the mix improvement there where the rug category has been certainly lagging. You've  talked about some sales growth initiatives. Is there anything you're doing in terms of just helping the rug side of the business? Or is that something where it's just much more to focus in terms of the higher price point, entire margin items than \u2013 or is this expectation that rugs continue to lag?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The rug sales showed improvement from quarter 3 to quarter 4. A lot of the business is driven by the very large retailers around the country who are still cautious about consumer demand. And with that, they have actually been pushing the product mix in their stores down to try to have lower retail price points. That's been impacting the industry as well. We have many new initiatives to go into new distribution areas that we haven't focused on as much to grow specific retail categories. We're introducing more fashionable rugs to try to change the retailers' focus on low opening price points and move them towards improving their mix. We've been utilizing new proprietary raw materials to different our products. We expect these things to show some benefit this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","First question. On the tile business, wondering if could help us understand a little bit the incremental margin in 2012, which seems like it's a little bit below trend. I'm curious where the incremental margin ought to be in that business in '13, and also interested in how you think -- how the Marazzi compares to that margin over time.","Frank H. Boykin","As we've said before, Eric, the incremental margin in the tile business runs in the mid-20s. It was impacted specifically in the fourth quarter, though, with the plant shutdown costs that Jeff had mentioned that we put in place to control inventory levels. And then also, we had higher promotional sales that utilized the capacity. And then our Mexican plant, Salamanca, costs are improving, but we have potential there to get those up even higher. So if you look at the margin, they did -- the dollars actually went up 23%. Incremental margins would have been more in line with where they should have been, in the mid-20s, had it not been for those 3 items. And then there was one other question, I think?","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","How Marazzi matches up over time with Dal-Tile margins or compares to Dal-Tile margins over time.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We would expect the 2 to be fairly in line with each other over time. The question's going to be what happens with the European business and when does -- when do we recover those margins. We believe that the other -- the Russian business has potential to be higher margins, and the U.S. business should be in line with ours over time.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then second question, the step-up in capital in 2013. Can you just talk a little bit about where that is? Is that all legacy? Is that inclusive of spending for the acquired businesses?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Capital expenditures is -- plan is about $300 million going into the year, including Pergo's new capital. It doesn't include new capital for the other businesses which we don't own yet. And there's nothing in there for any restructuring activities at this point. Many investments are going to support growth in the future. New products and expansion is about 40% of that, maybe a little more. It's going into new extrusion capacity in carpet. It's going to start putting in new ceramic capacity, which takes over a year to put in, so it's going into growth for future. It's insulation plant we talked about. And then we're starting to put some investment in to participate in manufacturing LVT that's going in this year. We have cost reduction plans of probably another $70 million, $80 million or more. And then the balance of it, most of it's in different types of maintenance or some small cost production pieces.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baugh from Stifel, Nicolaus.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could just share with us what you're seeing right now in terms of residential U.S. repair remodel spend. And maybe the same for commercial. And then, more or less, how you think that may unfold as 2013 unfolds?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Let's see. So far this year, it's difficult to read the carpet side because of 2 things. One is the price increase last year and timing of it, and now the new price increase. You have pre-buys and stuff going on last year at different times in the year, so it's difficult to read. In general, we see, so far this month, it's trending about as we expected through the period of time. We're seeing increases as we go through the period, and we think they'll be -- they're consistent with our estimates going forward that we have built into our earnings.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Do you care to give us a rough guideline of what those revenue expectations are? Not necessarily for the first quarter but as you think about, say, the resi repair\/remodel for '13?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The remodeling piece, at the moment, I have to say that we haven't seen a significant upturn in it at this point. Our expectations are that as economy and people keep working more and based on the indicators that we see, that people will start spending more. But I can't say that it's taken off yet.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'll shift John's question to Europe, how it trends in Europe then. And is there any sort of bottoming you're seeing in Western Europe in the Unilin business?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The trends in Europe are still difficult. We started this year, and the weather was more difficult than the first part of January, which had a  negative impact on sales. We also had -- in our business, we had some price increases last year, which created a pre-buy in January that affected the comps, so it's making it a little difficult for us to see. I can tell you that the trends are still negative across the business. We talked about somewhere between 5% and 10% across the different business categories with some better and some worse. The attitudes of our people are that they feel a little better about things going on. It looks like that the banks are keeping liquidity in the business over there, and we're hoping it's near the bottom. We'll all get to see.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","If you go to Eastern Europe then, I know that was a big -- been a big market for you and even there with Marazzi in terms of growth. Are we looking at another growth good growth year in Eastern Europe, specifically Russia, in '13?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Russia, business continues strong. The Russian economy continues good. And the building industry, there's a shortage of housing. And so it continues to go. So we're looking for a strong Russian market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Desi DiPierro from RBC.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","On the depreciation and amortization guidance, doesn't look like it includes Marazzi. So what can we expect for 2013 depreciation for that business?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, you're right, it does not include Marazzi. It includes our legacy business in Mohawk and it includes Pergo. Marazzi, we've not finished all of the purchase accounting and step-up for the assets, so we don't have a number going forward. I can tell you, though, that their historical depreciation and amortization ran about $75 million annually. But it will increase. That number will increase once we complete the purchase accounting.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Mr. Lorberbaum.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We appreciate everyone joining us. We believe we're well positioned going into 2013. We believe that the acquisitions that we've put in place will benefit us greatly over the long term. And we're well positioned to take advantage of what's going on in the United States. Thank you very much for joining us.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mohawk Industries Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, October 31, 2014. Thank you. I would now like to introduce Mr. Frank Boykin, Chief Financial Officer. You may begin your conference.","Frank H. Boykin","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor conference call. Today, we'll update you on the company's progress during the third quarter of 2014 and provide guidance for the fourth quarter.","I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include a discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any GAAP to non-GAAP amounts.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. During the third quarter, our earnings per share were $2.06, as reported, or $2.44 excluding unusual charges, an increase of 21% over adjusted second quarter 2013 results. This represents the highest quarterly non-GAAP earnings per share in Mohawk's history.","During the period, we significantly increased our adjusted operating income by 12% compared to last year through productivity enhancements, cost-containment and acquisition synergies. Ongoing initiatives to control expenses and increase our productivity yielded our highest operating margins in 8 years.","Third quarter sales increased about 2% over the prior year, both as reported and with a constant exchange rate. We delivered good results this period, even in an environment with sluggish demand, due to our market diversification and strong execution.","As 2014 began, most forecasts were anticipating strong increases in both the U.S. housing starts and remodeling. The projected rise in both new home construction and existing home sales has fallen short of expectations, along with remodeling not growing at the anticipated rate. A bright spot for 2014 has been the increased home values, which has strengthened future remodeling demand. The commercial sector was more positive with forecast of almost 4% year-over-year increase in commercial spending.","While the U.S. represents about 70% of sales, other markets have also been soft. At the beginning of '14, we expected Europe to improve from its bottom. However, the economy in the Eurozone now appears to be weakening. Likewise, the Russian economy is softening more than expected and the housing and flooring sectors are feeling the impact. Despite these economic conditions, we continue to execute well, driving the productivity of our existing businesses and enhancing the performance of our acquisitions by improving all facets of our operations. Moving forward, we are focused on product innovation, operational excellence and sales execution. We will continue investing in our business to support our future growth and profitability.","The $550 million in capital investments we will make this year are increasing our productivity, allowing us to further differentiate our products and improving our margins. We will continue to execute our business strategy to deliver results.","As we look at our third quarter performance by segment, our carpet business's adjusted operating income rose approximately 20% over the prior year, and the margin was up 170 basis points as a result of increased productivity, improved quality and cost reductions.","Net sales were softer than anticipated, up about 1% with commercial outperforming residential. During the period, we reduced SG&A costs through more effective sampling, reduced selling costs and restructuring of administrative functions that yielded greater efficiencies and improved our customer service. Our investments in new manufacturing technology increased productivity, reduced waste and improved quality, contributing to the profitability of the business.","During the period, residential remodeling was softer than expected, with sales in new construction and multifamily sectors increasing. We increased our participation in the more value-oriented polyester category and our proprietary Continuum process has allowed us to grow by offering a superior post-recycled -- post-consumer recycled product that delivers outstanding stain and perform soil resistance as well as greater softness.","In the fourth quarter, we are introducing the next generation of our unique SmartStrand collection with new features and benefits to create additional value. The expansion of our Karastan distribution continues to increase our luxury carpet sales, as we provide scalable merchandising for different markets and retailers.","The price increase we announced on certain products in April was fully executed at the beginning of the quarter, which helped to offset increased raw material prices and freight costs.","We are pleased with the growth in our commercial category as we have executed our new product strategy to improve the value and styling of our products, featuring our exclusive DuraColor fiber systems. At the same time, we've reduced the complexity of our manufacturing through more disciplined material strategies. We're also improving our flexibility, service and cost structure as well as enhancing our margins while providing greater value to our customers.","Our position in modular tile continues to grow and is enhanced by our introduction of new 12x36-inch plank carpet tiles that can be utilized in conjunction with all our other standard sized products to create stylish new designs for public spaces.","Our hospitality business remains strong with new commitments from major hotel chains. We're excited about our future growth prospects in the commercial market.","Our Mohawk Brand hard surface sales are growing due to the expanded use of engineered wood, LVT and ceramic and the stronger new construction of multifamily markets. We have implemented more streamlined operations over the past few years, which is resulting in greater productivity, lower costs and improved quality in this segment. We anticipate continued operational improvements from our fiber, yarn and carpet plant investments and realignments.","About 85% of our new Continuum capacity is now operational and performing as anticipated. To offset escalating transportation costs, we implemented freight increases in July. We continue to improve our logistics systems. And our customers are responding by shipping more on our trucks and increasing our volume per shipment.","During the period, our ceramic segment's adjusted operating profits grew 16%, as reported, or 17.5% on a constant basis -- exchange basis, due to increased productivity, better quality and improved pricing and mix. Net sales rose 2%, as reported, or 3% on a constant basis compared to the prior year. Our ceramic performance improved significantly with slower growth in most of our markets.","In the U.S., ceramic continues to outperform most other flooring products with commercial growing more than residential. During the period, sales in our service centers grew stronger. We increased participation in our Statement ceramic showroom program and improved large builder and multifamily partnerships.","We're on track to open 16 consolidated Marazzi and American Olean service centers in areas where we lack strong, independent distribution. These service centers provide a comprehensive portfolio of products, with the Marazzi brand focused on the mid- to high-end residential sector and American Olean brand focused on the more value residential and commercial products.","The integration of Marazzi into our U.S. ceramic operations is substantially complete and we continue to work towards realigning our manufacturing assets to reduce changeovers and increase flexibility.","Site work has begun for our new ceramic plant in Tennessee, which will be capable of making higher-value technical porcelain products that we have historically imported. We're expanding our capabilities to manufacture larger sizes and have recently started up a new production line in Texas to meet increasing demand. We continue to introduce rectangles and planks in flooring as well as larger 12x24 wall tiles. To recoup higher freight and raw material costs, we've announced a price increase to be implemented in January on all our ceramic products.","We continue to expand dramatically our participation in the Mexican ceramic market as we increase the distributors and retailers supporting our brands. We now offer a complete product assortment from value red body tile to premium porcelain with larger sizes in planks, floor and wall tile collections and market-leading designs influenced by our U.S. and Italian operations. Our new introduction should allow us to further improve our product mix and increase our average selling price and margins in Mexico.","During the period, our sales improved in Russia on a local basis and our ceramic market we estimate to be down in the high single digits. Our earnings during the period improved more than our sales as we upgraded our product mix.","While our actions in design, value and service are helping us gain share, we anticipate margin pressures as the ceramic category slows within the market. We're expanding our distribution in new construction in the DIY channel to offset the slowing remodeling business.","We have a strong Russian management team that is enhancing our sales execution, improving our distribution process and upgrading our manufacturing operations.","The ceramic market in Europe remains difficult with limited credit availability impacting demand. We continue improving our margins by reducing our cost structure and improving our mix. Our sales were off slightly as we balanced discontinuing low-margin products and replacing them with higher value ones. We are presently introducing 500 new SKUs to further upgrade our European ceramic collections, while reducing our total SKU offering by about 20% since we have owned Marazzi.","Roughly 35% of our sales are now from products introduced since we completed the acquisition. As part of our turnaround strategy, we're in the process of replacing over 50% of our Italian manufacturing assets, to be completed by the end of 2015. One production line is already running and a second will be operational by the end of the year. Since the acquisitions, through better planning and manufacturing strategies, we have significantly improved inventory turns by more than 25% in our Europe ceramic operations.","During the period, net sales for laminate and wood segment increased over the prior year on a constant exchange rate and as reported by 3%. Adjusted operating margins for the segment was 11.6% due to lower sales in laminate, higher costs in new products and equipment startups, offset by acquisition and productivity improvement.","In the U.S., laminate primarily sells through residential remodeling, which has been the weakest of all the flooring categories. In Europe, flooring sales remain weak and have been impacted by both volume and mix of our products.","In the fourth quarter, we anticipate improvement in the operating margin compared to the prior year, while we continue to invest in LVT and absorb the impact of foreign exchange.","In the U.S., laminate sales were softer than expected due to both the weakness in remodeling and inventory adjustments that pushed some orders into the fourth quarter. Our Pergo brand is gaining further traction in the home center channel with the introduction of new style and design, providing greater value to the consumer.","Our wood flooring sales grew during the period due to the strength in new residential construction, however, market pricing did not keep up with material changes.","Across our U.S. laminate and wood manufacturing, we are aggressively pursuing productivity improvement and cost reduction. During the quarter, we incurred start-up costs for a new board product and a new production process in engineered wood, both of which should be behind us.","In Europe, flooring sales were softer than we expected. We have executed almost a complete revision of our Pergo product line to upgrade the styling and performance in the marketplace. Our new deeply embossed Quick-Step laminate collection is being well received due to its differentiated appearance and distinctive texture.","The timing of marketing and merchandising investments related to these launches increased the segment's SG&A this quarter. During the period, we absorbed start-up costs related to our Belgian LVT plant and equipment upgrades at our recently acquired Czech wood plant. Our increased participation in the rapidly growing LVT category and the expansion of our wood flooring sales should strengthen our future results.","Our European insulation business continued to grow with operational and formula improvements offsetting pricing pressures.","Our sales and margins on roof panels declined due to unfavorable market conditions, and we closed a small roof panel facility during the period.","Our European board business delivered top line growth due to our broad product offering and increased margins from productivity improvement and higher material yields. The synergies associated with the Spano acquisition are yielding operational and administrative efficiencies ahead of schedule.","I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period.","Frank H. Boykin","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales in the quarter were $1,991,000,000, up 2%, both as reported and on a constant exchange rate basis. We had growth in all segments, with stronger performance in the ceramic and laminate segments.","For the third quarter year-to-date, pro forma sales grew 2% or 1% on a constant exchange rate basis. Gross margin, as reported, was 28%. Excluding restructuring, it was 28.3%, up 60 basis points over the comparable amount last year. We had higher productivity and acquisition synergies that drove improvement.","SG&A, as reported, was $343 million. Excluding restructuring, SG&A as a percent to net sales was 16.4%, a 50 basis point improvement over last year. We were able to keep our SG&A dollars flat, while leveraging the lower SG&A dollars -- percent.","Unusual charges for the quarter were $41 million, with most from plant closures, acquisition restructuring and bond redemption premium that we paid for the purchase of $200 million of our 2016 bonds. The operating margin excluding charges was 11.9%. That's up 110 basis points from last year. The declining ruble impacted our operating income dollars by $2.5 million in the quarter.","Given our present earnings mix, we gain or lose about $1 million of operating income per quarter if the dollar-euro exchange rate changes 0.02 or if the ruble-dollar exchange rate changes 2.5. We have approximately 70% of our laminate and wood business that's euro-based and 30% of our ceramic segment that's euro\/ruble-based.","Our interest expense for the quarter was $35 million and includes a $17 million bond redemption premium, which reduces second half interest by approximately $4 million, and we were able to realize some cash savings as a result of the redemption.","We may purchase additional small lots of the 2016 bonds if pricing is favorable. Interest improved $8 million, excluding the premium, primarily due to the ratings upgrade and our entry into the commercial paper program.","Our income tax rate was 19% for the quarter, which compares to 21% last year. We expect our full year rate to be 21% this year and range from 22% to 23% next year. The rate will fluctuate between quarters, due to shifts of income between countries and timing of deductions.","Earnings per share excluding charges was $2.44. That's up 21% from last year and, as Jeff mentioned, is the highest earnings per share in our history.","If we move to the segments. In the carpet segment, sales were $779 million, up 1% over last year, with sales growth primarily from volume increases in both commercial and in our hard surface products. Our operating income was $84 million, with a 10.8% margin, up 170 basis points from last year. Continuing productivity and volume increases supported higher margins.","In the ceramic segment, sales were $780 million, up 2%, as reported, or 3% on a constant exchange rate basis. We had good growth in our ceramic North American business, with the largest improvement in Mexico. Our Russian business grew in local currency, with the European business down slightly.","Our operating income was $106 million, with a 13.5% margin, up 160 basis points from volume, productivity and mix. All regions reported margin increases during the quarter.","In the laminate and wood segment, sales ended at $463 million, up 3% on both a constant reported -- constant exchange rate basis as well as reported.","We had Europe showing an increase in most categories and U.S. declining slightly from slower remodel laminate business. The operating income in this segment was $54 million with an 11.6% margin, down 130 basis points due to mix and start-up costs. In the corporate and eliminations segment, we had an operating loss of $6 million, and we estimate the full year loss to be about $30 million.","Jumping to the balance sheet. Receivables ended the quarter at $1.2 billion, with DSOs at 53 days for the quarter. Inventories were $1.640 billion, with inventory days at 113, up due to inflation, backwards integration and prebuy of raw materials. Fixed assets were $2,773,000,000 and included capital expenditures during the quarter of $142 million and D&A of $85 million. We estimate CapEx for the full year to be $550 million, primarily for capacity expansion and as we assimilate our acquisitions. Total D&A for the quarter is -- or for the year is estimated to be $350 million.","And then finally, long-term debt -- net debt ended the quarter at $2,284,000,000. Our leverage ended at 2.0x debt-to-EBITDA.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. We anticipate that the growth in the U.S. economy in the flooring category will remain unchanged during the fourth quarter, with residential remaining slow as commercial grows. We do not foresee significant improvement in the European economy or flooring industry during the period.","In Russia, we expect the economy to continue slowing, creating pressure on our results.","For the total company, we expect improvement in our sales and operating margins compared to last year. However, due to the strengthening dollar, we anticipate that foreign currency translation will reduce sales and profits as reported. Our performance will benefit from new products, productivity improvements, synergies from our acquisitions and cost containment initiatives. We remain confident in our ability to execute our business strategy within the prevailing economic conditions.","With these factors, our guidance for the fourth quarter earnings is $2.18 to $2.27 per share, excluding any restructuring charges.","Looking forward to 2015, we anticipate improved growth in the U.S. economy, with housing starts, existing home sales and remodeling strengthening from this year. The European economy appears to be getting weaker, but the Central Bank is keeping interest rates low to stimulate growth. The Russian economy is declining, and we are taking actions to increase our market share, which will impact our margins.","We expect improved sales growth on a local basis and continued improvement in our margins.","From the beginning of 2014, the stronger dollar has reduced the dollar-euro exchange rate by 7% and the dollar-ruble exchange rate has decreased by 31%. Our reported results will be lower if the U.S. dollar remains strong. Our plans for 2015 are centered on improving our results and we'll continue to pursue acquisitions that provide good long-term returns.","We'll now be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Great execution in a tough top line environment. I guess, my question really deals with some of the longer-term margin targets that you've communicated historically. I think you've talked about 10% as being kind of the longer-term target margin in carpet and 13% in ceramics. And I guess, the question really is are we seeing margins here? Or are you beginning to think differently about margin potential?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Make sure you remember that the business is seasonal and we're in one of the best quarters each year, so you have to look at the annual rates. We believe we'll continue to improve our margins from the annual rate we expect to be at.","Frank H. Boykin","We're not changing the earnings -- or the margin targets that we've talked about in -- long-term margin targets we've talked about in the past, David.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Great. So we're getting closer to those numbers. Now, I realize there's seasonality in the numbers, but it would appear that we're getting -- we're converging on those numbers pretty quickly. Follow-up question is just with regard to Russia, and you called out a couple of times in the presentation that you're investing there, that the macro situation there is deteriorating pretty quickly, margins are likely to come in. Is there any way to help us in terms of sizing that business today within the context of ceramics and the extent to which you feel margins might come down?","Frank H. Boykin","When we bought the Marazzi Company, it was about $1 billion in sales and I think we said then it was represented, in total, $1 billion around the world. And we said Russia represented about 25% of that, and so the business has grown over the last couple of years.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And then the margins to compression that you expect from these various dynamics?","Frank H. Boykin","Well, they'll go down, but we're not ready to quantify it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall from RBC.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is actually Desi filling in for Bob. You discussed the price increases for the carpet segment that you realized in April in order to offset raw material costs. Given the recent decline in oil prices, are you seeing any raw material relief on the petroleum-based inputs for the segment as we've gone to the fourth quarter?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We have not seen any basic changes in our raw material costs. The raw material cost that we've said do follow oil over the long term, but in the short term, the chemicals and resins aren't always aligned, so we haven't seen any yet. If they stay down continuously for a long time, we would expect to see so.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you guys are obviously investing heavily in the business to realize improved margin performance and expand your product offering. And then as we think about CapEx requirements for the business going forward, do you expect to remain in that $550 million area for 2015? Or should they trend lower over time as the spending related to the integration of the acquisitions are completed?","Frank H. Boykin","We, at this point, don't expect to spend the same number next year that we're spending this year. We don't have a final budget yet, but we're not looking at spending the same number this -- next year as we are this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Jeff, if you look at the -- you made some comments about the U.S. remodel\/repair market. How much do you think it's down? And are you starting to see pricing pressure come through on your categories? And I guess, which categories are you seeing the weakest type performance?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The remodeling business has not improved as we had expected. I can't say that we have a definitive reason why it is for the different pieces. We believe that the mortgage problems that people are having, getting mortgages, are impacting existing home sales. Some new buyers coming in the marketplace with the debts they have, these young people are impacting it. So we think that it's going to improve, they just haven't come back as fast as we have thought as they go through. With that, the marketplaces are less robust than everyone had expected and there are various promotions and things in the various categories as people try to balance sales with their asset levels.","Frank H. Boykin","And it's hard for us to quantify the difference between new construction and remodel because there's overlap between customers and products and things like that, so to give a number would just be a guess on our part, Stephen.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. Okay. Fair enough. And then, Jeff, if you -- when your CapEx gets big, I look at it as 4%, 5%, 6% of sales, I really think of that in the same vein as I look at acquisitions. And you did -- between last year and this year, you're pushing what, $900 million or so, so a decent-sized acquisition, if you will. Can you help us understand, with acquisitions, it's fairly easy to see what's going on from a margin perspective and whether you're getting top line. We can't really see that with CapEx. Can you help us a little bit with what do you think we've seen so far out of the last 2 years' worth of spend? And what do you think is still on to come? I know we've got the LVT plant that is going to make a big difference, but maybe some of the other moving parts to it.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","If you look at the overall CapEx, we have about $70 million to $90 million in maintenance, safety, environmental things each year, depending upon what it is and basically those are just keeping the business running. We internally have a rigorous process for deciding what to do. When we look at it, most of the cost reduction projects typically have between 2- and 5-year paybacks. When we look at investments that are going to expand the sales, they tend to be a little longer, could be 4 to 6 years, because the start-up time in getting them go through could be less. If you look at what we spent in 2014, the big pieces are around replacement of high-cost assets and our acquisitions that we knew when we went in that we would have to do things to get their margins up. There where businesses like the Pergo business, which had very low margins; the European ceramic business, which had no profits that we knew we were going to invest in; we've announced and we started the spending towards putting in a new porcelain plant that makes technical porcelain in the U.S. and Tennessee; we're in the process of putting up a new LVT plant in Europe; we've expanded the production capacity of ceramic planks and larger sizes in the U.S.; we have fiber and yarn investments in the carpet business that support the changing product trends, it happens about once every 20 years, we have to replace huge parts of the assets; and then we have numerous smaller projects across the businesses each year.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. If you sort of broke it out between your spend to drive volume versus your spend to improve your margin, how would you, sort of, allocate that bucket?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We have it, but I don't have it in front of me. But each project, each division, each piece and I can't -- I don't have it to give you anything. It's made up of those pieces that we talked about.","Frank H. Boykin","Just to, Stephen, reemphasize Jeff's point on going through a rigorous process, we do. We get down into a lot of the details at the division level and then here as well, when we have capital projects that are brought up.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Listen, the reasons the margins are improving are all these things we've been doing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if we go back to the margin improvement and look specifically at the carpet and ceramic side, clearly a very good job in a tough top line environment. But if I look at the profit improvement, so $1 growth in profits in excess of $1 growth in sales. So even if you're executing on these kind of productivity improvements, that seems like it's probably unsustainable. I think margin -- guidance for fourth quarter, it's just -- we'll still see that in the fourth quarter. But just how to think about the next couple of quarters on the incremental side for those 2 segments?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","So what you're seeing is years of work we've been doing to get ready for this, including the capital investments we just talked about, about the businesses. If you look in the carpet business, we've closed a significant number of facilities; we've consolidated different parts of the business; we've replaced higher costal assets; we simplified the product line and the raw material structures; we've consolidated and reduced the administrative costs multiple times in the last year or 2. We've invested in new systems to improve the efficiency of the business and we've spent a lot of effort trying to increase our product differentiation, which helps our margins in that. So I mean, all those things coming together have had a significant impact on the way we operate the business.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. Okay. My second question. On the lower laminate sales in the U.S., I'd imagine it's maybe hard from quarter-to-quarter to get a great read on this, but what's your confidence level on -- that this is truly just a weak R&R environment versus things like LVT actually eating into market share for laminate in the U.S.? Any color you have on that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I mean, our Ouija board probably doesn't work a lot better than anybody else's. We believe that the laminate business will grow but at a slower overall rate than the overall flooring category because of the competition it has with other things. Also, there's some pressure on the higher-end products with ceramic and other alternatives going after it. Our business is focused more on the middle- to higher-end of the marketplace, where there's more differentiated product which helps us. But in our plans, it will grow slower than the overall market.","Frank H. Boykin","And then one other point to make on laminate is it's -- the end market there is much more limited, it's primarily residential remodel and very little going into new construction and commercial. So that is a headwind compared to the other categories.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Mike Rehaut. First question I had was on the -- going just back to the carpet margin question that was asked earlier. I mean, looking at it another way, in over the last 3 years, you're on track to do kind of at least a mid-8s type of margin this year, you're basically talking about 400 basis points of margin improvement on flattish sales. And so with incremental margins, I believe you've talked about around 20%. I think the math would just dictate that if you're going to get some amount of sales growth over the next 2, 3 years at least that, that 10% margin could be easily surpassed. So I just wanted to know if there's anything that we're missing there in terms of -- I mean, obviously, you can have some short-term disruptions from a cost versus price, but you've been able, in a lot of instances, to achieve price increases when needed, cost-based, that is. So I'm just trying to understand if there's anything that we're kind of missing in terms of what would keep a lid on carpet margins from not exceeding that 10% mark?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","It's definitely our goal to do that. We expect continued benefit from our investments. We expect to continue improving the productivity and new products. We're anticipating, next year, to have continued improvements, but probably a little less as a percentage basis than we did this year. And our goal is to keep driving it up to new heights.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. I know it's hard to give out a target when it's kind of almost been new territory. Second question, just on -- you highlighted some, kind of, more temporary costs in the laminate and wood segment for the quarter. Just trying to get a sense of the order of magnitude, where you had the overall margin down about 130 bps year-over-year, what those kind of more temporary third quarter costs that you don't expect to recur? What was the impact of that on the year-over-year decline?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I'll try to give you a view of the pieces, but the specific numbers, we're not giving out. We had weaker sales in both the U.S. and Europe, which impacted the business; we had higher costs due to new product introductions; we had equipment startups that I went through, which we think are behind us, so those were onetime pieces; in Europe, we're absorbing the cost of investing in LVT; we have the new Czech plant that we bought from someone; we're having to upgrade it and get it where it can make more money; in the U.S., the wood selling prices didn't cover them so the question is where the margins in the selling prices and the cost is going to be in wood, we hope they're going to be better. With all that, we do expect the margins to improve in this segment, both next quarter and next year.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One quick last one, if I could. The Marazzi savings that you expected, are you on track? Or do you think you could even exceed some of your original targets or hopes that you had when you closed the acquisition?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The business is doing better than we had expected. The U.S. business we're now operating as a single business and is working well together. We think we have opportunities to market the 2 brands together, which we've been talking about. The Russian business is operating really well. The market conditions have changed from where we saw it. But when we bought the business, the Russian economy was growing about 5%. And most likely, it's going to be in a recession. And then same thing as here, when you're in recession, our category tends to get hurt worse. As some of the things helping us there are that probably about 25% of the ceramic market was being imported from around the world. So the weak euro is slowing it down and then we believe we're in the best position in the marketplace from a styling standpoint, from a product and a design standpoint and from the franchised stores that are lined with us. However, the remodeling part of the business is being impacted the most at the moment. So we're having to move from that to expanding our position in the new construction business and the DIY channels, which we're doing. But we're expecting the overall marketplace, the pricing pressures to increase, but we're going to increase our market share. And then the final piece of the business is the European business, which was basically earning no money, we have it profitable at this point and growing a profit. And when we get through putting in the new equipment, we'll have a lower cost base and a higher product mix when we get through. And we'll have to decide -- we have in place what we expect to do next year, and -- I mean, it's moving and actually being executed as we speak. And there's possibility for more actions after that once we get it executed. So I think we're doing really well from where we started and some things are in our control and some things aren't.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Frank, I was just wondering, on -- in 2014, if you were to aggregate, sort of, cash flow over spent on restructuring actions in any of the integration, if you could give us a rough sense of what that number was or will be? And then as you look forward to next year, maybe what the change might be, considering any other restructurings you might have planned?","Frank H. Boykin","I don't have it broken down between cash and noncash in front of me, but I can get that for you later, Dennis. I guess, we've incurred about -- in restructuring, about $47 million for 3 quarters, and we could get another range, say, of $23 million to $27 million in the fourth quarter, but timing in terms of decisions that we make and when we execute things may impact that. And then next year, it could range -- and this is all related to the acquisitions. It's really related to Spano and the Marazzi -- Europe Marazzi acquisition. Next year, it could range $40 million to $45 million. And I can get you the cash portion of that later. I don't have it here in front of me.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay, that would be great. And then separate question. As you look across the portfolio, and specifically wood, I know it's not a big business for you. But if you look at the price per foot of wood with the inflation that's been driven by raw materials, what type of GAAP is that versus, let's say, ceramic as an example? And how would that compare versus history?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Are you talking about the cost difference or the selling price difference?","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Selling price to the consumer.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The selling prices of ceramic have had limited inflation, with most of it being caused by the freight movement. Ceramic is very, very expensive to move around the country, but I mean, it's gone up limited amounts. And then the wood prices have gone up substantially as the raw material prices have gone up. So that wood is much more expensive relative to ceramic than it was 2 years ago or 3 years ago.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So does that limit the industry's ability to recover raw material cost inflation on the wood side?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","That's impacting it as well as the capacities in the marketplace doing it as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baugh from Stifel.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I was wondering, if you go back to ceramics, Jeff, and I know you're not going to give a '15 guidance, but there's a lot of moving parts. Obviously, the revenue outlook for Russia and Western Europe is pretty challenged. But I'm just curious, as we think about dollars of EBIT maybe next year in ceramic going up versus flat or negative, do we get enough boost out of the U.S. growth and margin improvement at Marazzi and Europe that we can still look at a pretty good growth next year in ceramics?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I mean, we're expecting to have the top line grow and we're expecting to have the margins go up also as a collective piece, but we're going to lose a part of it relative to the FX. Now I don't know whether the FX is going to get better or worse from here forward. I'm not too good at guessing, but we're expecting both of them to grow and offset it, but it's going to inhibit some of the growth we thought we were going to have.","Frank H. Boykin","And a lot of the changes we're making, John, in ceramic Europe, we're upgrading assets and consolidating plants, et cetera. That's improving our costs and taking our mix up. So that will drive margins and top line a little bit, too, with the mix increase.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","So on a local basis, we expect the European business to be more profitable and we'll probably give up a little taking share in Russia.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then quickly on carpet. Did you benefit at, all from, from rug sales being up materially year-over-year? And do you think your volume of residential carpet share was similar to the trade? And was that negative?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think in the period that we probably did a little bit better than the carpet industry. We are anticipating our rug business doing better going forward. We've made changes in it to improve our product offering. We're using more of our fiber and assets to bake more differentiated products and we've had some changes in the competition in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","You made some comments on commercial being up and strong, in the intro. I guess my question is can you differentiate between carpet and ceramic and trends you're seeing there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think the trends are similar. They have different -- they participate in different channels at different amounts. And then in my carpet segment, we've gone through about 1.5 years or 2 years of transition of moving the product line, the raw material structures, taking complexity out of the business. And those things are giving our business a boost as we are getting to the other side of all those things.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Do you think you're taking market share in carpet in the recent results?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Maybe a little.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg from UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's actually Susan for David. In terms of the promotion, are you seeing any big changes there? And also, have you noticed any changes to the effectiveness that they're having on the consumer?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I doubt that they're changing the consumer much. Typically, promotions in the industry are run as the supply and demand of individual companies move around and people try to equalize their assets with the demand structures of each one. So I don't think that the promotions really change the consumer demand.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on the R&R side, it seems like earlier in the year, it wasn't just getting better but it also seemed like people were maybe ever so slightly moving up to sort of higher-end products as well. And now based on your comments, it seems like that has really slowed dramatically in the second half. What are you hearing from your customers that's really driving this? And to what degree do you think people have stopped purchasing as opposed to perhaps moving down or shifting to different product types?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think, today, the markets are more bifurcated at the top and the bottom. The middle is what's getting hurt the most. The middle buyers are tending to move down or postpone it as much. Some of it may come from -- over the past few years, you had companies investing in homes that they weren't living in them and renting them out. They tend to go with lower-value products than others. People, I think, are concerned about -- in the early 2000s the price of a home was moving up so much that if someone put an investment in their home, they expected to get multiples of it back when they sold it. So having the housing prices move up where people get more comfortable that they invest -- the money they're putting in are investments would help the business more. We think it's going to improve over the future. We think that people want to live in nice places. We think that the mortgage rates are going to get a little easier, the conditions to get them from what the government is talking about. So we're optimistic about the future. But it is what it is today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","As we've discussed in past calls, there's a bit of capacity coming online at the lower end of the carpet market and a capacity that will continue to come online as we go into next year. What, in your assessment, does this do to pricing? And not necessarily the next couple quarters, but how do you position yourself and how do you think about pricing in that end of the market over the next 12 to 24 months?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The capacities coming in was based on expectations of a higher growth rate that we've seen so far as well as the change in the product mix of what people are buying. So some portion of what's coming in is replacing other raw materials and obsoleting other assets that the industry have, such as in olefins, which is declining, so there's many assets that are going to be shut down or not used. With that, there is more capacity in the marketplace and it tends to -- people tend to use the open price point categories to balance out the asset utilizations from time to time, to get them going. And the bottom end of the market is always competitive and we expect it to continue to be.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the laminate wood, I appreciate your comments today on that. But as you -- one of your peers has seen similar-type margin or pricing pressure. And I guess the question would be is the pricing situation improving? Or is it unchanged? Or are you somehow better able to perform and pick up share even though the market is less than ideal?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","First, our share to our total business is relatively small. And second, I want to make sure you understand, our U.S. wood business is not the same as our non-U.S. wood businesses.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Right. I was referring to the domestic.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The domestic business, in addition, you have a solid wood business and an engineered wood business and the dynamics are different because of the raw material content of each. But the recent past being we, as an industry, tried to raise prices and did not get as much as we wanted. I don't see anything that's changed that from 2 weeks ago to now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I've got just a couple questions left, all of them have to do with oil sensitivity. We're looking, obviously, at volumes in the carpet industry that are really muted. Do you need to see growth in industry volumes in order to maintain price? Should raw materials drop via lower oil prices? Or do you think the industry is disciplined to the point where the low oil prices could translate through at current volumes without excessive discounting?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","In my long history, the pricings have gone up and down based on raw materials. As the prices go up, we chase it a little, and as the prices go down, we keep it awhile but it tends to end up being passed through over time. The commodity areas of the business tend to have little differentiation, and I would assume that if the prices fall, there would be some positive impact for a while. But with the capacity utilizations, we will probably pass it through. But historically, it's always moved down there anyway so I don't know if it's really capacity related today or it's just the way we operate. We don't want to earn too much money.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And where would you see -- assuming the oil prices stay down here, where would you see lower oil prices manifest itself first within your various raw materials? My guess would be in the backing, since the backing prices have risen this year, more so than perhaps others. But where might you see it first, Jeff, canary in the coal mine-type stuff.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I can't give you a simple answer I don't repeat. We have each of the different raw materials that we use: polypropylene, polyester, nylon that all have different chemical dynamics in them. So the chemical changes in each industry and what the alternatives for the chemical part of it determines what the prices are with supply and demand. You then have that resin pieces, which you have supply and demand in, which go into various industries beside ours. And the competition of all there, you can have, as we've said before, you can have falling oil prices and rising raw material for us or you can have reverse. So it just has to work its way through based on the world dynamics, too, because the chemicals get shipped around the world and the U.S. dollar strengthened and that's going to impact it. So I mean my predictions of where it's going to go aren't too good, and I have never found a formula that I can convert one to the other.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Last question, if I might. Frank, total transportation costs for the company, I'm aware that there -- it's not all oil-based, obviously, there's going to be labor costs that inflate on you and other ancillary costs that have nothing to do with the price of diesel. But generally speaking, your entire transportation exposure from a cost standpoint is what, ballpark?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I don't think we have the numbers with us, but most of the product categories, the freight is an add-on cost or we add -- we change the price of the products. So we're trying to move the selling prices to take care of them as either freight or the other. We've said before that we raised the freight prices in the second quarter. We just announced that we're going to raise ceramic prices that are sold on a local basis in the first quarter. So I think that we have reasonable ways of managing to pass-through of those costs. They're not exactly lined up but they tend to be pretty close today.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Are they separate from the selling prices of the product, the freight costs?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","It depends on the product and the market and the channel. In ceramic, we have a portion with our service centers that we sell it FOB to local destinations for instance. In our carpet, we tend to sell them with a freight charge added on to it. In other pieces, we have a freight charge embedded to get it to local and then an additional freight charge to get it local -- the long haul embedded in the local freight as an additional charge and all variations thereof.","Frank H. Boykin","I just want to follow up on one question that Dennis had asked earlier about cash versus noncash restructuring this year. As a percentage, cash is probably about 2\/3 of the total. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eli Hackel from Goldman Sachs.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you just talk about maybe what the slower-than-expected growth could do to potentially catalyze additional consolidation in the foreign sector globally? As you think about M&A for your company, are there any specific areas of focus that you're looking at? Obviously, you did deals in Europe and some was a Russian focus more recently. Are you looking towards moving to other areas or more to the U.S. with potentially stronger growth in this country, maybe in the more medium term?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We see the world as an opportunity for us to do acquisitions. We try to find acquisitions that we can leverage our knowledge and\/or leverage our style, design processes in. We go into new marketplaces. We think those things we're capable and we have shown that we can apply those across new places and help people improve the way they go to market. We don't have a specific area that we say we have to be in this one or another one. We look for opportunities in 2 places. One is either to buy businesses that we can improve substantially or buy businesses with really good management and good results that we can take and leverage across other areas and geographies and we operate for both. I can't say that we have one geography that we want to go in. We look for geographies that we think we have advantages in or that will give us a foothold to expand upon. Around the world, there are companies that are owned by private equity, which they're looking to turnover. There are some areas where their businesses, like we bought Pergo, or other ones that their -- the operations of the business aren't what they want and they need capital. And again, I can't say there's one product or geography that's more interesting to us than another.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just quickly. Can you just update us on your LVT plant in Europe and any potential plans to do LVT or build an LVT plant in the U.S.?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Our LVT plant in Europe is in the final stages of being constructed. We are running tests on the product design and specifications as we speak. We have a lot of product design and things going on in the background. It is a new technology. It is different than other technologies that have been tried. It's -- we're going to be conservative in making sure that we test it properly before we bring it to market. I think we're in a good position. It's the second plant in the world, I believe, that's automated and running at high potentials. We have the ability to make products in the high end of the market as well as in the low end of the marketplace. We think it's a good place to start. We'd like to get the learning curve through it and then we would be prepared to open up other plants in other geographies as we thought we're -- give us good returns.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Last quarter, you've commented that SG&A would be up sequentially versus the first half and the back half of the year. And the third quarter run rate is down materially from the first half. Were any of these changes temporary or maybe performance-related that we should expect to come back? Or should we think about these as being more permanent changes to your SG&A? And I'd also find it very helpful if you can just update us on the fixed versus variable part of SG&A.","Frank H. Boykin","The SG&A dollars were about flat, maybe slightly down Q3 this year to Q3 last year, excluding restructuring. And they'll probably be flattish in the fourth quarter this year compared to last year. As we move forward, I would anticipate the dollars to go up as we reinvest back into the business and grow the -- to support growth in the business. But the percentage of SG&A, the sales, we'll be able to leverage that and that should continue to improve. And it's about 50% fixed and 50% variable, somewhere around there.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Great. And then also, just to clarify the tax guidance, which seems to be lower. Can I just confirm that the fourth quarter, you're pointing to about an 18% or under an 18%? And is there any -- I'm just wondering if there's anything that you've structurally changed there on the tax side. Or if you can give us just the mix that we should think about for next year to figure out where we come in within your guidance.","Frank H. Boykin","Rates should be about 19% for the fourth quarter, and really, the rate is impacted between quarters and in between years, based on regional dispersion of the earnings and also between quarters based on timing of certain deductions. And looking forward, we're estimating at this point that our rate -- tax rate would be in the range of 22% to 23%.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","You gave him the quarter, what is the annual tax rate for '14?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes. The annual rate for '14 is -- would be around 21%.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to talk to you a little bit about LVT. We've seen a tremendous amount of capacity opening up in the industry, seems you can't really go for a bike ride in the country without passing a new plant. And I was curious if you could just talk a little bit about how you think about your capacity, which you're bringing online, relative to what you see others doing? What we're -- what I sort of see when I look out there is a category that has gotten everybody very excited. Nobody really -- it's, kind of, like new land, nobody has really staked it out yet. I'm very curious as to how you anticipate the success being achieved in -- for individual players. What's -- what kind of strategies will, in your view, likely be the path to success? Is it going to be distribution? Or is it going to be product innovation? Just if you could talk a little bit about that.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Just to clarify the question, do you want a capacity discussion or a strategy-to-sell discussion?","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, more of the strategy to establish a strong presence in that category versus others.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Let's start first. Our plant is in -- the one we're building right -- the one that's up -- that's going to be up soon is in Europe. In Europe, there is one other low-cost high-performance plant there, and I'm not aware of another one being announced at the moment. So we think we're in good position there. In the U.S. market, the marketplace is somewhere around $900 million, I believe, in wholesale this year. It's expected to grow at double-digit rates over the next few years. The amount of capacity coming in the industry is somewhere around 40% to 50% of the sales in 2014. The Chinese have been supplying the marketplace, so it depends on the -- what happens with the ability to compete with the Chinese, both on a cost basis and a style and design basis, what's going to happen with the capacity questions. On an individual basis, you're going to have companies that have different strengths. We believe that our business, it is very similar to both our laminate business and somewhat with our ceramic business -- we think that we have advantages in the style and design category to take our knowledge from those businesses and apply it to the new business. In addition, our ability to get to all categories of the market in commercial as well as residential in all the different channels with our sales forces and the relationships we have, we think will allow us to achieve the shares we would like in the industry.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So when you look across LVT, currently, how much of that business do you think -- or the demand do you think is commercial versus resi? In the U.S., I'm talking about. And do you anticipate that the growth will be greater in commercial or resi as you look forward over the next few years in LVT?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I'm guessing, but I believe that the commercial part is probably around 40% of the industry at this point, and we see it growing in both categories.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then the second question I had generally is about brand. And I was curious as to whether you believe that brand matter -- has come to matter less in the various flooring products that you've seen and is perhaps other things such as innovation have -- or just flat-out costs have allowed manufacturers to -- or have allowed customers to sort of move away from brand and just sort of seek value in other ways or if you still think brand is still very, very important in the category.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think that the brand price and style and design and service are all components of the same thing. And what you have is, some competitors that have little differentiation and tend to -- the only thing they tend to sell is price on one extreme. And then you have the ability, which I think we do, to compete on a price basis in one part of the marketplace, to compete on a style and design in another part of the marketplace and to compete on a service level at another part of the marketplace. And so I think that it depends where in the value stream you're playing and which channels or markets you're playing, how much it means to each.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And where do you think you've seen the most change with respect to the design and innovation in terms of that becoming more important? Would you say it's been mostly in the ceramic area or the carpet area?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I mean, I think -- I'll give you examples of all. In carpet, we led the industry with a product called SmartStrand, which has a differentiated position. We led the industry in creating ultra soft carpets, which dramatically changed the premium part of the industry. In ceramic, we've led the industry in using Reveal technology, which is a unique printing technology. Today, about 20% of the industry in ceramic is being sold in wood planks, which didn't exist 3 or 4 years ago. And we have the most options, the most sizes, the most links. For instance, we translate that into other looks as well. In laminate, we have a premium high-end position, which we get because our products are different from others and people are willing to pay more for a Ferrari than they are for a Volkswagen. So, I mean it's everywhere.","Operator","There are no other questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Jeff Lorberbaum for closing comments.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you for joining us. I think that we had a good quarter. I think that the strategies we're using are enabling us to outperform the marketplace. And I think the investments we're putting in are going to allow us to do better on an ongoing basis. The management of the business is in the strongest position it's ever been at, and I think that our company has significant opportunities for the long-term future.","Thank you for joining us.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Mohawk Industries\u2019 Quarterly Investor Conference Call. We\u2019ll update you on the company\u2019s progress during the first quarter of 2014 and provide guidance for the second quarter and the full year.","I would like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. During the quarter, our earnings per share were $1.11 as reported, or $1.23 excluding unusual charges, an increase of 41% over adjusted first quarter 2013 results. Our adjusted operating income increased 47% as productivity initiatives drove higher earnings across divisions and our operational improvements gained traction in our acquisitions.","For the period, our sales were up 22% favorably impacted by our acquisitions. In addition, the first quarter had one less shipping day compared to the prior year, which equates to approximately 1.5% of net sales. As we ended the first quarter, we began seeing the greatest improvement in our U.S. domestic sales in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions, which were hardest hit by winter storms during the first quarter.","First quarter earnings were higher than we expected due to our acquisitions, improved productivity, results outside North America, and lower taxes, although the severe winter weather in the U.S. impacted sales. During the period, we continued making progress in our acquisitions, including enhancing our organizational structures, sales strategies, product offerings, and productivity and manufacturing improvements.","We expect to make significant progress on our acquisition initiatives throughout the coming year. During 2014, we plan to invest $500 million in new capital expenditures, the highest amount in our company\u2019s history and various projects to support growth and margin expansion, including expanding carpet, fiber and yarn capacity, increasing tile capacity around the world, and building an LVT plant.","In the U.S., we expect the economy will improve from a sluggish first quarter with GDP expanding between 2.5% and 3% for the year. Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing study expects improving residential remodeling as homeowners upgrade properties after years of deferred investments. The National Association of Homebuilders continues to project increases in new construction \u2013 new home construction.","And the National Association of Realtors is anticipating a rebound in home sales for the remainder of the year after severe weather reduced the first quarter results. The U.S. Consensus Bureau forecast expanding non-residential construction during 2014 with hospitality and office channels outpacing overall commercial growth.","In other markets, the Mexican economy is showing some positive signs with consumer confidence improving in March and inflation dropping. In April, the International Monetary Fund raised its 2014 growth estimates for the euro zone as recovery gains traction in some of the larger economies, after several years of postponing purchases of both residential and commercial flooring and upside exists in Europe when the recovery accelerates.","In Russia, the economy is expected to slow to little to no growth this year, but the weaker ruble should reduce the importation of ceramic and improve demand for locally manufactured tile. During the quarter, the carpet segment adjusted operating margins rose 60 basis points to 5.1% as a result of productivity improvement, cost reductions, and improved pricing.","Net sales were down 3%, as reported, or off 1.5% adjusted for one less shipping day in the period. Our residential business outperformed our other categories.","We saw marked improvement in our daily sales rate in the latter part of the quarter and we anticipate our second quarter top line growth improving in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions as they recover from the harsh winter.","Presently, retailers are reporting improved traffic as they implemented more aggressive marketing to drive sales. We continue to reduce our cost in both our operations and administrative structures to align staffing with improvements we\u2019ve made in our systems and processes.","In residential, our UltraSoft products continue to grow and capture a greater share of the premium carpet market. We anticipate continued success with these products this year as consumers purchase higher quality products when they remodel their homes. We are expanding the number of retail stores selling our premium Karastan carpets to broaden the distribution of the brand. Our new Continuum products may drop to 100% recycled polyester are gaining momentum in both the value added and promotional price points.","The segmentation of our residential salesforce into two focus groups, retail and builder multifamily, is enhancing our penetration into each of these channels. Mohawk\u2019s SmartStrand Silk collection again this year received the dealer recognition for the best carpet introduction and for the best display system that showcases our comprehensive offering and attributes of our premium SmartStrand carpets.","Our commercial business continues to transition to our new Duracolor performance fibers, which provides greater value and improved styling. Our introductions from last year are now among our best selling products and improve our efficiencies and margins. We updated our Quickship program in carpet tile to maximize our sales and enhance our service and efficiencies. We are expanding our luxury vinyl tile offering to satisfy commercial, as well as residential requirements in anticipation of our new manufacturing capabilities.","We are also added a new resilient sales specialist, as well as turnkey program to offer complete projects including installation. We continue to increase our extrusion and yarn capacity to support our expanding Continuum polyester with state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies that maximize our efficiencies. We have enhanced our service in quality levels in both residential and commercial products through better planning, inventory management and process controls. Numerous productivity projects including operational enhancements, reengineered materials and capital investment are generating significant savings. This month, we announced a price increase of 2% to 4% for carpet to offset inflation in material, energy and freight. We have included the impact of carpet pricing in materials into our guidance.","During the period, our ceramic segments adjusted operating margins grew 160 basis points to 9%, as a result of higher volumes efficiency games and improved mix. Net sales rose 69% compared to the prior year primarily due to the Marazzi acquisition, which delivered particularly strong results in Russia, as well as legacy sales growth in North America. In the U.S. sales in Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast were impacted by the same extreme weather conditions during the period similar to our carpet segment.","The segments U.S. performance improved in the later part of the quarter and continues to expand in the beginning of the second period. Our new U.S. organization is delivering improved results. We are expanding the distribution of our combined American Olean and Marazzi collections by providing distributors a more comprehensive offering. We are on track to implement 14 combined American Olean Marazzi service centers in areas where we are not supported by independent distributors this year.","Our larger sizes rectangles and longer planks are expanding our style and design and enhancing our market position. The introduction of new collections produced in our European, Chinese, and Mexican plants are further improving our U.S. offering and margins by replacing other products that we have previously purchased.","We are expanding our ceramic shop within a shop merchandising concept with flooring retailers. We anticipate having 200 showrooms activated by the end of this year. As new home construction continuous to expand, increasing our position with regional builders and adding new fashionable collections that will improve their product mix.","In the commercial channel, increased new construction remodeling are improving our performance. For the 10 consecutive year, we received the dealer award for best ceramic product in North America\u2019s largest flooring trade show. Efficiencies gain through manufacturing and distribution process improvements, labor productivity initiatives and reengineered materials in U.S. will further improve our margins.","Our Dallas Ceramic manufacturing expansion should be completed by the third quarter adding about 50 million square feet of capacity with capability to manufacture products up to 48 inches long in the U.S. During the period, we announced construction of a new ceramic plant in Tennessee, which is expected to start up production by the end of 2015.","The plant will manufacture premium commercial and residential products, which we have historically imported. We have begun to realign our U.S. facilities by product type to reduce changeovers and improve efficiencies. We expect the realignment to take over a year to fully complete.","Our sales in Mexico continue to increase as we broaden our ceramic product line and distribution. Our expanded product offering is being well received and our margins growing, but improved product mix. Manufacturing and distribution efficiencies are reducing our costs and additional Reveal printing investments are creating higher value products for the market.","We have made significant progress in restructuring our ceramic business in Europe by introducing new sales strategies improving our product mix and reducing our costs. In the first quarter, the business increased its profitability at the execution of our strategies drove improved results on the plant floor, as well as the market place.","Our margins have expanded as we upgraded our product mix with larger sizes, broader wood collections and higher value commercial products. Our wood tile manufacturing consolidation in Spain, our wall tile manufacturing consolidation in Spain has been completed and our investments to enhance our European glazed porcelain styling and efficiencies are underway.","We continue to increase sales of our products outside Northern Europe and markets that are growing faster. To improve efficiencies and effectiveness of our sales force, we introduced CRM technology across the business in Europe. Our SG&A costs are declining as we streamline our organization and more effectively market our products. We have improved working capital management with increased inventory turns and better management of receivables.","On a local basis, our ceramic business in Russia grew significantly in both revenues and operating income for the period with higher volumes and improved mix from our collections we introduced last year despite a slowing economy and industry. Our results were negatively affected by currency as the ruble weakened significantly and impacted both our raw material costs, as well as our financial translations. Our Russian business just introduced the largest new product collection in its history and its enthusiastic reception has reinforced our market leading design position.","During the quarter, we completed to startup of a new porcelain production line to meet growing demand. We have increased our logistics efficiencies, reducing costs and enhancing service to our customer. We announced a price increase in Russia which should be executed in the second half of the year to offset inflation and the impact of currency on our raw materials. We continue to improve productivity and conversion cost across worldwide ceramic operations. We are reengineering body composition and manufacturing processes to lower our cost structures. We are also investing in new capacity to increase our production of rapidly growing ceramic wood planks in all markets.","During the period, adjusted operating margins for the laminate and wood segment rose 110 basis points over the prior year to 11.5% with productivity initiatives acquisitions synergies and price increases partially offset by higher wood cost. Net sales in the segment increased 16% over the prior year reported or 13% on a currency and exchange rate with most of the increase in this final acquisition higher volume in wood flooring and growth in insulation boards.","In the U.S. during the period weather reduced segment result like our other businesses as customers reduced inventory in response to slower store traffic and consumers differing flooring purchases. Our new Reclaimed laminate was voted the best collection by North American dealers at the market. During the period with again shipping our first natural wood collection by Quick-Step creating a brand extension with improved styling, maintenance and installation. We implemented flooring price increases and freight increases in March to offset rising wood costs and transportation expense. We have further announced price increases in April to cover increasing wood costs again.","Our European net sales on a constant exchange rate were up slightly compared to the prior year from warmer weather and some economic improvement. We are completing the rollout of our updated Pergo laminate offering with sophisticated designs, performance features and installation. The Pergo product transition should be complete in the second quarter and should enhance our sales and market position.","To support our laminate growth in Russia, we are implementing strategies to expand our DIY business and address opportunities in other distribution channels. We are also launching new laminate products in Europe to participate in the commercial channel using the Pergo brand. We are leveraging the strength of our Pergo and Quick-Step brands and our wood offerings in Europe, and have begun investment in our new wood plant in the Czech Republic to produce our existing products. This facility will extend the reach of our wood business in Europe and Russia. It will also allow our Malaysian wood plant, which has been running at full capacity to expand sales in Australia and Asia.","Construction of our European LVT plant is on schedule with production slated to begin in the fourth quarter of this year. We are expanding our LVT sales in Europe and the U.S. to support this new production capacity. Our European insulation business expanded significantly in the Benelux region and our new French facility is driving sales growth in that market.","Our roof panel business remains soft and to improve our results, we continue to decrease our manufacturing and SG&A costs. We continue to make progress as planned with the integration of our Unilin and Spano board businesses. We have realized synergies, including the consolidation of production lines and sales organizations, as well as lower material and energy costs. During the second half of the year, we expect to integrate the information systems, which will further enhance the organization.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period.","Frank H. Boykin","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $1.813 billion, up 22% from last year, or 1% on a pro forma basis. This year had one less day in the quarter as compared to last year, which equates to 1.5% of sales. Sales were impacted more than expected as difficult weather conditions continued through much of the quarter.","Our gross margin was 26.5% as reported. Excluding restructuring, it was 26.9%, up 130 basis points. Productivity initiatives were the biggest driver with some benefit from volume in ceramic. SG&A dollars were $351 million or 19.3% of sales. Excluding restructuring, SG&A was 19% of sales, a 10 basis point decrease over last year. Our businesses continued to exercise strong control over spending.","On a pro forma basis, our SG&A dollars are about flat. Restructuring charges for the quarter were $12 million and included $2 million in ceramic and $10 million in the laminate and wood segment with 50% of this total included in cost of goods sold and the remaining amount in SG&A. We estimate $20 million in additional restructuring in 2014 as we continue to integrate our acquisitions.","Our operating income margin was 7.9% of sales. This represents growth of 140 basis points resulting from increased productivity, cost control and some volume improvement. Our interest expense was $22 million. It increased over last year due to financing of the acquisitions in 2013. We estimate fiscal year 2014 interest to be $85 million, which includes the impact of our new commercial paper program.","Our income tax rate was 22% for the quarter, which was less than anticipated due to timing of certain items. We still expect the full-year rate up 22%, but anticipate the second quarter and the third quarter to be higher and the fourth quarter to be lower by 200 to 300 basis points. However, timing could impact quarters different than expected due to complexity of our tax structure and our geographic footprint. Our earnings per share excluding charges was $1.23. This is up 41% from last year.","We move to the segments, in the carpet segment, our sales were $675 million, down 3% from last year. Weather impacted shipments more than anticipated, but we are expecting more normalized trends in the future.","Our operating income margin was 5.1%. This is up 60 basis points as our carpet business continues to improve productivity. In the ceramic segment, sales were $695 million, an increase of 69% over last year. This includes Marazzi sales of $272 million with the Marazzi acquisition driving most of the growth this quarter.","On a pro forma constant exchange basis, sales were up 3% with all three regions increasing. Our U.S. business experienced slower growth than expected with bad weather in the quarter.","Our operating income margin excluding charges was 9%. This is up 160 basis points with increased productivity and some volume growth driving the improvement. Our laminate and wood segment sales were $468 million, an increase of 16% over last year. This was primarily impacted by the Spano acquisition, which had first quarter sales of $42 million this year.","Sales were up approximately 2% on a pro forma constant exchange rate basis for this segment. Both our European and U.S. businesses were up with the U.S. impacted by weather. Our operating margin, excluding charges, was 11.5%, up 110 basis points with the Pergo and Spano synergies and productivity improvements driving the increase.","In the corporate elimination segment, our operating loss was $8 million and we are estimating $30 million for the full year. If we jump to the balance sheet, receivables ended the quarter at $1.175 billion. This includes $334 million from acquisitions, which was not in last year\u2019s numbers, and equates to a DSO of 51 days.","Our inventories ended the quarter at $1.632 billion. This includes $268 million from acquisitions, which were not included in last year\u2019s numbers. Our inventory days at the end of the quarter were 116 days. Fixed assets were $2.745 billion and included total capital expenditures of $122 million for the quarter with depreciation and amortization of $81 million.","We estimate capital expenditures for the full year of $500 million primarily for capacity expansion as our U.S. economy expands and we assimilate our acquisitions. Our 2014 full year D&A is estimated at $350 million. Long-term debt ended the quarter at $2.4 billion. Our leverage at 2.3 times debt to EBITDA was impacted as our seasonal working capital built up. We expect our ratio to improve to 1.7 times by the end of the fourth quarter of 2014.","Jeff, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","","Thank you, Frank. Our management team is executing strategic initiatives to maximize our acquisitions and implementing best practices in process improvement to enhance our legacy business. Although the pace of economic improvement varies across our markets, we are driving innovation, operational excellence and sales growth to optimize our results.","In each of our businesses, we have many local advantages, including leading market position, highly recognized brands, diverse distribution and efficient manufacturing that position our business for growth in each market as it improves. Although, the weather in the first quarter impacted our U.S. business, order and shipments began improving as the period ended.","Our non-U.S. growth was higher in the first period due to warmer weather in Europe than last year and better performance of our Russian product introductions. We are implementing product and freight increases as required to offset inflation across the business.","In the second quarter, we anticipate an improvement in the U.S. resulting in a sales increase of 5% to 6% for the total company. With these factors, our guidance for the second quarter earnings is $2.14 to $2.23 per share and for the full year $8 to $8.30 per share, excluding any restructuring charges. We remain positive about both our strategies to enhance Mohawk results and overall outlook for the floor covering industry this year. We are planning to increase capital investments across the enterprise to support the introduction of innovative products, increased capacity to sustain our growth, and drive productivity, efficiency and cost improvement. We remain focused on increasing shareholder value by driving our top line growth and improving our bottom line.","We will now be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with the JPMorgan. Mr. Rehaut your line is open. Please check your line to see if your line is muted first. Question withdrawn. Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS.","","Unidentified Analyst","My name is actually Susan for David. You made mention to the fact that you have seen some improved traffic since the weather has turned, but that some of this is coming off of some increased promotional activity that you are doing. Can you just give us a little bit more color around the magnitude of the promotions that you are offering and maybe how they are working? Are you seeing people more inclined to move up in terms of price points as a result or what you are seeing?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think what I\u2019ve said was we were seeing our customers doing more activity to get people in their stores. Their business was down, so they became more aggressive in attracting people as the weather got better. So our promotional activity really hasn\u2019t changed dramatically from what we\u2019ve been doing. If you look at it again, the regions that were most impacted by the weather experienced significantly slower sales during the first part of the year. The trends of our bookings were increasing significantly in the second half of March and coming into in April. And again like I said, to give you a better view of it, we are expecting the total sales improvement in total company to be about 5% to 6% in the second quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then in terms of your uses of cash, I know that you expect to spend a record level in terms of capital expenditures this year. How do you think about debt paydown and maybe potential other uses that could come up?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Our balance sheet is in good shape. Our debt related to our cash flow has been improving. We have capabilities of increasing our debt significantly. The capital investments we think are good investments and good returns to maximize our business over time. So we think we are in good shape, and we still have a balance sheet that we can go do additional acquisitions and more investments where we please.","Frank H. Boykin","","So our focus is probably going to be in terms of capital allocation and continuing to invest in the business with capital expenditures, looking for strategic M&A opportunities, and that\u2019s going to be the focus and paying down debt on capital allocation.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Michael Dahl with Credit Suisse.","Michael Dahl \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks. I wanted to follow-up on the question about promotional activity and appreciate that it\u2019s not you driving it, but at the same time you are trying to push through pricing across channels. So can you talk about whether you are seeing that impact your ability to push price as your customers are trying to do more to drive traffic into their stores?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We have a lot of different businesses with a lot of different pricing actions going on. The actions in all the businesses are trying to recover the inflation that\u2019s going on? They are all at different implementation parts. Some of them have been recently implemented, other ones won\u2019t be implemented for a month or two as we go through. Some of them have just been recently announced.","So they are all in process. We have to, as always, react to the marketplace\u2019s needs and what competition does. And as far as we can see at this point, we believe we are going to be able to recover the inflation that\u2019s going on in most of our markets.","Michael Dahl \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks. And as a follow-up, I guess, on carpet specifically, it seems like if we take into account the pricing that\u2019s been put into place and granted this was a tough quarter with the weather, but it seems like square footage is still down in that business. Can you give us a sense of how you are thinking about that and how you are seeing the market from a \u2013 progressing from a square footage basis? Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","","The industry in the first quarter was down with negative units. It was impacted by the weather and everything else. Our anticipation for the rest of the year is that the units turn positive somewhere in range of maybe 3% could be more or less.","Michael Dahl \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ken Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Good morning.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbau","","Good morning.","Frank H. Boykin","Good morning.","Ken Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","I wonder \u2013 you gave the sales guidance for the second quarter, which I appreciate that. One of the things I think investors are struggling with is kind of the \u2013 you guys obvio1usly have a lot of integration benefits that you are accruing, but if one looks at the end markets domestically, I think generally some categories we\u2019ve seen sharp bounce back.","So there wasn\u2019t activity in January, February and parts of March that snapped back. And your 6% guidance kind of gives a steady flow. Did you see a lot of variance within your domestic businesses? So tile, for example, at the DIY retail as opposed to tile in your stores going to construction. And could you maybe give a comment around that to give a little more granularity in terms of how the weather impacted your products in different channels?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I don\u2019t know if I will be able to give you anymore data, I can give you some direction of where it is. First is, our different product categories have different amounts of growth. So the ceramic business in the U.S. is growing faster than carpet business and the laminate business, so it starts at a higher growth. They relatively though, they all decreased approximately the same amount with the weather. As you look in the channel, all of these businesses are having increases in the new construction channel as the new construction continues to increase.","Some of the quarterly or monthly variation you see, it gets averaged out by the time they order the products. And so we don\u2019t see as much month-to-month variation as you see in the stark numbers, we tend to trend six to nine even twelve months behind those as they go through. We are seeing and anticipate further improvement in the remodeling business. We believe that as the economy gets better, we will see more people moving in it. And in the remodeling part, people tend to use higher value products so the better it gets, the better our mix gets as we go forward.","","Ken Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thank you. And then I guess in the Unilin, I did see there was, relative to Pergo, the retail side, I saw that Unilin has some infringement cases. Could you comment on perhaps how you are doing share wise in Unilin Pergo and then I believe, in Columbia, the hardwood, could you comment on pricing and margins and how effective you\u2019ve been at holding market share? Thank you.","","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","","The first question, I think it was about laminate. The laminate business is growing slower than the flooring industry as a whole. We are mainly focused on the medium to high-end part of the business in our markets. We intend to have limited participation on the lower end, because we focus on creating higher value products with more differentiation in it.","I think that within our markets that we focus on, that our share is stable or growing slightly as we go forward and the other part of the question? And the wood business, our wood business, the volumes are going up. The profitability has been impacted by the significant rising cost in wood. We had anticipated that they would peak right now. They still kept rising. With that, we\u2019ve raised prices twice in the first half of this year, the first was for 5% and it\u2019s been executed. And the second is around 10% is in the process of being executed. Our profitability in the division has improved as the volume has gone up and helped us leverage the cost of our assets across the business.","Ken Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much, guys, strong quarter. I wanted to ask you about how things progressed in terms of the productivity through the quarter. Obviously, you performed very well in a tough environment. And I was curious as to whether or not there was anything that sort of landed in the \u2013 let\u2019s say the March timeframe when you were observing the results coming in that surprised you positively, particularly whether there was maybe anything you kind of thought might may materialize as a benefit in 2Q but actually wound up in 1Q. Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I don\u2019t think that there was any unusual things. Frank, why don\u2019t you go through the taxes because I think that\u2026","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, I think there was one positive surprise outside of the operations though, as you know, Stephen. The tax rate we estimated to be 24% and actually it came in at 22%. And as I said earlier, as I was going through my presentation, we still expect the full-year rate to be 22% with Q2 and Q3 to be higher and Q4 to be lower than that. But the tax rate is kind of hard by quarter to estimate because timing of different things could impact us and particularly more difficult was our complexity has grown and our geographic footprint has expanded. And that\u2019s probably the thing that was the biggest surprise in the quarter.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Do you have the impact of taxes in the first quarter?","Frank H. Boykin","That was about $0.04 a share from 22% to 24%.","Stephen Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then you have indicated that in the second quarter and even at the very, very end of the first quarter, you began to see a bit of a snapback in recovery and volumes. And we talked about weather impact. Normally we think of that sort of being additive to what your normal run rate would be \u2013 normalized run rate would be.","So in 2Q, you\u2019ve sort of talked about a 5% to 6% overall sales growth rate. Should we interpret from that that as we get into 3Q and 4Q that all things equal you would think kind of a normalized growth rate would be somewhere south of 5% to 6%, or would it be different than that for some reason?","Frank H. Boykin","I think that we believe that it\u2019s going to continue at that rate or maybe even stronger as the economy improves and people start investing more. So that would be \u2013 we hope it is going to be better than that.","Stephen Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Well, so do we. Thanks very much, guys. A very strong quarter.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates","Good morning. Thank you. Frank, on the $500 million of CapEx this year, how many plants are actively under construction right now and then what would your current capital plan look like as you move into 2015?","Frank H. Boykin","Well, in terms of actually plants under construction, new plants, would just be two, I guess \u2013 the LVT plant that we have over in Europe and then the ceramic plant that we\u2019ve just started in Tennessee. I think that\u2019s right. And then we have got a number of new lines or expanded lines across the world that we are adding. I\u2019m not sure I know off the top of my head.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We are putting ceramic in Russia as we speak where we are updating equipment. In Italy, ceramic, we have a new line going in Dallas we talked about. We have announced the building of a ceramic plant in Tennessee, which isn\u2019t out of the ground yet. We are putting significant increases in extrusion capacity in our carpet divisions. I think those would be the biggest single dollar amounts, but there is a lot of activities to increase efficiencies, productivity and impact product development, product offering, as well as maintenance things going on.","Frank H. Boykin","And then with regards to future CapEx, I mean it really depends on kind of how we see the industry growing across around the world as well as requirements from our M&A activity. This year is a large year because of growth and the assimilation of the acquisitions. And it\u2019s probably a little bit early right now in the year to be forecasting for next year. But it could be something a little bit more than D&A, which is kind of a normal run rate for us.","Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates","Okay. And then just from a P&L standpoint, all of that you have going on either on new plans or those that are in the works, what kind of expense benefit would you get next year if you don\u2019t see a reacceleration or acceleration in anything that is maybe not planned? Is it possible that you see expense leverage improved next year since some of these costs roll off?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","","We don\u2019t have the numbers here, but on all of our significant investments we expect to get reasonable returns on those as we go forward. Some of them take \u2013 if you put in a new plant, it takes a long time to get the sales up, to get the leverage, could take a year or two years out. Other ones your turn on \u2013 other investments you turn on in the next months to get advantages from it.","Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates","Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel.","John A. Baugh \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","John.","John A. Baugh \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Q2 sales guidance annually (technical difficulty) hello?","","Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates","Oh, sorry, guys. I thought I was off. (inaudible) for that exact number, Frank.","John A. Baugh \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Should I wait for the operator to do something.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Go for it. We will see what happens.","John A. Baugh \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay. I was wondering on two fronts, the Russian front, the results there were materially better in the first quarter, it sounds like, than the outlook you gave us. What is your prognosis for the year and I understand that can change with all the tensions building, but do you have a different outlook now versus 90 days ago?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The economy is continuing to \u2013 the economy, we think, is going to be 0% give or take. It could be better or worse than that; we don\u2019t know. We believe the industry is going to be negative in Russia. What we said a month ago we still believe today is that we are going to take actions to improve our position and grow our business in a tough environment. So the only difference is that the last time I think we said this year our earnings are going to be flat and this time we think they are going to be a little bit better than that because of improved product mix that we had in the business. Other than that, they are still going to be \u2013 could be a significant impact based on exchange rate and if you can tell us what they\u2019ll be, we will know what to do with it.","John A. Baugh \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I will leave that up to you. Thanks for that. And then on the acquisition sort of integration, if you could maybe go through Pergo, Spano and Marazzi and tell us how far through you are in realizing the easy initial saves in each of those. And then maybe update us on the timing of when you got aggressive with acquisitions relating to your leverage ratio. Thank you.","Frank H. Boykin","","The start is the \u2013 I will start with Marazzi. Marazzi, the U.S. most of the opportunity that were easier done. The U.S has been reorganized and is operating at one. We are going to have to keep investing in the Marazzi American Olean stores. That is going to take years to get to where we want it to be, but things are in place and being structured. In Russia, basically, we are just funding the growth and continuing the strategies that we had. And we might be about 30% of the way through with the European business. We have restructured it, we\u2019ve done it. We are putting investments in equipment. The first leg of it is coming in this year and it will take us all year to get it in and then next year to get it implemented the way we like.","And then there is further opportunities in the European business after that that will take longer. In the Pergo business, both of the businesses \u2013 the European business and the U.S. business have been totally reorganized. The European business, we have shut down all of their manufacturing; it has been consolidated. We\u2019ve redesigned the strategies in the marketplace. We are right in the middle of reintroducing almost the entire product line with better product as we speak. Those should be in the stores by the end of this quarter and it will take over that six months to just most of the value out of those.","The U.S. business, most of it is done. We have some new equipment coming in, in order to improve some of the costs, which will take probably towards the end of this year before the equipment in and operating. The Spano business, we have closed one plant; we closed the line. We have integrated the sales and operations of the organization. We are looking \u2013 so the easy pieces have been done. We are looking at additional capital investments to throughout possibly some of the worst equipment between the two companies. It hasn\u2019t been concluded what to do yet.","If we move forward with that, it could take a year or two to get all those fully in place from the time you order them to the time you execute them. On the acquisition front, we believe that we have \u2013 the management structures are in place. We have made a huge amount of progress in a year putting all the infrastructure in these things, the strategies have been executed, the teams are leveling out what they are doing. The debt level has come down, the operating margins is come up and all the business and we are in place to do additional acquisition if we find them at the right prices to move forward and we are looking.","John A. Baugh \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you for the color and good luck.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East with ISI Group.","Stephen East \u2013 ISI Group","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Jeff, if you could just talk a little bit more about Russia and the weather, just the Russia from the standpoint of if the tensions escalate, etc., do you all have any contingency planning there? What are your options and possibilities that type of thing, if the government starts creating interference for US-owned companies, etc.? And then on the weather, you talked a lot about the sales line. Can you give us any type of magnitude of inefficiencies from production, shipping, etc.?","","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","","In Russia, the big risk to us are one, is we do import some clay \u2013 a portion of our clay from outside Russia. So we have alternative that we have been looking at. We prefer not to use them as that but we have alternative there we have some negative impact to sales and to the Ukraine, which could impact us. It\u2019s a small part of the total business, but the world blows up and things go crazy we have to react and we can\u2019t anticipate what it might be. We don\u2019t think we are in core industry like the oil and gas business as that we are not anticipating a significant impact on that sort of bigger risk for us we think would be the economy is getting much worse.","Frank H. Boykin","","And we\u2019ve checked with other people too, Stephen, outside experts about that and they confirmed the business we are in, the locations we are in, the risk to ask is from a political standpoint and somewhat limited. The bigger risk is going to the economy and what happens with the economy over there with everything that is going on politically.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I forgot the part of the question.","Stephen East - ISI Group","All right. That is really helpful. Just on the weather, you indicated \u2013 gave us a good idea of the sales impact. Can you give us some type of idea of magnitude inefficiencies, either production, shipping, etc. versus what you would typically expect in the first quarter?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","There were some plant shutdowns and startups that you wouldn\u2019t normally have due to the weather. Now every spring we do have some, so its not a zero baseline. I would just see a couple of million dollars to be more or less between the different pieces across but, again that\u2019s hard to tell most of the shipment I think we are able to get through is more a sales problem other than whatever we have to absorb.","","Stephen East - ISI Group","Okay, thanks. And then just one last thing. As you look at your carpet segment, the performances, you talked a little bit about the different strengths. It sounds like residential was the strongest. Could you just sort of run through new construction, remodeling and on the commercial side, what is going on there? Are we seeing an acceleration or is it sort of a steady-state right now?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","All the businesses were affected by weather. As we have come out of the piece, the builder business is continuing to be the better part of the category as you would suspect. We are seeing improvement in the remodeling business as we go forward. We are hoping a remodeling will continue to strengthen and we\u2019ll see a mix improvement as it does in the business because a consumer who buys their own product tend to buy higher value products. Multifamily business still remains good around the country. The commercial business slowly expected to improve going forward. The indicators are good. We see our bookings levels improving and so those things are supporting the increases we have been talking about.","Stephen East - ISI Group","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good afternoon and great quarter. Just wanted to ask about your capital investment program and your Greenfield ceramic initiatives. Are you guys set on capacity or are you just investing in the new facility because you are very confident about demand and what is your thoughts \u2013 I\u2019m kind of getting the impression you might be taking some market share?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We are looking out for the next \u2013 the ceramic plant from the time you start until the time it is up, you are talking about two years before you get any capacity out of it and being a third year before you start getting it. At the same time, you incrementally put in equipment; you don\u2019t put it all in the first day as you go through. So, if we look out over the next five years, we have done a view of what we think the business is going to grow and so we are increasing the capacity to support that because of the long lead-times.","We also able to, because of our Mexican business, our other one; we are able to support the Mexican business by putting more capacity up here and using more of the Mexican business in Mexico as well as importing changing around. The business is also setup to produce the highest value tile above what we have. We are importing from Italy, the highest value most differentiated pieces lot of it goes in to the commercial business so we\u2019re also putting equipment in there to more aggressively produce locally, the highest end of the product line, which historically has come from imports.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you. And just one question, I just wanted to see, taking the temperature of the European consumer, do you think on a Mid-Continent, I am putting aside Russia, do you think European consumer demand is starting to turn the corner in the U.K. and Germany? Is there any signs of that and what are your outlook in the back part of the year for Europe? Thank you very much.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We are seeing areas where we think the European economy may have bottomed. Some countries \u2013 you can tell about Europe as one. Some countries are doing better than others, so we are more optimistic now than we have been in the past. Our business was up slightly from last year on a comparable basis. In the first quarter, the weather in Europe was slightly warmer just opposite of the U.S. So we think there was some business because of the warmer weather impacting it, which was a positive then. We are not yet sure exactly how to put that looking at the future. And from our position, the things we are doing in our ceramic business to turn it around and make it profitable and the things we are doing with the consolidation of the acquisitions we get and turning of the over the new Pergo line, we think that we can do better because all the activities we are doing.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it.

Just a couple follow-up questions to some of the answers you have given. The plant closure associated with the Spano integration, when was that closed?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","","I think it was in the fourth quarter, but I am not sure. There were so many pieces. I think it was in the fourth quarter.","","Keith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Okay. And then you had mentioned on the Marazzi integration, you were 30% of the way through in Europe. Is the remaining 70% just more rationalization and the production assets there or are there other things involved?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We have ordered equipment that is being delivered to take their glazed flooring business and improved productivity and cost as well as enable us to make higher value products that equipments on its way in as we speak and is being put in over six, nine months because we have to keep supporting the local business while we are doing. We then have further plans depending upon how Europe goes and how we read the market that we could keep investing and improve our cost positions in other parts of the business. And we haven\u2019t turned those loose yet until we finish the first phase and get a better view of what is going on in Europe.","Frank H. Boykin","At the end of the day, with that strategy, Keith, we should have a much more cost-effective and efficient manufacturing operation and raise our mix up from where it was before.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","And just to make sure we understand, we started out with a losing business.","Keith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay.","Jeffrey S.

Other than that, it was easy.","Keith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","All right. Final question, you had talked earlier in the call about 2014 I believe what you called combined service centers where you don\u2019t have distribution and ceramic tile. I assume that\u2019s in North America. Are those locations, are they actually doing retail sales, as well as wholesale or are they just focused on wholesale?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","That was Marazzi\u2019s attempt before we bought them to start building a structure to compete with our business, with our Daltile business. And so they had a limited number of service centers that, for the most part, weren\u2019t doing as well because they had a difficult time having the product breadth to support what was going on.","So what we are doing is we are adding to those stores our American Olean product category so that we can have a total offering and offer the marketplace two options of our own owned products to go through it and then we get through that step, the question is what other geography can we maximize the piece in where we don\u2019t have strong independent distributors to support us and start growing them from there. The initial stores that we\u2019ve done are showing good progress in improving their sales and improving their share of the marketplace, but we are in the early stages.","Keith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Is that \u2013 those sales are wholesale sales from you?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I\u2019m sorry, we don\u2019t sell direct to the consumer in those stores. We sell to contractors, retailers and other things whoever is in the market, but not the retail consumer.","Keith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research","Yes, good morning, everyone. Jeff, just a question on organic growth and capital allocation. Last quarter, you talked about having made 30 acquisitions since 1992. This quarter, you are reiterating the $500 million of CapEx for 2014. Can you just talk about organic growth expectations over the next two years and maybe that was the 5% to 6% number you referenced earlier and how do you think about the right balance over that time from a capital allocation standpoint between organic growth and acquisition growth?","Frank H. Boykin","First, the 5% to 6%, given all the acquisitions and given what happened in the first quarter, we felt that we wanted to try to give you a clear view of the near-term future because it is really hard to understand. So that is what the 5% to 6% was. The capital allocation only starts first with supporting our own business and maximizing our internal growth. And so that is always the first thing we are going to support and keep doing. We are going to have to keep investing in the businesses where we get the proper returns so that we have good cost positions and innovative products to drive our business.","From there, the next one is to continue looking at and finding the right acquisition, which will give us the proper returns for our shareholders we want over time. And so those could be businesses that are doing well that we have just done like the Russian business. They could be businesses that are doing lousy like they have in the ceramic business or the Pergo business where we shut down the manufacturing. And each one of those has a different return expectation based on the risks and how well the business is doing.","David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research","So as you think about that organic growth over the next two years, what is a good rate for us to be thinking about?","Frank H. Boykin","We haven\u2019t really stated a rate. I think that when we look at this year, we said the next quarter would be 5% to 6%. We expect the rest of the year to be \u2013 we are hoping to be stronger than that. And next year, we put together a plan at this point.","David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research","Is it fair to think about industry growth as kind of 3% to 4%?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","","3% to 4% on the U.S. It might even be a little higher. Don\u2019t know","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, it depends on region and it depends on product.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think using that for the U.S., I think 4% for the flooring industry is reasonable.","David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. And you should be gaining share over and above that I guess?","Frank H. Boykin","Well, in terms of actually plants","David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eli Hackel with Goldman Sachs.","Eli C. Hackel \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Thanks, I just wanted to touch on the $500 million in CapEx. Is it possible to break that down how much is for the recent acquisitions, how much is for legacy? In the legacy, how much is maintenance versus growth CapEx?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","It is possible, but we don\u2019t have it to give you. We have it; we just don\u2019t have it in front of us.","Frank H. Boykin","","You can call me, Eli; I can help you a little bit with that.","Eli C. Hackel \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then just in terms of the \u2013 on the commercial side, I just wanted to understand the comments you made on commercial, were those specific to carpet or just love your overall thoughts on what you are seeing in the commercial business and all of your segments?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We\u2019ve made a lot of comments. Some of them were related to the carpet business and the transition of the product line and others where that we were seeing the commercial business improving and our backlog improving, that which relates to the whole business.","Eli C. Hackel \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thanks. Gentlemen, I think you made a comment about laminate growing slower than the industry and carpet growing slower than the industry. Can you just talk a little bit about what is growing faster than the industry, your exposure there and then if you have thoughts about your portfolio relative to what is gaining and losing share relative to the industry in flooring?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Those comments around the U.S. flooring industry first and then the U.S. flooring industry, you have some products growing faster and some growing slower. When we look at it, the faster growing products are going to be wood and ceramic and the slower than the average are going to be carpet and laminate.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Co. LLC","As you think about your portfolio, the Columbia acquisition of a number of years ago, it seems like your wood exposure is smaller. Do you have thoughts from an acquisition perspective that there is a need to get bigger in the wood category or how do you think about that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Recently I mean we have been standing in our wood position in Europe recently with a small acquisition in Europe, but we still have a niche position in Europe and the U.S. we would consider acquisition \u2013 wherever we have knowledge that we can leverage and business is that we can leverage, we would consider those as a possible work place to look at. The decisions will come around what we have to pay for it and the return on investment over time along with the risks associated with those. So anything that is in flooring and for the most part anything in the world we would look at, we would have to then review that based on the risks associated with the geography and the risks","associated with each individual business.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And then secondly, as you are seeing this recovery take shape, again, curious what your thoughts are about the incremental margin of the business through the recovery, especially as it relates to product mix and what you are seeing in terms of the uptake of better product across the segments.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Yes, I don\u2019t think our incremental margins have really \u2013 our view on incremental margins have changed in Europe. As we said, carpet is 20% and tile 25% and laminated in the 30% range. So over the cycle, that would be the view of the incremental margins both up or down in any particular quarter depending on whether we are investing or not.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","And at this time there are no further questions.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We appreciate you joining our call. We are optimistic about our future.

Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Welcome to our conference call, due to multiple request to involve a broader part of our management team Chris Wellborn will be joining us on today\u2019s call. Chris was appointed President of Dal-Tile when we acquired the ceramic business in 2002 and was promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer for Mohawk Industries in 2005. Chris had a deep knowledge and understanding of our entire business and for the past 15 years he has played a critical role in developing and executing our strategy across the entire organization.","Today I\u2019ll review Mohawk\u2019s overall result and Chris will cover the operations of our three segments. In the second quarter Mohawk performance continued at a record level generating the higher sales, operating income and EPS in the company\u2019s history. Our businesses continue to exceptional execution of sales growth of 6% as reported and 8% on a constant days and currency basis including previously announced acquisitions.","Adjusted operating income for the period increased $381 million up 7% overcoming high material and startup costs and reduction of IP. Across the business we\u2019re increasing prices to offset inflation, introducing innovative products and improving our productivity. We\u2019re viewing our growth around the globe with significant investments to extend our product portfolio and penetrate new markets.","As detailed last year, we\u2019re expanding our sales capacity by approximately 1.4 billion. This production will come online over the next 12 months and our startup costs will be higher until we\u2019ve optimized all of our new manufacturing operations later in 2018.","During the period we completed the acquisitions of two small ceramic manufactures to expand our European platform and two U.S. material manufacturing operations to enhance the vertical integration of our business.","Our strong local management teams are identifying opportunities to differentiate our products and improve our productivity. This year we\u2019re increasing our total investments to over $850 million to capitalize on innovative new products, increase automation and greater efficiencies as well as to enhance to the four acquisitions.","Between 2016 and 2018 we\u2019ve many projects being implemented. In the ceramic segment we\u2019re expanding capacity in the United States, Mexico, Italy, Bulgaria, Poland and Russia in adding porcelain countertop plant. In North America segment we\u2019ve been expanding the LVT, laminate, wood, polyester carpet pad and rugs. We\u2019re also upgrading our nylon resin plant.","In the rest of the world segment we\u2019re expanding our LVT, laminate in Europe and Russia and boards, also in entering carpet tile in Europe and sheet vinyl in Russia. In every segment we\u2019re investing in new product innovations, increasing productivity and expanding distribution. These initiatives will increase our sales and profitability maximizing a long term value of our business. The U.S. economic outlook remains solid with job and wage growth sustaining customer confidence and supporting continued economic expansion.","More first time homebuyers are entering the market and housing starts are up despite lot and labor shortages. Harbors LIRA Index is forecasting home remodeling growth above historic averages over the next 12 months. The architectural billing index shows commercial and institutional trends staying positive. In Europe the economic forecast is sustained and study growth across the entire region. The Russian economy expanded for the second consecutive quarter reinforcing an optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year.","I\u2019ll now turn over the call to Chris, for his review of the segments.","William Christopher Wellborn","Thank you, Jeff. During the quarter sales in our global ceramic segment increased 9% as reported and on a constant days and currency basis with adjusted operating income rising to a $163 million, 16% increase. We completed two European ceramic acquisitions that increased our segment sales by 6% during the period.","Our legacy business improved from the prior quarter but was limited in North America by capacity constraints in red body ceramic and in Europe by the temporary plant shutdown to upgrade our technical lines. In Europe, half of our new technical equipment has begun production and is operating at expected levels, and we are importing product to satisfy U.S. demand until our Mexican expansion becomes operational later this year.","Our U.S. ceramic business improved during the quarter even with capacity limitations in our lower end products which have now been resolved. New home construction continues to outperform the commercial and residential remodeling channels and we made further inroads with regional, national builders because of our advantages and style, performance and service.","We are introducing higher value products from our new Tennessee plant including longer, more realistic with visuals, surface texture and registration with our designs and proprietary slip resistance surfaces. We have added service centers and are growing our sales with unique merchandise in promotions to optimize each channel. We are adding sales personnel and distribution points to increase our countertop business and are introducing new porcelain slabs that we will manufacture in Europe. The market for countertops made of quartz is about 1.2 billion and growing more than 10% a year.","To greater increase our participation in quartz countertops we are constructing a new plan in Tenseness that will be operational by the end of 2018. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a talc line in Texas that will ensure our material supply and enhance our competitive position. Even with our capacity constraints our sales in Mexico outpaced the strong local market. Our sell in market expansion will start up later this year where leaving our capacity shortfall and allowing us to expand our distribution in the U.S., Mexico and South America.","Our European ceramic business grew substantially as a result of our new acquisitions and new products we have introduced. Presently, we are introducing creative new designs and finishes in our mid price products and tailoring our collections to satisfy the taste of regional markets. We are expanding our focus on architects and designers to increase our participation in the commercial and new constructions channels. We are finalizing new products for new porcelain slab lines with manufactures countertops and wall tiles.","The shutdown to upgrade our technical ceramic plant impacted our sales in the last period however our service will be fully remediated later this quarter. Our Eastern European business has rebounded from the severe winter and we are introducing larger sizes and Italian design to that market. The integration of our Italian acquisition is progressing as planned and we are improving their predictability and broadening their offering. In Poland we are enhancing the cost structure of our acquisition and restarting existing equipment. We are providing technical expertise to enhance their product offering and improve their efficiencies and will be installing additional capacity next year. We believe there will be further opportunities to consolidate the European ceramic market and expand our market share.","Our Russian ceramic business is significantly outperforming the market with sales and margins improving as a result of our unique design, strong brand and robust distribution.","During the period the ruble strengthened against the dollar with the economy expanding the last two quarters. We are increasing our capacity in Russia to support future ceramic growth. During the quarter, the flooring North America segment sales grew 6% as reported with adjusted operating income raising to a 140 million an increase of 12%. For the period our hard surface sales outpaced carpet and residential sales were stronger than commercial. We have implemented price increases and improved our product mix which have together have offset material and other inflation. We are executing productivity initiatives across our operations resulting in improved efficiencies and yields.","Our premium residential carpet collections are growing faster than the market due to increasing consumer preference for the superior softness and performance of our exclusive smart strain franchise. We have begun shipping smart strain self reserve, the fourth generation of our proprietary fiber with an even greater level of softness. Retail commitments are increasing for our luxury care stand brand as we enhance its style and design.","Sales of our ultra-soft and standard continuum polyester collections are growing across all price levels of the market and we have expanded our continuum capacity in the prior, in the period to meet increased demand. For the quarter our rug business improved on the strength of our sophisticated new airline collection and the success of our growing outdoor rug programs. The expansion of our carpet cushion operations is running as planned and improving our sales and distribution.","During the period we completed the purchase of nylon polymerization plant which we are enhancing to improve our competitive position. Our main street commercial sales expanded faster than our specified channels with carpet tile continuing to gain share. During the period our sales in the hospitality, senior living and retail sectors surpassed the institutional and corporate categories. Our new broadloom and carpet tile introductions received awards from the architects and design community at three premier commercial expos.","Our LVT and laminate sales outpaced our other hard surfaces with our distribution expanding as a result of our leading design and performance attributes. Our LVT operations are improving and construction is progressing on our new rigid LVT line which will start up by the end of this year. Our solid tech rigid LVT has quickly gained traction in the market and we are expanding sales in the commercial and builder channels.","In addition to carpet our hard surface collections were honored by the design community at the leading commercial expos. Our proprietary water resistant laminate with enhanced visuals is growing as an alternative to wood. And we are increasing our capacity later this year to support additional growth.","For the quarter, sales in our flooring rest of world segment were up 2% as reported and 8.5% on a constant days in local basis. The segment was impacted by lower patent revenue and increasing material cost and currency changes which are recovering with price increases.","We anticipate that the majority of the increases will be fully implemented by the fourth quarter allowing us to recover our higher cost. Our LVT sales are growing significantly, although we are reaching the limits of our present capacity. Our new LVT production line in Belgium will introduce both rigid and flexible products and should startup in the fourth quarter.","Our sheet vinyl production has recovered and is now operating normally at full capacity. We are introducing new residential and commercial products to improve our mix and maximize their results. In Russia, we are finalizing a purchase of a building of ceramic facilities to house our new sheet vinyl manufacturing operation.","In Europe, our premium laminate collections grew substantially and we have begun the installation of a new laminate press line to further expand our business and improve our product mix with value added introductions. Our Russian laminate sales are also constrained by our local manufacturing which we are expanding mid-2018 to increase sales in that market.","We are raising laminate prices in most markets to cover higher raw material cost in currency changes. We are enhancing our wood business with higher value products and more efficient processes. Our installation business has been significantly impacted by raw material shortages which have reduced our sales and dramatically increased our cost.","Raw material availability is presently improving and we are significantly increasing our installation prices to align with the inflation. Our roof panel sales have step changed as the improving European economy drives higher consumer confidence in a more robust housing market.","Raw material increases have impacted our roof panel margins and we are implementing price increases to offset. We are seeing increased demand for our wood panels and we have changed our production schedules to minimize the shutdown days during the traditional summer holidays.","We are raising wood panel prices to offset a higher cost and improving efficiencies with new investments and processes. Construction of our new carpet top plan is underway and we can limit it operations in the fourth quarter. We are recruiting experience sales and operations professionals to introduce our innovative carpet tile solutions featuring fashionable designs, easy installation and superior performance.","I'll now turn over the call to Frank Boykin to review our financial performance for the period.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Chris. Our net sales of $2,453,000,000 were an all-time new record growing 6% as reported and 8% using constant days and foreign exchange. Our acquisitions added 2% to the sales growth rate for this quarter. Our gross margin as reported was 31.8% excluding charges the margin was 32.7%.","Gross profit was $802 million dollars excluding charges and was favorably impacted by productivity of $38 million, price mix of $39 million and volume of $31 million offsetting $58 million of interest inflation.","SG&A is reported was 17.3% of net sales or 17.1% excluding charges which improved 20 basis points over last year as we leverage higher sales and continued our focus on cost control. And usual charges were $25 million during the quarter and primarily related to plant consolidation in the Flooring North American segment and acquisition related charges in our Global Ceramic segment.","Operating margin excluding charges was 15.5% and improved slightly over last year. Operating income excluding charges of $381 million was positively affected by $44 million of productivity, $38 million of price mix and $13 million of volume offsetting $58 million of input cost inflation.","Other income loss was a lot of $4 million and primarily was due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacting our results. Our income tax rate for the quarter was 24.5% that compares to 26.3% last year. Our tax rate this quarter was favorably impacted by tax planning strategies related to our European ceramic acquisitions and partially offset by less favorable Italian statutory rates. ","We expect the rate to be 28% to 28.5% in the third quarter and then for the full year to be in the range of 26% to 27%. Our earnings per share excluding charges was $3.72 representing an increase of 7%.","Moving to the segments. In the Global Ceramic segment, sales has reported were $903 million in increase of 9% or a 3% increase on a constant FX and days basis for the legacy business. We had growth in all regions with Russia turning into strongest performance for the quarter.","Operating margin excluding charges was 18.1%, which is at a 110 basis points over last year. Primary factors for this increase were productivity of $19 million and volume of $14 million, with a $11 million of interest cost. Our Flooring North American segment has sales of a $1,040,000,000 and grew 6% both as reported and on a constant basis with a very strong growth in laminate and LVT.","Operating margin excluding charges was 13.4% that was up 60 basis points over last year. The improvement was supported by $20 million of price mix and $12 million of productivity, partially offset by $22 million of inflation. In the Flooring rest of world segment, sales has reported were $510 million a 2% increase or 8.5% on a constant basis.","Our LVT and laminate sales both had strong growth in the quarter. Operating margin excluding charges was 17.3% and was impacted by lower patent revenues. We had favorable price mix of $14 million plus $13 million of productivity offset by $23 million of input cost inflation.","In the corporate and elimination segment, we had an operating loss of $10 million and we are expecting the operating loss to range between $35 million and $40 million for the full year.","Jumping to the balance sheet. Our receivables were a $1,640,000,000 with day sales outstanding up to 55 days compared to 54 last year; this was due to changing mix in our customers in the quarter. Our inventories were a $1,866,000,000 with the inventory days at 109 days for the year.","In increase from a 105 last year due to raw material inflation and more sourced product needed to support our LVT, ceramic, and countertop businesses. Our fixed assets for the quarter ended at $3,892,000,000 with capital expenditures in the quarter of $224 million in depreciation and amortization of a $110 million.","We're currently estimating our full year CapEx to be in excess of $850 million with depreciation and amortization of almost $460 million. Our long term debt ended at $2.9 million with our leverage at 1.6 times debt to EBITDA.","And with that, I will turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Mohawk's operating performance in the third quarter should continue to significantly improve most sales and income strengthening further even with higher material inflation and changes in patterns. We're implementing price increases across most product categories and regions to cover material and currency changes in the third quarter.","We will begin optimizing the acquisitions we completed in the second quarter by improving their strategies and enhancing their profitability. Taking all this into account, our adjusted EPS guidance for the third quarter is $3.70 to $3.79. To enhance our long term performance, we are investing a record level this year to expand our product offering and capacities, improve our efficiency and extend our geographical reach.","In the fourth quarter, we will incur higher startup cost as our production expansions ramp up and we elevate our marketing activities to increase our sales. The expansion of our LVT, ceramic, laminate sheet vinyl and countertop capacity will increase our future growth in profitability, strengthening our position as the leader in flooring.","We will now be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","Yes, good court. Congratulations on all the progress. I guess, the whole notion of raw material inflation is something that's coming up a lot through the various earnings calls this quarter. You are clearly responding with the number of pricing initiatives.","Is there any way you can talk about what percentage of your business, what percentage of your revenue streams would be subject to price increases?","Frank Boykin","We don\u2019t really look at it on a global basis adding Mohawk together. So, I don\u2019t have a real simple answer. Most of the product categories are being impacted by product, by raw material increases and most of them were pushing price increases through in United States as well as most of the rest of the world.","David MacGregor","And is there one segment that would be more prevalent than the others in terms of the intensity of the pricing initiatives?","Frank Boykin","I'm not sure the -- anything that's got to do with oil based things, wood based things, the acid base things that go into vinyl, almost all the product categories are going up. That I mean, it's crossed every I will guess ceramic would have less pressure because it doesn't have those things in it.","David MacGregor","Right, okay. And this is my --.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I would just add on the positive side that we're putting in price increases across the board in all of the segments to offset this inflation.","David MacGregor","Right, it's good to see. As my follow-up question, I guess you talked about adding $1.4 billion of sales capacity, what percentage of that $1.4 billion of capacity comes on in the second half of '17?","Frank Boykin","I don\u2019t have that in front of me. There are a lot of pieces that are coming online at different points in time. There is different parts that have already been implemented. There is some that are just finishing. There are parts that will come on in the fourth quarter, more of them and several of them will come on till further into 2018.","David MacGregor","Right. Is there historically a typical relationship between startup cost and percentage of revenue capacity?","Frank Boykin","No. Each one, different. It depends on if you're putting it in the existing plan if you're starting a new plant somewhere else, if you're going into new product category, a new geography and you have to build up the sales and marketing to pieces. So, the pay up on where it is some start up row that quickly and have the sales to support. And others, they are newer technologies that take, it could take a year more to get optimized.","And the same thing with the sale. You go into new geographies, the customers are waiting there for you to fill it up on day one.","David MacGregor","Got it. Thanks, very much.","Frank Boykin","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Samuel Eisner from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Samuel Eisner","Yes. Good morning, everyone. To just on organic growth, there does seem to be an inaudible step up in the pace for organic growth over the last four quarters your last 12 months. So, curious if you can talk a bit about your expectations for organic growth going forward.","I think you guys have commented in the first quarter that you expect 5.5% for this year. But do you think that we've reached a kind of inflection point in the pace organic growth for the organization and then also if you can talk about the 0.70 number.","Frank Boykin","We're optimistic about our business this year and we still expect the historical sales growth at 5.5%, historical business is to grow about 5.5% this year. Without acquisitions, which means the full period will be stronger. We think the results in the second half will be greater even absorbing the higher startup cost, the inflation, as well as the reduced IP.","And again, we're investing a record levels to drive these and a large part of the benefits and all these things won't show up until '18 and these and beyond because the capacities coming on, the cost will be at the front end and you'll get the benefits in the end of '18 and in future years, a lot of it.","Samuel Eisner","That's helpful. And then talking about productivity, I think to the first half of the year, you guys are around $80 million, $85 million run rate on that, which's certainly be higher than the 140 that you guys did last year. And then I also think on the first quarter, Frank you commented the third quarter would be higher than in the first quarter as well.","So, just curious how we should think about the progression of productivity and is it a very strong asset for you guys?","Frank Boykin","Yes, Sam. The productivity, we continue to believe that that will be higher this year than it was last year. I would say it's a little bit hard to judge exactly which quarter it is because we've got so many projects that are going on. Some are good, some in that better than we thought, some in that worse we thought, so it's going to be hard to say if third quarter or fourth quarter are going to be higher. But I would say we are still looking at a higher number for productivity this year.","Samuel Eisner","Got it and maybe just lastly going back to the questions from the prior person just in terms of price cost on the quarterly basis or annual basis do you think that you will be price cost positive in the back half of the year given the price increases that you put out across the globe?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think it will be the fourth quarter before we get most of them implemented so there should be implemented now and should be coming on this quarter most of them will be placed by the fourth quarter.","Samuel Eisner","Got it and appreciate that. I will hop back in queue. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Bob Wetenhall","Hi, good morning and another fantastic quarter and encouraging outlook. I was hoping that Chris is here and he is a Dal-Tale maybe he could give us download where you are in terms of adding capacity on the ceramic side it seems like you are importing product from Europe to satisfy U.S. demand, Tenseness is online and it has something going on in Mexico. Where are we in terms of meeting your needs?","William Christopher Wellborn","Yes so, we are adding capacity in all of our segments. We are adding in North America, we are adding in Mexico we are adding capacity in Italy. We are adding capacity in Russia. And in North America as well and most of that capacity is going to come on towards the back end of this year and throughout next year.","Bob Wetenhall","Got it. And maybe Jeff you could talk about LVT plant openings both in Europe and North America and while we have Frank maybe you can just touch on your expectations for maybe some of the plants start-up cost both on the LVT and ceramic side when that's going to start to show in the P&L and if that flows into 18? Thanks and good luck.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you. LVT continues to grow significantly. Our estimate is that LVT in the United States is little about 20% this year with that we have our plant we put up is still improving its productivity and increasing its production capacity. In the United States the plant will come up the end of the year at the end of the fourth quarter and start producing for next year and Europe all our lines are running at capacity we are doing things to increase those. The plant in Europe will actually start up probably a month or two earlier than the one in the U.S. they both have capabilities to make all the products flexible and rigid in the marketplace and combine across the world we will have over a billion dollar worth of LVT capacity when it's through.","William Christopher Wellborn","And I will just address the start-up question Bob. The fourth quarter of this year as well as future quarters into next year will have higher startup cost and what we have seen in the preceding couple of quarters. We are increasing capacity as Jeff has mentioned earlier by $1.4 billion and we are expecting about $45 million of start-up this year and then again as I mentioned we will see LVT start-up as we move into next year we are expanding almost all categories with our largest investments in ceramic and LVT to increase growth and profitability.","Bob Wetenhall","Frank, just to be a little tactical on this given the timing of some of the openings that Jeff and Chris were talking about would you say that $45 million of start-up cost is back in _ in 4Q?","Frank Boykin","Yes I am saying most of the start-up are much of the startup cost is just going to be in the fourth quarter.","Bob Wetenhall","And will we see some in the first half of the 18 as well?","Frank Boykin","Absolutely, you see an elevated start-up cost number as we move into next year for the first half at least for the first half.","Bob Wetenhall","Got it. Good luck with the growth gentlemen. Great quarter.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. You had talked about the loss of the patent revenue starting during the second quarter can you give us any kind of idea what that was like in the quarter and is there been any change in your view what patent revenue is going to look like over the next 18 months or so?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes. The pattern revenue, the operating income coming from it actually dropped about $11 million in the second quarter. And going forward we expect the IP could be a little higher than the $35 million operating income that we gave you before as the FX has improved a little bit we think there is some potential for life and this is on an ongoing basis.","Keith Hughes","So the $35 million was the run rate once the IP falls off on a yearly basis you are saying that could be higher. Is that am I understanding that right?","Jeff Lorberbaum","That was the prior number that we have given everyone and we think there is some opportunities to improve it.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Second question you had in the ceramic decision you had two acquisitions I believe one was in Poland. Where was the other one?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Within Italy. Italy and then we bought a small mine in the United States.","Keith Hughes","Okay. And the one in Italy can you give us any kind of indication what it specializes in and the reason for the purchase?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Sure. The one in Italy is right across from our existing [indiscernible] business which gives us a good opportunity for synergies. They tend to be in the mid to higher end price category I think it will be excellent acquisition for us.","Keith Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse, your line is open.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good morning. Your foreign North America margins have really improved nicely as we have moved through this year as we think about the back half and maybe some of these price increases continuing to come through can you give us some sense of how you are thinking about the progression there over the next few quarters and then maybe looking into 2018?","Jeff Lorberbaum","So, the first we have is the whole raw material cost increases that are flowing through. They won't be fully covered till sometime in the third quarter and the second quarter we cover some of those for the mix improving as we go through. I think that we think what happen to similar improvement over the year in the business in the margins as we go through as we have been having in order to hit the increased margins and sales that we are having everything has to improve to offset the IP the declining and have the increases we are in and if you guys look at the total and take the IP out the basic businesses are increasing much more.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Thank you. And then just following up you have mentioned sort of your portion to the countertop market you mentioned the construction of new course plant in Tennessee that's going to come up next year. It's certainly in area that's growing a lot but it has also seen a lot of competition coming in can you talk to generally how you think about positioning yourself in that market and maybe sort of where you want to play in terms of price points or product offerings within that?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It\u2019s different to some of the others we have been building a countertop business for ten years and we have been putting in warehouses and distribution points selling all different types in United States and we continue to expand those businesses. The total countertop business we believe around the $5 billion industry in United States and the quartz part of it makes up about 25% of the business and there we are going to move into both manufacturing quartz and manufacturing porcelain countertops which are small part of the United States business today. Italy is about 5 years ahead and starting to grow there and so we are going to put a plant in Europe to start manufacturing those and bring those in. now we think it offers another opportunities to grow our business with the products that we have knowledge with.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baugh from Stifel. Your line is open.","John Baugh","Thank you. Good morning and congrats again. My questions are little bit different but I am wondering if you could somehow quantify what you think all of your revenues that are not flooring i.e., countertops, walls, roofing installation and what the growth rate of that business is relative to your flooring business?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It\u2019s still relatively small to the total. There is spread in all the different divisions or different pieces and normally we don't look at them that way so I don't have an easy way to pull them together for you.","John Baugh","Any sense if they are growing too fast or slow than flooring overall Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum ","Yes, some more some less. As you would expect. There are all in different parts of the pieces like the roofing business is growing faster now but it's been depressed to prior three or four years so we are getting back some of the pieces in Europe. The European academy is better so the board business over there has improved lately and we have invested things to consolidate difference. Remember about a year or two ago we bought an acquisition over there we put them together close plants so those are improving. So the European academy all the pieces are suffering for a while. They are all bouncing back a little bit now which is a good thing. So I am still relatively small part of the total.","John Baugh","And any color on what you have got traction over the padding carpet the product you introduced earlier this year?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The carpet pad we have I think about five or six plants in the United States. We built a new plant and to satisfy the needs in the Southwestern part of the country. The plant is up and running well at this point. And we are increasing our revenues.","John Baugh","I was asking about I think you call the Aero or the combo product where you already have the packing installed to the carpet.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Got you. That's a really brand new product. And we have just installed equipment and make it on our large basis the products are just hitting the marketplace but we are going slow, we are not mass pushing it out at this point. We are putting it in a limited group of customers so find out how to train them and teach them, how to sell it and make sure that we are ready to expand it much more dramatically so it's a really unique product and you have to start building it overtime.","John Baugh","Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan, your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning everyone. And Chris it's good to hear your voice. First question you mentioned of the quartz plant that you\u2019re bringing up I guess from what I understand be ready for production in the back half of 18. I just wanted to your thoughts around the entry into this kind of emerging market. Obviously you already do lot of porcelain and other I guess primarily the porcelain that you are already doing, countertops with but what are your plans for this market and what type of capacity will the plant ultimately give you let\u2019s say in 19?\\","Jeff Lorberbaum","So the quartz industry and has been growing significantly we think it's going to continue growing. It's about 25% of the U.S. marketplace we are selling products already in it and we are growing our sales in it today. We think it offers an opportunity, we think it's going to keep growing. There are multiple people in it and doing different pieces but we think that we can bring with the distribution we already have and with our knowledge of product and design we think it will bring some new things to the marketplace and be prepared to compete against anybody. The new plant will have a capacity of approximately a 100-125 million with the first line that's going in it and we can expand it as needed going forward.","William Christopher Wellborn","Yes I will just echo what Jeff said in terms of distribution we have been in this category a long time with stone, quartz that we got a good foundation to start with.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just on secondly on LVT the 20% growth that you mentioned for 2017 I assume it\u2019s in the U.S. is that for Mohawk company specific or the industry and if it's the industry it kind of sounds like a little bit of an acceleration but in either case I was kind of curious where that \u2013 what materials primarily it's cannibalizing from I assume from different parts of the laminate term, but where is the give on that or the cannibalization occurring?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The number we gave you is our guess what the LVT business is growing in the United States as an industry. There are different pieces of it growing at different rates and I forgot the last part of your question.","Michael Rehaut","Just canalization Jeff, I assume it's primarily laminate but are there other product line let's say that your \u2013 to the extent that laminate is giving the share up how is that affecting your own laminate business in the U.S. as well?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It's growing so rapidly and so much it's affecting every other product categories. So if the growth rate of the industry is I\u2019ll make my guess, 3.5% to 4% it's taking a large portion of the 3.5% to 4% and slowing down almost everything else somewhat.","Michael Rehaut","And does that impact your decision making around maybe even shutting down some of the capacity and some of the other products areas?","Jeff Lorberbaum","No. the other one are still growing they are just growing slower by maybe 1% to 2%.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Wojs from Baird, your line is open.","Timothy Wojs","Hey guys. Good morning. I guess just maybe back on the countertops piece is how do you guys think about the Greenfield opportunities within countertops versus maybe something on the M&A side and then maybe more broadly how do you feel about the pipeline within the M&A more broadly?","Jeff Lorberbaum","So on the Greenfield we were putting up a plant in U.S. for quartz and a plant in Europe for porcelain so we think that's an opportunity. On the other side we are always open to acquisitions and if the right opportunity came about we would be interested and looking at different pieces. On the overall acquisition piece we continue to look at acquisition, there is opportunities out there but as always we are selective to make sure that we are going to optimize our long term returns for shareholders and do what we want to do.","Timothy Wojs","Okay and then Frank on the production capacity that was taken off line in Europe for the production upgrades. Is there \u2013 can you give us a sense of what that might have kicked in out of the quarter and kind of what the expectation for that to come back online in the second half would be?","Frank Boykin","It just slowed down we built the inventories up to try to offset it back in the fall of last year we made the best guesses we could as you would suspect you aren\u2019t perfect so it limited some of our sales there. The plant has we actually shut down the entire plant to replace all of the equipment in it. We have half the plant is running today another 25% coming up as we speak and the rest of it will be operating by the sometime this quarter. So I mean all things are going forward it just shut it down temporarily. ","Timothy Wojs","Okay, great. Good luck on the second half.","Frank Boykin","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Rednor from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Scott Rednor","Good morning. Just on that topic on the U.S. in the ceramic piece can you just explain what exactly slowed the growth this quarter and recognizing there is some puts and takes in the capacity side are you guys turning away customers or is it something that's you guys can correct in the next quarter or so?","Jeff Lorberbaum","In the U.S. we were constrained by capacity and some of the categories we have begun importing product temporarily which is here now and we are building a plant in we are doubling the size of our plant in Mexico which will come up in this fall to take care of our capacity constraints. On the other hand the ceramic industry we believe is growing slightly slower rate than it did last year because of LVT taking part of it which is well positioned in as well as the economic growth of the country isn't as high as we all had hoped it would be.","Scott Rednor","Okay. Jeff is there any issue that you are losing some sales there that you can correct or do you think the import model is picking all that up?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think that the ceramic business in general is growing at a slower rate and we compete against imports all the time. The imports make up probably almost 40% of the total industry in the United States which we are part of because we import our stuff from Mexico is considered import also as that so we participate in it. We are well positioned.","Scott Rednor","And then just interested in rest of the world I mean the high single-digit organic growth there. Can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more clearly LVT is helping you there but from outside perspective in that's a much longer growth rate than we see now that business in some time. So I just wanted to get some more color from you Jeff beyond LVT and is there anything there that's not sustainable or is there certain pieces of that business that have now turned the corner if you will?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We have seen a setup in the European market and everything. It's improving. Our sales are 8% on a constant basis and these are local basis there. We are investing in everything over there to expand our LVT business, our laminate business. We are introducing carpet tile. We are going into Russia with new capacity and laminate. We are expanding our \u2013 we are going in the sheet line of business over there. We are expanding our ceramic business in Russia. Our European businesses have more capacity in the ceramic and the southern end of the piece. Just feels better and we are going to keep this right up that's a different question.","Scott Rednor","Fair enough. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Nomura Instinet, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is Mason on for Mike. So your main three segments is growing faster in the specified market and carpet tile. How much of your carpet tile business is mainstream specified and why noticeable difference between two?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think the point was not just carpet tile, at least in this quarter business changes from quarter. In this quarter our mainstream business grew faster than our commercial business overall and then our carpet tile business is also growing faster than our total commercial carpet which includes Broadalbin carpet. I am not sure if that was the answer to the question or not there.","Unidentified Analyst","No. it's helpful. Thank you. And then the new carpet tile plant in Europe that will start in 4Q, what countries are reserved and is this your first carpet tile exposure to give up?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It's our first carpet business outside the United States is that the gentleman who runs our final business in Europe also came out of Balata and he ran a carpet business in Europe and has good knowledge about it which is why we decided to go into Europe because of the talent he brings to it as well as we understand how to make it so we are building a sales forces as we speak to start selling it or not sell that but also sell our final products, our laminate products, our other products that we are making to build a commercial business which is a fairly small part of our total business in Europe. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research. Your line is open.","Laura Champine","Good morning. Your inventory growth in the quarter was pretty significant. Is that just chasing demand or what is or is it the difference in raw materials cost or what's driving that?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It's really made up of few pieces. First is right as the material cost go up all of that flows into the inventory immediately as the prices go up. The second is that we are building our businesses in different places. We are importing products for LVT, ceramic and countertops so those inventories are going up. And then finally, the Europe economy was not quite as robust as we were expecting.","Laura Champine","Got it. And then, on the increase in the CapEx budget for this year. Is there any way to put that in buckets whether its buyer specific plan investment or maintenance versus new capacity versus productivity and so forth?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think it's sort of a luck, its big categories. One is the acquisition we bought we put in money into expand or improve those to get the profits up for one or the sales up. We pull some of the these projects that we are talking about I mean these are all huge investment in different pieces and we pull some of those back into earlier so some of the expenses will come into 18, 17 some of the expenses will come in here and a lot of this too there is a good chance at the end of the year some of the payments could come up month earlier or a month later in fall in one year or the other. Some of it's going into additional ideas about more product innovation which will put in new capital and to make those and then the quartz plant will pull some of the expenses in the year you may have seen something about it a plant or property we bought in Tennessee that payment was for the building that we are going to put the quartz plant in.","William Christopher Wellborn","And Laura I will just address your question about maintenance and productivity etc. I would just say that there is \u2013 the additional amount that we are putting in doesn't include any maintenance if that was part of your question. The maintenance we are working to drive it down and it could be $100 million or more as we go forward and then in the balance it's going to be split probably more of it will go into capacity maybe two thirds of it go into capacity and about one third of the balance go into productivity in round numbers.","Laura Champine","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","John Lovallo","Thanks guys. First question I guess Frank just kind of housekeeping on the tax rate the 28 to 285 in the third quarter is that a reasonable kind of rate going into 2018?","Frank Boykin","I don't think we are in a good position right now to talk about the 2018 rate. There is some movement going on around in some of the countries that we are in right now talking about reducing stress to our rates. We are going to need little bit of time to understand that and how it impacts us. So I need to wait and see how that all works out before I address next year's rate.","John Lovallo","Okay and then I guess moving on in our travels we have seen that your LVT product is being offered standard feature at least in one of the home builders entry level products. I am just curious is this kind of relationships if you have that would be several home builders and do you see that as kind of a driver of your growth?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The home building piece is one of the faster, is the fastest growing part of the U.S. business that's growing probably 8%-9% estimate you want to use it's a large part of our business. We sell all kinds of products through the channel to those home builders. We have relationships with the national home builders as well as the original home builders to specify our products into the marketplace that use wood, that use carpet, that use laminate, they use countertops. All the different categories that we make are sold to the channel and we get there through a lot of different ways.","John Lovallo","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Stephen East","Thank you and good morning guys. Jeff premium carpet so your soak reserve etc. growing faster than the industry. I guess we really heard that for quite some time so I am wondering is that how much would you attribute to that being a great product in pulling demand versus is the consumer finally are we done with this missed shift down and the consumer starting to move up in mix?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think that let me try to answer it two different ways. One is that softness is becoming more and more important part in premium carpet. The carpet that we make are softer than anybody else in the marketplace and then Louis think we are coming out or even softer than those were. Now while that's going on you still have polyester carpet growing in the marketplace and the polyester carpet is at lower price points and it tends to pull that on the average mix. So you have both things happening at the same time. And I think that we are doing better in the higher end of the market in general.","Stephen East","Perfect. All right. And then on the M&A, you did a couple of acquisitions that are vertical. Is that by happen stance that they both occurred or you are putting more focus on going vertical and if you are what type of \u2013 how has that helped your margin if you will?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We really haven't changed the strategy. We are quite comfortable back at integrating businesses and then improving our cost positions and it's really depended upon what comes available some of it we do green field and some of it we buy so it's not a change in strategy.","Stephen East","Okay I got you. And one last quick one. Just your raw material trends are they backing off or you still seeing inflating?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It seems like they have plateau but you never know. Most of our raw materials we buy on at market and they fluctuate up and down month to month and just as a comment a lot of the raw materials supply didn't put much investment in -- as the economy was down either the high cost stuff was taken out or no capacity was putting in so if you look at the supply chain of this whole thing there is a lot of pressure to increase it and as those capacities get tight our suppliers are trying to increase margins really unrelated to their cost structures which is atypical at this time of the cycle.","Stephen East","Yes. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Yes. Thanks very much. Strong quarter guys. I am Stephen Kim from Evercore if you are confused. I wanted to ask you about the startup cost. I know that you have talked a bit about it already but what's the start-up cost in 2Q and in the first part of this year and I am trying to understand whether or not the numbers that you gave or the 45 million for the year which was unchanged is that netted out of the productivity numbers, productivity numbers you are giving or is it a separate offset?","Jeff Lorberbaum","So first on your later part of the question start-up costs are not included in productivity there. And then if you look at how much we have incurred in the second quarter we have incurred about 6 million start-up cost and in the first quarter we incurred about $11 million start-up cost. And what was said at the total should be around 45 with more in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter.","Stephen Kim","Perfect. Yes that's very helpful and then Frank when you were going through all the puts and takes on the operating income did I hear you say the volume benefit for ceramic was 14 million and the total company was 13 million or did I hear that wrong?","Frank Boykin","Volume was 13 for the total company and yes ceramic was 14 correct.","Stephen Kim","So the difference there in \u2013 suggest there was no volume benefit in the other two categories or the other two segments just wondering if you could flash that out for us a little bit I mean with that because you had maybe some dysfunctionality somewhere can you just sort of talk a little bit about that?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think what is causing to look strange like that Steve is the high fee that we lost with the higher margin.","Stephen Kim","Yes I know that would definitely do it and just one last thing in your prepared remarks I think you said that sales should strengthen in 3Q just wanted to make sure that we are on the same page on what that comment was referring to I assume that you meant that your growth rate which was about 5.6% on an organic basis would be higher in the back half of the year. Is that what you meant or did you mean something else?","Jeff Lorberbaum","What we meant was that we gave earlier direction we thought that the legacy business will grow 5.5% and in the first half they grow less than that and then in the second half we expect to make up the difference in the pieces plus the addition of the acquisition we made.","Stephen Kim","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Appreciate it. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is open.","Eric Bosshard","Sure. On the target for legacy revenue growth Jeff that you just talked about why does the back half grow faster than the front half. What visibility do you have there in regards to either market trends or your market share?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Some of the new capacities businesses and products for moving in and we expect to get some advantages from those as we go through. And we expect to improve some of our businesses all different.","Eric Bosshard","From an underlying demand standpoint what you observe in second quarter what are you observing with your customers, is that notably different in the second half across the business at any point?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I am not sure the general but the general business is better across the pieces we have new product launches and we are going into new product categories and we are doing things to expand our business in different places.","Eric Bosshard","And then lastly in terms of pricing in the carpet business you picking some steps of how has that gone and a little bit more clarity on the flow through of that relative to catching up to the input cost or digging you out of the input cost hold that you had been in and what does that look like?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We have implemented two price increases the first was implemented. The second one is going in. some of it will be coming into the third quarter as we speak and the second quarter we offset all the cost increases but it was using some of the mix improvement that we\u2019ve done to get it and so the industry is pushing through the price increases we need to cover the cost.","Eric Bosshard","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Michael Dahl from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Michael Dahl","Thanks for fitting me in. couple of follow-ups here. A lot of comments or questions around the startup cost and some of the productivity I guess just thinking about heading into next year Frank you have noted that start-up cost are going to remain elevated but if I think about the productivity side and how it should be tied to basically your CapEx budget for that given the higher CapEx budget are we directionally is it fair to assume that productivity improvement should accelerate next year as well?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We have not put together all the budgets for next year and the pieces so I can't give you a rational answer on the question we are still focused on this year which roll in that half way through. All of the businesses are coming up with new ideas to increase the productivity and to bring new products to market and then we are trying to release any constrains on a business to all the assets. And we think those things are going to have long term positive profitability in our sales growth with all those things when you put it all this new equipment you have the lag time to optimizing the sales and optimizing this equipment so that's going to all be happening over the next 12 months as we try to bring all these things up and therefore from quarter to quarter I can't give you an exact piece but I can tell you a year from now will be much better shape.","Michael Dahl","Got it. And then going back to the some of the vertical integration, I appreciate that's always been a part of your business. Maybe if you could help us help refresh where are some areas if there are any large areas outstanding that you are not currently backwards integrated that if the right opportunity arises you would be interested in going that direction.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think the biggest opportunities would be in our ceramic business and owning mines to support the raw materials in some places we have them and other places we don't and some cases that make sense and other doesn't. I guess most of the other businesses the board businesses which support laminate we buy raw materials from them when Europe was buying a lot more waste products to put in we are looking for ways of utilizing waste product surround like we do and polyester bonds in different places. So we are fairly well integrated but there is some places where we have old, and as they become available we might make changes like we did in the carpet business with nylon as it we were doing just final without it but there was an opportunity and we took advantage of. ","Michael Dahl","Okay. Great. Thank you. ","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over to Mr. Lorberbaum.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you for joining us. The company is in a very strong position and the organization is generating a lot of ideas to grow both internally and externally, introduce the products and expand in our geographies. We think all of these things will help our business long term and we are putting in place to optimize the return to our shareholders.

Improvements in the U.S. market, product mix, productivity improvements, lower amortization and the Pergo acquisition all contributed to our results, offset by the negative impact of a slower European economy and one less day in the period compared to last year.","For the quarter, our sales increased 5.5% as reported or 5.4% on a constant exchange rates.","During the quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $151 million and reduced SG&A by 90 basis points relative to sales across the enterprise even as we increased investment in growth areas of the business.","In the U.S., economic indicators show that commercial building and remodeling continue to recover with the Architectural Billing Index and commercial lending market forecast predicting sustained growth. The National Association of Homebuilders projects 975,000 home starts this year, representing a 25% increase over 2012. Harvard's April LIRA Index projects gains in residential remodeling through 2013.","The Russian economy is expected to continue expanding, and the European Union countries are anticipated to continue facing headwinds.","In January, we completed the acquisition of Pergo and are well along with execution of our integration strategy. We are closing both of Pergo's manufacturing plants in Sweden, which have antiquated high-cost assets. The production will be moved to our modern manufacturing plant in Belgium, which will also be utilized as a distribution center for Pergo products, along with their distribution center in Sweden, to guarantee excellent service levels outside Skandia.","This fall, we will update Pergo's European product line with state-of-the-art technology and improve their click installation system while maintaining their best-selling products and unique performance features. This should add significant value to the product offering and increase the enthusiasm for Pergo products in Europe.","In the U.S., we're enhancing the manufacturing assets and processes to reduce cost and improve quality. In both the U.S. and Europe, our cost will improve as we manufacture much of the board requirements, limit manufacturing and impregnation requirements that Pergo is presently purchasing.","We've unified the organization by combining senior management teams, sales organizations, logistics systems and administrative functions. The manufacturing consolidation and administrative restructuring will eliminate about 140 positions across the business and will take up to a year to complete at an estimated cost of $35 million, less real estate sales of $10 million to $15 million in the future.","We anticipate all of our integration restructuring activities will enhance Pergo's opening margins to a level similar to Unilin's over the next several years.","After the first quarter closed, we completed the acquisition of the Marazzi Group. This transaction is transformational for our ceramic tile business and makes Mohawk the global leader in ceramic tile. The combination will provide many opportunities to improve our performance by leveraging best practices, operational expertise, product innovation and manufacturing assets across the enterprise.","In the U.S., the Dal-Tile and Marazzi management teams are working closely together to realize synergies in operations and administration. We're preparing to test selling Marazzi and American all-in together to offer our customers a wider range of ceramic options. We will improve service and efficiency, utilizing the Mohawk distribution system, and Dal-Tile will source products for Marazzi's European plants.","In Europe, we've pointed a new President of Marazzi, who has in-depth understanding of manufacturing and marketing, with over 30 years of European ceramic experience. We have also appointed the Marazzi U.S. business president, who has extensive experience in both the U.S. and European markets, to lead the European sales function and refine our present marketing strategies to maximize our position.","We've identified opportunities for expansion in higher-growth markets, such as Germany, Eastern Europe and North Africa. We are reviewing our manufacturing operations to upgrade technology, improve efficiencies and expand our product offering.","In the faster growing Russian market, we continue to expand our unique approach as a manufacturer, distributor and retailer, focused on mid-to-high end market. Presently, we have the #1 position in the fragmented Russian market, where we own and franchise retail stores. We have direct control of about 50% of our sales all the way to the end customer, which builds strong brand awareness with retail advertising at the store level and ensures the superior consumer experience through our knowledgeable retail staff.","We are reviewing options for expanding both our product and distribution channels, as well as exploring other regional market opportunities. In the future, we will expand our manufacturing capacity to support our expected growth in this key market.","While we're in the early processes of going through, we estimate Marazzi's restructuring costs of $15 million to $20 million, which will be offset by real estate sales estimated to be about $10 million in the future. Our goal with these actions and longer-term improvements in the European economy is to expand the Marazzi operational margins up to the low to mid-teen range over the next several years. Acquisition costs for the Marazzi transition -- transaction will total approximately $14 million, including advisories, service, legal, tax and accounting fees.","Earlier today, we announced the closing of the acquisition of Spano for $164 million. Spano is a chip and melamine board manufacturer, primarily in the Belgium market, with annual sales of approximately $230 million. The acquisition will generate significant synergies to bring greater value to our customers and broaden our product offering. The transaction creates many opportunities to optimize assets, raw material purchases and production efficiencies. We do not expect the acquisition to have a material impact on our 2013 second quarter results.","Frank, would you please give our financial report?","Frank H. Boykin","Sure. Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $1,487,000,000, increasing 5.5% over last year, driven by volume in Dal-Tile and Unilin and improving mix in the carpet business. Our gross margin was 25.4% as reported. The margin improved slightly, excluding nonrecurring items. We had better mix, higher productivity and increased volumes in the U.S. that offset the impact of a slower Europe.","SG&A dollars were $290 million, which was flat with last year, and 19.5% of net sales. And that compares to 20.4% of net sales last year. Better leverage with higher sales and amortization, which was lower by $10 million, positively impacted our SG&A.","Unilin amortization will be approximately $35 million lower in 2013 compared to last year.","Restructuring charges for the quarter were $10 million. This included $2 million in cost of goods and $5 million in SG&A for the Mohawk segment reduction in force, with the $3 million balance in Unilin SG&A related to the Pergo integration.","Full year restructuring is estimated at $35 million per Pergo integration cost and an additional $15 million to $20 million for Marazzi, $10 million of which was accrued in the first quarter by Marazzi. We expect to offset a portion of these costs with proceeds from future asset sales estimated at $20 million to $25 million.","Our operating income, excluding charges, was $97 million [ph] or a margin of 6.5%, which is up 140 basis points from last year.","Interest expense was $19 million compared to $22 million last year and was impacted favorably by lower rates this year. We are estimating interest in the future to be at $25 million per quarter.","Other expense was $6 million and compares to income of $1 million last year. This was primary impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange.","Our income tax rate was 18% compared to 20% last year. We are expecting the tax rate to be 20% for the full year this year, including the Marazzi, Pergo and Spano acquisition.","Earnings per share, excluding charges, were $0.87 per share. This is a 50% improvement over last year. Outstanding shares of stock for the first quarter were 69.9 million shares, and we're estimating outstanding shares for the full year to be at 72.4 million shares.","If we move to the segments, in the Mohawk segment, sales were $695 million, flat with last year. Carpet sales improved, offset by lower rug sales. Our carpet sales were positively impacted by specialty retail and commercial, with slower home center sales due to product transitions.","Operating income, excluding charges, was $31 million, with a margin of 4.5%. This is a 90-basis-point improvement over last year, with new super soft carpet products driving positive mix and with efficiency improvements also impacting our results.","In the Dal-Tile segment, sales were $412 million, up 5% from last year. The Dal-Tile sale service center and independent distributor channels grew, with the home centers lagging due to difficult comps from last year. The Mexican growth continued to be strong, with double-digit growth rates again this quarter in the local currency.","Operating income, excluding charges, was $30 million or 7.4%. This is up 80 basis points from last year with volume and productivity, as well as improving performance at our new Mexican plant, positively affecting profitability.","In the Unilin segment, sales were $404 million, up 20% over last year, with North America and Pergo offsetting our slower legacy European business. Pergo sales in the quarter were about $70 million.","Operating income, excluding charges, was $42 million with a margin of 10.4%, which represents an improvement of 240 basis points over last year due to lower amortization and increased volume in North America.","In the Corporate and Eliminations segment, our operating loss was $7 million. For the full year, we expect it to be around a $25 million loss.","We have now completed the Pergo, Marazzi and Spano acquisitions. We will own Pergo for 12 months in 2013. Last year, sales were $320 million and will be less this year due to discontinued low-end products, lower European demand and delayed product transitions in Europe. We anticipate operating margins of 7% to 8%.","Marazzi will be owned for 9 months this year. Sales last year were $1.16 billion, and we experienced a 4% to 5% growth rate in the first quarter of this year, which is anticipated to be maintained throughout the year. The operating margin for Marazzi are estimated to be 10% to 11%.","Spano will be owned for 8 months this year. Sales in 2012 were $230 million and are anticipated to be slightly down this year, given the slower European economy. The operating margins are estimated at 7% to 8% for Spano.","At this point, purchase accounting has not been finalized, and our estimates are subject to change. The timing, implementation and strategies of our integration are still being established and maybe revised. We are assimilating these businesses into our existing operations and will not have separate results to report for the acquisitions in the future.","And now we'll jump to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $1,120,000,000. This is up due to the cash that was raised to finance the Marazzi acquisition, which closed in early April.","Receivables were $826 million. Our DSOs at 47 days were flat to last year. Receivables increased approximately $28 million due to the Pergo acquisition.","Inventories were $1,230,000,000. Our inventory days improved to 107 days from 109 days last year. The inventory increased at the end of the quarter about $48 million due to the Pergo acquisition.","Fixed assets of $1,730,000,000 include capital expenditures of $63 million during the quarter and depreciation and amortization of $60 million. The full year capital expenditures is estimated at $380 million, including Pergo, Marazzi and Spano.","Depreciation and amortization is estimated at $310 million for the full year, including each of the 3 acquisitions. Our full year run rate for D&A is estimated at $335 million.","Our long-term debt was $2.3 billion at the end of the quarter and included $600 million 10-year 3.85% bonds and a drawdown of $130 million of the bank revolver, both used to finance Marazzi in our April acquisition. We are currently paying interest at 2% on the revolver. Net debt to EBITDA was 1.7x at quarter end and would have been approximately 2.8x on a pro forma basis if Marazzi and Spano had been included.","Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Mohawk sales were relatively flat during the first quarter with operating income rising 24%, excluding unusual charges. Carpet sales growth was partially offset by home center transitions that were completed in the first quarter and lower rug sales. Our SmartStrand and Wear-Dated soft carpets are growing and positively influencing our product mix and margins. Our sales in the specialty channel continue to show strength, and we expect improvement in the home center channel as sales of our new introductions gain traction in the second quarter.","We began implementing a 4% to 6% price increase during the period to offset our material cost changes. However, the timing of implementation will not cover an estimated $5 million to $10 million of those higher costs in the second quarter. We anticipate the price increases will align with our material costs in the third period. We implemented a freight increase for carpet to offset higher transportation cost.","Over the past several years, we simplified our business, improved our processes and implemented more automated systems, which allowed us to eliminate about 250 positions in management and administration at a cost of $6 million, which was expensed in the quarter.","During the period, we built upon the success of our revolutionarily SmartStrand Silk collection by adding 12 products that combined silk's unsurpassed softness with contemporary styling. Consumer response has been enthusiastic to our Wear-Dated Embrace luxurious softness and exceptional durability, easy care and attractive price point for premium product. We're further expanding the soft category by introducing Wear-Dated value products made with our recycled polyester with a compelling environmental proposition.","As the differentiated super soft products expand, we anticipate the category will represent a larger share of our carpet sales and further improve our product mix. We are increasing extrusion capacity throughout the year to satisfy the increased demand for these products.","Sales of hardwood and ceramic in our Mohawk segment improved with new introductions, such as our ArmorMax hardwood that offers unsurpassed wear and scratch resistance, and ceramic tile with the Reveal Imaging that replicates the rich look of wood and stone surfaces. During the period, we announced a third price increase of 10% on our hardwood products to offset rising lumber costs.","In the commercial category, our hospitality sales continued solid as we expanded our customer base and as hotels increased their renovation of their public spaces. Our exclusive Duracolor commercial broadloom and tile products expanded due to their exceptional styling, superior stain and soil resistance and improved value.","We introduced the new modular floating tile installation system and a new eco-comfort pad, which is made of 90% post-consumer recycled content that increases the life of our carpets.","We executed productivity increases across the business, resulting in material yield improvements, waste reduction, increased recycled content and improve efficiencies. Our new customer management tool has enhanced our sales productivity, identified new sales opportunities and improved our project management.","Dal-Tile sales increased 5% as new residential construction, commercial sales and our Mexican business continued to show strength. Our positive results for the quarter were supported by new product introductions, featuring both the rustic and polished surfaces, new larger sizes and unique Reveal Imaging designs.","Our margins were supported by higher volumes and improved labor productivity but were partially offset by rising energy costs. Last year, the initial inventory shipments of new products to home centers created a more difficult sales comparison than the first period of this year.","In the residential category, our Dal-Tile brand showed good growth from new Reveal imaging designs and a classic look of travertine and slate, mosaics made of glass and stone and larger format tiles from our Chinese JV.","In the home center channel, we added new sizes, updated our floor tile options and added fashionable mosaics to complement existing lines.","In our Dal-Tile brand, we added sales representatives to target new residential construction, expanding our regional builder business.","To grow our American Unilin brand, we've added representatives focused on commercial specifications in the multifamily segment.","Commercial sales grew in the restaurant, retail and hospitality channels, with large projects utilizing high-fashion design, contemporary sizes and sophisticated colors.","To provide appealing premium options to the design community, we introduced innovative collections that replicate limestone, a valued price porcelain with dual-layer construction and a commercial product that blends recycled porcelain and marble chips and earns lead points.","In Mexico, we continue to grow faster than the market by aggressively pursuing new construction projects, adding distributors, improving product mix and expanding our penetration of home centers. Our Salamanca facility volume efficiencies and yields continue to improve according to our plan. At our Monterrey facility, we added Reveal Imaging capability to both our wall and trim production.","To offset cost increases, we announced a price increase of about 3% for tile in Mexico that will be fully implemented in April.","During the period, Dal-Tile improved cost by reducing off-quality production and waste, increasing machine efficiency, achieving higher plant utilization rates and enhancing material formulations. We combined more of our regional warehousing with our carpet distribution to reduce our costs. All of Dal-Tile manufacturing facilities have now been certified by third parties for exceeding world-class safety standards.","Unilin sales grew by 20% or 19% at a constant exchange rates due primarily to the Pergo acquisition. The legacy Unilin business sales improved in all product categories in the U.S. and in insulation boards and wood flooring outside the U.S. This was partially offset by lower laminate, wood panel and roofing sales in Western Europe.","Margins improved from increased U.S. volume and lower amortization costs, offset by volume, lower mix and material inflation in Europe, excluding acquisitions.","We increased our laminate distribution to new markets, such as Ukraine, and initiated promotional actions within established European retailer channels. Our new laminate lines in Europe are being well accepted with collections that offer the look of natural wood in contemporary colors, as well as long-wide planks resembling custom wood floors.","Our engineered wood products with brush surfaces offer fashionable visuals at affordable price points.","Our Livyn luxury tile line collection is gaining traction across Western Europe, differentiated by our Quick-Step brand industry-leading realism and an advanced click installation system.","In North America, our laminate wood flooring sales increased across all channels. Laminate flooring sales were enhanced by introductions with realistic wood visuals and wide planks. Our wood floor products are growing with performance features, such as Scotchgard and ArmorMax protection that provide easy maintenance and industry-leading wear resistance, new products with scraped surfaces and fashionable distressed looks. To offset rising lumber costs, we announced another price increase of 10% for wood flooring that will be effective in late May.","Sales of our installation (sic) [insulation] boards continue to grow with an expanded product offering and increased geographical penetration in France and Germany. Construction of our new insulation board plant in France is ahead of schedule, with production anticipated to begin in the third quarter.","In the period, inclement weather conditions further hampered the difficult economic environment affecting Western European housing construction and reduced our roof panel sales. Earlier this year, we consolidated our roofing sales organization and we'll consolidate our 2 roofing plants in the second quarter while maintaining the ability to respond to a future rebound.","During the period, retailers at the industries largest U.S. trade show voted Mohawk brands as having the best new products in most flooring categories, including carpet, ceramic tile, laminate and area rugs.","Training magazine placed Mohawk 8th in their national ranking, and Mohawk was the only manufacturing company in the top 10 for the second consecutive year.","We delivered solid results this quarter through product innovation, productivity improvements, market expansion and strategic acquisitions. In all areas, we're driving cost and sales initiatives to enhance our results. We're implementing price increases as required though our carpet prices will lag our costs in the second quarter. We believe that both commercial and new housing growth will continue this year, and we're anticipating some improvement in the residential remodeling.","We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of our international business even while challenges persist in some regional economies. In each of these regions, we have leading market positions, highly recognized brands, outstanding distribution channels and efficient manufacturing that will benefit our results as those economies improve.","We anticipate each of our acquisitions contributing to our sales and earnings this year as we implement strategies to maximize their potential.","With these factors, our guidance for the second quarter earnings is $1.58 to $1.67 per share, excluding any restructuring or acquisition costs.","Our focus in 2013 remains on creating differentiated products with an appealing value proposition and successfully integrating our recent acquisitions. For 2 decades, we have created significant shareholder value, having a dual strategy of growing our established businesses while enhancing performance of acquired companies.","We have an experienced management team with the resources and talent to execute these strategies. Regardless of the pace in the recovery, we remain committed to driving innovation, operational excellence and geographic expansion to optimize our business.","Finally, in connection with our recent acquisitions, we are changing the names of our segments to refer to product categories rather than historical brands. Going forward, the Mohawk segment will be known as the Carpet segment, the Dal-Tile segment will be known as the Ceramic segment, the Unilin segment will be known as Laminate and Wood segment.","This will not change either the brand or sales strategies that we utilized today.","With that, we'll be glad to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Stephen Kim.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to talk to you about your current balance sheet and acquisitions in that context. It seems that you have a net EBITDA debt -- net debt to EBITDA below -- well below 2. It seems you have some room to either do buybacks or possibly additional acquisitions. I was just wondering how you see the balance between these 2 options given -- in particular, trying to understand, do you have the capacity right now operationally to absorb any additional acquisitions in the next 6 to 12 months.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Yes, I may not have been clear on that, Steve. The pro forma debt to EBITDA with Spano and Marazzi will be about 2.8x.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Oh, it will. Okay.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Yes, yes. So the answer -- the short answer is, we're really going to focus on paying down debt and integrating the acquisitions.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. That is very helpful. If I can ask a follow-up here, talking about your guidance that you gave. I think you made a commentary about Pergo margins ultimately after the integration actions having margins equal to Unilin's. And I just was curious, did you mean the Unilin segment overall or did you mean Unilin's laminate margins? Because my understanding is the laminate margins are higher than some of the other products that Unilin has.","Frank H. Boykin","The laminate margins are higher in the division, and we expect to be able to raise the margins significantly over the next year as we implement all the strategies we went through.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, just wanted to clarify also around the acquisitions. In response to Steve's question, the operating margins, is that going to -- I don't know if you exactly answered Steve, if it's going to the Unilin overall corporate average or the above average laminate business. And also, in the estimates that you have for at least 2Q '13, I would assume that it doesn't include any of the payback on the restructuring.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Well, I'll answer the last question first. The estimates we have for next quarter -- and we've got these 3 acquisitions and a lot of moving parts, right, in each of the 3 acquisitions, so it does include some of the savings that we're going to get from some of the integration that we've already completed. But we still got a good bit more to do. What was the first question?","Frank H. Boykin","In the margins, we believe that we're going to be able to get the Unilin margins back to the low to mid-teens, and we would like to have the -- we expect to have the Pergo margins in the same range.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And I guess, second question on the Mohawk carpet segment, you pointed to still lagging inflation in the second quarter. I guess really kind of 2 parts because I think it would be helpful to understand what's going on in the Mohawk segment. On the top line, can you give us a sense of how much the product transitions negatively impacted overall top line growth, number one? And number two, I would assume some of that would come back. And with that coming back in 2Q, would you still expect a year-over-year margin expansion even with the cost inflation lag?","Frank H. Boykin","We don't break out the margins by individual products within the segments, the -- or the sales, but we do expect the growth rate to increase in the next quarter. It was also impacted by about 1.5% with the less day in the period. We're expecting the sales to increase as we go through the year, both in the actions we're taking, as well as improvements in the markets.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","And we should also, Mike, see improvement in the margins as we move through the year, both from mix and productivity.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's on the year-over-year you're talking about?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Wood with Maguire (sic) [Macquarie].","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","You had mentioned the impact of weather in your roof panel sales. But broadly speaking, Unilin within Europe, we've seen also some weather-related weakness from your peers. Can you sort of quantify how shipments and orders were impacted and what you're seeing so far this quarter related to that potentially coming back?","Frank H. Boykin","We have the same thing in our business with the one less shipping days about 1.5% impacted Europe. We see Europe continuing with soft and volume under pressure in all the businesses in Europe. Our legacy European sales are down some more, some less than about 10% in the different pieces. However, we're offsetting some of it by growth in new channels, as well as new geographies.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","And I would say from the weather perspective, the products that were most significantly impacted would have been the roofing panels.","Frank H. Boykin","The construction -- anything related to construction.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Yes. In laminate less so.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Got it. And also within the Mohawk segment, can you sort of just go through some of the moving parts there in terms of mix shifts impacting margins like the polyester mix or lower end, lower margin sales, SmartStrand and Embrace, which could potentially be helping you right now, and the impact of area rugs?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","If you look at the different categories, we are increasing our sales of higher value products, which we call all the soft products under multiple different brands. And we think we're changing the premium market in carpets, so that's helping our margins. We are continuing to reduce the sales of our old staple products and are headed to close to 0 over this year. We get through -- there's some of those legacy left. There's a transition away from polypropylene products that going on and replacing those is growth in the polyester business. Polyester is basically selling in the mid to low-end part of the marketplace as when people go above there, they prefer to have the extra benefits of the higher-value nylon and some extra products that we sell. I guess some of the other margin things that are going on at the midpart point of the market is not growing as much as it should be because of the replacement business. So we expect that business to pick up as it goes through until you have higher growth in our business at the lower end and at the higher end.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wonder if in it the tile business domestically, if you could talk about the, on the non-res side actually, bidding or what you are seeing in terms of -- obviously, residential is turning, but in terms of the non-res, how does that look to you guys?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Commercial business' growth was stronger than our residential business and the ceramic business. We see that the specifications are increasing. We see more activity going forward, so we're positive about the businesses that goes through and expecting it to get stronger.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess the particular areas, are there particular industries, I mean, generally, things like education and government are cited as weakness. So are there particular areas that you would like to call out?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Hospitality has been strong in both carpet and in tile, and we've seen strength in health care as well.","Frank H. Boykin","And some of the commercial categories are doing better [indiscernible] I'm sorry.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. And I guess, the margins that you guys laid out for the acquisitions, you said you hadn't finalized your purchase accounting yet. But were those margins that you gave including purchase accounting as you now model it?","Frank H. Boykin","Ken, that's our best estimate. We've further along on the Pergo acquisition because we've obviously had it longer. And then Marazzi and Spano, those are our estimates that we're hopeful that we're fairly close.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And in terms of seasonality of sales, would you put any real thought into how those months of sales following any big seasonal variation?","Frank H. Boykin","Well, just like with the legacy Mohawk business, it experiences the same kind of seasonality. First quarter is going to be the slowest in each of those 3 businesses.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The only difference would be there European business. In August, it's slower where the U.S. businesses are.","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, because of the holiday season here.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Wondering, if we are talking about the laminate wood business with Pergo in terms of shifting the production from Sweden to Belgium, wondering as you do that, how much cash are you going to have in terms of the Belgian capacity then?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I don't know exactly the numbers. We have enough capacity to support the business and the growth that we need. We have some assets that will be moved to make up any shortfalls that we have. We don't have any limitations to our business.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, within the ceramics business then, you talked about sort of the distribution with Marazzi in Russia in terms of owning the retail and controlling that distribution. What are your thoughts on that more broadly? Is there -- as you look at that, is there any thought in terms of just more of that activity in terms of control and distribution through retail?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The difference is that the Russian market has been just changing in the last 10, 15 years. And so as it develops, Marazzi built a retail distribution channel there. I don't believe that you can take that and replant it across the world in developed areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Goldberg with UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's actually Sue for David. Can you speak to the pricing that that you get on some of the new products that you've introduced even if it's broadly across the different segments? And as you raise prices on those, do you have more pricing power there such that you're not just able to make up for any changes in the raw material costs, but are you actually able to add to the margin at all with those products?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The answer is the product introductions had different margins based on the value-added difference. And as you go up in the higher end of the spectrum, there's more differentiation. As you go down in the bottom end of it, you have commodity products with very limited differentiation. When we introduce products, we try to introduce products that have higher margins than the products we sold before and replace old dropping products with better margins as we go every year. We attempt to introduce products to cover the raw material costs that are there so that we don't have to raise them, but it doesn't always work out that way.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So right now though, you're basically just sort of keeping up with the raw material prices you're seeing?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Well, our goal is to do better. If we see we think we're expanding the margins in all the businesses, and some of the actions are related to how we're managing the product mix.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the sort overall buying trends, are you seeing that are people are stepping up at all and maybe moving away from some of the higher value stuff that we saw in the sort of depths of this downturn that we've been through?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We don't see a major change in the average pricing of the different categories. What you have is a lot of the new construction business tends to use lower quality products. So as it grows, it's offsetting some of the higher-value products or selling the remodeling piece. What we really need is the remodeling business to recover, and you'll see a significant change in the mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Could you guys talk a little about the, I think you said, 4% to 5% for Marazzi in the quarter? Can you just talk that a little bit geography by geography and what you're seeing across the 3 major regions?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Sure. It's consistent with where we are. The Russian business is growing the fastest. The U.S. business is second, and the European business actually showed growth by growing the business outside the southern part of Western Europe and to other areas of Europe and to Eastern Europe, as well as into Northern Africa. And so we're focused going forward on maximizing the business in the areas that are doing better, and that's what we intend to do.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And just to clarify that on the Russian side, how fast a growth is that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think it's around 10%, but I'm not exactly sure on the exact number.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then separately, on the Mohawk segment, the carpet business, how do you guys think about sort of what a good outlook would look like in a recovery scenario? There's been a lot of different timing issues related with some of the home center rollout, the mix, the rugs, maybe a lack of home improvement growth trailing some of the other industries out there. Where do you see kind of the volumes going once some of the stuff normalizes outage? As you look out over the next couple of years, what would you consider to be a strong recovery-type scenario in that category?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","You have to start out with an estimate of what's going to happen with the entire flooring industry. If you assume -- it depends on how long a time period. If you assume about a 5% increase, what you'll have is the carpet piece should be below there on average over the period, and the things that are growing faster, such as ceramic, will be higher. Now a lot of it also depends on the mix in category. So ceramic has a much higher percentage of its business in new construction, for example, and the carpet side has a much higher percentage in remodeling. Then you have different amounts going into commercial. But I mean, in general, I think that as you see a 3% growth rate -- 3%, 4% growth rate in carpet over X time, while you have a 5% in the industry would be a good growth rate.","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, and the biggest thing with carpet right now is that remodeling side. That's over 50% of the total. And once that remodel, the pent-up demand comes back and that should really impact the carpet business.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So you see that kind of growth as during a recovery scenario or a more normalized longer-term cycle?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","It depends what you're calling recovery. Are you calling recovery in the next 12 months or the next 5 years?","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Let's say the next 2 years?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The next 2 years, then you've got to decide what the average growth of the industry is going to be so...","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","To your point in carpet, carpet will under-grow the flooring category overall?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","It will. So I mean if we fix 6% or 7%, it will go up with it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First off, a housekeeping question, Frank. And if you've mentioned this in the prepared remarks and I missed it, I apologize. The $5 million to $10 million negative impact in Q2 from the FIFO accounting from the price increases, what was the negative impact in Q1 so we get a sense of what that means sequentially?","Frank H. Boykin","It was not a negative impact in Q1. It impacted us because we're buying in Q1, and it's hitting our P&L in Q2. So it was the raw material we're buying in Q1 that we're talking about.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got you. Okay. So the timing of it even though it was not as a quarter ended per se, it still was a de minimis negative impact to you in Q1?","Frank H. Boykin","Correct.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And next question, you're renaming the Mohawk segment the Carpet segment. Remind us, generally speaking, how much of that segment at this point is actually carpet versus other things, like textiles and rugs and pads and hardwood surface, that kind of thing.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The majority of it, carpet.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","2\/3 or 3\/4, how do we gauge that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We don't break out each of the pieces by product.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last question, and I'll defer to others. A small competitor of yours the other day mentioned that April carpet sales at the specialty retail side was a little soft. Do you think that's systemic in the industry? Or is that perhaps more company specific for them?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I mean, we're expecting a second quarter of our business to improve. We have a lot of initiatives that are making it. I don't really have industry numbers at this moment. We're expecting ours would do better, and we're expecting our margins to improve. You heard us also take significant cost out of the SG&A. That will start showing up in the second quarter and going forward, so we're trying to make our business better no matter what happens.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Maguire [ph] with Longbow Research [ph].","Unknown Anallyst","I guess the question is somewhat hypothetical in nature. I mean, you've got an awful lot of irons in the fire here. You're investing in people, you're investing in new products, you're ramping plants in Mexico and France, the list goes on and on and on. You've put up a 6.5% EBIT margin for the first quarter. Any sense of what that margin would have been if you were to exclude all these investments that you're making?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","No, they all get intertwined together.","Unknown Anallyst","Do you track them in terms of what the burden is to the P&L. Is it 100 bps or 200 bps?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes. But I mean, we do that internally, but we're not prepared to talk about specifics at that level of detail.","Unknown Anallyst","Okay. Maybe if I -- in that case, let me just ask you about the French new insulation board plant. What do you think that would support in terms of incremental revenues at full capacity?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Probably about EUR 100 million.","Unknown Anallyst","About EUR 100 million? Okay, terrific.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Baugh with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wanted to dive into the Mohawk segment and I guess just better understand the moving parts there. So everything being equal, we have 1.5% less volume just because of the short day, do I understand that correct?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, that's correct.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then I wasn't clear, I guess, with that 1.5% of incorporated. Were carpet volumes up overall, flat overall? I mean, it sounds like there were up in specialty commercial, and then they were down in the home center channel. But did it net out to flat in volume, which really would have been 1.5% positive with the extra day?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The volume probably would be flat to up slightly.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","With adding back the 1.5%?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Across all the pieces.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then what -- we've heard referred about rug sales being slow for quite some time now and the home center issue. I guess, we're going to start lapping that. When do we lap that and maybe some more color on precisely what's going on in rugs?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The home center by the end of this -- by the end of the first quarter with the new introductions in, then we should start seeing improvement in the home center piece. The rug piece, we continue to see by the retailers a focus on reduction of lower price points. So what happens is the unit prices continued to decline as they keep pushing down the mix within the retail stores of what they want to advertise. So with that, the carpet sales have gone down with the reduction -- or the rug sales have gone down with the reduction of the selling prices, as well as the demand in those things have also been reduced. We have continued to reduce our cost structures and are maintaining our profit levels as that happens. At the same time, we are focused on growing various channels within it. There's a specialty retail channel that we think is growing and can then improve our mix, which we're planning on doing this year. E-commerce continues to grow, and we're trying to drive more fashionable higher-value rugs to improve the mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, in the prepared commentary or one of the questions, I can't remember, you had talked about the Mohawk segment. Are you expecting to the volumes to improve in the second quarter and is that industry or is that from your own initiatives?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We're expecting industry volumes to be up a little bit, and we're expecting to do better than the industry.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And the last several quarters, you've done a little below for a lot of reasons that you've mentioned several times. Are we just anniversary-ing some of those problems or is it something else?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think we're improving our position.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the price increase, you expect it to be fully in by the end of the second quarter, is that correct?","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, but there'll be a shortfall in the second quarter, which we don't expect to have in the third.","Operator","Your last question comes from Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is actually Desi filling in for Bob. On the SG&A line, yes, that was really excellent in the quarter. And I was curious how we should think about that over the course of the year, especially once you bring in the acquisitions and how their SG&A margin compares to your own.","Frank H. Boykin","Well, we're going to continue as we move through the year. We're the going to continue to see improvement as we leverage the SG&A expenses against better sales.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think you have to answer in 2 pieces. Because one of the legacy businesses, we expect the percent cost of sales to continue going down as we manage the cost. The businesses coming in, we're homogenizing those costs, we're taking costs out. But many of them are above where we are, so there's really 2 different answers.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then also in the Unilin segment with the wood flooring price increase, how do you expect that to -- versus the rising wood cost? Do you expect to have a lag there at all or is it going to be pretty smooth?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Remember with our business at Unilin, it's a -- the wood business is a portion of our U.S. business, which is smaller than our European business, and then that's only a portion within it. So it's a limited piece to the total. The prices will go up and will help offset some of the costs that we have and improve it, but that's not going to be significant to the total.","Operator","I would like to turn the call back over to Jeff for closing remarks.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you for joining us. We think that we are well positioned going forward in our legacy businesses and improving both the mix and the products. We think that we are -- we have made the right acquisitions at the right time, and we expect our business to continue improving over the next several years.","Thank you very much for joining us.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mohawk Industries Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, August 1, 2014. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Frank Boykin, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Frank H. Boykin","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Mohawk Industries quarterly investor conference call. Today we'll update you on the company's progress during the second quarter of 2014 and provide guidance for the third quarter and the full year.","I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. During the second quarter, our earnings per share were $2.08 as reported, or $2.21 excluding unusual charges, an increase of 20% over adjusted second quarter 2013 results and the highest quarterly adjusted earnings per share in the company's history. Our adjusted operating income increased 160 basis points as productivity initiatives, cost reductions, price increases and manufacturing consolidation drove higher earnings across the business.","During the period, sales rose 4% as reported, or 3% on a constant exchange rate, over the prior year primarily driven by the strengthening euro and partially offset by the weakening ruble. Top line growth was less than we anticipated due to slower improvement in the U.S. housing and remodeling. However, profits were in line with expectations as a result of successful product introductions, productivity improvements and better controls. We reduced SG&A costs compared to last year across the enterprises -- enterprise, even as we reinvested into the business to promote new product collections and enhance our sales strategies. Our entire management team is focusing on enhancing the organizational structures, sales and marketing strategies, product collections and operational performance, as well as further integrating our acquisitions into Mohawk. We're continuing to invest in our acquisitions to improve profitability, increase mix and streamline the business. And we anticipate these actions will result in even higher earnings as the European and Russian economies improve.","During 2014, we expect our capital expenditures to reach $550 million as we have identified additional opportunities to improve our future results. These investments will support sales and income growth and include new product innovations, upgrading assets of acquired businesses, increased yarn capacity for carpet, greater ceramic tile capacity and an LVT plant to support our growing commitment to this category.","In the U.S., continuing improvement in the job market and a growing GDP should support a stronger second half of the year. Although housing growth has slowed in the first 6 months of 2014, it is expected to continue growing from its currently historically low level. Both the National Association of Home Builders and Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies expect residential remodeling to grow for the remainder of the year, with pent-up demand driving increased spending. The AIA's Architectural Billings Index rose to a 9-month high in June, and the new project inquiry index increased to an 11-month high, reflecting stronger nonresidential growth trends.","In Mexico, the economy should improve on its first quarter growth as consumer confidence hit a 7-month high in May and GDP is projected to rebound almost 4%. The European Commission is projecting limited growth across the European Union during 2014, citing positive impact of declining deficits, rebounding investments, improving employment and continued reforms. In Russia, the Central Bank is predicting declining economic conditions in the second half of the year, although the forecasted recession has not arrived yet and the ruble has rebounded.","As we look at our second quarter performance by segment, our carpet business adjusted operating income increased 15% over last year, as a result of increased productivity, improved quality and cost reductions in operations and administration. Net sales were up 1%, and we anticipate improvement in both our residential and commercial categories in the second half of this year. We reduced SG&A costs through systems improvement, lower selling costs and reductions in force that yielded greater efficiency and enhanced customer service. Our investments in new equipment delivered increased productivity and throughput, contributing to the profitability of the business.","In the residential channel, the segmentation of our sales organization into retail, builder and multifamily has improved our execution, and we are adding personnel to maximize our brand penetration in the major markets. Investments in new Continuum technology is supporting growth in our product collections made from up to 100% recycled polyester in the mid and value price points. Our patented Continuum process produces a better, cleaner, bulkier carpet from postconsumer recycled content with outstanding stain and soil resistance, as well as more luxurious softness. Our super soft carpet collections, such as SmartStrand Silk and Wear-Dated Embrace continue to capture a greater share of the premium carpet category, as homeowners upgrade their remodeling projects. We're also expanding the distribution of our premium Karastan carpets by providing a broader offering and increasing the number of retailers selling our high-end brand.","Commercial orders improved through the quarter, led by hospitality and corporate sectors. Orders are growing now that we have substantially completed the transition to our own fibers, which deliver industry-leading style and performance and improve our efficiencies and margins. We have reorganized our commercial sales organization into smaller regions, segmented by customer type, with the complete product portfolio for each channel. At the annual industry exhibition, our new breaking form carpet tile collection was named the best modular carpet with new shapes, colors and patterns that create sophisticated visually appealing commercial spaces.","Our investment in extrusion and yarn capacity is supporting our increased Continuum polyester sales with our state-of-the-art manufacturing project 75% complete at this point. We continue to drive numerous productivity projects across the segment, including operational enhancements, improved SG&A costs and capital investments.","Our April price increase was fully implemented at the end of the quarter to cover the raw material inflation we incurred. We announced an additional freight increase in July to cover increased trucking and logistics costs.","During the period, our ceramics segment's adjusted operating income grew 21% due to productivity, volume, pricing and mix. Net sales rose 5% as reported, with a constant exchange rate compared to the prior year which, for the first time, includes the Marazzi acquisition and its comparisons.","In the quarter, U.S. sales improved less than anticipated as demand did not rebound as strongly as we anticipated, and larger customers adjusted inventories. In flooring retail stores, we continue to expand our ceramic store-within-a-store program with a special merchandising and promotions. We will open 6 additional American Olean and Marazzi combined sales service centers on the West Coast by the end of the year for a total of 16 overall. All of the combined service centers in operation are providing a broad product selection and are attracting new customers to increase our market position.","We continue to grow our relationships with national and regional builders by providing the best ceramic program available with a high level of local service. The commercial sector is accelerating, with hospitality, retail and corporate expected to lead the growth through the remaining part of the year.","Our innovative new collections are leading the market shift to larger sizes, planks and rectangles. We are expanding our Reveal printing technology to mosaic tiles, creating enhanced visuals that coordinate with our wall and floor tile. Our new production line in Dallas has begun operation and will satisfy the increasing demand for ceramic planks in larger sizes. We will transition some Salamanca production to the expanded Dallas facility to free up capacity to support our growing business in Mexico. Our new ceramic plant in Tennessee remains on track to start production the beginning of 2016.","Across the business, we delivered productivity improvement, implemented enhanced formulations and added new equipment to improve service. We continue to find logistics and productivity improvements across our transportation system. Daltile received the Award of Excellence for ceramic for the 16th straight year in Floor Covering News, and ranked first in quality, surface and design by Floor Focus Retailer survey.","Sales in Mexico are growing significantly and outperforming the market. We are gaining share as we expand the distribution of new products from our Salamanca plant by offering innovative collections that provide market-leading style and value with superior availability. We continue to expand the number of distributors and retailers supporting our brand, while growing our margins through improved mix and from our larger sizes in planks.","In Russia, we outperformed the market with sales continuing to grow on a local basis. We overcame slower retail sales through growth in the new construction and DIY channel, with specialized products tailored for each of these sectors. The current Russian economic situation is impacting major consumer purchases, including flooring. The economy has slowed and is expected to be sluggish through the end of the year. For the period, sales and profitability increased on a local basis, but the 11% decline in the ruble reduced our sales and income when translated to U.S. dollars. Sales of -- of our 2013 product introductions continue to grow and have improved our product mix. Our 2014 introductions have been similarly well-received and enhance our position as the style and innovation leader in the Russian marketplace. During the period, we opened 4 new franchise retail shops and started up a new production line to support future growth. Through improved production planning, we have reduced inventories and manufacturing costs. We're continuing to improve the Russian organization by enhancing the management team and accelerating sales, manufacturing and system initiatives.","In Europe, our sales and margins continue to progress due to increased sales outside of Southern Europe, as well as growth in Spain and improved mix from larger sizes and unique styling. We continue to lead the European market with ceramic wood planks and have expanded the collection with even larger sizes. During the period, we consolidated all of our wall tile production into our Spanish facility. We've committed the capital to upgrade all the floor tile lines in 2 plants in Italy by the end of 2015, with the first kiln conversion to be completed during this quarter. In the third quarter, we expect normal seasonal slowing in Europe, where our margins should continue to improve over the prior year from lower SG&A, higher productivity and better mix. Our European organization has been significantly improved over the past year with the addition of new talent, a single European sales strategy and investments in state-of-the-art equipment. We continue to streamline the organization, refine processes and improve our sales and administrative functions to reduce cost and improve efficiencies.","Across our global ceramic business, we are increasing productivity and enhancing quality through best practices that improve our costs and throughputs. We are leveraging the manufacturing and product strengths of our international assets to provide differentiated products in our other markets and give us a competitive advantage.","During the period, the adjusted operating income for laminate and wood segment rose 21% from acquisition synergies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. Net sales for the segment increased 6% over the prior year as reported, or 3% on a constant exchange rate, with most of the increase from the Spano acquisition, higher wood flooring sales and growth in insulation board sales.","In the U.S., slower-than-anticipated store traffic reduced the segment sales in line with our other U.S. businesses. Greater participation in the new construction channel drove higher sales of wood flooring. We're successfully leveraging the Quick-Step brand with the new wood collection featuring sophisticated styling, reduced maintenance and our patented installation system. Productivity and cost initiatives are being aggressively implemented across the U.S. laminate and wood flooring manufacturing facilities. The second wood flooring price increase this year was implemented in July to cover higher U.S. wood and transportation costs.","European sales on a local currency were up and flat on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year. Sales were stronger in the Nordic countries and the U.K., although softer Western European markets continue to create headwinds. Overall, our wood and LVT categories grew during the period but were impacted by slower laminate sales. By the end of July, we will complete the transition to our updated Pergo laminate products, which should improve our sales and margins due to their enhanced styling, performance, all with easier installation. The improved productivity of our Belgian facility, where we consolidated our Pergo and Unilin laminate, is reducing our manufacturing and raw material costs as expected. SG&A expenses in Europe were lowered significantly by improving administrative efficiencies.","At our recently acquired wood plant in the Czech Republic, we have invested in new equipment to produce higher-value products under the Pergo and Quick-Step brands. The new wood collections from this facility will be launched in October and will expand our wood business across Europe and Russia. We will utilize some of our Malaysian wood capacity to increase sales in Australia and the Asian markets.","Construction of our LVT plant in Belgium remains on-target, with new equipment being installed and tests under way. We anticipate a longer start-up period to allow more extensive testing of our new LVT processes to ensure our high quality standards. To support our future LVT capacity, we are growing sales in both the residential and commercial channels in Europe, the U.S. and Australia.","Our European insulation business continued to expand in France and the Benelux region, supported by additional production in our new French facility. Our roof panel sales and margins remain under pressure, and we announced the closure of a small French plant, with production to be consolidated at other facilities. We are also improving our sales organization to maximize the sale of the products in all channels.","The integration of our Unilin and Spano businesses continue to progress, with a single sales force providing a comprehensive product offering to every customer. Many initiatives to reduce costs in our board business are at various stages of completion, including the closing of 2 manufacturing facilities, closing of a production line, integrating management and administrative functions, consolidating information systems and reducing raw material costs.","I'll now turn the call over to Frank, to review our financial performance for the period.","Frank H. Boykin","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales -- we had net sales of $2,048,000,000 during the quarter, which grew 4% as reported, or 3% on a constant exchange rate basis. We had growth in all segments, with stronger performance in the ceramic and laminate segments. Our gross margin was 28.1% as reported, or, excluding restructuring, 28.4%, which is up 70 basis points over last year.","We had higher productivity, lower cost in acquisitions that drove this improvement. SG&A dollars were $353 million, with 17.2% of net sales. On a pro forma basis, excluding restructuring, SG&A dollars actually declined. Cost-cutting continued to improve results, allowing reinvestment back into the business.","Restructuring charges for the quarter were $11 million and included $7 million in cost of goods sold and $4 million in SG&A. We estimate there will be $38 million in additional restructuring in the second half of 2014 as we continue to integrate our acquisitions.","Our operating income margin was up 160 basis points to 11.4% for the quarter. Interest expense was $21 million and improved over last year due to our ratings upgrade and our entry into the commercial paper program. Recently, we announced that we will purchase $200 million of our outstanding January 2016 bonds, using commercial paper to fund the repurchase. Currently, we have $900 million of bonds at 6 1\/8% coupon outstanding. We'll pay approximately $17 million in a make-whole premium during the third quarter to buy the bonds, realizing some cash savings. This will reduce interest expense by $4 million in the second half of 2014 and $11 million in 2015.","Our income tax rate was 24% for the quarter and compares to 21% last year. We expect our full year tax rate to be 22%, with approximately 20% in the second half. However, timing of deductions could impact quarters differently. Earnings per share excluding charges came in at $2.21, up 20% from last year, an all-time quarterly record for Mohawk.","We turn to the segments. In the carpet segment, sales were $780 million, up slightly over 1% during the quarter. We've seen growth from new products in both residential and in commercial. Our operating income excluding charges -- the operating income margin excluding charges was 8.1%, up 100 basis points compared to last year, with productivity increases supporting the higher margins.","In our ceramic segment, sales were $797 million, a 5% improvement. We had growth in all regions around the world, with our largest improvement in Mexico. The Marazzi acquisition continues to benefit top line, as well as bottom line results.","Operating income margin, excluding charges, in the ceramic segment was 13.4%. That's up 180 basis points due to volume, productivity and mix, which offsets start-up costs from one of our plants.","In the laminate and wood segment, sales were $501 million, up 6% over last year. Sales were up 3% on a constant exchange rate basis, as the euro benefited our results. Operating income, excluding charges, was 14.3% of sales. That's up 170 basis points, with acquisitions and cost reductions driving higher profitability.","In the corporate segment, we had an operating loss of $8 million and are estimating a $30 million number for the full year.","If we jump to the balance sheet. Receivables ended the quarter at $1,262,000,000. Our days sales outstanding for the quarter were 52 days, and that compares favorably to last year. Inventories ended the quarter at $1,645,000,000. Our days inventory outstanding were 109 days. We were impacted by slower -- a slower rebound in demand and some larger customers adjusting inventory levels. We expect to improve our inventory turns in the second half of this year.","Our fixed assets ended the quarter at $2,830,000,000 and included capital expenditures of $128 million, with depreciation and amortization of $84 million. We estimate that capital expenditures for the full year will be $550 million, primarily for capacity expansion and to continue expanding -- or assimilating our acquisitions. D&A is estimated for the full year at $350 million. And the long-term debt ended the quarter at $2.4 billion, with leverage at 2.1x debt-to-EBITDA. We expect the ratio to improve to 1.7x by the end of the fourth quarter.","Jeff, I'll turn it back over to you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. During the period, we once again demonstrated our ability to deliver earnings growth through sales improvement, productivity initiatives and leveraging acquisitions. In each of our segments, we're optimizing the efficiency of our operations, the advantages of our leading market positions, the breadth of our distribution and the strength of our brands to grow our business.","We anticipate that our sales will strengthen as we move through the second half of the year, supported by continued U.S. job creation and improved economic growth. We continue to take appropriate action to pass through raw material and freight increases, as required. We're improving efficiencies in manufacturing, logistics and administrative functions, and we continue to consolidate operations as needed to reduce costs and improve service. In the third quarter, we anticipate further improvement in the U.S. market, with limited growth in our -- in the European and Russian markets. With these factors, our guidance for the third quarter earnings is $2.38 to $2.47 per share, and for the full year, $8.09 to $8.25 per share, excluding any restructuring charges.","We remain committed to enhancing Mohawk's results and we are optimistic about the improvement of the floor covering industry and our participation in it. We continue to bring innovation to our products and processes to expand our revenues and margins. The integration of our acquisition continues to reduce costs and improve our market position. We continue to pursue acquisition opportunities where we can leverage our knowledge, resources and capital.","We'll now be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is actually Desi filling in for Bob. Just looking at the ceramic segment. Margin performance was really excellent this quarter, 13.4%. You had previously mentioned that you were targeting an operating margin in the range of 13% to 14%, longer term. And as you integrate Marazzi and realize better productivity levels, do you think there's maybe some upside to your long-term forecast, given where the business is currently operating?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I mean, one thing, you have to look at the annual margin, which we were talking about rather than the quarterly since we have seasonal variation through it. So we're still aiming in those ranges as we think on an annual basis.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then also on the SG&A line, you had mentioned the dollar value had decreased, as well as the ratio. And as we look out towards the back half of the year, are there continued -- do you continue to see cost reduction initiatives that you can take to maybe keep SG&A flattish or even a little lower in the second half?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We always have initiatives to control our cost and improve them. What we expect is the per sale will be down going forward and the dollars will be up somewhat in the prior -- for the rest of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","You guys have done a lot of investments driving outgrowth with -- you mentioned the new tile printing, distributor expansion, other product innovations. Since you haven't had a lot of help from market growth to date, can you give us an indication of what you're expecting from the end market growth in the back half and what you saw in the quarter, particularly in the U.S.?","Frank H. Boykin","So your question is the outlook for sales as we move through the rest of the year, Michael?","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","No. I mean, I know you're going to continue to drive the outgrowth. I'm actually interested in what you think the actual markets that you're operating in will grow in the back half of the year and whether or not they were helping you in the first half or this quarter.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I mean, we think that the U.S. market is going to improve in the second half. The question is, it can improve a little or a lot. We don't know at this moment, which is the reason we give you a range as we go through. We believe that it's going to improve from where it is. We were more optimistic about it going into the second quarter. And as we went through, it didn't rebound as much as we thought so we've modified our view of the second half slightly because of it.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","And then in terms of the expanding of the carpet distribution, I'm just curious what the impact is on your current distributor base? And what I'm ultimately getting at is why are you now able to expand the distribution? Is it from new product introduction similar to what you did in Unilin in Europe during the volatility there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","What we've said was that we were going to expand the distribution of our high-end Karastan brand more. The high-end Karastan brand, we treat differently. We make sure that we find the right retailers who can sell better quality products, and we're expanding that base, is what we meant to say.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","You talked a lot about the acquisition integration. If you looked at it in what inning you're in, that type of thing, where do you think you are? And as you move through the process, integrating all of this, does this fundamentally change your incremental Op margins you think you can get as you go over the next few years?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think I might have to sort of talk you through the different pieces because they're all a little different. Pergo... the Pergo integration is substantially complete at this time. With the European manufacturing is basically shut down, and now put in our plants. We went through start-up costs in getting them together as we go through. So we're manufacturing the products there. The new product line is in place so we anticipate having more productivity improvement in our old plant because it had all the different changes going on in it. In the U.S., we're also substantially complete. But we're putting new equipment in, that's being installed this period, which will enhance our capacity, as well as improve our efficiencies. Marazzi U.S., we have integrated it with the Daltile organization. Organization structures are set up and working. And basically, the big pieces, going forward, are to optimize the product alignment by plant and keep continuing to optimize the distribution of both brands through the marketplace. In Europe, we have put a new strategy in place, the organization's in place. We have been improving the costs. We have new equipment, and some of it's just going in this period and it will continue to go in one line after another because we're operating as we change, all the way through 2015. The new equipment will allow us to reduce our costs, as well as improve our mix further. Just as a comment, in our ceramic business, we're not trying at the moment to drive top line growth. The focus is on driving margins through the changes in mix and reducing the costs until we get the business performing the way we want it to. In Russia, the focus in Marazzi is just to improve the organization's strength. And we've made progress in expanding into DIY and new construction businesses, which is helping us actually increase our sales in a marketplace that's under a lot of pressure. And we continue to introduce new products. And we really have a differentiated product strategy, which is giving us higher margins in Russia than the competition and allowing us to outperform the competition. The last acquisition is the Spano acquisition, which we've already integrated. The sales, the management, the systems are all complete. At this point, we have one manufacturing line that's been closed -- one plant that's been closed, and we're in the middle of closing another plant as we speak. All the changes with the acquisitions are on track. We think they're on-plan to achieve what we want. We think there's more opportunities in the margins and the sales top line as we go forward.","Frank H. Boykin","And then Stephen, I'll just address your last -- the last part of your question regarding incremental margins. We don't expect the incremental margins that we've talked about in the past to change. It will add to the profit dollars. But that 20%, 25% and 30% margins that I gave you for the carpet, tile and laminate businesses we think are going to stay in that same ballpark.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that helps. And Jeff, if I just look at Marazzi, just listening to you talk, is it fair to say you're probably halfway through or so on that? And then the other question that I had is just on the M&A front. Are you all still in a reactive mode there? Are you now proactive? And you talked a little bit about where your debt was now. I guess, how much debt capacity do you have right now or you would be comfortable going? That type of thing.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We made huge progress, as we just talked about the acquisitions. Our balance sheet is in good position, as Frank went through the ratios before, which allows us to pursue acquisitions. I think the management is in position to take on other things, and the balance sheet surely is. We continue to assess opportunities around the world. But you don't have them until you conclude, which you never know when and how that's going to go along. Acquisitions are a core part of our long-term strategy and we believe we are highly competent in bringing them in and putting them together.","Frank H. Boykin","And with regards to how much additional debt and our leverage. As you know, in the past, what we've done is we've, as we've bought companies, we've levered up. And then as we've integrated them and generated cash, we've brought our debt and our leverage down. And that would continue to be our strategy. We're at about 2.1x debt-to-EBITDA right now, and we could go up maybe to 3x, somewhere around there.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","And we'll continue to pay off debt as we go through the year.","Frank H. Boykin","Yes.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. And Jeff, if I can sneak in on that, any preferences geographically or product-wise as you think about it right now?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The preferences are for a return on investment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","I guess the first question, do you think there's anything to the notion that flooring being more of a planning category and an interior category that, with the harsher winter and kind of later break to spring, that it just got kicked out? And now you're in the summer period, people are thinking outdoors. So it's really not until the fall that you get back to that remodeling push?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","If you go back over the history of our industry, it tends to be slow from about the first part of January, December because you can't get it in before Christmas. It tends to stay there until you come out. It starts picking up in February, March. And it tends to run fairly level all the way through the rest of the year down. And then the things that have impacted it lately, the economy impacts it. So I don't see a dramatic change in seasonality other than the normal things that we go through.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","I guess the question is -- and I realize it's hard to quantify, but do you feel like that normal seasonality that got kicked out, got kicked out further than 2Q and into 3Q? Or it just completely got eliminated?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","In our own business, I can only answer that we're seeing the normal seasonality. It just didn't jump like we expected it to jump from our thesis in the first quarter [ph]. It still improved as we went from first quarter to second quarter, it's just that we thought that the category would have picked up more than it did.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got you. Okay. And then the comment you had made on retail, I think that there was some tightness in inventory and maybe some weakness in traffic. Have you seen that change at all, thus far, in the third quarter?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The trends we're seeing are, as we said, is that the second quarter wasn't as good as we said, but it is better. We're anticipating the third quarter and the fourth quarter to improve from here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The first question I had was just going back to your expectation for a little bit of strengthening in the back half in terms of year-over-year growth versus the first half. And I just wanted to get a sense if that was based on just the, perhaps, easier comps, at least, as it relates to carpet in the second half versus the second quarter? Or some bigger macro drivers or other types of drivers that you see in your business?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I guess what we evaluated -- there's a lot of things we put together in trying to estimate the future. We get input from our own people, what they're seeing. We get input back from our customers, how optimistic they are about it. We watch the trends that we're doing. And we believe we're going to see an improvement of it. We're not expecting it to jump through the ceiling, but we think it's going to improve, and we'll find out.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I guess, also with the second quarter itself, you did note that sales were a little bit below, but you had several drivers that offset that. Just conceptually here, are we thinking, perhaps, that the delta in sales was maybe 1 or 2 points of growth that was offset by the new products and productivity and cost controls? And if that were to occur in the back half, do you think you have sufficient momentum in those offsetting drivers to continue to allow you to make your guidance?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I guess, going back to the second quarter, somewhere between 1% and 2%. We had expected to grow probably 1% to 2% more than it actually did. And we've taken that into account as we've estimated the future.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, you continue to have good margin expansion on the carpet business, despite -- first quarter was down year-over-year in terms of revenue, second quarter up only 1%, and yet, you're still showing some very nice margin improvement. I just wanted to revisit what the biggest drivers of that were. I mean, last year, I think the big driver in margin improvement was the positive mix in your residential business, with some of the new -- the products and fibers that you rolled out. As far as I understand, that's continued to a degree in residential but also expanded into commercial. And so I just wanted to get a sense if that is -- I mean, you've listed several things that have improved the margins. But if that is kind of still the bigger driver, the mix? And how to think about the impact of those drivers going forward, if they would eventually moderate or if you continue to see more in the kitty?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I mean, first is that we spent the last few years upgrading our organizations, changing some of our strategies and -- both from a product standpoint and a sales standpoint to improve our margins, which we knew we had to do. Those things continue and haven't changed. The margins in the business, we have hundreds of productivity things going on at all points in time. We're very structured in how we identify them and execute them through the business. It improves both our quality as well as our cost in the different pieces. We have -- with the changes we've made, we put -- the majority of our people, we consolidated together in a single building so that we could communicate better. It allowed us to actually reduce the number of staff that we've had. We've become more focused on making sure that we don't do a large number of initiatives with the very -- the initiatives that have the most benefit. So we've reduced the number of activities but put the focus on ones that have higher value to the business and to our customers. All those things continue to pay off in how we go to market.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So are you saying then, Jeff, and I don't know, Frank, if you can weigh in on this as well, that at least the first half of this year in carpet, the bigger driver of improvement then, are you kind of pointing to more on the productivity front than the cost control front? Because it was my understanding that at least last year, the bigger driver was the positive mix.","Frank H. Boykin","Well, so I would say the bigger driver this year -- you're right, last year, mix was a big driver. The bigger driver this year in margin improvement is productivity improvements, cost control, both in manufacturing and in SG&A. And then mix, probably, with a little bit of headwind. We had some volume improvement that helped us in the quarter, a little bit, but volume improvement helped us in the quarter as well.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So mix is actually a little bit of a headwind this quarter?","Frank H. Boykin","A little bit, yes.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","As we grow our share in the mid to -- as we grow our business in the mid to lower end, it's going to impact the mix a little bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just following up on that last question. So if mix was a negative driver to carpet margins in the quarter, I guess what that could infer is that, overall, polyester grew faster than nylon. Is that a fair statement?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Definitely.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just making sure. I -- there was no material slowdown in polyester demand in the quarter, best you could tell then?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We are participating more aggressively in the polyester market. But with that, we still improved our margins in the total business by about 15%. The polyester market should continue to grow. We don't see the growth in the category slowing down and we are -- we have introduced products and we've invested in our manufacturing facility, and so we make it at competitive prices in the marketplace. But again, the margins in the lower price point products are typically lower-than-average, but not unusual for those price points which we've always participated in.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then my final question, also with respect to carpet, specifically on the residential side. Did you -- best you can tell, did you gain share versus the industry in residential? And I think there may have been some benefit in rugs. I think that Shaw may have walked away from the rugs business earlier this year, so I'm sure there was some benefit to you on that. If we look at carpet specifically, how would you gauge your performance in carpet versus the residential industry?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think that we probably did a little better in the residential piece. We probably did a little worse in commercial because we were still concluding the transition that we had. And then your comment about the exit of my competitor, we really haven't gotten any benefit because they had a huge amount of inventory they had to push through the system as they exited the business.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Might that be a material growth opportunity for you over the next several quarters?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We're expecting -- our rug business did improve in quarter. We're expecting it to continue improving. We have introduced more differentiated products using our raw material strategies to differentiate them in the marketplace, and it's also improving our mix. So we're assuming that -- we believe we're going to have improvement of it over the next 6 months or a year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg from UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's actually Susan for David. Can you talk a little bit about the promotional environment? And given the slowdown, did you see any changes there? And with that, are you seeing that consumers are reacting any differently to them? So are they becoming any less or more effective in getting them to actually get out there and make the purchase to do the project?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","There was some more promotional activity in the period as both retailers tried to drive traffic into their stores and as manufacturers tried to even out the capacities with the sales that are going on. It's hard to break it apart to tell what impact it had. You know the end result was that the industry didn't increase as much as we had hoped. It's difficult to tell what the government policies, tax changes and a lot of other things also had on the individual consumers.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of a sort of bigger picture question, your growth was really impressive despite all the sort of puts and takes that you had this quarter. And as you look further out, it's still relatively impressive given what's going on. Can you talk a little bit about the role of the U.S. and growth in the U.S. in terms of the broader picture, now that you've done all these acquisitions and you have a much broader international kind of footprint?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Oversimplified, about 65%, 70% of our business is based in the U.S., and the others, in the -- other marketplaces. Each of the markets are a little different. We're expecting the U.S. business to improve more in the near term than our European business or our Russian businesses. Our Mexican business in ceramic is doing well. As we spent the money 2 years ago or more to put in new capacity, we've changed our product lines, so it's growing at significant rates. We think these trends will be in each place. As we talk about the acquisitions, each one is a little different. The European ceramic business, we're really focused on driving margins and in changing their mix and cost structures. And that will continue over the next 1, 1.5 years. The Russian marketplace is going to be -- is suffering a little bit. And I think we're well positioned because we're positioned as the style and design leader in the marketplace. As well as owning the distribution and having over 300 franchise stores, helps us push products through the marketplace. So I think we're going to gain share. But the profitability of the business, we're going to give up a little as the market gets a little tougher. But we use that to gain share over the next 6 months, is our plan. And the real big opportunity is how much is the U.S. going to increase? And I think we have a pretty good estimate of it. It could be a little better, it could be a little worse as we go through the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jeff, I think you've talked about -- mentioned the reductions in force. I'm curious where specifically that was impacting? And is this something that was contemplated as part of the overall integrations? Or is it something that you may have had on the shelf and hit the button on when the market didn't turn out to be quite as strong as you anticipated?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Yes to all of those. The acquisition thesis, we continue to adjust the organizations as we've put them together. And as we move through it, we continue to make adjustments in them. At the same time, we talked a minute ago about the carpet management organization, we consolidated into a single building, which was spread out over a lot them. And in doing so, we were able to reorganize it, but it also got the benefit of the last 1 or 2 years of changing systems and processes, so we actually reduced the SG&A there. We continue to look at our sales organization and make sure we're maximizing the pieces, and we constantly adjust the sales strategy in order to get the products to market. And it's in all the businesses. In the Spano acquisition in Europe, we've gone to a single sales force, where we just have 2 in each of the businesses. And we've done the same thing in other areas as we go through. We continue to challenge the methods we go to market, and we try to find better ways of controlling the costs and SG&A on an ongoing basis.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then secondly, I wanted to ask about LVT. Any update on how you're thinking about as the new capacity comes on? It seems like a lot of others are bringing on capacity more or less around the same time. Do you think the market can handle that domestically? Do you worry about increasing price competition, any thoughts there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Yes to all of those. Basically, the production in the U.S. is being imported from China. So there's going to be capacity put in the U.S. and there's going to be a battle that goes on between moving it into the U.S. marketplace. Usually, local production, if it's put up in the right capacity, can compete because of its flexibility in the marketplace, and -- if you can have it at the right price. So the question is going to be with the capacity coming on, there's multiple ways of making this stuff. There are going to be different strategies of equipment. There's going to be different strategies of go-to-market. There's going to be different capabilities in style and design. And we're starting out at -- our third [ph] plant's being put up in Europe, we're going to use it to supply some of the stuff here. This European plant, by the end of the year, should be operating. And then the question's going to be, when do we put up the second one and the third one in our different regions which we participate in. While that's going on, we are importing product and selling it into all the different marketplaces. And we think we're getting ourselves positioned properly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","The first is really more focused on your U.S. or North American business. During this year, first half of this year, broadly speaking, are you seeing different performance in terms of sales momentum of higher-end price points versus lower-end price points? And then also, along with that, if you could discuss the willingness of the market to accept pricing and has there been any change relative to historical performance?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","In the quality pieces, there is some improvement in the higher end of the business. And so there is some mix improvement from it. However, at the same time, the new construction of moderate homes is also growing, which tends to use lower quality product, because they're trying to get the home built for the least cost. So there's a mix thing between them as you go through -- going on. The multifamily business is doing well. It tends to be at the lower, so the average mix through it, I'm not sure, has changed dramatically. But it's because of the growth at the high end and the low end, the middle piece is what's -- hasn't rebounded as much as it should. We're expecting over time for that middle area to improve. I forgot the second part of your question.","Frank H. Boykin","The other question was price increases and market acceptance of price increases.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The marketplace never likes price increases. We are -- have put in and have executed the price increases in the different markets that we have. In the carpet segment, we've increased the prices they are in. We did not change the prices in the commodity part of the carpet business in that one. We had put in price increases in the wood business, where the wood's been going up significantly. And they've been going in. We've put in price increases in different parts of the business as required in all the different product segments. There's also a thing going on with the transportation cost. As the U.S. economy has improved, it's gotten tighter in the transportation. And so we've had to raise the cost of the transportation in all the different product categories also.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Great. And just to be clear, on that commodity portion of the carpet, at least the pricing degradation that we saw earlier this year, you've seen stabilization in pricing there. Is that correct?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The commodity business has always been, and continues to be, low differentiated products, easy to move. And there's always price pressure on the commodity business, when business doesn't reach the levels that you want. No different than anything, and it tends to be in spot deals as you go around. And it's the same thing for all our product categories.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","And along that line, there's -- you've added some capacity. One of your competitors is continuing to add a bit more capacity on that lower end. How does that, when you think about strategically over the next 12 to 24-plus months, how does that change your thinking about pricing in that commodity portion of the business? And do you see it as a meaningful threat or is it just part of managing your day-to-day business as you come off of a deep construction downturn?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","There is new capacity going into the industry by multiple players. It's been going in over -- sometime over the last couple of years. It's not a new phenomenon. At the same time, all the capacity isn't new to the industry because in some cases, there are other product types that the capacity is going out of the marketplace, creating some needs to offset it as the market changes in customer desires as you go through. At the same time, I think the industry and we are expecting improvement in the volume of the industry, which is going to need more raw materials to support it. Over the last 5 years, there used to be significant amounts of nylon staple in the marketplace, which just about disappeared. There used to be polyester staple, which has declined significantly, almost to 0. And the polypropylene category has also declined. So there's multiple things happening as the capacity is going in to satisfy it.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then finally, thank you for giving color on restructuring for the back half of this year. How should we think about restructuring charges as we enter into 2015, I assumed it will largely be behind you?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I don't have those in front of me, where they are. Do you know...","Frank H. Boykin","We don't have those numbers here in front of us. There will be some more restructuring that Jeff talked a little bit about, continuing through 2015 on some of the work that we're doing. So there will be some more charges tomorrow -- or next year.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Will it be at lower magnitude, just generally speaking, in 2015 versus 2014?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","They should be.","Frank H. Boykin","Yes, they should be but let me, before I weigh in, look at the numbers on that.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We finish those. We go through our plan in the next quarter or so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to talk to you a little bit about the synergies and the productivity initiatives that have spun out of your -- acquisitions that you've made. And in particular, what I'm intrigued by is some commentary about that -- from you that the initiatives and the integration has gone on track and yet, you've upped your restructuring guidance, it looks like about $20 million for the back half of the year. And you said that you've incorporated a more conservative outlook because you didn't get the bounce-back from weather that you had thought and yet, your guidance didn't change. So you put all of that stuff into the hopper. And what it seems to suggest to me is that the overall basket of opportunity of savings and benefits from these acquisitions is maybe bigger today than -- as we look out, than maybe what we had","[Audio Gap]","And I was curious if you could sort of frame your commentary around that. Have you encountered, as you've gotten deeper into these integrations, more things that have sort of reinforced the value of these acquisitions in your mind?","Frank H. Boykin","So Stephen, I would say, the increase in restructuring that you saw in the second half is really some activities that we maybe pulled out of next year and put into this year in terms of restructuring for these acquisitions. It really doesn't change in terms of our savings, synergies et cetera that we thought we would have at the beginning of the process and where we are right now. If you looked at the total number, I'd say the total hasn't changed, the parts and pieces probably have. We never end up with what we start out thinking. But we -- I would say that in terms of the total numbers that we talked about a year ago that those haven't changed.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So what I'm hearing you say, then, is that since you've upped your restructuring charge guidance for the back half of the year and since the environment overall has weakened a little bit, you didn't get the snap back from weather and yet your guidance remains the same. Really, what it sounds like is we should be thinking that you are pulling -- you've pulled some earnings out of next year and into this year. Is that what I'm hearing?","Frank H. Boykin","No. No, no, we didn't do that. We didn't pull earnings out of next year and put them into this year. We're just -- we're moving more quickly on some of the activities.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's fine. The other question that I had relates to your wood flooring. You talked a fair amount about it, about price increases going in to offset the material cost inflation, et cetera. I was curious if you could talk a little bit about the difference between the solid and the engineered wood flooring. Generally, if there's a significant difference in what has been the dynamics that have been occurring between those 2, in your view. And if you can help us understand to what degree your U.S. wood flooring business relates or has synergies with -- to your European flooring business.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Let's see. The European and U.S. flooring businesses, I mean, other than having best practices that you'd put between them, I mean, it's not anything alike. In the European business, we have a small market share. We're focused on the engineered wood. We've been making it in Malaysia and using the Malaysian plant to satisfy the European market, the Asian market and the Australian market. We have purchased a new plant that will make products similar in Eastern Europe and that's going to enable us to expand the business. But we still own very limited share and it's a niche position, and we tend to focus on the mid- to high-end part and we're using our brand to create a premium position within it. In the U.S. business, we have a different strategy, which is made up of an engineered business as well as a solid business. We participate in the breadth of the marketplace in both categories from high to low. And the marketplace is significantly different than it is in Europe.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And the trends that you've seen in the U.S. between engineered and solid, is there anything important to talk about there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The -- our business is increasing in both. The solid business tends to be a higher percentage in the new construction business. The raw material costs affect the solid business more. So what happens is you've had a spread of the prices between similar products, and solid and engineered has gotten larger and so it costs more. Over time, it should impact the market share of those because you have to pay a higher price for a similar product as you go through. We think the wood business is -- in flooring, is perceived as one of the aspirational purchases. We think it's got a nice position within the marketplace. However, you're also seeing various alternatives in the ceramic business. The fastest-growing part of it is ceramic planks that look like wood, and it's growing dramatically as you go through. So that's a relative new competitor to it. You have LVT in a marketplace that's getting bigger. It's becoming a competitor to people who want that visual look. And then you have laminate that's been there for a long period of time. So there's a lot of options that are going to play out over the next few years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eli Hackel from Goldman Sachs.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jeff, I know you talked a little bit before about expecting the U.S. to improve. Maybe just from a high level, what's your view, just broadly, on the U.S. consumer? It's sort of an open-ended question, but if you could talk about high-end consumer versus low-end or however you'd want to characterize it. Just curious sort of your top-down view of what the U.S. consumer looks like?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I guess we're surprised from our category that there hasn't been a larger rebound in the remodeling business. We would have thought as the -- historically, as the consumer gets more confident, they start spending more money on their home. And we just haven't seen the rebound because it -- we have seen it, but not to the extent that we would have. The new home business, we're all looking at the same numbers. And I guess we were surprised that the new home sales, the building, relative to what it was, we thought it would be higher than it is. And the question is, is it a momentary thing or is it going to reverse it? The one thing we're sure of is the long-term needs for new homes is much higher than it is today and, at some point, it's going to have to equalize. Another part of it is the young adults that are coming into the marketplace, they have this overhang of debt that earlier generations didn't have from their education and it may be causing them to postpone what they did into a future point. And then overlaying on top of it is a lot of young people that have gone through this recession and you don't really understand how it's going to change what they purchase and now they act in the future. So there's a lot of variables going on and we'll all get to see how they play out.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one follow-up, Frank. What's the impact of currency in your guidance for the second half of the year?","Frank H. Boykin","I don't have that here in front of me, Eli. Let me get it to you after the call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Two things. First of all, the stepped up CapEx -- and I think it stepped up last year and it's stepping up significantly again this year. Can you just talk a little bit about how you think about the payback within that and the impact on returns from those efforts.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Absolutely. One part is the payback has to do with the acquisitions. Upgrading those and integrating them into the business is a portion of it. And then the second piece is that we're -- some of our categories, we're anticipating longer-term growth. And so we're investing in new piece -- new equipment to satisfy that, such as the new plant in Tennessee we're putting up. We've put new lines in Georgia. We've put a new ceramic line in Russia. And so part of it's getting -- to have enough capacity and supply the demand that we see. And then the last part of it is all around taking existing equipment and replacing it with new technology that's better than the old technology, which all gives payback. The paybacks could be anywhere from 2 years to 5 years, depending upon which category it is and what it is. In addition, we have -- like going into the -- LVT is a new business. So that's about $50 million that's going into it this year to get -- to go on a new product category.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","The benefit from this, when you look back a couple of years from now, is this a meaningful benefit in terms of incremental revenues and incremental opportunities on margin? Or is this things you have to do to sustain where you are?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We're expecting them to have a positive impact. Part of the reason the margins are growing this year as you see them is the investments we made last year and the year before.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, that's helpful. And then the second question just relates to how market share is evolving in flooring. And you spoke to this a little bit with engineered floors. But as you look at the carpet business and your laminate business relative to what's gone on with engineered and with LVT, how do you think about how the landscape is changing with your portfolio and its market position relative to where the market's evolving?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","If you look over the entire flooring category, my expectation is that flooring will grow faster than GDP over the next couple of years. In those pieces, as you look at the segment, I would believe that ceramic would be higher than the average. I have laminate and carpet being lower than the average. LVT is a new category, so it's coming from a low base. So it should continue growing because the base is relatively low. And then wood, you have to -- wood depends a little bit on price versus unit. There's been a huge inflation in wood due to the raw materials. So a large part of the wood growth is in price inflation, so if you take that out, I would guess it would be somewhere in the middle.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And those are probably similar answers, except for LVT, to the last couple of years. Is the intensity of any of those materially different?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think the trend is just continuing as they've been.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I guess, first of all, in the commercial business. You talked about order growth, both in carpet and ceramic. Is there any chance to getting you to quantify that order growth heading into the second half?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","No.","Frank H. Boykin","We don't give that out.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Is the commercial business kind of where you want it to be as a percentage or as a proportion of your overall enterprise today?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We don't really look at it as a percent of the enterprise. What we look at is how we'd maximize each channel that we're in. And we don't have a limitation that says this one needs to be X versus the other one.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","So as you stack up those priorities and you look the marginal efficiency of investment in each, does current -- does the commercial business, how does it compare versus residential in terms of incremental investment?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Incremental investment. A large part of the -- I have to answer it 2 ways. In some cases, a large part of the assets can be utilized in either\/or and then some of the assets are unique to commercial because in some cases there are some differences. So like the plant we're getting ready to put up in Tennessee, some of those assets will be focused on driving commercial business, which is made out of a different body formula than the other so it has some different pieces in them. In some cases, there's some cuts in [ph] technologies that are different but then when you move away from that, there's a huge part of the asset that can flip between either\/or as the demand is needed.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Maybe I can take that up with you offline. And the follow-up question I had was really back to the conversation around LVT. And it just seems as though this quarter, you saw strength in LVT, your laminate business was down. As we talked to channel contacts, it seems like that's happening across the industry, where laminate is becoming a bit of a victim for growth in LVT as a substitution effect plays out. I guess, just longer term, do you feel you can grow your LVT business fast enough to offset any potential deterioration in laminate from that substitution?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","They're not all substitutable. If you look at the average price of laminate versus the average price of LVT, they're really at 2 different price points. LVT is much more expensive. LVT also has a -- probably a large portion of it is going to end up in the commercial business, which a very limited portion of laminate ends up in the commercial business as we go through. So they're not exactly -- the products aren't substitutable, one for the other. I think that LVT is going to take and impact a little bit of a lot of things. I think it's going to impact laminate -- the higher-end laminate piece somewhat. It's going to impact some carpet in some instances where it's substituted for. It may end up as a piece for ceramic but again, the value proposition in each one of these things are different. But if you just look at the total market, I think it's going to take bits and pieces from all of them, including wood.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baugh from Stifel.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Just real quick, because this is dragging. Russia, I haven't done my channel checks yet, but what are you thinking about second half of the year there? What are you assuming? Are you assuming negative sales and\/or profits or continued sales and profits? And any way to think about the risk or exposure there if the recession really does hit?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We're thinking that the Russian economy is going to slow further, that the ceramic business is going to decline. That we're going to attempt to take market share in it, and our percentage margins will go down as we do that.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And so that would translate to an overall profit number second half year-over-year in Russia, flat, negative?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think that we'd probably end up, on a margin piece, maybe flat, given that we're trying to push that up. And then the translation, your guess is as good as mine, I have no idea where the ruble is going to go.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Zener from KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You touched -- you mentioned the ABI index which is -- well, it can be a very vague indicator for demand. Can you give us a little flavor for what you're seeing in the domestic commercial market, which I believe for you guys, obviously, in the tile piece there is newbuild [ph] the carpet, specifically, is more retrofit. So is it that you're seeing growth because you're gaining share, which it certainly sounds like given your product innovation? And could you also give us a sense of what you're seeing in the end market and how much that's driven by the products you're replacing being just worn out? Is it style, discretionary purchase? Just give us a little feel for that commercial channel, please.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We're in the commercial -- when we talk about commercial, I have a ceramic business and a carpet business that are all going into the channels in different ways. They tend to go into different places. My ceramic business has been increasing. We have a competitive advantage with the breadth of our offering and thesis as we go through our styling and design. And we've been growing that relative to the marketplace. We believe we can continue growing it. We have some advantages of owning higher ceramic that makes unique things in Italy and in China, that we bring in to support that as we go through to give a much broader offering. The carpet business, we have been lagging as we've changed our entire product line to go through and have a different raw material strategy within it. We think we're at the end of it and we're expecting our business to grow in it. As we look forward, the inputs we're getting back and what we're seeing, we're hopeful that there will be an improvement in it going forward. But again, our view forward is still limited.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just to finish off, you talked about improvement a lot in this call in the second half of the year. Are you seeing any improvement here in July, as carpet or any of the business orders pick up from the trend you saw in the second?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We have -- in the second quarter, we have 2 things. One is, we started out that we thought -- we had a more optimistic view of what was going to occur, which didn't. On the other hand, it did improve seasonality and continues to improve seasonality-wise. It's hard to read the pieces because there's a lot of -- from week-to-week, it's not a straight line and it makes it harder to read on a short-term basis. The indications we have, we believe that ours will be better.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Presenters, I turn the call back to you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We appreciate you joining us. We think we have a strong management team and the right strategy to run our business for the long term. And we are optimistic that the second half will be better and continue to be that way. We appreciate you joining us. Have a nice day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Mohawk Industries quarterly investor conference call. Today, we'll update you on the company's results for the third quarter of 2015 and provide guidance for the fourth quarter.","I'd like to remind everyone, that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers.

Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Frank. We delivered another excellent quarter as our adjusted earnings per share rose 22% to $2.98, the highest quarterly adjusted EPS in the company's history. Our net sales were up 8% or 15% on a constant exchange rate. Our adjusted quarterly operating income also reached a record level at $309 million, up 30% over the same quarter last year.","All segments contributed to our sales and income improvement. Our new segment structure that we announced last quarter has benefited our performance, enabling us to optimize our regional businesses by enhancing our product offerings, manufacturing assets and distribution strategies.","During the period, we made significant progress in aligning our IVC acquisition with our European and U.S. flooring businesses and our KAI acquisition with our Italian ceramic operations.","The business strategies of these acquisitions are coordinated with our existing businesses and we are beginning to execute best practices across each segment. We're introducing products to take advantage of the unique capabilities and customer relationships of each organization. Earnings for IVC and KAI acquisitions were in line with our expectations for the third quarter. As we leverage the strength of these businesses, we anticipate greater market penetration and continued earnings growth in the future.","After a flat first quarter, the U.S. economy grew in the second and third period. In late October, the National Association of Home Builders reported that builder sentiment rose to its highest level in a decade bolstered by an 11% year-to-date increase in family, single-family construction.","Also in October Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced initiatives designed to help lenders make loans more accessible to potential home buyers. Harvard's LIRA index projects home improvement spending will gain momentum in the fourth quarter with homeowners investing more discretionary remodeling projects.","Improved employment and lower gasoline prices have kept consumer confidence high and should support remodeling investments. Commercial spending is forecast to continuing growing with hospitality, office and recreation sectors leading the category.","Mexico's economy is benefiting from low unemployment and strong consumer activity, with new residential and commercial construction driving ceramic sales growth.","The European Central Bank has expressed a willingness to further reduce interest rates and expand its quantitative easing program to accelerate economic growth.","The Russian economy is in a recession and most believe it will continue to face headwinds through the end of 2016.","I'll now review the third quarter performance of our three segments. Our Global Ceramic segment sales were up 2% as reported. On a local basis, sales grew 11% and adjusted operating income rose 15%, with adjusted margins increasing to 15%. As a result of improved productivity, volume, price-mix and the KAI acquisition, partially offset by currency headwinds.","During the period, our U.S. ceramic sales continued to improve, with residential outpacing commercial. Sales grew across all channels, as we increased our investments in new products, additional sales representatives, and new service centers and galleries.","The residential new construction sector remains the strongest part of our U.S. ceramic business. We continue to gain commitment from major regional builders, as a result of innovative products, which elevate home values. Wall tile sales have performed exceptionally well, as decorating trends and our fashionable designs are expanding wall tile into new areas of today's homes.","In residential remodeling, ceramic sales will continue their positive growth, while hospitality and retail remain our strongest commercial sectors.","Placement of new sample displays in major retail groups is increasing our position in this channel. And new commitments by our independent distributors are strengthening our market position. Home centers continue to see ceramic as a growth category and we're gaining commitments with our unique coordinated floor and wall tile collections.","To satisfy increased demand in the U.S. market, we've begun importing ceramic tile from both our Russian and Bulgarian businesses, leveraging our global footprint to optimize our profitability. Construction in our new Tennessee plant is well underway, and equipment is now being installed.","Productivity, material enhancements and yields are improving our costs in our existing manufacturing plants. We've also implemented several initiatives in our service centers to improve the customer service experience and move toward paperless transactions.","Growth in the Mexican ceramic market remains strong, as we improved our position and we are adding new sales representatives to increase our market penetration. We continue to expand our distribution base and increase our participation in home centers, residential construction and commercial channels.","Our new products in larger sizes with wood, stone and brick visuals are enhancing our market position and improving our margins. Geographically, we are in a stronger position with our recent acquisition in western Mexico, combined with our existing facilities in northern and central regions of the country.","In Europe, our ceramic sales are outpacing the market. We are enhancing our product mix with larger sizes, longer planks and outdoor tile. We're benefiting from upgrading our assets at our manufacturing facilities, which are increasing our competitiveness and yielding more differentiated products such as, three-dimensional wall tile, hexagons and brick visuals.","We completed phase one of these investments during the period and will finalize the second phase in the second quarter of next year. We're planning additional enhancements to our capabilities following the completion of these two phases. Our service should improve as we gain additional capacity to satisfy growing demand.","Our new wall tile collection has received the 2015 Design Award in Italy, reflecting our position as Europe's ceramic design leader. We continue to gain share in Western Europe as well as surrounding markets by expanding our customer base with multiple brands and increasing our participation in commercial projects.","Our new Bulgarian ceramic business is increasing its product mix, improving its manufacturing and expanding sales outside the local market. New capacity has recently been installed to produce larger sizes and embossed wood planks. We have seen increasing competition at opening price points as the European exports to Russia have declined.","Though Russia is in a recession, we are increasing our share in the ceramic market. During the period our sales grew on a local basis though our margins contracted as inflation outpaced price increases. As imports substantially decline we are improving our mix with gains in the high-end of the market. To further support our leadership in the premium market we are installing a new production line next year to increase our porcelain capacity to produce higher value commercial products historically purchased from Europe.","During this period we increased our investments in sales personnel to expand our DIY, specialty retail and commercial businesses. We opened seven new franchise stores during the quarter and we're investing more in marketing to grow our sales. Our Russian comparisons in the next two quarters will be very difficult due to consumers pulling forward purchases as inflation dramatically increased last year.","Our Flooring North America segment, sales were up 8% over last year with adjusted operating income increasing 41% over the prior year. The adjusted operating margins increased almost 14%, due to improved volume, productivity, input cost and the IVC acquisition, partially offset by price and mix.","The new structure of our North American carpet and hard surface businesses is improving our performance as we leverage the strength of our brands, marketing strategies and consumer relationships over all categories. During the period, we invested \u2013 we increased our investments in sales personnel, marketing and promotions in both carpet and hard surface categories to enhance our position. We anticipate these investments will improve our results by expanding our market penetration and enhancing our product mix.","Our carpet business continued its margin improvement from productivity and lower input costs, offset by price mix and additional sales investments. We are beginning to see improved margins from our recent product introductions and the expansion of our Karastan branded customer base.","Our builder channel is growing significantly, and we are improving our position in the home center channel. We are expanding our SmartStrand Forever Clean collections with new tonal flecks and fleck visuals. The popularity of our polyester carpets continues to grow. The superior stain resistance and softness of our Continuum polyester products are helping us capture sales in this category.","Our commercial margins are continuing to expand with the introduction of more stylized products, improved manufacturing efficiencies and enhanced service. We continue to revise our product offering to reduce manufacturing complexity and eliminate underperforming SKUs.","Our new plank carpet tiles are gaining acceptance in the A&D community and our award winning collection from NeoCon are now entering the market.","We're gaining momentum with large national accounts, and we're expanding our integrated installation services for large projects. We're increasing the specialization of our sales force by sector, and enhancing our training so that our sales professionals deliver superior solutions to satisfy our customers' needs. We're improving our efficiency and reducing our cost by closing two commercial plants and consolidating the operations.","Our rug sales and margins were up during the period as our new product introductions gained traction in the marketplace. Our focus on new fiber innovation is differentiating our offering and improving our mix, we have extended our line with a new exterior mat collection that has been well accepted in the marketplace.","Sales of our hard-surface products are growing faster than carpet across all channels, with builder and commercial sectors expanding the fastest. We're seeing margin improvement in all categories driven by higher volume, productivity and cost saving. We're investing in new product samples and sales personnel to further expand our participation in all facets of the marketplace.","Our recent laminate introductions are creating a new high-end category with deeper structures, more sophisticated visuals and unique water resistant technology. Wood remains the aspirational purchase for most consumers and our solid wood collections appeal to builders, while our engineered wood products have become a desirable remodeling choice.","IVCs management team is now guiding our U.S. vinyl product strategy and leveraging our customer relationships and logistics expertise. Our sheet vinyl and LVT sales continue to grow, and we're introducing new Mohawk branded products from IVC to expand our vinyl offering in all channels.","Our LVT growth has been limited by our manufacturing capacity. However production at our new U.S. plant continues to increase as we refine the processes of the world's largest LVT plant. We expect significant improvement in our cost over the next 12 months as we implement equipment modifications and process enhancements to increase our production.","We continue to increase the productivity of all of our manufacturing assets, improving our efficiency yields and quality. Material costs are benefiting our margins, partially offset by lower price mix and other inflation.","We continue to optimize our raw materials through reengineering our formulations and increasing our recycling. Our enhanced logistics systems are improving service to our customers, as well as the return on our investments.","For the period, our Flooring Rest of the World segment sales rose 24% as reported or 41% on a constant exchange rate with adjusted operating income improving 48% over the prior year. The adjusted operating margin increased almost 16% due to improved volume, input cost and the IVC acquisition, partially offset by significant currency headwinds.","Our laminate sales increased during the period and we have realigned our sales and product strategies to optimize our brand. Quick-Step and Pergo will be focused on the premium high-end laminate with differentiated features. Balterio, the laminate brand from IVC, will focus on stylized products customized for specific retailers. We will maintain separate sales and product development organizations to satisfy different customer needs across all channels.","Our premium laminate brands continue to benefit from deeper, more natural structures and bevels that yield more realistic visuals. We've also added water resistant technology that's unique in the marketplace and expands applications for laminate into additional areas.","Our current premium product collection is one of the most successful ever due to its unique features and performance benefits. Sales of our stylized collections are also growing and we're introducing collections with our new digital technology to differentiate our products.","During the quarter, our laminate sales were strong in Eastern Europe, Russia, Australia and New Zealand. To increase our Balterio brand sales in the Russian market, we're moving products formerly made in Belgium to our Russian manufacturing facility of laminate.","Our wood sales increased during the period but were constrained by supply limitation. Our margins were up, as we improved our mix and lowered our cost.","Continued cost savings from production in our Malaysian and Czech plants as well as favorable exchange rate positively impacted our margins. We continue to benefit from the 2014 acquisition of the Czech manufacturing plant, which we have upgraded and expanded. Our mix and average selling price improved, as we marketed wood collections under our premium brands and introduced differentiated surfaces, including matte finishes, rustic visuals and reclaimed looks.","Our vinyl business also improved with significant growth in LVT. As with laminate, we are marketing two brands focused on different channels to maximize our distribution in the marketplace. Our new LVT plant in Belgium is producing high quality product with unique features and is increasing production to satisfy the growing demand. New equipment will be installed in the plant by the end of the year to increase our capacity further.","Our European LVT start-up is doing well and additional material supply will be installed next year to reach the planned capacity. We're introducing new LVT sizes with embossing, enhanced scratch resistance and superior click installation system to add more value and participate in the commercial sector.","Our product mix within the IVC Moduleo brand is improving from higher value products with embossed and registered designs. Our Russian sheet vinyl business declined. We increased sales in other geographies to utilize our capacity.","Our non-flooring product categories in the segment are up slightly with improving margins due to some relief in material costs. We continue to see significant growth in our insulation panel business which delivered improved margins from higher volumes and lower costs, partially offset by selling prices. One of our chipboard lines experienced an unplanned stop and will be down for four weeks, impacting operating income by approximately $3 million to $4 million in our fourth quarter.","I'll now return the call over to Frank, to review our financial performance for the period.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $2.151 billion, up 8% as reported or 15% higher on a constant exchange rate basis, with the legacy business growing 6%. Foreign exchange reduced sales $131 million compared to last year. All segments grew over last year on a constant exchange rate basis. During the quarter growth was driven by acquisitions and improving volume, as well as mix, partially offset by lower pricing in carpet and vinyl. Our gross margin as reported was 30.8%. Excluding charges, the margin was 31.4%, up 310 basis points from last year. This was driven by volume, productivity gains and lower raw materials, partially offset by price, mix and currency.","SG&A, as reported, was $373 million, this represented 17.3% of net sales. Excluding charges, SG&A was 17.1% of net sales, up 70 basis points from last year due to investments expanding our sales force, increasing sampling and raising our merchandising.","Unusual charges for the quarter were $20 million, with approximately $15 million associated with the IVC and KAI acquisitions. About three-fourths of the $15 million was from purchase accounting and acquisition cost with the balance related to integration. The remaining $5 million of the unusual charges was for continuing integration of our Spano acquisition.","The operating income excluding charges was $309 million or 14.4% of sales. The margin grew by 250 basis points and operating income would have been $21 million higher using a constant exchange rate.","Interest expense for the quarter was $19 million, which compares to $35 million a year ago. It was down this year primarily due to the redemption premium paid last year, when $254 million of our 2016 bonds were redeemed. Implementation of the CP program, our commercial paper program, this year also resulted in lower rates.","Other expense was $5 million, and it was unfavorable $7 million versus last year, due to foreign exchange.","The income tax rate for the quarter was 22% this year and that compares to 19% last year. We estimate a full year tax rate this year of 22% to 23%, and we estimate next year's full year tax rate of 25% to 26%. Geographic mix and lower interest deductions will pressure our 2016 tax rate.","Earnings per share excluding charges, was $2.98 and is a new quarterly record for Mohawk representing an increase of 22% over last year. Weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter are estimated to be 74.5 million. Our estimate for 2016 outstanding shares will be 74.8 million for the full year.","We jump to the segments, in the Global Ceramic segment, sales were $792 million, up 2% as reported or 11% on a constant exchange rate basis with the legacy business improving 8%. Foreign exchange reduced sales $76 million compared to last year. We had strong volume growth in the North American and European regions with Russian volumes slightly down but price up significantly to offset inflation.","Our operating income excluding charges was $121 million or 15.3% of sales. The margin expanded 180 basis points, and operating income would have been $13 million higher, using a constant exchange rate, higher investment in selling and marketing to drive future sales was offset by volume growth, productivity and price mix.","In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $955 million, increasing 8% over last year, with our legacy business up 4% over last year. This was driven by strong hard surface and rug business sales, partially offset by unfavorable price and mix.","Operating income, excluding charges was $133 million or 13.9% of sales, up 330 basis points, driven by productivity, raw materials and the IVC acquisition partially offset again by price mix and our SG&A investments.","In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales were $404 million, growing 24% over last year, or 41% on a constant exchange rate basis, with our legacy business up 6%. Foreign currency reduced sales $55 million in this segment compared to last year. The IVC acquisition was the biggest driver of growth with laminate and wood also turning in strong performances.","Operating income excluding charges was $64 million or 15.9% of sales with the margin up 260 basis points, and it would have been \u2013 operating income would have been $9 million higher, using a constant exchange rate. The improvement here was driven by volume, raw materials and the IVC acquisition, partially offset by currency. In the corporate and eliminations segment, our operating loss excluding charges was $9 million, and we are expecting approximately $35 million for the full year in this segment.","Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, our receivables were $1.3 billion. This reflects days sales outstanding at 54 days, up slightly from changes in channel mix. Inventories ended the quarter at a $1.621 billion, the days improved to 105 days, from 113 days last year. This improvement was impacted by acquisitions and better inventory management.","Fixed assets for the quarter ended up at $3.046 billion, and includes CapEx of $124 million with depreciation and amortization of $95 million for the quarter. We are estimating CapEx for the full year this year to be approximately $530 million as we invest back into the business to support volume growth and improved productivity.","And then finally, total long-term debt ended the quarter at $3.2 billion with a 2.3 times debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio. We expect the leverage to improve to about 2 times by the end of the year.","Jeff, I'll hand it back over to you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Frank. Mohawk's performance benefited from strategic acquisitions, new investments in sales and operations and improved manufacturing logistics. The U.S. residential and commercial flooring markets have improved throughout 2015 with hard surface sales growing faster.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we anticipate the U.S. economy will continue its gradual growth. We expect year-over-year margin growth to continue in all segments, as a result of our strategies and acquisitions. We are selectively increasing our SG&A relative to sales to optimize future market share. Our recent acquisitions are being integrated into our businesses and are positively impacting our earnings.","The costs associated with new plant startups, interruption of our board production and four fewer days will be absorbed in the period. Taking all these factors into account, our guidance for the fourth quarter is $2.66 to $2.75 per share, which will be a 17% to 21% increase over 2014, excluding any restructuring charges.","Our fourth quarter earnings guidance would have been approximately $0.15 per share higher on a constant exchange rate relative to last year. Our view for next year is that the U.S. and European economic growth will remain stable with Russia facing continuing headwinds.","We anticipate each of our segments will expand sales and margins from acquisitions, marketing initiatives and productivity improvement. We will continue higher levels of capital investments to enhance our product offerings, expand our capacity and grow our margins.","Next year our total interest expense should decline $25 million to $30 million with a redemption of our 2016 bonds, rising interest rates and no additional acquisitions. In 2016 we expect that foreign exchange rates will be a headwind and our tax rate will increase to 25% to 26% as our geographic earnings change. Our balance sheet can support significant additional capital investments and acquisitions to further improve our results.","We'll now be glad to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, good morning, everyone. I wonder if you can just talk about what the total benefit of lower input costs amounted to this quarter and what will that benefit increase and will that benefit increase in fourth quarter?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The majority of the difference came in the Flooring North American segment. There was about a $29 million benefit from changes in material costs, labor, SG&A and energy, partially offset by price mix and sales investments.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Can you say what it was in the other two categories, Jeff?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","It was a small number, it was $1 million, I think in one and $1 million or $2 million in the other, David. We'll have it in the Q that comes out later.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Sure. Sure. Okay. That's great. And then just a follow up, what are you assuming in your fourth quarter earnings guidance for FX impact on revenues?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","We're assuming that \u2013 we generally use a FX rate that's close to where we are at the beginning or when we estimate the quarter.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie Securities. Your line is open.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Congratulations on the quarter. Just curious on your comments, there was a lot of commentary in terms of sales investments in ceramics, U.S., Mexico. You mentioned sales personnel in carpet, hard surfaces. Is this a continuation of a strategy or are you now just accelerating these investments because you're seeing the market pick up or if you can just kind of give some of your strategy there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","When we came out of the downturn, I mean we were doing everything possible to reduce our expenses and drive our profit margins up. And then we started expand \u2013 moving from that to investing at a normalized level with the businesses.","In the last quarter or maybe a little before, we started changing that and investing even more. And we've made a decision that instead of lowering the SG&A percentage that we're going to invest more in it in these expanding sales forces, most of which was in the United States. We're investing more in products and merchandising. We're increasing the hard surface sales forces as we've added more vinyl to the group as we go through. In ceramic, we talked about increasing distribution points, design centers to keep pushing those forward.","Our Mexican business is doing well. We're adding sales people in it. In Russia, the market is down, but we're going to go ahead and invest more to take advantage of our position in the marketplace in a declining market.","We estimate in the third quarter that the investment is about $13 million, and we're going to continue investing going forward. The result of that's going to be instead of the SG&A percent going down next year, it's going to end up flat, but it's going to start higher and improve throughout the year.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. Very helpful. And then you'd commented in the past about a 5% to 7% growth rate typical in this market in a recovery. You guys are in that range now, but I'd be curious if you could opine on how much of that growth is kind of coming from your share gains, how much the market is and if you think the market is sustainable at this pace of growth or could pick up?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","My guess is that the flooring industry is probably growing around 4%, maybe closer to 5%, depends on where you go going forward. I don't know \u2013 none of us know exactly where it's going to end up. And then, you have to keep remembering our business is now much bigger than just the U.S. business. So, about a third of it is around the world in different places and the economies are in all different shapes, depending upon where we are, but we're optimizing our positions in the ones that are having trouble as well as the ones that are doing well.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Armstrong from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. My first question is a little bit on M&A, something you've been proven good at. What regions do you see the most potential M&A or the best pipeline at the moment and if the opportunity arose, is there anything preventing you from getting materially bigger in the U.S.?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that we're a very unusual company, that we have the ability to acquire businesses and maintained the businesses that they \u2013 we attract good ones. We can go into new geographies or new product categories and maintain and improve the businesses. So I think we are very well-positioned with that.","That allows us to look at both new geographies and or new products, both within geographies we're in as well as new ones. And we've proven we can do it in all of them. When we look at acquisitions, because of that, we can enhance ones more that are in geographies we're already in, because you can leverage the strength of both businesses. However, by going into new geographies, you'll tend to see us when we go into new places to buy the best businesses, because we're buying the management as much as we're buying the business isn't that (34:10).","And then once we get that, we then take a different strategy of how to expand it either through greenfield or through other acquisitions around it. I think that gives us a very strong platform to grow, and we're really not focused on any particular marketplace.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","And let me just add that given the relative size of our business to the U.S. market, there is more opportunities outside of the U.S.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's completely fair. And then switching gears a little bit, a lot of companies have been talking about labor issues restraining sales growth. Are you seeing any of that in your markets, or do you see any evidence of that yet?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The only thing that I guess you would see is that the homebuilders and some of the remodelers are struggling with getting labor to execute their strategies as much, which then backs up to us. If there's more opportunity, we're not quite getting those. But in our own particular business, we're able to attract talented people, I think that we're perceived as a business that's growing and offering opportunity. So, we don't see much of it in our own businesses.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Collin A. Verron - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, it's actually Collin filling in for Bob. In North America, you had the robust improvement in margins. You noted that part of this improvement was because of productivity improvement. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you're doing on the productivity side and maybe quantify the improvements, and how much room is left to drive productivity?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, the improvements are everywhere. We have a theory in our business. We call it halfway there. And it doesn't matter where we are or how good you've gotten or where you are in the business, even if you've just improved it, there's opportunities to move it further and we drive that through the whole business.","We start in the fall with a plan of developing strategies and pushing it down through the whole organization, the dissatisfaction with where we are. With that, we combine that with we are investing heavily in the business. This year we'll invest about $500 million in the business which allows us to do more with the structure that we have. And in 2016 we are planning to spend even more. The combination of these things are what's allowing the margins to go up in a difficult market.","Collin A. Verron - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks for that color. And then a question on the price and mix side for North America. You noted that there was a negative price mix. Can you give a little bit more color around the drivers, maybe quantify it a little bit. And is any of this related to your giving back price from your lower input costs?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All the businesses are competitive. As the raw materials decline there is some give back of raw materials into the marketplace by us and our competitors. There is more of it in the lower end than the higher end, but it happens everywhere as you go through. I forgot the rest of the question.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","He had asked how much. In the 10-Q, it will show about $20 million of a headwind for price mix for that segment also.","Collin A. Verron - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","A question on the KAI acquisition in terms of the revenue growth, we all have the prior year numbers, but can you give us some sort of feel for how that did in the quarter versus prior year before you bought the business?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","We \u2013 Keith, when we talked about the acquisitions last quarter, we had guided that we thought they'd be accretive $0.20 to $0.25 together, IVC and KAI, and they both together came in at the top end of that range at about $0.25 accretion.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","$0.25? And then, from a revenue perspective, the revenue is a little lighter than I thought, how did that look versus prior year?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We don't break out the sales at the levels below the segments. The KIA business has had some increasing competition in Europe, as I discussed before. As the European ceramic suppliers lost business into the Russian market for example, they tried to push the stuff through the marketplace, so that's affecting some of the opening price points.","On the other hand, with the business between us, we are upgrading their product mix, we're moving them into new categories they have, we're using our relationships to have them sell product outside the local markets they've been in and we see it as a big opportunity going forward. We've just put in some more capacity into place in order to make higher-end products. So, we're well positioned and we think it will help us both within those markets or using that as a low cost supply into other parts of Europe.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And switching to IVC, in their domestic business, I know they had some lower margin sheet vinyl business. Is that something that you'll be able to supplant with something higher margin and has that process begun?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We like the strategy that they have. They have a broad base of business from low, medium to high. They sell based on differentiated products, high service level. We actually make unique products for different customers to differentiate them in the marketplace. We like their strategy, which is why we bought the business, and we're not changing it now.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Two questions for Frank. You have some notes coming due in January 2016. Are you going to be paying those off or just rolling over the financing, Frank?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","We will be paying those off and rolling it into the CP program.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And the other line on the income statement went from an income in the prior year to an expense this year, what was the change?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","That was the currency. I think it went from $2 million of income to $5 million of expense. That's the transactional FX impact on our receivables and payables that are denominated in foreign currencies.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And did \u2013 that's the difference between where you're selling and the cost, is that correct?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","It's the difference between the exchange rate when we enter the transaction and the exchange rate when we settle the transaction.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much, guys. Good quarter. Frank, you had \u2013 actually let's start with Jeff, you had talked about the sales investments, and I think you indicated that you'd be expecting those \u2013 that incremental spend to continue into next year, more weighted in the first half is the sense I got. I was curious if you could talk a little bit about how long it's going to be before you see a significant revenue response from these investments. And then also if any of the investments related to the Ragno repositioning, I didn't hear you mention that, but just wondered if that factored in as well?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, it takes time to get new sales people in the field, to have them develop relationships, to have them start moving product into the marketplace. You get some benefit immediately and you get some later. We have increased the amount of sales people across all the pieces I've already reviewed with you. We are spending more on pushing products into the \u2013 more distribution of our products into the different marketplaces as we go through.","In the residential piece, what you'll see, it probably takes three months to six months to see some of the benefit. In the commercial business it takes much longer, because you have to get into projects and the projects don't get executed, it could be for two years down the road, but we think we're in a good position, and we think it's the right thing to do.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Anything on the \u2013 related to what you're doing over there in Italy in terms of moving more into the higher end, anything associated with that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","the Italian business, when we bought it, was a very \u2013 I mean they were about breaking even maybe, as they were losing a little money. So, we have really been focused on driving the profitability of the business. With that we've been really controlling the cost. We went through \u2013 we're finishing the second phase of replacing the equipment. Each of the investments were about $30 million each. Those investments are allowing us to increase our product mix to bring better products to the marketplace. And as we need it, we will incrementally increase the sales force to go with it.","We use the two brands as we do in every other place, to be able to get greater penetration in the marketplace and it allows us to satisfy one customer on one part of the street and give differentiated products to the other. With that, we also have different product strategies with each and it goes through all of our businesses and it's one of our strengths, managing multiple brands in the same marketplace.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, I guess a second question, sort of very much related to it as you talked about the two phases so far in Marazzi Europe and the putting in the new equipment. By the time the phase two is finished in 1Q 2016, do you expect \u2013 how much do you expect on average your capacity in European ceramic will have increased?","And then just a quick one for Frank. You gave guidance, you reiterated your guidance on tax for the year, but that leads a pretty wide range for the quarter, I would guess that probably you'd be thinking you're coming at the higher end of the range given all the dynamics you're seeing in terms of geographic profitability. Just wanted to see if you could provide a little more color on 4Q specifically. Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On the capacity question, the goal was \u2013 and we've actually done it, is to throw out the equipment one piece at a time and put it in. So we don't interrupt the sales that we can. We get through at the first two phases wasn't to try to increase the capacity, but it will probably be up around 5% plus or minus with the first two phases. And then, we haven't started yet but we think there's going to be third investment right behind it.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But you also get a top-line impact because you increase the sales dollars per unit by selling higher value products. So that's where a lot of it's coming from.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Right. And then the tax rate in Q4 is going to be around 18%.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So thank you very much. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First, just a couple of clarification questions. You mentioned raw materials benefit of $29 million. Was that \u2013 the $29 million was, I think you said, that was concentrated in Flooring North America. But was that all in Flooring North America and there was just some marginal benefits in the other segments. And did that $29 million cover both raw materials and lower energy costs as well?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so the $29 million is a North American segment, and that's input costs, so it includes raw materials, energy cost, labor, et cetera. And that was basically what the $29 million represented. Was that all your question or do you have another part to it?","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, well, I guess, really it would be helpful, I think, most people thought that there would be a very large benefit primarily from raw materials. So if you're thinking about that $29 million, is that more driven by raw materials or kind of equal across the three buckets that you mentioned?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","I'd say, it's more driven by raw materials.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And the pricing giveback that you mentioned, the $20 million, is that something that began to occur this quarter? And you said it was more concentrated in the lower end. On a relative basis, is your mid-to-higher price products holding up a bit better then?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","It's price mix. It's the two things combined, Mike. So, we have a hard time separating the two, but it's both combined. There was pricing pressure last quarter as well that we spoke to on the call as well as mix pressure. The mix pressure is coming from polyester, with lower cost product, that's causing a de-mixing in the industry as well as with ourselves.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","One of the things with polyester, on average it could sell for 10% or more\/less than an equivalent Nylon product. So, as the industry has moved, you've lost a significant amount of top line revenues in the industry going to lower cost products which decreases the revenues of the entire industry.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And just last question, bigger picture going back to your multi-year acquisition strategy. Obviously, a lot of the recent ones have been more focused in Europe, obviously you have some very large positions already in North America, U.S. specifically. As we think out over the next three years to five years, Jeff and Frank, perhaps you could give us an overview of \u2013 from a geographic and or product perspective, where does the most opportunity lie, particularly from a geographic perspective, is it still in Europe or are you looking to other major regions across the world as well as from a product perspective?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure. I agree with the first premise that says that most of what we're doing is in Europe. If you recall, Marazzi was the number two provider of ceramic manufacturing in the U.S. Pergo had the biggest part of their business in the U.S. for instance. So as we do the acquisitions of larger businesses, most of them have pieces. IVC was a very large participant in the U.S. vinyl business.","So it hasn't been as one-sided even though what's happened is the offices of these companies were not in the United States but they all had big positions in the United States. As we look forward to the piece, we really are not geographic-dependent on the decisions. The question is does the business fit our strategy, does the price we pay give us the returns we want, and what's the long-term value it adds and consistency of the business and what can we do with it and it could be anywhere.","However, there are certain areas of the world that it's difficult for U.S. players to play in, meaning they don't play by the same rules we do. And so areas where they don't play by the same rules, some of the things that happen is local companies in our industry don't pay taxes properly, and we do, so we try to stay away from things where there is something inherent about giving us a less than competitive position in the world, so that's a major part of the considerations when we think about different companies.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","One real last quick one for Frank, Frank, corporate expense for next year, you said $35 million for 2015, can you give us a sense directionally or rough range for next year?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","It'd be about the same.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks again.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Jeff, on the IVC acquisition, your contribution's coming in at the high end of guidance and if you look at what's left to be done, could you talk about what needs to be done to maximize contribution and maybe help us quantify how much more upside there is to those numbers and how long it takes you with that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","IVC was a very well run low cost business. And they had a very defined strategy, which they executed well. The biggest opportunities are to leverage the other relationships we have in the rest of the business to broaden the distribution of their products to continue with adding design capability to the business and expanding the distribution of the businesses. There are opportunities with best practices that we learned from them and they learned from us as we go through.","We have the \u2013 they had invested \u2013 started the investment in a new LVT plant in the United States that's just coming up. So filling up the plant in the United States. They are helping us dramatically speed up the progress of the LVT plant we have in Europe that we were building coming up. And then the question is, are there other geographies or other places to move into LVT and vinyl now that we have a core competence within it and the opportunities as we consider every other product category we have.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay. So it sounds like from a cost perspective, you all are there, it's just how much of the IVC product you can really lever because of your organization then...?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There is not a lot of cost take out in this business.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Okay. And then following on the two LVT plants, what type of start-up costs do we have in third quarter, what do you all think happens in the fourth quarter and then I guess next year, how long does it take you to get to \"full capacity\" for those two?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Well, the startup costs in Q3 were about $8 million and it will be close to that in the fourth quarter. That's startup for \u2013 not just LVT, but for everything that we're doing, the major projects that we're doing.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And then the \u2013 going through, it's going to take most of next year to get the two LVT plants up where we want them, there was unique technologies that have never been done before, there were things put in them that \u2013 to push the limits of the technology. And some of those things to actually optimize them we're going to have to replace and sometimes the equipment can take six months or more just to get, once you decide what you want to do, to execute it. So it will take us throughout most of next year to get the plant capacity up to the level we want in both of them.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay. All right. Thanks. And the last question I had was \u2013 Jeff, on the North American flooring it looks like your core growth was about 3.5%, 4%. You all have gone to this new structure, could you help us out, how much do you think was the organic demand that was going on in the market versus the new structure and as you move, as this structure gets embedded over the next three months, six months, nine months, would that provide any tangible, meaningful incremental growth to this business?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think what it's going to do is help us in multiple different ways. One is, it's going to help us broaden the distribution of all the pieces. So, by putting them all together, you have the same management sitting on top, that's trying to figure out, how to use the relationships between all the different pieces and drive it. How to use the operational excellence and ideas we have across the business as you go through. How to use the distribution structures as we go through.","The combination of all these things, there's a lot of overlap in these hard surfaces, because we have the direct sales forces all reported to the old segment. Now by having them together is one of the reasons we're expanding the sales organizations even more, to push the products through the marketplace as well. It's also going to help us focus on the independent distributors, and bring them more unique products, differentiate them more and expand our distribution there. And then you have just the best practices across the pieces of sharing resources. So, longer-term, they are all incremental pieces, you're not going to see it as one big lump anywhere.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Thank you, this is actually Matt (56:24) on for Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. So first, just following up on the earlier questions on lower pricing and the sales investments in the carpet category. Assuming no change to input cost, would you say that what we saw in the third quarter would be in line with what we should expect going forward or would there be risk to kind of incremental promotional activity from here?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","First of all, remember that we're highly seasonal from quarter-to-quarter, and you can't take one quarter's margin and apply it to the year. So, what we've said is that the margin improvement that we've had, we expect to see continued margin improvement year-over-year, but that doesn't mean that the same margin in the third quarter is the annual margin as we go through.","Our expectations are that next year you will continue to see improved margins and improved sales from all the investments and strategies we're putting together. We've spent a lot of time differentiating the products and new innovations that we bring into the marketplace. And I think that our service and quality continues to improve. But I think that we're improving our position in the market.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Understood. Thank you. And then just on the organic growth in Flooring North America. You delivered pretty healthy growth in the legacy business. So understanding that you don't disclose the actual results under the old structure. But just wondering if you could break down the relative performance of the carpet and laminate, wood categories. Just to help us kind of better understand the sources of that growth? Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The Flooring North American sales were up about 4% on a comparable basis. The carpet grew the slowest, and remember that polyesters reducing the average selling price offsetting some of the top-line within it. Our rugs and hard surfaces are growing faster than carpet for \u2013 the industry is growing faster and our categories are growing faster. And then with the new IVC, we're putting in new products in our different brands as we go through. And we expect our vinyl sales to increase and fill up the new plant we're just building.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Josh (58:55) filling in for Sam. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to clarify on that last answer, your carpet business did grow or can you give us a sense of how it performed relative to the industry?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The industry numbers that we have, we think were about flat, with the residential lower and the commercial higher. And our business, our residential business was probably similar. And in the commercial, we said, we have been changing the product line, so we're dropping a higher level of products replacing them, but we're getting huge benefits in the cost and margins.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. And do you have any outlook or color you can give us on industry pricing over the next couple of quarters within carpet?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The carpet industry is competitive. There have been, like you would expect, more pressure on the commodity products than the other, with the raw materials coming down, we've given some of it back. And we'll continue to react to the market and hold our positions.","Unknown Speaker","And last one from me, could you give us a feel of what some of the puts and takes were on the ceramic margin sequentially \u2013 why it was down a little bit on somewhat similar sales?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I mean, it's hard to compare the margin sequentially, because you got seasonality. So, for example, you've got the European business in the ceramic segment, and that's going to be slower in the third quarter than it is in second quarter. I mean, what we try to look at is how the margins improved compared to where they were a year ago.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. Congratulations on the quarter, and good luck with the next one.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","Hey, Frank. Just a quick one to follow-up on the North American growth. If carpet was flattish, does that imply that the other categories, primarily laminate, wood were up high-single, double-digits in the quarter?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Laminate, wood, vinyl, everything else we sell.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","And the leading areas within the channel, I guess, if that's as strong as high single-digit, low double-digit, where are you seeing the strongest growth channel-wise?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","I think that our business is doing reasonably well in all the channels. I don't think one of them is different.","Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you, and now good afternoon. Listening to all the activities in Q3, it sounds like you gave the whole management team vacation in the last quarter, Jeff. I was going to ask three different questions, but now your stock's off $11, I am presuming on this fear that your carpet margins are collapsing because you're giving back pricing. Could you perhaps clarify a little bit for folks on the line here that first of all not all your raw materials in carpet are virgin chemicals, and talk about the recycled content and corn. And perhaps address what I think is a misperception, that your carpet margins are down in the third quarter and or going to be down in the future. Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, I think the clarification on oil is that in our carpet business, a large part of the materials are from oil. But over time, we've developed two large categories, which are significant to our business. One is recycled polyester, which the majority of our polyester comes from recycled bottles, which doesn't follow exactly the oil prices. The second is that we have our SmartStrand category, which comes from corn, which also follows different ones. Now, they're related in some ways and not related, but they are not directly related.","The second is that, besides the improvement in the raw materials, the investments we're making, we're getting huge productivity improvements across the business. And then, we spend a huge amount of effort differentiating our products and bringing new products into the marketplace to improve our mix, relative to the marketplace.","Now with that, we have been selling more of the lower priced pieces as something but we still have a much higher mix than the industry average, because of all the merchandising and marketing we do. We are confident that we're going to continue improving our profitability in the business going forward. However, we're going to have to react to market pressures just as in every other category, because we think that we're investing significantly more than most of the industry, and we think we're executing better. So we're quite confident about the direction that we're going and where we're positioned.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","And just to clarify, John, one more time, the soft surface margins have shown improvement year-over-year.","John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And I think your comment was that you expected that to continue into 2016, correct?","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Expecting our margins in each of our three segments to continue in fourth quarter and then through 2016.","John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And then, just as a follow-up, could you comment maybe on your intensity, your appetite for acquisitions. If you're going to be close to two times leverage here by the end of the year, that's kind of been historically a trigger point. And then maybe, Frank, a comment on roughly where free cash flow annualized is running? Thank you, and good luck.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've done a lot of acquisitions in the last two years or three years. We've done significant ones this year. Even with that we generate a huge amount of cash as well as our EBITDA is going up, both paying down debt and increasing our capacity. With those things, we have the balance sheet to invest significantly more in internal capital as well as acquisitions if we find the right businesses at the right values. And we're aggressively looking for those things. However, we're only going to do it if we like the returns on the investment and the risk levels.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","And on the free cash flow question, John, the third quarter was about $265 million and for the year we'd estimate it'd be $530 million or $540 million, in that range.","John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good luck.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phillip Lewis with Security Capital Brothers (sic) [Security Capital Brokerage]. Your line is open.","Phillip A. Lewis - Security Captial Brokerage, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys, and congratulations on the quarter. Just quick, just to clarify, the emphasis on hiring the new specialized sales folks. Is that going to be across all the channels?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have different sales forces going into different channels, each of the businesses is different. So, I mean in my carpet business, I have multiple sales forces selling carpet into specialty retail. I have specialized sales forces going into the builder and multi-family channel, I have multiple specialized business sales forces going into the commercial business, and in all those things, I have similar variations of that in the other businesses. We are increasing the sales forces in all of them, positioning ourselves to be more aggressive than we have in the past. We're confident about our position and products we're bringing to market, and we believe that we can help our growth and profits by putting these investments in today.","Phillip A. Lewis - Security Captial Brokerage, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. That was very helpful.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Jason Smith with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Laura Champine - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, guys. It's actually Laura Champine. My question is on the pricing actions. It's clear that you're giving up some pricing to offset the cost savings you have. Are those actions over in your view? Or are they more \u2013 is there more that needs to be done in the current quarter?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The pricing actions are related to competitive situations in the marketplace. We will remain competitive and as the market changes, we have to change with it or our customers will find other alternatives, the market has been fairly disciplined up to now, and given what's gone on in the raw materials, I think that the industry is doing reasonably well, and I don't see anything that's going to change it in the near future.","Frank H. Boykin - Chief Financial Officer","And, Laura, I'd add too, that both on the raw material front and the pricing front, for the quarter it was where we expected. It was in line with our expectations.","Laura Champine - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions. I turn the call back over to Mr. Lorberbaum, for closing comments.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. We have a distinctive culture that drives product differentiation, operational efficiency and customer commitment. We operate our business in a decentralized manner that creates competitive advantages, while driving best practices across our total enterprise. Our capability to execute acquisitions and broaden our products and geographies provides unique opportunities to Mohawk. Our substantial cash flow and debt capacity will enable us to sustain both our internal and external expansions.","Thank you for joining us.

Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. And thanks to everyone for joining us. During today's call, I'll review our second quarter highlights, assess market conditions and later discuss our third quarter guidance.","The U.S. flooring industry continues to improve with new residential construction up significant for the year, remodeling gaining strength and commercial construction continuing to grow. Mohawk is the world's largest flooring manufacturer and our second quarter was the most successful in our history. We had strong revenue and profit growth, as both our legacy business and recent acquisitions delivered strong performances that exceeded our expectations. Our earnings per share were $1.16 as reported or $1.84, excluding unusual charges, an increase of 61% over adjusted 2012, our best second quarter on record.","For the quarter, our sales increased about 35% as reported or 34% on a constant exchange rate, supported by 6% growth in our legacy sales and the balance from our recent acquisitions. Our adjusted SG&A improved 110 basis points, as we continue to control our costs. Our adjusted operating income increased 9.8%, an improvement of 190 basis points.","In the first half of the year, we invested approximately $1.85 billion in 3 acquisitions: Pergo, Marazzi and Spano, which were financed advantageously with 10-year bonds at 3.85% and low-cost, short-term debt. Our second quarter results affirmed our strategy of acquiring complementary companies that we can leverage with our existing business to facilitate market expansion and increase our profit.","During the period, we made significant progress in integrating our new acquisitions, including realigning organizations, consolidating plants, reducing cost structures, relocating production and assets and enhancing our product offerings. We're also pleased to be recognized in the U.S. as the flooring manufacturer of the year by industry retailers and commercial customers in a survey conducted by a leading trade publication.","Our second quarter performance reflected our ability to execute our growth strategy, along with signs of an improving U.S. economy. The housing sector is seen as a leading component of the U.S. economic improvement this year. The National Association of Home Builders forecast 955,000 new home starts in 2013, with expectations of continued improvement through 2014 as new home construction returns to its historical averages.","Harvard's LIRA index, which measures remodeling investment, forecast significantly higher residential remodelings for the remainder of the year. The June's Architecture Billings Index, a leading indicator of nonresidential construction, remained positive, indicating a steady demand for commercial construction. Commercial loan originations are up almost 10% over 2012, reinforcing a positive future outlook.","In our other markets, Mohawk is poised to become the world's 10th largest economy this year, even as the country's pace of growth has somewhat slowed. Russia's economic minister, in his mid-July statement, expected new monetary policies to improve growth in the back half of this year. The European market remains soft, with Northern Europe outperforming the Southern part of the continent.","These overall economic conditions mirrored Mohawk's second quarter performance. Our legacy North American sales were up 8%, while the balance was down slightly due to weaknesses in Europe. As a reminder, before we review our segment performance, we revised our segment names to reflect our larger and more complex business. As I review the 3 segments, note that our carpet segment was formerly referred to as the Mohawk segment. Our carpet (sic) [ceramic] segment was previously called the Dal-Tile segment. Our laminate and wood segment was identified as the Unilin segment.","Our carpet segment second quarter sales increased 5% over 2012, with carpet sales outperforming rugs. Sales rose to their highest level in more than 4 years due to improving residential new construction and remodeling, continued commercial growth and improved rug sales. Our operating margins expanded 100 basis points, as higher volumes, improved sales, along with greater manufacturing and SG&A efficiencies, offset material costs. Rug sales improved with a focus on new distribution channels and product categories. During the period, carpet price increases were implemented, but lagged raw material inflation by approximately $6 million, as we anticipated, and will align with our cost during the third quarter.","In residential, sales in the specialty channel showed substantial growth, while our home center business improved with the completion of our product transactions during the period. The momentum of our next-generation soft products remained strong, and during the period, we extended our soft technology into polyester fiber with the launch of our EverStrand softer feel collection. These new products, along with our SmartStrand Silk and Wear-Dated Embrace, extend Mohawk's leading position and provide our customers with 3 distinct value-added propositions. We're also introducing a new attractively priced polyester collection under the Image brand, targeting retailers that stock carpet in their stores.","In commercial, corporate hospitality, retail and health care continue to outperform the other channels. We're aggressively expanding our Duracolor commercial carpet collection, made from Mohawk's premium fibers, which provide a greater value to our customers and unparalleled performance. Our carpet tile sales continue to grow, outpacing our commercial broadloom during the quarter.","We are currently benefiting from the many strategies we have executed over the past few years, resulting in enhanced product innovation, reduced manufacturing complexity, improved operational efficiencies, lower-cost materials and higher yields. We continue to improve our quality performance and service level as well as reduce our administrative costs. We're installing additional extrusion and yarn [ph] assets to support continued growth and enhance our cost position.","Revenues for the ceramic segment have almost doubled with our Marazzi acquisition, compared to the prior year. And they're now comparable to our carpet segment. Operating margins have expanded 260 basis points due to improvements in both our legacy business and Marazzi. Our North American sales were up in the low-teens, including both our Mohawk and Marazzi brands and our Mexican business.","Residential growth in the period was driven by new construction and improved remodeling, outpacing our commercial business. We've launched a new builder collection to enhance our product selections for large homebuilders. We see signs of continued growth in residential remodeling in both our specialty and home center channels. We announced a 2% to 4% price increase in ceramics, effective in August, to offset higher energy, transportation and other costs we have been incurring.","Our statement's retail ceramic program continues to gain momentum with commitments for about 140 boutique shops that improve the sales and margins of our retailers. Sales of our ceramic planks that resemble natural wood are growing dramatically. We're in the process of increasing our production of plank tiles to support their continued growth. American Olean and Marazzi brands complement each other, and we will market them together to provide a complete line of residential floor, wall tile and commercial tile. Additionally, in Las Vegas, where we lack strong independent distribution, we're testing distributing both brands in a single service center. We anticipate these actions will enable us to maximize the market position of all our brands.","Our strong commercial sales organization and comprehensive product offering are expanding our specialist specification to large national hospitality, retail and other commercial accounts. We have reorganized our U.S. ceramic management to operate the U.S. Marazzi and Dal-Tile business as a single company reporting to our North American Ceramic President. We have realigned our organization to leverage our sales, product development, manufacturing and logistics organizations. We're beginning to import products from Marazzi Italy to replace ceramic purchases from other manufacturers. Our business is benefiting from sharing best practices between Dal-Tile and Marazzi that will result in many improvements going forward.","In Mexico, our new plant continues to improve its productivity, quality and cost. We have expanded our customer base as well as our product line. Our sales mix is improving as we transition to higher-value products from promotional offerings used to start up the facility. Our Mexican sales have increased as we anticipated, and our margins have expanded as our sales mix and cost have improved. We've initiated new capital investments to expand our North American wall and floor tile production to support our continued growth.","Our Russian ceramic business continues to perform well, with double-digit sales growth and leading ceramic margins. The Russian industry has slowed with the economy, resulting in more promotional activity in the market. Our integrated distribution model is increasing sales to the stronger new construction market, offsetting the less robust remodeling market. Our new 2013 product collections are outperforming our expectations, with plank tiles featuring wood looks expanding at a rapid pace similar to North America. We've increased our advertising budget to support our brand strategy and growth in major markets in Russia. Our productivity and logistic costs are improving with more automated equipment and enhanced processes. Our market penetration is growing as a result of our new product introductions and the addition of more franchise stores. To support our continued growth in the Russian market, 2 new production lines will begin operation by the end of the third quarter.","Our European ceramic sales were up slightly, with expansion in Northern Europe and exports to other markets offsetting soft conditions in Southern Europe. We've implemented a new European organization, which is executing significant sales and operational improvements. We've changed the organization structure to manage as a single European business rather than the historical country-by-country basis. We have reduced the infrastructure to improve our cost, reduce manufacturing -- restructured manufacturing into a unified operation, realigned the sales organization to offer our entire product line to all customers and are expanding our premium product offering. We have completed an analysis of our product line and are introducing more decorative, larger-sized tiles while rationalizing underperforming SKUs.","New products are being manufactured for Dal-Tile to introduce into the U.S. market. New investments in equipment are being made in Europe to lower our cost and further enhance our capabilities. In the ceramic segment, we are leveraging the best practices and knowledge of all of our operations across the enterprise to enhance our product development, supply chain management, productivity, distribution and marketing strategies.","Sales in our laminate and wood segment were up 33% over last year, with the majority of the increase coming from our acquisitions of Pergo and Spano. Operating margins, excluding unusual one-time charges, were 13%, with significant improvements in North America and acquisitions offsetting weakness in the European markets. Our legacy North American sales were up double-digits with strong growth in residential new construction and home centers. With the addition of Pergo, we now have a leading position in both the North American specialty retail and home center channels and lead the premium laminate category with the best brands and differentiated products.","We have integrated the management teams of our U.S. Unilin and Pergo businesses, so we're operating as a single entity. We have reduced SG&A expenses, consolidated administrative functions, increased manufacturing productivity and eliminated redundancies. We've increased the output of the North American Pergo production lines and started up a mothballed Unilin laminate line. We are in-sourcing paper and prevention [ph] maintenance and some board requirements, which Pergo was outsourcing. We are manufacturing Unilin's laminate accessories in the Pergo molding plant. And we are leveraging our company's freight and distribution capabilities to improve efficiencies.","Our Malaysian wood business, Australian distribution and Russian operations continue to improve, while our European business continues to face headwinds with our legacy sales down slightly and margins under pressure. The Pergo integration in Europe is also well underway and will create significant synergies. We will be expanding Pergo's distribution in both residential and commercial, with a focus on the brand's higher durability and performance features. We've begun manufacturing Pergo-branded products in our Belgian and Malaysian factories. And we are in the process of closing both of the Pergo manufacturing plants in Sweden. This will allow us to enhance the product offering with new technology and substantially improve Pergo's profitability. The production will be entirely moved in the third quarter and new collections are being produced to update the European Pergo product line this year. We will maintain local warehousing in Sweden to ensure industry-leading service in the region. European energy and conservation policies continue to drive our insulation board growth.","In addition, our polyurethane composition has enhanced thermal properties that is gaining share from other types of insulation. Our new insulation plant in France will begin production in the third quarter, expanding our capacity and geographic reach. Our roof panel sales are lower, along with a decline in new construction in the Netherlands and France. The consolidation of our 2 roofing plants in the Netherlands will be completed in the third quarter to improve our costs. Our legacy board sales were flat, with margins down somewhat in the period. The market continues to be difficult, and we are adjusting to the economic environment.","We closed the acquisition of Spano during the period and have identified many opportunities for synergies. We have restructured the management and sales organization of the board operations. This will help us expand the product offering and distribution, optimize manufacturing assets and reduce infrastructure costs. We anticipate maximizing the use of the best assets, reducing manufacturing complexity, eliminating product movements and replacing inefficient assets to further improve both the productivity and our cost position.","I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period.","Frank H. Boykin","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $1,976,000,000, up approximately 35% as reported, or 34% on a constant exchange rate basis, and include an incremental $416 million from our acquisitions. Legacy sales for the quarter were up 6% compared to last year. In the U.S., new residential, residential remodel and commercial all grew while Europe remained slow. The performance of our acquisitions exceeded our expectations in the quarter.","Our gross margin as reported was 26%. However, excluding charges, the margin was 27.7%, up 80 basis points due to higher volumes, better mix, cost initiatives and our acquisitions. Our SG&A for the quarter was $381 million or 19.3% of sales. Excluding charges, it was 17.9% of sales and improved 110 basis points from cost reductions, better leverage and lower Unilin amortization of $10 million.","Our restructuring charges for the quarter were $60 million. Total restructuring and acquisition costs are estimated to be $120 million for the full year, of which $45 million to $65 million is expected to be recovered from future real estate sales over time. In the second quarter, the $60 million of restructuring and acquisition costs that were incurred include $42 million for Marazzi, $15 million for Pergo and $2 million for Spano, with $1 million in other categories. The $60 million was comprised of $14 million for legal, accounting and banking fees, a noncash $19 million charge for the inventory step-up and $27 million for restructuring, primarily related to the Marazzi reduction in force and the Pergo plant closures and related relocation. In the second half of 2013, we estimate the $50 million balance of restructuring charges will include an additional $14 million for a noncash inventory step-up and the rest will be for plant and infrastructure consolidation, product changes and system conversions, which are being finalized.","Operating income, excluding charges, was $193 million, with a margin of 9.8%. Operating income dollars are up 66% from last year, with our margin improving 190 basis points. EBITDA, excluding charges for the quarter, was $275 million, with a margin of 13.9% or a 120 basis point improvement. Interest expense grew to $25 million with our increase in debt from the acquisitions. Our income tax rate was 21% compared to 18% last year. And for the full year, we expect a rate of 20%. We had a loss from discontinued operations, which was $1.4 million for the quarter or $0.02 per share. This includes a loss from the operations of a noncore Marazzi sanitary ware business held-for-sale. Our earnings per share, excluding charges, was $1.84 and is up 61% over last year.","If we move to the segments. In the carpet segment, our sales were $771 million, an increase of 5% over last year. We had volume increases in all of our end markets, with improvement also driven by price increases and mix. Our operating income in the segment was $55 million or 7.1% of sales. This is an increase of 100 basis points and related to volume increases and mix improvement.","In the ceramic segment, sales were $760 million. This was an 88% increase over last year. The increase was driven by the Marazzi acquisition and volume increases in our legacy business. Marazzi contributed $310 million to sales in the quarter. New residential, remodel and commercial all grew over last year. Operating income, excluding charges, was $88 million or a margin of 11.6%. Operating income dollars were up 144% over last year. Our margin improved 260 basis points. The Marazzi acquisition, volume improvement and cost savings all contributed to the margin growth. The Marazzi results will be included in Mohawk for only 9 months in 2013. Their full year sales last year were $1,160,000,000, and we expect a 4% to 5% growth rate in 2013, with a margin of 10% to 11%.","In the laminate segment, sales were $471 million, or a 33% improvement over last year. Acquisitions and North American growth offset a slower European business. Acquisitions in the quarter contributed $105 million to our sales. Operating income, excluding charges, was $59 million with a margin of 12.6%. The operating income dollars were up 44% with lower volumes and mix improvement in Europe, offset by higher volumes in North America, as well as earnings from our acquisitions. Pergo and Spano sales were $500 million combined last year, after excluding discontinued raw material sales and products previously dropped. Both are expected to be down in 2013 due to a slower European economy. Pergo will be owned for the full year and Spano for 8 months, with combined margins estimated at 7% to 8% this year.","In the corporate and eliminations segment, we had an operating loss of $9 million. We're expecting the full year loss to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million this year, with the intercompany profit eliminations impacting us more as we grow our top line.","On the balance sheet, receivables ended the quarter at $1,146,000,000. This includes $300 million of an increase from acquisitions. Our days sales outstanding were flat to last year at 47 days. Inventories at the end of the quarter were $1,592,000,000. $410 million of the increase in inventories came from acquisitions. Our days inventory outstanding were flat to last year at 106 days. Fixed assets at the end of the quarter were $2,594,000,000 and included capital expenditures of $83 million during the quarter, with depreciation and amortization of $81 million.","We continue to anticipate full year capital expenditures of $380 million and depreciation and amortization of $315 million. Total long-term debt was $2.5 billion. Total net debt at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion. And that compares to net debt on a pro forma basis at the end of the first quarter of $2.5 billion. Our net debt-to-EBITDA improved to 2.6x compared to 2.8x at the end of the first quarter on a pro forma basis. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $153 million, with free cash flow of $70 million in the period.","I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Our performance during the second quarter underscored the value of our recent acquisitions and our ability to integrate them into our business. Our talented management team is focused on driving our historical businesses while optimizing our new acquisitions. We've quickly identified and executed many significant changes during -- including new organizational structures, cost improvement, asset consolidations, realignment of marketing strategies and the enhancement of our product offering.","We continue to make the necessary strategy changes and investments to improve our profitability. We're committed to bringing innovation to the marketplace in all our products. And our new acquisitions have enhanced our ability to realize this. We anticipate improving each of our product categories with our strong brands, efficient manufacturing, innovative products and broad distribution. We are increasingly confident in the continued strengthening of the U.S. market. And we believe that continued job growth, expanded new home construction and greater remodeling investments, along with our new acquisitions, will improve our future results.","With these factors, our guidance for the third quarter is $1.81 to $1.91 per share, excluding any restructuring or acquisition costs. With business improvement and acquisitions in 2013, we anticipate the fourth quarter seasonal decline to be slightly more than in 2010 and '11. Our second quarter result demonstrate our ability to grow our legacy businesses while delivering positive results through acquisitions.","Mohawk is a global business with the knowledge and expertise to effectively compete in local markets while satisfying regional trends. While Mohawk's product and geographic presence have dramatically broadened over the years, the constant that remains is our commitment to operational excellence, continuous innovation and the satisfaction of our customers.","We'll now be glad to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Baugh.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wanted to inquire on the acquisitions, where you think you are in terms of timing of executing the full realization of synergies and if you could do that by the 3 acquisitions. And then whether or not any of the 3 opportunities on the synergy front are perhaps greater than when you first acquired or analyzed the business.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","With the new acquisitions, we expect over the next few years to be able to improve the operating margins by about 2% to 4%. In addition, we believe there'll be revenue growth, which should continue. We've made significant progress in the integration. Some of the pieces are in our control and some aren't. Some of the things that we intend to do include putting new assets in. That could take 2 years to get them in before we realize all those. So the actions that we're doing include realigning the organizations, which we've done; consolidating plants, which is an ongoing process; reducing costs in all parts of the business; relocating production between the plants to optimize the plants that produce it; as well as enhancing the product lines to do that.","John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So Jeff, where do you -- first inning, third inning, fifth inning?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Listen, some of the businesses was only owned for about 30, 45 days. You could say we're further along on Pergo, but we're not as far along on Spano.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Looking at tile in Mexico, where you've been, obviously, expanding your capacity as you bring in new product. Could you discuss the growth you kind of had in that market, and how much was share gains and organic? And you talked about Russia as well, in terms of a bit more promotional activity. I know that's, obviously -- I believe that was about 1\/4 of Marazzi, if you could go into that as well?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We'll try to give you some feel for it, but we don't break out specific products and sales in each of the parts or the margins of each.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess, if you were just taking share in Mexico, if that was half the growth -- and then if in Russia, what's happening there -- and -- because it's a hard market to understand, I think, from our perspective.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Well, in Mexico, we put in capacity of -- new capacity of, I think, just under $100 million about a year ago, little less than a year ago. During the year, we have gotten [indiscernible] because it takes over a year to get it up to the efficiencies. We're getting close to where we'd like it to be. By the end of the year, the cost in the new plant should be pretty close to the same as every other facility that we have. At the same time, we started promoting product to use the new capacity, using lower-value products as we're training the people and the production is running through the plant. And what we're doing now is moving it to higher-value products in the marketplace. We still have a limited share of the Mexican marketplace, and a large amount of room to grow. We believe in the marketplace that our customers are looking for alternatives to purchase product from. So we believe we're a good alternative with a product offering from the top all the way to the bottom. In Russia, the market is very fractured market. We believe we're the largest participant in it. Nobody in the market has more than mid-teen market shares approximately. So there's a lot of opportunities to grow in Russia. We have a management group that's been there for a very long time building the business from a very small business to where it is today.","We have the integrated structure there, where we manufacture the product. We have distribution across the country, all the way up to retail and franchise stores to move the product to market. In this period we just finished, we've started doing more advertising in the major retail markets in order to enhance the value of our brand and become more aware of our products in the marketplace, which is helping us overcome the slower growth in the economy. What else? To offset sales, the softness in the marketplace, we're also increasing our sales into the new construction part of the market, which still did not have the decline or softness that we saw in the replacement marketplace. In addition, I guess, in Russia, we've come out with a brand-new product line in the first of the year, and it's being accepted better than we had anticipated. So we think we're doing well, given the structure. We believe we have a long-term opportunity to grow in the categories we are as well as expand into other markets.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","The first question, Frank, you mentioned that the acquisitions were coming in ahead of expectations thus far. Can you just talk a little bit about where that is? Is that top line or cost and maybe even by geography?","Frank H. Boykin","We're not prepared to talk about them individually. But we have, I would say from a margin and bottom line standpoint, probably better performance than what we had anticipated.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then on the nonresidential side, I think you've talked consistently that, that's been a growing market for you. Could you maybe break that down between ceramic tile, carpet tile and then broadloom carpet just to kind of understand the puts and takes within that?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","So we're not prepared again to give you specific numbers. We could tell you that the commercial market is still growing for us in each of our segments. It's growing on all the pieces. The ceramic segment has a larger portion of commercial than does the carpet segment. I think we've given before that it's about 40% of our business in that segment. And in the carpet segment, we're seeing a change in it as the commercial tiles continue to grow. So we're having very high growth rates in our commercial tile, taking share from our broadloom business. We see going into the fall a continuation of what we've been seeing.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","But broadloom is growing still?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Can you give a bit more color in terms of the positive mix shift in carpet? So that's mainly coming from area rugs or new product introductions? And essentially, how sustainable is this? Is this a one-time snapback or a cyclical shift or just a continued product evolution?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We've been working for the last 4 or 5 years, our strategy is to improve our business, improve everything within it. And they're starting to pay benefits that we have. We're seeing better mix from higher-value products, and we've been talking about leading the soft category with -- we have 3 different pieces within it driving it. We have better volume going on in our carpet business, which is helping our cost. We continue to improve our manufacturing costs, and we continue to control our SG&A costs, all of which are benefiting the margins.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Okay, got it. And also in the Belgian -- the melamine business with Spano acquisition, I believe you said in the past that there was some tougher price discipline in that market. Since the acquisition, have you attempted any price increases or had any success there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We have not done anything. What we've done so far is we've restructured the management and sales organizations to put them together. We are getting the products, so each one had some slightly different product. So by putting the sales groups together, we could offer the product offering to a broader customer base. We're optimized -- we have the potential to optimize the manufacturing assets. We believe that reductions in infrastructure, we can do to improve it. We're just in the initial stages of developing how we're going to get there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is actually Mike Dahl on for Dan. Appreciate all the color on the various initiatives across the business. I was curious about on the ceramic side, you mentioned you're testing this distribution strategy, the single center distribution in Vegas. How should we think about the margin opportunity from that? And is this a sign that if this were to go well, you'd explore broadening that out to other markets as well?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","You have to go back to what the strengths and weaknesses were of each of the brands prior. The Marazzi brand basically focused on medium- to higher-end residential floor tile. And they were trying to drive their business through that. In our business under American Olean, we have a commercial product line, which they don't offer. We have wall tile they don't offer. We have a broader pricing spectrum of products we cover. And then we also offer assorted things in installation and other packages to give a full package to the customer. What we're doing is offering to both our distribution customers as well as where we have weak distribution, the combination of offering both brands to our customer base together. And that will allow us to have a complete line, competitive with our complete Dal-Tile line. And we believe that doing so, we'll be able to attract more customers and increase both the brands' penetration in the marketplace.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then also on ceramics, could you quantify what percentage of SKUs were impacted by the product review? And also talk to the margin differential between some of the larger decorative tiles and some of the weaker SKUs that you're discontinuing.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I don't have the detail of the SKUs. There's a significant number of low-productive SKUs in the Marazzi Europe line that we're going to remove from the line. At the same time, due to limited capabilities and equipment, they were limited in how much of certain higher-value products they could make. We've agreed to increase the capacity, make changes in it to improve the amount of the higher-value products we can do and restructuring the manufacturing. They ran the business. They had plants in different countries in Europe and they ran them each fairly independently. What we're doing is running them more holistically. And so by moving products around, we have capability short-term of producing a different mix of products. We think it's the right thing to do and we'll continue down that path.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And any quantification on just what you can do on a margin basis from those higher-value products?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","A minute ago, we gave a view that said that over time, we expect that the margins of all the acquisitions collectively over the next few years, we'll be able to move it up 2% to 4%. This is about as close as we're going get you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with the Cleveland Research Company.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Two questions for you. First of all, Europe, can you clarify what you're seeing and expecting in Europe? I know you talked about Pergo and Spano being down this year and Marazzi being up, but I know there's different pieces there. Could you just cut through and talk about what you're seeing in terms of demand in the Europe market in the first half and expectations for the second half?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The Southern part of Europe continues to be weak. We're seeing declines. The Northern part tends to be better but also declines. We have different product categories that are more related to new construction versus remodeling, and you're seeing differences there. Country-by-country, there are significant differences. Going forward, our hope is to have limited downside and possibly be at a bottom. We don't know.","Frank H. Boykin","The other thing, Eric, I would point out is that if you look at our 2 businesses over there, Unilin, Unilin is primarily in middle and Northern Europe, which countries are performing better, as you know, than Southern Europe. Marazzi does have a presence in Southern Europe. But as we've talked about, they've been able to offset a lot of that. Their businesses in Europe have been able to offset all of that. A lot of that with exports into other areas around the world.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And then secondly, the management changes that you've made as you consolidated the new businesses within tile and laminate, could you just speak a little bit of what their marching orders are? I know you've spoken of the focus on improving profitability. But interested in how that is balanced relative to accelerating sales growth and market share.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I'll try to repeat some of the things that we talked about. In the U.S., we're operating both together as a single entity, that we are looking at combining the 2 brands here, which we think we can increase penetration both through distribution as well as the areas where we don't go through distribution. We believe that the combination of those will allow us to increase the penetration of those. We believe that the equipment can be optimized by taking the products that fit which plant best across the entire enterprise and increase the productivity and cost structure of those. In the European business in ceramic, I mean, we're changing the business philosophies dramatically. They used to run the business as a country-by-country basis, almost as independent businesses. We are -- we have put a single management structure over the top, where all the manufacturing is reporting to one gentleman. All the sales are reporting to another. That we are taking the product lines, which they used to go to market separately, and we're going to put them through all of the -- a unified sales force to drive those. We are focused on increasing our business in areas in Northern Europe. We're focused on increasing our business in Northern Africa and other countries around. We are increasing the amount of premium products through short-term changes, as well as new investments to allow those to occur, which will take some time to maximize. What else can I tell you?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You mentioned that you're seeing a definite improvement in the repair or remodel side of demand in several of the segments. And it seems like this is the first quarter that we've heard about that in quite some time. Can you give us some more details around exactly what you're seeing there? Is it increased sales? Is it people moving to a higher price point in terms of product mix? Just some sort of sense of what's going on there.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","In all of the different channels in both the businesses, we're seeing growth through the specialty store channel. We're seeing growth in the home center channel in both cases, as well as the other parts and pieces of them. We believe that it's being driven by several things: One is that increasing home prices around the country is giving people more confidence to put more money in their homes. The economy, though not growing as much as we would like it to be, is growing and there's more people working in each one. We're seeing some -- and it's harder to get because there's a lot of moving parts. We believe that as that goes further, the people that spend money on remodeling tend to purchase higher-quality products and should improve our mix as we go through in all the different categories.","Frank H. Boykin","I'll add on the mix side though, Susan, it is still early, a little difficult in the cycle, a little difficult to evaluate mix. With price increases that we've had in new products and prebuying that's going on, it's a little difficult to evaluate what's going on with mix.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then have you guys seen or heard sort of anecdotally that there's been any changes in demand? Are consumers having any reaction to the fact that rates have moved at all? Is that impacting their ability to maybe finance projects or the way that they think about taking these things on?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We're not getting any input in either direction on that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Wanted to ask you guys, what are you seeing in terms of raw material costs and pricing initiatives to offset it? It sounds like it's kind of at loggerheads right now. Any color would be terrific.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Each one of the businesses have different things driving it. So the carpet business, we're in the middle of implementing a 4% to 6% price increase that we announced some time ago. We talked about the lag and recovering it and that we anticipate to cover it now. At the moment, we haven't seen significant changes in it. We continue to watch it as we go through. In that area, some of the chemical prices are under pressure. However, there's some increases in the oil prices. So we're just watching it and we'll have to react to it. In the ceramic segment, we have the natural gas prices have gone up and the gasoline prices on the trucks, and in that business, we sell a lot of it delivered. So we've announced a price increase in the third quarter to try to recover those changes and some others with it. In the wood business, the lumber prices on the solid woods and the engineered woods are going up. We've announced 3 or 4 price increases this year. We're still implementing those. Hopefully, we're reaching a peak.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. So your carpet sales were up 5%. This is the best growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2011. So that's obviously an exciting development. Is this mid-single-digit growth rate, in your opinion, based on what you know now, likely sustainable during the back half of the year?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We're hoping that the present trends will continue.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Jason Aaron Marcus - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is actually Jason Marcus in for Mike. The first question is going back to the ceramic segment for a minute. So you saw a really impressive improvement of about 260 basis points in the quarter. I was wondering if you could let us know, kind of in order of magnitude, how much of an impact the higher volumes had relative to Marazzi and the sales mix? And then in terms of the year-over-year progression in margins for the next 2 quarters, do you think you'd be able to maintain the same type of improvement you saw in the second quarter? Or do you think you will maybe even be able to improve that even more in the back half?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Jason, it's all built into the estimates we gave you. We gave you an estimates for this quarter. We tried to give you some view of the seasonality of the businesses in reference to history. And you should be able to get pretty close.","Jason Aaron Marcus - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the different industries that you sell to on the commercial side, like education, office, health care and government, I'm just wondering if you could quickly run through the trends that you're seeing in each of those.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I guess, just high level, the corporate, hospitality and health care are the strongest markets that we're seeing in the different pieces. We see that they'll continue like they're going at this moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","At the risk of being overly simplistic -- and I do respect the fact that you don't give a whole lot of details around your guidance, but I'm looking at the third quarter guidance that, frankly, shares -- results pretty similar from an EPS standpoint in Q2, yet you've got a lot of things that are sequentially better in Q3 as you suggested. You've got the fair carpet pricing in Q3. You've got no FIFO impacts like you had in Q2. You've got higher prices in ceramic and wood and the volume has also accelerated through the quarter. So I'm just confused as to what the offsets there exist between Q2 and Q3 on the negative side that would cause you only to be hitting in the same general area as you did in Q2.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","If we could get the Europeans to quit going on vacation for a month or so in the third quarter, you wouldn't have the same result. So it's all got to do with what happens in Europe, the majority of it is what's happening in Europe and around that they all take off, which is -- it always happens every year.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I would think though that the overall volumes there will not be all that dissimilar Q2 to Q3. So is that the area of conservatism that you see that you're baking in there, is you're not sure where European margins shake out?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","No, the European sales are less.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the last question I would have, Frank -- and if you mentioned this on the call, I apologize. Available liquidity as it stands and where would you feel comfortable where that liquidity needs to be for you to make a fairly substantial acquisition going forward?","Frank H. Boykin","We're at $300 million right now available on our revolver. And with regards to acquisitions, we continue to look at anything anybody brings us. But we're focused right now primarily on integrating those acquisitions, and we'll continue to pay down debt. And the other thing to point out that has happened favorably is our debt-to-EBITDA ratio has continued to improve. Just from the first quarter to the second quarter, it's improved significantly, so we'll continue to drop that.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We're expecting the ratio to continue improving significantly. So it's not a matter of being able to get the money, it's a matter of being able to have the management to tackle how many things at the same time. And we think we have the capability to buy other ones, it'll be greater over time. And if we find the right ones, we'll take actions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with the Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Wanted to pull the string a little bit more on ceramic margins, both in the quarter and looking forward, not only just for the back half, but over the next 2 to 3 years. First, for the quarter, how much of the over 260 basis points year-over-year improvement was to the core business versus acquired -- just relatively higher acquired margins? And as we look into the back half of the year, how should we think about Marazzi? Then finally, you originally had targeted a 13% to 15% type margin over the next several years. Do you think that there could be upside to that target?","Frank H. Boykin","So look, a couple of questions in there. I'll see if I can hit them all. The first thing I want to point out is with these acquisitions. As I talked about last quarter, as we get further and further along in the integration, it's very difficult to pull them apart and say x amount of the margin improvement came from the acquisitions and the other amount came from other things that we're doing. So we really can't address that. With regards to the future, looking out over the next couple of years, we are expecting our ceramic margins to get back up to the kind of 13%, 14% range that they've run historically.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","It would also help to have Europe improve a little bit, has a lot of upsides.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Do you think that there's possibility for upside beyond that 13% to 14%?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","One step at a time.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay, great. And if I could sneak one last in, how much of America's low-teens growth in ceramic was Mexico versus the core U.S. business?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The core business is so much larger than the other. It's basically setting the pace. The other one is a small part of the total.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I guess, for starters, Frank, in the past, you've given some guidance on contribution margins of ceramic, carpet and wood. And I'm just wondering how the acquisitions changed those numbers you gave us in the past?","Frank H. Boykin","I think we're still in the same vicinity as what we've given you in the past, about a 20% contribution margin in carpet and mid-20s for ceramic and upper 20s to 30% range for laminate.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then the 2% to 4% margin improvement on the consolidated numbers you discussed earlier, I just wanted to clarify, how much of that was restructuring and how much of it, if any, is just the operating leverage off the top line growth?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","It's all of the above.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","So that's everything, all-in, you expect at margin improvement?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Yes.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And then finally, just because Sam brought up the M&A question, if I could tag on there. Most of the category growth, at least in North America, has been in hardwood and LVT. And these are both categories where you've got a fairly limited presence or you're sourcing products. So I realized you've got your hands full right now. You're integrating, you plan to pay down debt. But can you just talk about where, within your M&A priorities going forward, these 2 categories may stand?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We have a significant wood business. We have a limited LVT business that we're importing products into U.S. and Europe. We're in the process of building an LVT plant in Europe. It should be up and running sometime next year. As that one proves itself out, we would be prepared to expand into those categories in other geographic markets.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","First question, within Pergo, the plant closures in Sweden you'd referred to, when would those be completed? And when will all the costs have been incurred on that process?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The completion will be by the end of this quarter. The operations will be moved to our Belgian plant and be supplied out of our Belgian plant. And the cost, I guess...","Frank H. Boykin","Most of the cost will have been done by the end of the third quarter.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","There's some in the fourth -- there's some later because there's product transitions and other things and updating the product line in Europe. So some is -- Frank gave you some numbers earlier about the rest of second half.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I don't know if you mentioned this in the prepared segments, but on Spano, I know there's going to be some manufacturing rationalization there. What kind of timeframe are you looking at on Spano?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We're still evaluating the opportunities. There are a number of plants close to each other. And the opportunities are, can we move the -- use the best assets and the place? Should we put more investments in? We haven't concluded yet.","Frank H. Boykin","Nothing's been announced.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then finally, you had some positive comments on the press release on rugs. I know that's been a problem for some time. Do you think rugs year-over-year will be a growth category for you in the third quarter?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The sales have improved. What's happening in the rug business is that as the retailers perceive the cuts -- we tend to sell a large portion of it to discounters, mass merchants. And over the last year or so, they've been compressing the price points, trying to make them more available for people with incomes that are getting squeezed. So we're having a significant problem into average value as they compress it. We're spending a huge amount of effort trying to bring them higher-value products that they can sell at higher price points. So it's a compression of the prices that's our biggest problem.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So not really units, compression of prices?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Yes, the retail price points.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Retail price, okay. Is that -- you think it's going to turn positive? Or we've still got some work to do with them?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","It's better than it was, but we're still working on it.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jeff, this is probably a question for you. I was curious if you could give -- talk a little bit about the evolution of your management style. And in particular, I'm curious as to whether you can give us some sense for how you -- what current bottlenecks you see in your current -- the way you currently have your management structured, how you have -- how you monitor what's going on in the field and how you allow the operation to make decisions, as well as you have. If there's any bottlenecks that we should be -- or that you're primarily thinking about, which you might need to address as you contemplate becoming an even bigger and more global organization?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think that what was just taken on in the last 6 months is a huge piece of acquiring as many businesses and as many continents and as many different product categories that we have all at the same time. The reason we're able to handle it is because of the management structure. Within the management structure, I have a Chief Operating Officer, who's over the business and helps me execute these strategies across the business. Under each of those, we have 3 segments: We have basically a carpet segment, a ceramic segment and a laminate and wood segment. Each of those has a President that's driving the day-to-day strategies and executing the business. Then under each of them, we then have different product managers, category managers, channel managers. And collectively, we set the tone for where we want to go. We have very good process in the place we've built over the years. Going into the year, we go through a strategic planning process. We come out of that with very specific things that we expect to accomplish over the next 12 months. They put together cost savings programs, product innovation programs. They assign it down through the organization to different people within it. Monthly, quarterly, they review the progress on those and keep adjusting them as necessary. And we have a really good progress to execute. You've been listening to all the things that we're doing in these different acquisitions. I mean, there are hundreds of pieces moving all at the same time. Each one of those acquisitions falls under a different manager. For instance, within the laminate business in Europe, there's one group that's driving the changes with Pergo, there's another group driving the changes with Spano in each one. There's another group driving the U.S. changes in Pergo under the U.S. management. And so each one is broken down into segments with different ones, so no one group has to take the challenges of any one piece. I think we're well-setup for the long term. The management is the strongest it's ever been. The systems and processes continue to get stronger every day. And I think being able to handle this and all the different activities we've got going on shows what -- how it's working.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, certainly so far, it's been working great. So I appreciate that color. I guess, my next question relates to Marazzi and the Pergo acquisitions, both of which you're doing integration work and seeing opportunities for expansion both domestically and overseas. I was curious if you could share with us kind of a generalization as to whether you feel that -- where you feel for Marazzi and Pergo more of the opportunity or low-hanging fruit exists, whether it be domestically or overseas for Marazzi and also then for Pergo?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Each of the businesses have unique opportunities. We talked through a lot of them in the last hour. The U.S. business, the operations side of the Pergo business, there's ways of improving it. They were starved for cash and putting them together, utilizing the best assets across it, internalizing things, like board production both in Europe and there. They had simple things like they were outsourcing maintenance. I mean, it's all being in-sourced as we speak. There were things like the raw material supplied in different pieces, we're internalizing those. In Europe, the Pergo assets were put in -- most of them were 20 years old and outdated. The reason we're closing the plants up, it costs more to fix them than they're worth. We can leverage the assets where we are by closing the assets there and moving them to our other plants. They go from having the worst assets in the industry to having the best assets in the industry. On the Marazzi side, the business in the U.S., I mean, it was running really well when we got it. We're looking for synergies across the pieces, in marketing, branding and product. Increasing distribution, we think a big opportunities. Europe, the European ceramic industry from peak to bottom is off like 50%. So they had already done many changes to do it. The big opportunity in Europe is to reduce the infrastructure costs, which we -- we have many things going on to improve the asset quality and to broaden the product mix. And boy, if we ever get any help in the marketplace, I mean, we have big upsides in it. The Europe -- the Russian business, I mean, is running well. We just have to keep feeding it capital and keep looking how to grow it in other areas that they're not in over time. All have good opportunities. We've got them all lined up and we're going after them all.","Operator","And there are no further audio questions.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you for joining us for our second quarter.

My name is Ryan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mohawk Industries Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, November 1, 2013. Thank you. I would now like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Frank Boykin. Mr. Boykin, you may begin.","Frank H. Boykin","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor conference call. We will update you on the company's progress during the third quarter of 2013 and provide guidance for the fourth quarter.","I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make on this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Today, I'll review our third quarter performance, provide a general overview of market conditions and later, discuss our fourth quarter guidance.","As the U.S. housing industry recovers, the flooring industry results are improving, with ongoing growth in new residential construction and residential remodeling. Commercial construction and renovation continue to provide opportunities, particularly in hospitality. Mohawk's recent acquisitions have cemented our position as the world's largest flooring manufacturer, and this quarter, we reported the highest earnings per share -- adjusted earnings per share in our company's history.","During the period, higher U.S. volumes, efficiency improvements and the performance of our acquisitions have supported our strong growth. Our earnings per share were $1.63 as reported or $2.02 excluding unusual charges, an increase of 94% over adjusted third quarter 2012 results.","For the period, our sales increased about 33%. Our legacy businesses delivered solid sales growth, and our recent acquisitions contributed significantly to our increased revenues.","For the quarter, we controlled our overall SG&A and improved our adjusted SG&A in our legacy business, while continuing to invest in samples and merchandising to support our new product lines. Our adjusted operating income increased to 11%, improving 350 basis points over the prior year, with growth across all of our segments. To deliver higher operating income, we have enhanced our product mix through innovative collections, improved our manufacturing and distribution efficiencies with new systems and processes and lowered SG&A.","In our second quarter conference call, we discussed our ability to expand our markets and increase our profits through acquisitions. During today's call, we'll update you on the progress we've made integrating Pergo, Marazzi and Spano into our business through organizational restructuring, facility consolidation, cost reduction, relocation of production and assets, and new value-added product offerings. Additionally, shortly after launching our fourth annual sustainability report, a leading industry publication honored Mohawk with it's top sustainability award to recognize the exceptional success of the company's many green initiatives.","As more attention has been focused on the health care in the U.S., we're committed to having the safest and healthiest industrial workforce by investing in preventative care, chronic disease management and processes that save money through higher quality care, and empowering our people to make better individual choices through training and educational resources.","The recent U.S. government stalemate negatively impacted consumer confidence. Despite this, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain solid and we expect consumer confidence to get back on track after the recent agreements were reached by our government. Though rebounding, new housing construction has not yet risen to its historical average. The National Association of Home Builders projects a significant gain in new home starts next year, with volume rising 25% to 1,150,000 units.","During the next few years, we anticipate housing will grow faster than the overall economy as the market expands to satisfy pent-up demand from the recession. In August, home prices rose for the 18th consecutive month, which should positively impact remodeling and lead to improved industry product mix as homeowners select more premium flooring options. For some time, remodeling spending has lagged its historical average, but we're seeing signs of improvement in Harvard's LIRA index, which forecasts stronger residential remodeling for the remainder of this year and 2014. Leading construction management consultants project commercial construction will grow by 5% in 2014, with hospitality strong and retail trailing. In our other markets, Mexico's rapid growth has cooled, but should benefit next year from the proposed opening of Mexico's energy sector to foreign investment, government stimulus and construction required due to widespread tropical storm damage. Many believe Mexico is the emerging market with the greatest upside potential.","Russia's economy continues to experience headwinds and the government's taking steps to reignite economic growth through stimulus policies and lower interest rates. New residential and commercial construction remain strong, although remodeling has slowed in the overall Russian -- with the overall Russian economy.","While the European market remains at a cyclical bottom, many people are predicting improvement next year. Northern Europe is outperforming the southern part of the continent as government policies transition from a focus on austerity to an emphasis on growth and investment. The flooring industry in Europe has not yet seen a significant improvement, with both the residential and commercial markets remaining below historical averages.","In our carpet segment, the third quarter operating margin was the strongest it's been in more than 6 years, and operating income rose 50% over the prior year as a result of product mix, productivity, cost controls and volume leverage. We've focused on the residential premium product category with differentiated supersoft carpets that have higher margins, and we're transitioning our commercial collections to premium fibers, which we manufacture and provide better value to our customers and higher returns to Mohawk. With this transition, our commercial volumes have been temporarily impacted, but will improve as new products gain traction in the market due to their more competitive positioning. We are substantially increasing polyester production capacity, allowing us to put -- and expand our participation in the value category of the builder, multifamily and retail channels. We're introducing about 40 new polyester residential products in the second half of this year to expand our sales in this faster-growing part of the market. We fully executed our carpet price increases in the period and our selling prices are now aligned with our costs.","Our adjusted SG&A continues to improve from cost reductions implemented during the year and are at their lowest absolute amounts since 2007. We have consolidated most of our carpet management team in Calhoun from multiple locations to enhance our collaboration efficiencies and speed of execution.","And residential product mix continues to improve as we expand our industry-leading position in soft carpet technology. We are broadening our selection of SmartStrand and Wear-Dated Embrace with more fashionable, higher-style product to maximize our share of the premium soft carpet category. We're introducing a new premium Soft Appeal collection of polyester, with luxurious softness and a leading environmental story, utilizing our Continuum technology with up to 100% recycled content. As we expand our polyester offering to satisfy all styles and price points, we expect additional growth in 2014. We have completed our product realignment in home centers and are seeing accelerated sales growth.","In commercial, our margins improved significantly with positive price and mix, while increasing the value proposition to our customers by utilizing premium fibers that we are manufacturing internally. Growth in hospitality continues to outpace other sectors by leveraging our specialized design capabilities, high-resolution print technology and collaborations with our ceramic business on large projects.","Productivity and efficiency gains are expanding our margins as we reduce our cost through improved manufacturing processes, higher material yields and efficiencies from realignment of our assets. Significant investments in fiber and yarn production and reengineered materials have improved our costs. Distribution costs have reduced with cuts in infrastructure, higher truck utilization and improved productivity from new processes and systems.","Our ceramic revenues were up 84% compared to the prior year through strong results in our legacy business and the Marazzi acquisition. During the period, operating margins grew 290 basis points to 12% as a result of higher volumes, efficiency gains and improved product mix. In the U.S., greater use of ceramic tile and new residential construction has driven sales growth higher than other flooring product categories. Our North American ceramic sales, which include Daltile, Marazzi and our Mexican operations, had a double-digit increase. We continue to optimize the value of our global ceramic assets by manufacturing products previously outsourced, moving production to the U.S. to improve lead times and margins, and utilizing our red body capacity from our new Mexican plant to meet demand in the United States. Additionally, we are launching, in our Daltile and American Olean brands, new products manufactured in Europe by Marazzi. A 2% to 4% price increase in the U.S. was implemented in August to offset higher energy transportation and other costs.","We continue to expand the Daltile brand position as the complete provider of all products in all price points, enhancing our position with national and regional builders, and retailers who focus on the tile category. We are executing the initial stages of our brand realignment with American Olean and Marazzi lines. The combined offerings will satisfy all residential floor and wall tile needs as well as a broad selection of commercial products. Marazzi products are positioned slightly above American Olean in the residential floor tile, and American Olean closes the gaps in Marazzi's wall tile and commercial selections. This combined offering has been implemented in the Las Vegas market and, over the next 6 months, we will be launching in additional markets on the West Coast. We will also be offering our American Olean and Marazzi distributors opportunities to enhance their market position, utilizing both brands where it's appropriate.","In commercial, we will begin offering higher-style tiles using Marazzi's Europe's unique technologies to enhance the design options for large commercial projects. We have realigned the U.S. Daltile and Marazzi ceramic operations with a unified management structure, including sales, marketing, manufacturing, product development and administration. During the first half of 2014, we will realign product manufacturing to improve asset utilization, customer service and distribution. The consolidated Daltile, American Olean and Marazzi business has strengthened our position in the U.S. ceramic market. Our home center and independent distributor market is now stronger and our product capability has improved. Efficiencies or gains through distribution and plant utilization in the U.S. are driving savings to enhance our margins.","In Mexico, our new plant in Salamanca continues to improve its productivity, quality and cost. To offset the slowing Mexican market, we've reduced SG&A and we will optimize capacity utilization by selling products into the U.S. builder market. Our Mexican margins and market share are improving by shifting Salamanca production to higher-value products from promotional goods during its startup.","In Russia, the ceramic market is softening with the general economy. We are improving our position and outpacing the market, though we have some pressures due to promotional activity by our competitors. Our extensive product offering and our strength in new construction in franchise retail channels have enhanced our market share during this time. This year's product introductions are performing well and are strengthening our differentiation as the style leader in the market. We are introducing channel-specific ceramic tile collections to increase our market opportunities, segmenting the commercial, new residential construction and home center channels.","We have expanded our advertising campaign to strengthen our consumer brand awareness and enhance market perception. With the strength of our brand, we're receiving greater interest from local ceramic retailers and opening new franchise stores that only offer our ceramic brand. Going forward, we're increasing participation in new residential and commercial construction centers -- sectors that are presently growing faster than the remodeling category. To support this, we're expanding our personnel to drive specifications, and introducing value-priced porcelain alternatives for large new construction projects. Best practices are being implemented to drive manufacturing efficiencies, enhance our logistics and marketing tactics, improve product life-cycle management and SKU management, as well as reduce the costs of our materials and operations. We continue to support future growth in Russia through investment in new products, increased marketing and the expansion of our sales organization and production capacity.","Our European ceramic delivered a solid performance, with increased sales in Eastern Europe, Middle East and the Far East, offsetting softness in Western Europe. To drive significant sales and operational improvements in Europe, we're implementing our strategy of a single unified ceramic organization rather than a country-by-country structure that existed before we purchased Marazzi. Within regions, we've consolidated the sales force to remove duplication of efforts and offer a comprehensive selection of products. We're improving the planning and manufacturing processes to reduce run sizes and working capital as we improve our inventory turns, though, in the short term, it is negatively impacting our overhead absorption. To lower our cost position, we're eliminating underperforming SKUs and introducing more decorative and larger-sized ceramic tiles to improve our product mix. We're enhancing our merchandising to accentuate the value of our products and introducing CRM tools for better customer support and market knowledge.","To improve our styling and reduce costs, we've approved investments to upgrade our flooring production lines that will be installed next year. We are realizing synergies across our global ceramic business, and utilizing common vendors and sharing best practices across all manufacturing.","Sales in our laminate and wood segment rose 37% over the prior year, with most of that increase coming from North America and our acquisitions of Pergo and Spano. Operating margins, excluding unusual and onetime charges, were 13%, up 380 basis points over the prior year, with significant growth of North American sales offsetting slower European markets. Our legacy North American business improved in all product categories and customer channels, driven by residential new construction and remodeling. The U.S. management team is focused on improving productivity and efficiencies across the combined Unilin and Pergo organization, optimizing flexibility to be more responsive and adding new capacity to satisfy demand for single plank laminate products. The in-sourcing of raw materials, maintenance services and boards was executed during the period. We have integrated Pergo's freight and distribution with the Mohawk logistics system to deliver improved service and greater efficiencies.","Our Malaysian wood plant is running at full capacity, and efficiencies are improving with new automation to offset increased labor costs in the region.","In our Russian laminate plant, we are leveraging higher volumes and local materials to reduce costs.","In Ukraine, we've implemented our own distribution structure to maximize our sales as the country's economic recovery strengthens.","In Australia, we are increasing our distribution through multiple channels and broadening our product offering with the addition of carpet tile.","In both Russia and Australia, we have implemented price increases of 4% to 8% on laminate and wood to offset currency changes.","The Pergo manufacturing facility in Sweden has been closed, and we are now producing Pergo-branded laminate in our Belgian facility. New products to update the Pergo line are being refined and we anticipate introducing them in the first quarter of next year. We've approved the construction of a new luxury vinyl tile line in one of our Belgian facilities, and the line will be operational by 2014.","There are many similarities between LVT and laminate manufacturing, so we can leverage our technical design-and-click expertise to differentiate our products. Our European business continues to be soft. The most forward-looking indicators are predicting improvement in GDP, as a cyclical bottom appears to have been reached in the economy. To offset these conditions, we continue to control costs, introduce automation and deliver manufacturing efficiencies and material yields. Our new insulation board plant in France has begun production of our products. Our insulation board sales continue to grow significantly, and we're expanding our geographic reach with our new French facility. Roof panel sales continue to be hampered by lower home sales and new construction. We completed the consolidation of our Dutch roof panel plants to reduce costs. And we're enhancing our product mix with new panels that provide greater moisture and sound resistance, and are capable of spanning greater distances. Our board sales are under similar pressures from the European economy, and we are unifying our Unilin business and our Spano acquisition to reduce operating expenses and improve efficiencies.","To date, we have closed a high-cost production line, we've reduced conversion costs, improved material usage and implemented a 3% to 4% price increase to offset material inflation. We will close a manufacturing plant in the fourth quarter to further improve productivity. We have consolidated our sales organization so that customers now have a single point of contact, and are broadening our product offering utilizing the combined assets. We've identified many additional opportunities to enhance the costs and productivity of our plants, which will be implemented over time.","I'll now turn the call back over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period.","Frank H. Boykin","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $1,962,000,000, up 33% from last year. The increase was driven primarily by acquisitions, which accounted for 28% of the growth, and our legacy business was up 5%. Our gross profit was $517 million for a margin of 26.4%. Excluding restructuring, the margin was 27.7%, 220-basis-point improvement compared to last year due to strong productivity, coupled with increased volume and favorable price and mix.","SG&A dollars were $341 million or 17.4% of sales. Excluding restructuring, SG&A was 16.9% of sales, 130-basis-point improvement compared to last year, due to a continued focus on managing costs and improved leverage on increased volume. Our restructuring charges were $37 million for the quarter, which included $14 million in noncash charges. In the fourth quarter, we estimate an additional $19 million of restructuring costs, all for our 3 acquisitions.","Operating income, excluding charges, was $213 million, with a margin of 10.8%. This is an improvement in our margin of 350 basis points, driven by a combination of the performance in both our legacy business and our acquisitions.","Our interest expense was $26 million, up from last year due to debt that we put on our balance sheet related to the acquisitions. Other expense at $3 million was up over last year and was impacted primarily by foreign exchange.","Our income tax rate was 21% for the quarter and that compares to a 20% rate last year. We're estimating the fourth quarter rate at 20%.","Earnings per share, excluding charges, was $2.02, up 94% over last year.","If we move to the segments, in the carpet segment, sales were $773 million, up 3% from last year, with carpet volume and positive mix driving higher sales. Operating income, excluding charges, was $70 million, with a margin of 9.1%. This is a 290-basis-point increase driven by improvements in price\/mix, along with productivity. In our ceramic segment, sales were $767 million, up 84% over last year. Our legacy business was up 12%, with overall growth driven by acquisitions. We had improvements in both our U.S. residential and U.S. commercial businesses.","Operating income, excluding charges, was $91 million, with a margin of 11.9%, again, an improvement of 290 basis points driven by a combination of volume, acquisition performance, continuing productivity and leveraging of our SG&A.","In the laminate and wood segment, sales were $451 million, a 37% improvement over last year. On a constant exchange rate basis, our legacy business was flat, as weakness in Europe was offset by stronger North American business. Operating income, excluding charges, was $58 million, with a margin of 12.9%. The improvement was from acquisition synergies as well as productivity.","In the corporate and eliminations segment, we had a loss of $7 million and expect the full year to be about a $30 million loss.","On the balance sheet, our receivables ended at $1,154,000,000 and include $328 million from the acquisitions. Our DSOs for the quarter were 48.2 days, flat with last year. Inventories on the balance sheet were $1.6 billion and include $387 million from acquisition. Inventory days ended the quarter at 108.5 days, up primarily due to the acquisitions. We've improved both our acquisition and our legacy business DIOs, but still have some work to do. Fixed assets ended the quarter at $2,684,000,000. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $109 million, with depreciation and amortization of $82 million. We anticipate $410 million of capital expenditures and $315 million of depreciation and amortization for the full year.","Finally, free cash flow was $104 million for the quarter, resulting in total debt of $2.3 billion. Our leverage improved to 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA, as we generated good cash flow in the quarter.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Mohawk today is in the strongest position in our company's history. We have substantially grown our profits and expect continued improvement next year. We have the most effective management team ever, and each of our segments has a well-defined long-term strategy to improve our business. With our Pergo, Marazzi and Spano acquisitions, we are quickly moving to drive synergies, lower costs and increase topline growth. We have already executed many initiatives to improve the performance of these acquisitions, including implementing new strategies and organizational structures, upgrading marketing tactics and product lines, and reducing costs through best practices and closing high cost assets.","In our legacy businesses, each segment has defined significant opportunities to deliver improved results as the U.S. business strengthens and we strategically invest in our products, capacities and organization.","With these factors, our guidance for the fourth quarter earnings is $1.66 to $1.75 per share, excluding restructuring or acquisition costs. We have an aggressive improvement plan for 2014 and beyond. Over the next few years, we intend to expand faster than the economy as our category rebounds in the U.S. and abroad, improve our costs and efficiencies across our new and old businesses, and expand into new product categories and markets. We have the management strength, the balance sheet and the vision to maximize returns to our shareholders.","We'll now be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions, and I'll defer to others. First off, the carpet margins, trying to get a sense -- they were terrific. How sustainable would they be? I understand that you have some more capacity coming online, you've got a new polyester mix that may degrade the overall margins a little bit, you've got the new fiber after the transition for the commercial business that may impact mix and margin. How should we look, Frank, at the carpet margins over the next couple of quarters or so?","Frank H. Boykin","We'll tag team on that, Jeff and I. I would say that the margins in the carpet segment over the next several quarters will continue to improve as we compare them on a year-over-year basis. Remember, we'll have seasonal impacts in both our sales and our margins, depending on what quarter we're in.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The margins improved from product mix, productivity and cost savings, which should continue. We're really focused on the SG&A costs as a percent of sales and we continue to improve our cost controls, as well as we've made recent reductions this year. We expect higher sales from expanding the polyester that you mentioned, which should help the topline, and then the commercial expectations are that we'll have higher growth and improved margins in it also.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then the final question would be, I understand in October, the industry has been much improved. Do you expect that to potentially continue into November, December? What do the year-ago comparisons look like in November and December versus that of October?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Typically, October and November in normal years will be similar as you go through, then it falls off as you hit the end of the year. It's anybody's guess, but we think we're going to continue at the rates we're at.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's actually Mike Dahl on for Dan. I was hoping to follow on, on the margin angle. I guess, you guys have certainly maintained an intense focus on productivity and bringing down costs. And I think we're all hoping for the type of improvement in demand that some of those forecasts called for that you noted. But could you characterize what maybe -- what inning you think you are in as far as progress on margins, absent any meaningful rebound in demand? How much juice is really left there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","In all our businesses, we believe that we can keep improving the margins through all the actions that we've been taking over the past few years. We made substantial investments in our capital this year. We're going to make more next year than we made this year. We believe -- at the longer-term outlook, we really believe that sales rates will improve next year in the U.S., that assumes the government doesn't stop it. We've had really strong growth in the ceramic piece and -- though we're expecting that to slow somewhat. In Europe, we believe that there'll be a slight increase in the sales, but it has some risk over there. We've seen in Russia, as we talked about, the economy slowing, so we assume that growth will slow a little bit -- will slow there, but we expect to outpace the economy there. Given all those things, we still see the acquisition synergies are on track, but it's going to take full execution. That'll go beyond 2014, but there'll be many things implemented during the year. So we see the margins continuing to expand as we go forward.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then moving on, the vinyl tile line, when you say up by 2014, should we assume -- is that a 1Q? And how should we think about the amount of capacity that represents and what it can do for sales here?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The plant is being put up in Europe. What I said was it will take most of the year to get the plant up and operating, so the impact will be more in the 2015. However, we are selling LVT that we're importing from around the world into the European market as well as the U.S. market as we prepare for that.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And any sense of -- just the amount of capacity that you're bringing on?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The capacity will probably be about $100 million worth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","We had started to see some improving residential repair and remodel trends, really, late spring, early summer. Could you talk a little -- discuss a little bit more what you're seeing in the market now and, based on your past, what you would project forward for the residential repair and remodel trends? In particular, are you seeing particular types or price points doing better now, that, say, you weren't seeing 6 months ago?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","As you look at the different pieces, our remodeling business in the carpet was doing better because of the aggressiveness we're taking in the high-end part of the marketplace. We're tending to see some improvements overall, though it got a little softer lately. We think that as the home prices go up, people will become more and more comfortable spending money on their existing houses as we go through. So I mean, we're still optimistic about the remodeling business improvement.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","We're also hearing the market that there's just been a little bit more of a focus with you in particular, and I would say taking market share, but you've spent a lot of time, understandably, integrating several major acquisitions and are taking some specific efforts to further enhance your U.S. carpet sales. Could you discuss some of these programs and maybe talk about -- and I know you brought in a higher-end product this year, but what you're doing as you plan for the next 18 to 24 months in terms of product and sales programs?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We've continued to upgrade and drive the product categories. In the residential carpet, we're continuing to support the higher-end products, but we're presently in the process of introducing about 40 new products in the polyester category with new technology we call Continuum. The Continuum technology is really differentiated, where we can produce products with up to 100% recycled raw materials, as well as they have better attributes. Our commercial business, we've been transitioning our premium products to fibers we produce, and this provides a better value to the customer as well as higher margins. Though in the short term, it's impacted the top line a little bit, but we believe it's going to significantly enhance our position. We think we're well positioned for the market as it changes. We've done a lot of things to enhance our sales execution in the marketplace, use better information tools to drive change through our organization and be able to communicate to our customers better. So we believe we're well positioned as the market improves.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's Steve Kim from Barclays. Two questions related to topline, if I could. First in ceramic, I was intrigued by 2 things you said. One, you said that you expected to expand your integration, which you -- a process, which you've started in Las Vegas, over the next 6 months in West Coast. Just want to make sure that -- that seems to suggest that you've had some success, initial success in Las Vegas, I just wanted to confirm that. And then also, if you could talk about -- in North America, you said that you thought that your sales were up double-digits, but should slow somewhat in '14. I thought that was surprising because what we just talked about, this integration going well in Las Vegas. And then also commercial really hasn't rebounded quite as strongly as we think it can, and neither with remodeling. And so I was just curious if you could put a little more color around that expectation for '14 in light of what we just talked about.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","What happened is neither the American Olean nor the Marazzi line were complete lines by themselves. And so by owning the 2 together, we're starting to merchandise them as a comprehensive offering to the customers. The first initial attempt at it was in the Las Vegas market. In addition, we had some service centers around the country that Marazzi had. They had a limited number that only sold their products. We had some in our side of the business that only sold American Olean. So the first thing is to convert those all to complete lines, so we can attract all customers in the marketplace and broaden the offering to both. In both companies, we have -- opportunities on the West Coast seem to be the greatest ones to begin with, to pull those together. And at the same time, both of those brands we sell through a distribution where its strong. So in markets where we're using third-party distribution, we're going to offer those customers the opportunity to have a stronger product line also. Depending upon the success we have at it and what happens in the marketplace, we'll determine how fast we roll it out over the next few years. The other question, I guess, is when we look over the marketplace, our growth in ceramic this year has been really high. And what happened is we've been able to grow it through new product introductions. There's new -- we're leading the market in wood looks out of ceramic, which are growing rapidly because they don't have all the problems of real wood, but you can't scratch them. So we've really captured a large part of that business. We believe they're all growing. We just think it's going to be hard to have that happen again next year.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, that's fine. It always makes sense to be conservative, so I appreciate that color. My next question relates to laminate. You had talked about the fact that in laminate, sales overall, legacy were flat, European down, North America up. My understanding is that North America represents a minority share of the sales in that category. And so my expectation was that North America was up pretty well. I just wanted to understand, is there anything out there that you have had -- been benefiting from, like a sell-in to a major -- from a major product line win or anything like that, which we have to think about as we model -- anniversarying something as we model out to 2014?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Remember, with the purchase of Pergo, Pergo was the major supplier to the high-end laminate through the home centers. So together, we now have the dominant share of the laminate business that's manufactured in the -- or sold in the U.S. as it -- so we have a much bigger position. So that business, we've been able to improve as we go forward. In Europe, the market is still tough. People are spending less. I think it's probably a lot like the U.S. market, where the home side of it is getting hurt more than the general economy. When people cut back, they cut back there. So we'll probably lag a little bit in Europe and improvement of it as the European economy gets better. I forgot what part I didn't answer of your question.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, I was asking about was there a sell-in, because you -- I was referring to the legacy business, not so much Pergo. Was there some sort of a -- something that would cause a difficult comparison on the legacy side, the Quick-Step side in North America?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I don't think so. I think I'm missing something in answering the question. We also have a wood business in our piece. The wood business is increasing sales, too, in the U.S., so that's helping the U.S. side.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, maybe that's it.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","It may be the wood piece.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Can you give us some color in terms of the higher growth that you're seeing in the polyester side of carpet? Is that cyclical because of the low price point at this point in the cycle, or is it more permanent because of new product development and the relatively lower price points of that category forward? Say, can you just give color on that and sort of how you're positioned from a mix of polyester versus nylon?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The answer to all your questions is yes. Polyester has become a more value proposition than the other pieces in the market, which is causing it to grow. It is participating across the spectrum. We are leading it in the higher-end part with soft ones. We have not participated fully in the more value categories, and we are taking actions to fully participate in that going forward.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Great. And also, I believe you had previously commented that, for the carpet segment, high single-digit operating margins, maybe more mid-cycle. And you hit 9% in this quarter. Last time you did that was 2006, and your sales are 37% lower. Given the updates in terms of -- should we still be thinking about high-single-digit operating margins as normal in carpet or have you changed that?","Frank H. Boykin","Michael, we were -- what we've been talking about is kind of an annual margin number. So you're looking at the third quarter there, which is one of our strongest quarters in terms of topline and margin, so I would say the answer is no. We're still saying kind of the normal run rate, and normalized environment is going to be 9%, 10% range.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Listen, I have a saying we use around here, \"You're halfway there.\" So wherever we get, we're expecting to go higher.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My first question has to go back to, I think, the biggest area of positive surprise for you guys, on the carpet margins. And if you look at 3Q versus 2Q, you essentially did the same amount of sales, but you did another 200 basis points of margin. A real strong sequential improvement. And so, just trying to understand, number one, what are the biggest drivers to that? I mean, you've mentioned a bunch of them in terms of mix and productivity, et cetera, some positive price as well. But I was hoping if you can break down the drivers of that. And then looking forward, it does appear that in 4Q, you are looking, at least on a consolidated basis, for margins to slow sequentially or to soften sequentially. And so, just trying get a sense of, again, number one, particularly in carpet, the drivers of the sequential improvement, the degree of magnitude there. And number two, why would the margin soften sequentially on ostensibly a similar number of sales?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Sequentially meaning next quarter or sequentially meaning next year?","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm really just talking about 2Q '13 to 3Q '13 in the first part of the question, and then 3Q '13 to 4Q '13 in the second part of the question.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","All right. First is -- I'm not sure I got it exactly right. I think that the SG&A from second to third dropped about 1%. And the 1%, as a percentage, was driven by a lot of actions we took to reduce the different costs, and we keep working on it. And I don't -- when I say reduce it, I don't want you to think we're cutting back on the things that impact the future business. We're investing in new products, we're investing in marketing, we're investing in sales groups in order to do it. But we are cutting out the things that don't give us the returns that we want. On the other side, with the manufacturing piece, we do have the improving mix. That continues as we keep selling a higher amount of higher-value products and it growing, which is one of the reasons that the sales weren't quite as high. We were so focused on driving the high end, the high end didn't grow as fast as the lower end process, which we're in the process of fixing. In the improvements, besides mix, we continue to cut cost everywhere. We continue to realign the plants. We continue to upgrade the products with the manufacturing assets, with the investments we're making. The team is really working on maximizing all the pieces. And the things we've put in place over the last 4 or 5 years are paying off.","Frank H. Boykin","And Mike, on your other question regarding the sequential change in margins from Q3 to Q4, if we have that right, that question. Normally, again, it's a seasonal issue, where sales are down and margins are generally down when you compare to the preceding 2 quarters.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I mean, the last part of December, there are very few people who buy carpet at the end of December. So I mean, we have very little sales once you get past the first week.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. No, I appreciate that. And I guess, just looking forward into 2014, when you talk about the successful focus on mix this year that's occurred as you've focused more on the higher end in carpet. At the same time, you've spent a lot of time talking about polyester and a lot of new products there to address more the commodity side, I believe -- or not the commodity, but more the value side, which does have a little bit of a lower margin. So just trying to get a sense, for next year, everything else equal, if you're just thinking about mix, would that have a positive or negative impact on margins in '14, given that you're still probably going to see some positive follow-through from the higher end?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Is that a carpet question or a total product question?","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just carpet.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The carpet, we expect the high end to keep selling more. You're correct that we're going to sell more of the mid to low price that are going to have not quite as much margin. At the same time, we're expecting an increase in the volume, which is going to give us absorption, the positive pieces there, and we're going to continue managing all the costs that we've been. So I mean, were expecting an increase in margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A question for you regarding the pricing increases that you've been putting through. As things have gotten better, are you noticing that your pricing power's improving any, so that maybe you're able to get not just the offsets to the input costs that you're -- the higher input costs that you're seeing, but potentially just getting any true pricing that's coming through in there?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I mean, we always attempt to. We have to react to the market and we have to sell at competitive market prices. I'm not sure whether it's a lot of extra price going in to -- other than all the actions we're taking to improve our mix as well as reduce our costs across -- in general. At the same time, we have to keep absorbing all the cost increases of labor and insurance and everything else that goes on. We have to offset. Not so easy.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right, right. Okay. And then in terms of -- are you seeing people moving up in terms of the kind of products that they're choosing? Is there a less sort of a move down and maybe that trend is slowly reversing itself, and you're getting people that are instead choosing to move up to a better product now?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think it's bifurcated. The people with money are trading up and buying better, but there's a whole lot of people in the mid to end that have limited discretionary income. And I'm not sure there's a lot there being moved up. It would also help if our government would help maintain our confidence in what's going on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","At the risk of beating this carpet margin issue to death, I wonder if I can just go back and kind of pick up on Mike's question, and he asked if you could explore the individual buckets. And I guess I'm going to ask you if you -- if there's any way you could help us by kind of weighting the individual buckets in terms of the influence of that 290-basis-point margin lift?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I don't have the details of that to break it down further, other than to give you the pieces that caused it.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Would it be -- with the 3 -- you talked about mix and operating and leveraging cost reductions. Would they be relatively equal in terms of their impact on that 290 basis points or was mix, by far, the biggest element?","Frank H. Boykin","I would say that productivity is actually the largest component of the improvement, but mix would be right up there with that.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, that's helpful. What are you modeling for revenue growth in carpet for the fourth quarter?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We typically don't give very specific pieces. We give you the total that we expect it to be, and you can see the trends that we're at.","Frank H. Boykin","We'd expect it to go up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Frank, I guess I'll just ask the same question backwards. In the third quarter, where was the upside relative to your initial guidance?","Frank H. Boykin","Relative to our initial guidance?","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Yes, for the third quarter earnings. In other words, you were performing probably about 10% better that what you guided us to. I'm just curious where the upside came from.","Frank H. Boykin","Are you just in the carpet segment?","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","No, no, no. It's the whole business.","Frank H. Boykin","Well, I think...","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Relative to the EPS guidance that you put out there last quarter.","Frank H. Boykin","Yes. So I would say we probably got a little more productivity across all the businesses than maybe what we were originally estimating, and the mix was a little bit better.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Also, we -- the new acquisitions, it takes a while to make sure that our financial reporting and estimating in the future -- we keep improving it. So we think we've gotten much better from where we were 6 months ago. And every quarter, we keep enhancing our confidence in the future numbers.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And by that, Jeff, do you mean the benefit of the acquisitions was better than you thought 6 months ago?","Frank H. Boykin","Well, you're generally -- to Jeff's point, you're generally a little more conservative, probably, when you're looking at outlook numbers, forecast numbers, until you become a little more comfortable with the business that you just bought.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then I think -- could you get a little bit more specific on what you're seeing in Europe? I think the phrase of yours was that it was soft. But are the rates of either decline or modest growth changing at all relative to what you saw over the last few quarters?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I'm not sure. The overall business in Europe of our legacy businesses was probably down about 4% overall. We have some categories, like insulation, growing. We've got other categories off more. So they are all over, depending upon what it is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Two questions. First of all, you mentioned a strong October earlier. I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the pace of business through the quarter and if 4Q is expected to then be materially different than 3Q. The second question relates to the acquisitions. And I'm curious how you would characterize where you are in the cycle of integrating these businesses in terms of the effort, and also what the payback curve should look like and where that should terminate.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Okay. I think that what we're trying to get across with the sales was that as we went through the third quarter, we saw some softening as we went through. And we think that in the October, it looks like it's going back to more normalized levels that we had anticipated. And what was the second question?","Frank H. Boykin","Well, on the acquisition synergies, in each of those 3 companies' acquisitions, I would say they are pretty much on track with where our initial plans were. Obviously, the Pergo acquisition would be further along than the other 2 because we closed on it earlier. But -- and we'll see improvements. We're seeing some this year. We'll see more next year. But it's going to carry on into -- beyond 2014 before we complete the execution of all that.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","With the acquisitions, I mean we closed up multiple plants already. We have integrated the organizations. I mean, we have some things that we're looking to make some large investments to throw out old assets. Those things take a while to do. We're watching and trying to learn about the businesses. I mean, they'll continue through '14 and '15.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just going back to the carpet question again, with the refocus on polyester. As you go into the market, other than price, what would be the drivers to take some share back in that market?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","Well, we have a huge customer base that typically likes us. We have a very broad offering. We're going to expand and have differentiated products. We're the only company that can offer recycled products. I mean, in the high end, we're going to be offering 100% recycled products which the consumer likes. We think we just can execute well in the marketplace, and then we expect to be competitive.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Second question, on ceramic tile. As you put these 3 businesses together, American Olean, Daltile and Marazzi, the concept of doing retail ceramic tile, like you're doing in Russia, in the U.S., is that something that could be on the radar screen?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We don't see any way that it's appropriate for the U.S. marketplace. In Russia, what happened was there really was a lack of distribution and retailers and methods to go to marketplace. They -- at points and places there, they sell stuff out of the back of trucks in fields. So it's just an immature market that allowed us to be in that position at this point. The U.S. is very mature, and it wouldn't make any sense.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Gentlemen, with the success in the Marazzi acquisition in the U.S., I wonder if you could -- you talked about a 2% to 4% price increase to cover costs, can you describe how the competitive landscape is changing, given your size and your distribution, and how your competitors -- fragmented competitors, largely, I guess, imports, have been responding to date?","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","I think it's a little early to either know or answer the question. Most of the things we've been doing are on the backside of the business about how we operate it to get in place. We're looking to utilize best practices across the business. We're looking to improve the design of the products. We now have a broader offering of the products. And then, you're right, we're going to go to market in a stronger position. The competitive position is that a larger and larger amount of the U.S. needs are being manufactured in the U.S. There's companies in Europe that have opened or are opening manufacturing in the U.S. to try to participate in it. And so in most of the markets, the majority of it comes out of the local manufacturing. So we see that as a positive and we're well positioned for it. On the other hand, we also have -- where most of it's coming in from is either China or Mexico, are the 2 biggest pieces, and we have positions in both markets so we can support those. So we think we're well positioned. What everybody else is going to do, they'll have to develop their own strategies.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Understood. And could you -- since you mentioned China, it hasn't been, obviously, something you've been talking about in terms of the JV. Any comments there would be appreciated.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","The Chinese market, there is dramatic overcapacity in the marketplace that's going on. We have reduced our costs in the marketplace to improve our manufacturing within it. We're upgrading our product line within it to improve the margins. We're getting benefits out of exporting products that make sense to bring to the U.S. and Mexican marketplaces. We're manufacturing specific products in our plants just for those marketplaces. With our sales in Marazzi, we have sales forces around the world that we think we can utilize those capacities to ship more around the world, and we have opportunities to achieve it. We're not achieving the profitability that we would like over there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dillard Watt from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Dillard Watt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Going back a little bit on the -- your comment about perhaps being a little more -- or a little less conservative on forecasting acquisitions. Wondering if you maybe could give us an update in terms of have you changed what you think your synergies can be in the various acquisitions or are we still maybe at the same level? Just if you could kind of walk us through the 3 acquisitions, let us know if there has been any changes to the synergy estimates.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We had a fairly good estimate of what we were going to do with each of the acquisitions. We had a long list of opportunities with each one that we're in the process of executing as quickly as possible. We're moving down those things. If I had to give you any surprises about the acquisitions, the positive ones would be the U.S. market is doing better than we had expected with Marazzi. The European market, we had really anticipated dropping more in sales. We're surprised positively by shipping stuff to other marketplaces to keep the sales up. The Russian business, the surprise there is the economy was growing probably 4% to 6% higher a year ago, and we anticipated the Russian marketplace staying better, so it's declined a little more than we had expected. The transition with Pergo is going as expected. We hope to come out with new product lines to really enhance the position of Pergo in Europe, because their assets were really outdated, and we can significantly improved the value and styling and design that we bring to marketplace and that should be executed in the first quarter. The Spano business, we're going through -- it's going to take longer because there's more changes in realigning the assets of Spano, because the 2 companies are basically in the same marketplaces and so there's a lot of opportunities to realign the manufacturing assets. We said we've shut down one line and we've announced the closing of another. There are other opportunities to take advantage of them. And the businesses, in some cases, there are some major capital investments that can be done in some to throw out even older, poorer assets than we're doing. And some of those will take more than a year or more from the time we order them to get them and implement them. So I think we're going right along where we had expected, and no big surprises.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'd turn the call back over to the presenters.","Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum","We believe we're well positioned in the marketplace. We believe the U.S. marketplace is going to keep improving. There's a good chance that Europe has hit bottom and will improve. We're executing well, and I'm really proud of our management and how well they are implementing all the changes and adapting to the marketplaces. We appreciate your support. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14979":["Mohawk Industries, Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, October 27, 2017.","Thank you. I would like to introduce Mr. Frank Boykin. Mr. Frank Boykin, you may begin your conference.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries quarterly investor conference call. Today, we'll update you on the Company's results for the third quarter of 2017 and provide guidance for the fourth quarter.","I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers.

Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. In the third quarter Mohawk delivered record earnings and EPS were sales growing approximately 7%. Our business outside the United States experienced the strongest revenue growth as economies of those countries expanded. In the period, we overcame rising material cost disruptions from hurricanes and reduced pattern revenues.","Our price in mix continue to improve as we enhanced our product offering with unique designed and differentiated features. To recovery material inflation, we implemented enterprise-wide pricing actions this year. And with productivity and mix we cover a higher cost earlier than we expected this quarter.","Our many operational initiatives and process improvements resulted in significant productivity gains of approximately $49 million and we incurred $8 million of start-up cost in our results. For the full year, we are investing $900 million to optimize long-term results by entering new product categories, extending our reach into new geographies and facilitating growth in our existing businesses.","These projects include ceramic expansions in Mexico, Russia, Italy and Poland additional premium laminate, engineered wood, rug and polyester carpet capacity in the United States and increased premium laminate capacity in Europe and Russia.","Our investment will satisfy increasing demand for our products as well as introduced state-of-the-art manufacturing technology to further our position as the industry's innovation leader. During 2018, in the United States we will launch production of rigid LVT as well as quartz countertops.","In Europe, we will enter the rigid LVT carpet tile and porcelain countertop business. And in Russia, we will open a manufacturing plant to participate in the large sheet vinyl market. Our strong financial position allows us to aggressively grow through both internal investments and acquisitions.","This year we've completed four acquisitions that broadened our product offering and enhanced our manufacturing advantages. Combined all of these initiatives will allow us to drive our long-term profitability and outperform the market.","With our strong management team and balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue our extraordinary performance of the last five years. In the United States job creation has been solid throughout the year and consumer sentiment remains positive. The U.S. economy and housing market continues to grow at a more measured pace even with the disruption of September's hurricane.","Single family housing starts are growing a multi-family construction is contracting this year. The October National Homebuilders Association showed builder confidence rising to the highest levels since spring. Remodeling trends are projected remain strong in recovery in Florida and Texas regions, will fuel substantial renovation and rebuilding.","The October architectural building index shows positive commercial and institutional building trends in most of the country with a slight softening in the west. Outside the United States, the international monetary fund has increased this forecast for economic growth in Europe and in Russia through 2018.","Now Chris Wellborn, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will provide you an overview of our segments performance during the third quarter.","Chris Wellborn","Thank you, Jeff. Our flooring rest of the world segment had an exceptional quarter with majority of our manufactured product sales and earnings growing dramatically. Our pattern revenue is running at a higher rate than we anticipated due to the broader use of our patterns and increase in worldwide sales of the LVT.","During the period our price increases and mix improvement offset our inflation in currency changes. Third quarter results were also enhanced by a reduction in summer shutdowns allowing us to shift more and customers increased purchased prior to pricing actions in either of which will occur going forward.","Our laminate innovation in proprietary structures and waterproof technologies is increasing the selection of our products by customers who would ordinarily purchase wood flooring. This combined with our broader ray of sophisticated designs is expanding our lead in the premium laminate category.","In this quarter, the start-up of our state-of-the-art laminate equipment will enable us to expand this growing category and broaden our distribution. The utilization of LVT is continuing its rapid acceptance in the marketplace. We are using the value of our well-known brands to segregate different channels and price points to address all components of the LVT market.","Our present European LVT manufacturing is running at capacity and our new plant will begin operating by the end of the year. The new plant will expand our capacity of flexible LVT as well as produced rigid LVT.","As always we will bring new innovations to LVT to differentiate our value proposition in the marketplace. Our process improvements and investments in leading technology continue to reduce our cost, enhancing our position as the LVT market gross and becomes more competitive.","We improved the visuals in the sheet vinyl to offer a value alternative for LVT and we are increasing our participation in the commercial sheet vinyl sector. We are exporting products to Russia they are prepared for our new sheet vinyl plant which will be operational by the end of next year.","We are also expanding the segments commercial sales force to increase the specification of sheet vinyl, LVT and our upcoming corporate tile collections. Our new commercial corporate tile plant should initiate limited production in the fourth quarter.","Our insulation business has improved as we have aligned our pricing with the dramatic inflation of raw materials. Our production is still being limited by material shortages, which we anticipate will be resolved early next year.","If our raw material cost remain elevated it may encourage the substation alternative insulation products that could impact our sales of these products. Sales and margins in our wood panel category have increased as the market strengthens.","In the quarter, our global ceramic segment sales increased 9% as reported and 7% on a constant days in currency basis with the strongest growth in Russia and Mexico as well as in our acquisitions in Italy and Poland which have been integrated with our existing European ceramic business.","The segment's operating income rose 5% as reported and 10% on an adjusted basis driven by improved productivity and volume. New capacity came online during the period with new production in Mexico and our modernized commercial tile plan in Italy. These capacity increases will allow us to more aggressively expand our future sales.","Our U.S. ceramic business was softer than we anticipated due to the impact of hurricanes in two of the country's largest ceramic markets. Though the recovery on these regions has begun we are projecting lower volumes through the end of the year.","As our new ceramic capacity comes up transitioning sales from outsourced products to manufactured products is taking longer than we anticipated, additionally the timing of product changes for some of our large customers was delayed.","We anticipate our fourth quarter ceramic sales will improve as we execute more aggressive sales strategies. We have introduced new porcelain collections with greater durability and patterned its slip resistance highlighting the easy maintenance safety and health benefits of our products.","In the third and fourth quarters of this year, we are opening about 15 tile and stone centers in the U.S., at key U.S. markets. In the period, our manufacturing plants were operating at record levels for volume quality and cost. We continue to expand our countertop sales and distribution significantly increasing our participation in the quartz category just for our upcoming production.","We are reconfiguring a site in Tennessee to install new QUARTZ manufacturing equipment which should begin operations by the end of next year. Our sales and margins in Mexico increased as we broadened our product offering and enlarged our customer base. We have completed the expansion at our [indiscernible] plant and all the new production lines are presently operating. This additional capacity with capabilities to make larger higher value sizes in ceramic will allow us to expand our sales in the U.S., Mexico and South America.","During the period, our European ceramic business increased dramatically with growth in our local markets and the addition of our Italian and Polish acquisitions. We are implementing many investments across the region to improve our productivity and introduce new product innovation.","The final upgrades at our Italian commercial porcelain plant have been completed and we are expanded our offering to utilize our new operations. We have just completed our major European ceramic trade show where we introduced new collections differentiating each of our brands.","Our new ceramic slab manufacturing is progressing as planned and we are finalizing our large countertop and wall panel collections to enter this new category. We are improving our product offering in the Bulgarian market as we invest a pretty larger sizes and improve our efficiencies.","We have implemented our Italian information system in Bulgaria and we are preparing to deploy the system next year in our recent acquisitions. We have started up the ideal assets at our polish plant and we are installing additional equipment to broaden our position in the Northern and Central European markets.","The Russian economy has bottomed out and the country's GDP has started to grow. The Russian ceramic industry's volume and margins are presently at a cyclical level. Our ceramic business is meaningfully outperforming the industry and we are adding capacity to increase our share as the market expands. With our premium designs, distribution and network of owned and franchise shops, we are well positioned as the market leader.","For the quarter, our flooring North America segment's profitability decreased as reported but increased 11% on an adjusted basis with adjusted margins growing 140 basis points as sales rose 2%. Our price mix and productivity improved during the period covering increases in material and other inflation. By improving the efficiency of our administrative operations we lowered SG&A as a percentage of sales even as we expanded our sales organization to foster greater engagement with our customers.","Our new product introductions improved our average selling prices and margins and process innovations and investments in manufacturing technology improved our cost. Capacity limitations in laminate, LVT and some residential carpet categories constrained our sales during the period and will be addressed in the fourth quarter.","Additionally, the hurricanes in Texas and Florida interrupted normal purchasing patterns and impacted our sales during the period. After a short-term decline we anticipate increased sales in these regions over the next two years as the affected communities repair [indiscernible].","During the period, our soft surface sales growth exceeded hard surfaces which were constrained by production limitations. Growth in our residential carpet outpaced our commercial sales. In carpet, we announced a 5% to 6% price increase on our products affected end of this year to cover our increasing costs. With their superior softness and performance attributes, our smart strain collections continued to take market share, expanding our leadership in the premium market.","Presently, our new smart strain self reserve and aero introductions are being installed in leading retail stores around the country. Each of these collections offers a unique differentiating proposition to the consumer. We are increasing the distribution of our luxury care stand brand which provides leading style and design in premium carpet.","Our continuum polyester continues to expand its position as the medium to low-end price points and our soft collections made of recycle materials provided superior alternative in the category.","In commercial, the specialization of our sales force by end market has increased the specification of our products, our award-winning carpet tile collections and squares, rectangles and planks work together to provide designers with unsurpassed options to create unique designs in every commercial space.","We are broadening our offering at mid-price points to provide more sterilized options and increase our share. With new product collections and the expansion of our sales force, we are increasing the non-specified sales of our commercial collections in the retail channel.","We have enhanced the productivity of our U.S. LVT operations and we are expanding our product offering in both residential and commercial categories. We introduced a proprietary rigid LVT collection designed for exceptional stability and durability as we prepare for new U.S. LVT production in the second quarter next year.","When the alliance complete, we will be the only U.S. manufacturer positioned as a competitive alternate to imports that can supply both high quality rigid and flexible LVT. We anticipate that the LVT market will continue to grow at high rates for the foreseeable future. And next year's capacity expansion will extend our position as the largest domestic manufacturer in the category.","Our new laminate production will be operational this quarter and will allow us to expand a successful waterproof laminate that improves on mother nature in both performance and visuals. The increased capacity will allow us to extend the distribution of our new collections and enhance our premium position in the marketplace.","I will now turn over the call to Frank, who will review our financial performance for the period.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Chris.","Net sales for the quarter were $2.449 billion up 7% over last year, with the legacy business growing 3% on a constant exchange rate basis. We had our strongest growth in the rest of world segment for the quarter.","Our gross margin as reported was 32%, excluding charges the margin was 32.5% and was favorably influenced by $63 million of price mix and $40 million of productivity. These were partially offset by $61 million of input cost inflation as well as lower IP.","SG&A as reported was 16.5% of net sales or 16.3% excluding charges which were slightly better than last year. Productivity of $9 million offset investments back into SG&A of $6 million. We had unusual charges in the quarter of $17 million which were primarily related to plant consolidation in the flooring the North American segment and acquisitions related to charges in global ceramic.","Last year, we had a net benefit of $12 million related to a legal settlement. Our operating margin excluding charges was 16.2% up slightly over last year. The results were positively impacted by $62 million of price mix and $49 million of productivity offsetting this $61 million of input cost in IP.","If we look at income tax, the rate for the quarter was 27.6% that compares to 26.4% last year. We expect the rate to be 27% to 27.5% in the fourth quarter. In 2018, we expect the full year rate to range between 28.5% and 29.5% as the geographic mix of our earnings shifts to higher tax jurisdictions.","Earnings per share excluding charges was $3.75 and increased 7% over last year. Moving to the segments, in the flooring rest of world segment, sales as reported were $523 million or up 13%. This was an 8% increase on a constant exchange rate basis. We had an extremely strong growth in most products with volume adding $8 million along with accelerated implementations of price increases as the price mix contributed $29 million to the quarter.","In our operating income margin excluding charges, it came in at 16.2% with price mix of $28 million and productivity of $8 million which helped to mitigate $22 million of input cost inflation as well as IP loss.","In the global ceramic segment, sales as reported were $893 million or an increase of 9%. FX and acquisitions added approximately 8% to growth even with storms product transitions and delayed load ends that we had as headwinds. Operating income margin excluding charges was 16.8% with productivity of $16 million and volume of $8 million covering input cost increases of $10 million.","In the flooring North American segment, sales as reported were [$1.032] [ph] billion up 2% over last year. The storms in capacity limitations were headwinds but price mix of $41 million drove higher sales performance.","Operating income margin excluding charges was 16.7% that was up 140 basis points with $32 million of price mix and $25 million of productivity offsetting $29 million of input cost increases.","In the corporate and elimination segment, we had an operating loss of $10 million; we expect $35 million to $40 million of loss for the full year.","We jump to the balance sheet, receivables and debt to quarter at $1.656 billion with days sales outstanding of 58 days. Our inventories ended the quarter to $1.911 million. We had 112 days of inventory on hand with raw material inflation and source product growth impacting the days.","Fixed assets were $4.1 billion with third quarter capital expenditures of $229 million and depreciation and amortization of $114 million. Currently, we are estimating full year CapEx of almost $900 million with an estimated depreciation and amortization of approximately $450 million. Our total long-term debt was $2.7 billion with leverage at 1.5x debt to EBITDA.","I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank.","In the fourth quarter we anticipate that the business will improve as we benefit from innovative new products, increased volume and the performance of our recent acquisitions. We expect higher sales with the release of some of our capacity constraints enabling us to expand our market position. During the period, we will absorb higher start-up cost estimated at $15 million, our results as new operations come online. The destructions caused by the hurricanes in the U.S. should diminish as those markets begin their recovery.","Greater productivity, better product mix and price changes should improve our fourth quarter results overcoming the reductions from our expired patents. Taking all this into account, our EPS guidance for the first quarter is $3.25 to $3.34 excluding any one-time charges. We are leveraging our strong financial position to invest in the business at record levels expanding our capacity in most categories, broadening our product portfolios and entering new markets.","The four acquisitions we have completed are enhancing our results and further our global strategy. Next year, start-up cost and marketing investments of our new operations will vary quarter-to-quarter, as we expand our business into new products and geographies with many of the benefits in future years as our utilization increases. Our organization's ability to maximize internal investments and execute acquisitions around the world will deliver greater long-term growth and profitability.","We will now be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital.","Bob Wetenhall","[Technical difficulty]","Jeff Lorberbaum","We are having a hard time hearing you.","Bob Wetenhall","Can you hear me okay?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Better.","Frank Boykin","That's better.","Bob Wetenhall","All right. Good. Nice Job in a tough quarter given the hurricane, Jeff, there is a lot of capital spending this year; it looks like it's gone even higher to $900 million. And I was hoping you could give us the view on the trajectory of sales gains you are going to experience from this. What's the sales impact in 2018, 2019, I'm not really talking about the quarter, I'm talking kind of big picture in the next two to three years. You got the $900 million this year, which is more than you spent last year. What's the sales benefit, what's the cadence look like?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Listen, our internal investments provide the highest returns of anything we can do. We said before that the capital expenditures of last year and this year would add about 1.4 billion of new capacity to our existing businesses. And ceramics were expanding in four countries and the U.S. were expanding laminate, wood, rugs and carpet were expanding laminate in Europe and Russia were entering new products and geographies across the world to give us new opportunities. In the U.S., we are going into rigid LVT in quartz countertops. In Europe, we are entering the rigid LVT carpet top and porcelain countertops and Russia we are going into sheet vinyl.","All these investments should help us drive the growth depending upon which one they are if we are going into new categories and businesses the growth that fill up will take longer than the ones that were already in the market with existing infrastructure.","Bob Wetenhall","Jeff, that's helpful. Maybe you could talk to me a little bit about SG&A spending, it seems and correct me if I'm wrong, the dollar spend on CapEx is really to add capacity and to improve productivity. But, if it's going to be -- have more product coming to market, you are going to have to invest in marketing and distribution, how should we be thinking about SG&A, what you are doing on the distribution and marketing side to get the product to the consumer?","Chris Wellborn","We have already started investing in different SG&A even as the business so -- we gave up some of the leverage we could have had this year by putting more sales people in or putting more products in the marketplace, will have additional costs as we drive it further in each one, we talked about putting, expanding our commercial sales force in Europe to sell the different products, we are going to have to invest in the sales people to sell the products in Russia and around the world.","What happens is, the cost are front end loaded in front of the sales, because you have to put the investments in before, so it will have an impact on using some of the leverage we would have had.","Frank Boykin","The market we have invested through three quarters this year is about $20 million in SG&A for all these types of marketing sales investments that we are referring to.","Bob Wetenhall","Maybe you can give a sense, just think taking off what you said, is it fair to say Bill, there has been a bigger increase in CapEx to grow capacity, you will be increasing your investment in marketing and distribution next year on the distribution side and it's kind of good a mirror what's happened with CapEx? And any guess\u2026.","Frank Boykin","It will go up. Now, some of it would be in the start-up costs that we break out for you because you have to put in all of the investment upfront and some of it we will give it you there as we did this year.","Bob Wetenhall","But, that's already starting to be a band, and that will continue a little bit into the first half of next year, correct?","Frank Boykin","It will continue all through next year as we are making a lot of investments, so that the business does well not just now but next year and the year after.","Bob Wetenhall","Got it. And so you are investing basically through the SG&A, so you get the distribution for the capacity you are adding and that's kind of going to help enable you to get to your top line target?","Frank Boykin","Once we get the business up where we expect and the SG&A as a percentage should start coming down.","Bob Wetenhall","Got it. So, was there something we could look at like an investment period that it peaks in the -- some point in the second half 2018 or 2019 and starts to decline on a relative basis, you get the leverage back?","Frank Boykin","Now, given all of the number of projects we have as I told you they are coming in at different points in time, so, each one of them will have those investments at the front end of each one. And then, they could be pairing off as the next one picks up.","Bob Wetenhall","Got it. So, this is going to be a multiyear base project since you roll out. Helpful color. Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much guys. Strong quarter. Good job. Interesting stuff, I wanted to -- I know you are doing a ton of different projects all around the world, then obviously, you touched on that in Bob's question in your opening remarks. But, one of the things that I thought might be helpful as we are just getting to the point where a lot of this capacity is starting to be turned on, and then, getting loaded, can you help us understand in 3Q what capacity was open in 3Q and actually shipping in 3Q that was not in 2Q? And in 4Q, what's going to be opening up or what will be shipping that was not in 3Q understanding that the longer term trajectory here, just I think the near term cadence might be helpful, if you give different color?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think in Q3 what came online was a plant in Mexico that has started out then all three lines are running, so it's started coming up and then we finalized the replacement of equipment in Europe and our ceramic commercial plant so that capacity is up and running now.","In the fourth quarter, if I can get all the timing right, the fourth quarter, the LVT plant in Europe is starting to come up, the laminate new capacity in the United States is coming up, I think the laminate capacity in Europe is coming up and let's say the carpet tower is coming up in the fourth quarter, they will just in limited ways. And then, I think maybe some capacity in Russia might be coming up and a [slam] [ph] line in Europe, I think might be coming up. This is just to name a few.","Listen, I deserve an award just to be able to remember all of it.","Stephen Kim","I was going to say. It is remarkable the your 3Q rest of world was up and strong as it was when -- I heard you mention was an EU, European commercial plan, are you sure there wasn't any sort of additional capacity brought on in flooring rest of the world in 3Q versus 2Q?","Jeff Lorberbaum","That was an exceptional quarter for all our various manufacture products we are growing dramatically. We got the positive impact of price and mix offsetting currency and inflation. We got the patent for higher than we projected to the broader use of our technologies and increased sales of LVT.","And then, the other thing that did help, we reduced the summer shut down, we actually staff different this year in order to allow us to run through some of the summer shut downs differently in Europe, so that gave us more to sell.","And then, one more, some of the customers increased purchases ahead of price increases as we go through. So all those things happen and because of those, we don't anticipate the same level of improvement in the next quarter.","Stephen Kim","Got it. No, that's helpful. Understand. Great. And then, second question, just wanted to talk about ceramic, obviously some people are going to be zeroing on that, segment which had some challenges and you are not specifically quantifying hurricane and I understand that. When you rattle through or sort of went through the various things that we are driving the softness there, it sounded like most of those were things that will dissipate, possibly as quickly as in the fourth quarter.","So, but then in your opening remarks Chris mentioned something about new sales strategies making you feel that the business will improve in 4Q. And so I just wanted to understand, even if you didn't have these new sales strategies which I assume will be successful wouldn't be so much you're seeing so far in October, wouldn't we think that the dissipation, the source, transition and the large customers postponing and things in the hurricanes that were not, wouldn't that pretty much allow for an improvement in the ceramic even before the sales strategies?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Well you've asked a lot of question. Let me see; let's see if we can do the hurricane things first. The hurricane impacted us in larger markets; there is really a lot to tell what people would have ordered when they didn't order it. But we put together, I guess some of the things internally and I guess we'll give it. We believe the hurricanes impacted our U.S. businesses somewhere between 1.5% and 2% in sales.","Stephen Kim","Got it.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Now just one more to remind you, all the different products going in flooring is one of the last things that goes in after replace the roofs, the windows get the water out of the walls. So whatever happens, we're trailing a little bit for most of the other product categories as we go through. And we anticipate less impact in the fourth quarter from the hurricanes and over the next over the long-term we're expecting it to help our business. Chris do you want to give some overview on the ceramic growth.","Chris Wellborn","Yes, Steve. The way I would think about ceramic, first if you look outside the United States we're growing very rapidly, Mexico, Russia, new acquisitions and we're in the positives of adding capacity to make that even grow better. We've got a couple of transitions in the United States as we're bringing up our new capacity, we are transitioning product that we were sourcing before we'll now make it, but what has to happen is you have to move out the old product and let the new go in which is happening right now that will continue going into the fourth quarter and strengthened next year.","The second is we've got new business with large customers; we are taking out the old product and waiting for them to take the new product. Again that transition will help us a little bit in the fourth quarter, but mainly next year.","Stephen Kim","Excellent. Thanks very much guys, great job.","Chris Wellborn","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Dahl of Barclays.","Mike Dahl","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow-up on the last comment regarding the transition happening within the ceramic production. I think you've mentioned that it's taking longer than originally anticipated to go through this transition from sourced internal. Can you just give us a little more color on, what's drawing that out more than you anticipated?","Chris Wellborn","Well, what's happening and let's take the new technical capacity that we're adding to abuse commercial products. What you have to do is take those source products that have been specified reduce those and then go get new specifications for your new products which will be at a higher profit and help us going forward, but it takes a while to go through that transition.","Mike Dahl","Got it. And in terms, I guess there is nothing is it, I guess what am I getting at is, is it a market issue or internal production issue that's leading to that timeline to be different than what the original anticipation was?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Listen its certainly different in our original anticipation, what happens is, when you are sitting there with tight capacities you can't go out and aggressive sell things when you are putting a new capacity, don't know exactly when the date is going to start up and where it is. So, you can't start selling it, then some of the customers make other arrangements and then they are just waiting for us to walk in and say here we are today after the equipment start to run it. I mean it's not turning the light switch on and off.","Mike Dahl","Okay, understood. And then regarding the expansion into countertops, I think you mentioned that you're reconfiguring at Tennessee facility, which facility was that and how should we think about kind of the size and number of lines that is planned once you get that up in running, what the countertops?","Chris Wellborn","Well, it's not a site that we had, it's a site that we bought that was used for something else, and we're putting in our quartz production capability into that site. We think the countertop markets is great opportunity for us its $5 billion with quartz estimated at $1.2 billion and growing more than 10%. We're already expanding the sales of quartz through our stone centers. This new plant will be operational at the end of 2018.","Jeff Lorberbaum","It's set up to except many new lines if we choose to do that.","Mike Dahl","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse.","Susan Maklari","Good morning.","Frank Boykin","Good morning, Susan.","Susan Maklari","My first question is around the Chinese government recently put a permit in place limiting the ways that they are taking some of the imports that they are taking from the U.S. and that seems to be impacting, some of the bottle recycling prices that are out there. Given your backward integration and incorporate specifically, do you see any of that coming through and how should we think about that relative to maybe some of the inflation that you've been seeing that business?","Chris Wellborn","The bottle market is unusual market you go though at times of the year people drink a lot of them other times they don't at different points in time that exports will be really high and really low. And it, goes all over it's a fluid marketplace, its supplying demand that goes up and down as the bottles get more and less in supply. And, what we do is look over the price over the entire year and try to average amount for the whole year. And I think that, it's a moment where the Chinese taking less it should help us in the piece, but on the other hand as more people are using it.","Susan Maklari","Okay. So you haven't seen any net benefit to-date yet from that bottle?","Chris Wellborn","Listen there is fluctuations everyday and daily we fight these things, it's an open market, you bid on them as they go and you get what you get at different prices, it's not a, there is 100s of people doing them at different markets, there is different freight to get from different places. It's not homogeneous like you think.","Susan Maklari","Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then you know you mentioned that you've been seeing a bit better trends in the pattern revenues than what you had been initially sort of forecasting or expecting. Can you give us a little bit more color there, how sustainable is that and how should we think about that relative to the $35 million run rate?","Chris Wellborn","So originally, we said it was $35 million, we said last call that we thought it was coming in higher than it was, but we found is the other patterns which, we have a broad use of them in designs in both designs, features and benefits that different people use around the world and laminate as well as into LVT. So the broader use of it is going on. The increase in LVT sales is just happening around the world as we go through as helping it. We decided not to be specific about the IT going forward, because it really impacts our execution as we go through with the as we try to maximize it and we're just kind of treat it like other products.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baugh from Stifel.","John Baugh","Okay for the good intro. Good morning gentlemen. Let's see, I had a kind of a question on LVT and its growing rapidly here, I presume its growing internationally as well. And I'm just wondering Jeff as you look at that, how that affects Mohawk obviously, you are one of the largest, but not the largest producers of LVT in the world, I presume you are still there outside to some degree and you are adding capacity, but also disrupt some of the other categories of flooring and I'm just wondering from your perspective, is there a mix favorable on margin from this, does it offset though by some things that maybe you don't, won't be able to produce as much of in fixed plan. And any thoughts there?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Its first the U.S. is a head of the rest of the world in the use of the LVT. And there is more at more use of it in different commercial and residential uses as well at different price points and its evolving. What happens is we think we're putting ourselves in the best position by having the lowest cost and largest capacity in the U.S. to support it. And we really haven't really started pushing the extremes what we had because, we haven't started bringing the differentiations and features and benefits as much just trying to get the start up as we have now ready to move forward that and the new plant will put us in the faster growing rigid place in the U.S. It will impact the growth rate of the other products if it keeps up at this rate, we think it grew more than 20% there is really no good method of getting the information how much is being sold, is all kinds of estimates all over, I don't know how good they are, as they go through. Also in the U.S., the distributors are selling a lot of it importing it from somewhere else and we think that we can take some share from the Chinese over there. In Europe it's not quite in the same spot, it's not as far long as it is and we have more capacity over there and we have a bigger share of what's going on over there. And the rigid piece is just starting well here it's been going on for a while. So, we think we'll be at the forefront of it too as it, but it will impact the there is only something, the floors haven't changed because we're putting new products in.","John Baugh","Correct. And it is my follow-up, I was wondering on the carpet side, where we are fairly significant cost spikes in PET and of course you primarily utilizing bottles, it sounds like there has been a price increased announced by your competitors and I presume you'll go along, but I'm wondering how that's going to play out it sounds like a favorable development for the carpet side of your business\/","Jeff Lorberbaum","The carpet side, the labor and materials have increased commodity chemicals are rising. We announced a 5% increase at the end of this year. Our other manufacturers you noted actually announced the price increases before we did.","John Baugh","Great, thank you, good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Nomura Instinet.","Mike Wood","Hi thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on the ceramic segment, you gave a lot of numbers, I'm not sure if you had given price cost impact in ceramic specifically in third quarter. But also there has been a lot of shatter in the investor community about ceramic price declines, because of new capacity additions and losing share to LVT. So I was hoping you can address that concern?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The price, really want much price and a little bit of mix on the ceramic side. And then we had inflation, but inflation was not raw materials inflation was in energy and in labor.","Chris Wellborn","Yes. We haven't had much inflation or much pricing in ceramic.","Frank Boykin","And then just another comment, over 50% of the ceramic that's used in this country is imported and it's been that way forever. I mean we always compete against the imports where they are, we had capacity constraints, I guess we're little less aggressive, its little hard to sell stuff you don't have and we're expecting next year to improve the sales and keep growing our business.","Mike Wood","Great. And the incremental CapEx the 900 versus I think 850 last quarter, curious what the reason and really for that increase, and if there was tax reform past where you can fully depreciate equipment purchases, what sort of trends that we would expect next year from CapEx?","Frank Boykin","We haven't finished the capital plan this year we haven't put it in front of the Board yet. I can tell you that the capital investments we make are the highest return do we have and usually there are lower risk than buying other things. We have a strong organization that finds new ways to do it, it's what helps our productivity go up and helps our innovation and product mix. And we're going to keep investing as long as we can find good projects to invest in.","Mike Wood","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Lovallo of Bank of America.","John Lovallo","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. I guess the first question just going back to raw materials for a second. Did you guys see any was there any disruption in the go from the hurricanes and if so, is that, some of that starting to come back on line at this point?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes. There were some disruptions, yes there was increase pricing as the capacities were limited. There is some of it coming back on stream; we'll have to see how it evolves over time, its little early to tell.","John Lovallo","Okay. And then as a follow-up, there is more and more to talk about NAFTA the renegotiations in the news given your exposure to Mexico, how you guys thinking about potential contingency plans if NAFTA where to fall apart?","Chris Wellborn","We have capacity in Mexico, we have a growing business in Mexico, we are increasing our capacity to support. We have been just recently started to moving and using the craft in Mexico to sell into the South American marketplace. We've been constrained in Mexico by our ability to support the business, we're putting new capacity in now, if the NAFTA changes we'll have to see how it affects the cost of product out of Mexico versus the rest of the world which is another as I said before 50% of its coming from somewhere and we'll have to see how well it works out. We have the largest capacity in the United States and if we need to change strategies we'll turn left.","John Lovallo","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Eisner of Goldman Sachs.","Sam Eisner","Yes. Good morning guys.","Chris Wellborn","Good morning.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Good morning.","Sam Eisner","So on the rest of world segment, obviously I know you're not breaking out the pattern income there, but I'm curious how to think about medium term, I recognize you don't give kind of margin targets, but I think we were all kind of thinking that this was kind of a low teens, maybe, low double digits type of margin business with the headwinds and now it seems like you're doing much better than that. So, curious if rebasing to higher profitability level within the rest of world segment given your new patterned revenue streams as well as better performance?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I don't know where you were, is that's I don't know how to help you. But, the pattern revenue is a higher margin percent so it goes lower, it will impact it also the patterns tend to pay lower tax rates, so it also impacts the tax rates which are affected. But we're aggressively trying to grow all the other products in Europe starting to improve and Russia is starting to improve, Mexico has been doing well. So, our business is outside the United States, you know we're anticipating will keep improving.","Sam Eisner","Got it. And then maybe transitioning over to North America, you know you commented that soft services is growing faster than hard services, if the expectation that mix, substantially improves into 2018 which also becomes a margin driver?","Chris Wellborn","As you said, we had constraints in laminate LVT and some of our residential carpet. We're expecting this quarter to get out of the limitations of those products with all the investments and stuff coming through. As our laminate production is in premium laminate LVT we're going to bring new things to the marketplace. We had something try to drive our margins and mix up as we through, we think it will improve what the, as the rigid comes on, rigid is a higher price product. So, it will participate more in it will average it up, on the other side there is going to be more pressure in LVT. But we think we'll have the right cost position to compete.","Sam Eisner","Got it, if I can maybe just sneak one more in the start-up cost for this year are $45 million have you given Frank if you've given a [indiscernible] how you guys are thinking about that in 2018?","Frank Boykin","We have just said that, we're going to continue to see elevated start-up cost probably a little bit higher as we move into next, we'll - it will be hard to say exactly how much is going to hit, which quarter, because those numbers move around, but you should see probably more the way towards the first half. But, stay tuned we'll have to focus numbers together when we get our budget together for next year.","Sam Eisner","Got it. Thanks so much guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research.","Laura Champine","Good morning. One more question on the CapEx spend, I think that the announcement today included about $50 million in incremental CapEx versus last quarter's. What's incremental in there, there are new projects or the current projects just costing more than you had thought three months ago?","Frank Boykin","I think the only incremental increase in the old projects would be some of the new ideas we spent money on in our two LVT plants as part of some of that, the rest of it is just new projects and new opportunities.","Laura Champine","Got it, and referenced in the press release\u2026","Frank Boykin","One more piece, just as you put these new things in the timing, when you get to the piece the timing of when the equipment comes in and the timing of when the bills are paid, I mean it's by throwing darts at the wall. So, I mean they could come in December, they can come in January and changes years, but it didn't change anything for us.","Laura Champine","Understood, and you did reference and comments this morning that in the North American hard surface business there were some production limitations, what does that mean?","Frank Boykin","It means that we have sold all of the laminate that we could make without putting in new capacity which is just getting started out, the men in ceramic that prior to the third quarter we were limited in what we could make and we couldn't turn it on and off as fast as we meant. What LVT we increased the capacity of our LVT through productivity initiatives we were selling all of that we could have. So, as those things reverse, we can now be more aggressive in our marketing and selling.","Laura Champine","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi thank you for taking my questions today. Before acquisitions completed in 2017, could you quantify the forward 12 to 18 month revenue contribution from each and also help sort of little bit more around with potential revenue synergies of these acquisitions? Thank you.","Chris Wellborn","We could give out any kind of sales numbers. We don't give out the detail of that level of those things and as small as they are. It just gets incorporated into the total business; there is synergies between the businesses. So, in Europe the two biggest ones are ceramic businesses which is one of the largest, it's in, it's almost across the street from our existing businesses, to show you how fast we move the slab plant that we were putting it in our plant, we actually installed it in the new acquisition business. We have integrated the administrative and marketing strategies of the each one. We're putting, we're selling products, we're selling products from made in different plants through the pieces, we're coordinating the sales efforts between the pieces. So, I mean as you would do with any acquisitions, we're doing the right things to optimize the businesses as we go forward and we're expanding the capacities in it.","Jeff Lorberbaum","And I would just remind you is that, we may have given the one of the ceramic, the largest ceramic acquisition and the number was about \u20ac150 million to \u20ac160 million of revenues annually in euros and two of the acquisitions were actually raw material backwards integration that clearly on adding revenue. So four acquisitions two were manufacturing that are adding revenue and two were backwards integration of raw materials.","Kathryn Thompson","Understood, thank you. And I know there has been a better focus throughout our earning seasons with rising raw materials would you've been effectively managing this year. But when do you look poor beyond just what's over your nose in Q4 and as you look more structurally into 2018 and beyond. What categories do you structural see, more persistent pressures and what are your thoughts about how you manage around those? And if could just, if we know that inflation is a reality and to the current market, but there are certain categories that have structurally more challenging, just helping us to frame how you think about managing that would be helpful? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The biggest ones you get in this part of the cycle, the chemical manufacturer start getting tight and typically the chemical prices start going up, irrelevant of the raw material inputs as they expand their margins. So, it wouldn't surprise me to keep having those things part of that, the thing driving the increase in our corporate prices that we spoke about. The other category I guess it has a lot of fluctuation would be wood prices both in the U.S. and Europe, they fluctuate up and down. And then the other thing you didn't really ask about was the currency changes, so we have to take all those things as they happen and try to pass them through as they incur and at the moment we think we've done the things we needed to do this year and whatever happens next year we'll react to.","Kathryn Thompson","Currency is harder to manage, the other two you can at least count where it's particularly around, so point taken. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Keith Hughes","Thank you, another question I had on, you spoken about hard service run slower than soft service in the United States. And I guess we have laminate capacity coming on the floor, are you full on capacity in the United States in flexible LVT?","Chris Wellborn","We were but what happened is, we got -- we made changes in the manufacturing and increased the capacity of LVT -- of our LVT plant there and then we have the new one coming up which should be running end of the first quarter, early second quarter.","Keith Hughes","Not the segments are solid plant, correct?","Chris Wellborn","It's a rigid plant but I have to tell you, we could make either or on it we need to.","Keith Hughes","Okay. And the changes you made to the existing capacity that help to just plug the market here in the fourth quarter?","Chris Wellborn","Yes. They will also give us, enable us to bring out some new products, we are putting new products. So what happened is, until we got the capacity to step up, we couldn't put more products in the marketplace. So what you will see in this quarter maybe the end was start putting out more products in both the commercial and residential. But, you won't see the impact up until next years.","Keith Hughes","Okay. Thank you.","Chris Wellborn","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Jeff, in responding to an earlier question, you made the observation that about 50% of ceramic is imported into the United States and then import supplied market for years. My understanding was -- it was always kind of bifurcated as a general observation between presence of imports at the high end of the market and presence of imports at the low end of the market. So, just to focus on that low end for a minute, what are you seeing in terms of change there, it is import product, I guess on the assumption I think you made the same forever, things are going to be some kind of change in presence, are they winning share or are they losing share and if you could maybe detail that a little bit, that would be helpful.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The first is, the market there -- we call it ceramic and porcelain. So, what's happening is, the porcelain product had been growing over the last five years as the start of design and differentiation. The ceramic products which are read by the products, tend to be the end and as consumer want to pay more. They want porcelain with it. So, ceramic has gotten pushed into a smaller category as you go through.","On the competition piece, it moves around the world depending upon exchange rates, capacities, excess capacities and it moves around the world, the commodity piece of it. And, if you want to sell a lot of the importance stuff, the bottom end is just the lowest price stuff. We sell as much as we want to win and but our goal isn't to be the largest commodity producer that has no value add, no marketplace as if.","David MacGregor","I guess, I'm just wondering if you are seeing improving product quality coming out of some of those foreign mills that is allowing them to creep from what may have been 20%, 25%, up to maybe 30%, 35% of the low end of the market, or just overlap with that portion.","Chris Wellborn","I don't think, we have seen much change and from where it's coming from. Like Jeff said, when the currencies around the world depending on how they change, it could fluctuate. We at the first part of this year, we kept more of our red body capacity in Mexico was we receding that market for a new expansion, so we probably had less read by ourselves during that period of time.","Jeff Lorberbaum","We don't really see a much difference in the competition as it is. The other thing just to keep in mind, when the market crash back in the downturn. I mean, we kept running our capacity through it and all the thing came out. So, what's happening is, that it comes back, it's coming -- the low end stuff, there is more of it coming in and most of it's supplied producers that don't know what to do with it rather than sell it at zero margin.","Right. It's also a lot of times, limited to the coast because when you have a low end product the freight becomes a very important part. So, unless you are talking Florida or maybe part to California. It's not so easy to bring in a lot of blow in product.","David MacGregor","Yes. That makes a lot of sense. This is my follow-up, quick question on LVT, what percentage of your mix now is commercial versus residential. And then, could you talk about profitability of North American LVT versus profitability of European markets and realize that your -- this scale differences between those few markets, which is in terms of what the market is competitively allowing.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Just to add an answer to that one. I think in the United States, the residential is probably twice as big, but not exactly as you go through, some of it got to do with the products and what we have been focusing or not, when we through we are trying to expand our commercial business we go through. And we lagged a little bit in the rigid because we were waiting on our plant, we have been importing some now. So, it's going to get bigger for us. Europe is a different market completely. We tend to focus more on the residential pieces historically because our strength in the distribution in residential as we build up our sales force over there to go in a more commercial, it should grow more as we see.","David MacGregor","And where the profitability of the two?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Commercial historically in most things is more profitable because there is more differentiation in it, they like design and sound different in it, they pay for performance features, so, typically it's a higher margin, its lower volume.","David MacGregor","Got it. Thanks and Congratulations on all the progress.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen East of Wells Fargo.","Stephen East","Good morning guys. If you look at -- wanting to bridge a little but quarter to quarter, if you look at your third quarter EPS, you are up about 7% year-over-year and your guidance for fourth quarters, sort of flattish if you will. I know you got a couple of incremental points headwind from higher start-up. But, what else would be driving the slower growth at least on an EPS basis quarter-over-quarter.","Jeff Lorberbaum","You have the -- IP is declining from where it was, the start-up cost are higher, yes, that would be the big ones.","Frank Boykin","Are you comparing pervious Q4 or Q4 this year to Q4 of last year?","Stephen East","I'm looking at Q3, your EPS is up about 7% year-over-year. And then, if you look at your 4Q guidance, it's basically flat, up a couple of percent on the year-over-year basis. So, what I'm trying to understand is there, anything that occurred last year or that's in there this year. I know your startup cost is going to take a couple of points away, but I was wondering what those other four or five point where that's coming from.","Frank Boykin","I mean that's primary, I mean start-up cost also includes to go to market SG&A investments that we are making as well that's probably more heavily weighted in the fourth quarter.","Stephen East","Okay. All right. I got you. And would the price raw material issue be meaningfully different quarter-over-quarter?","Frank Boykin","No. We think that we cover -- it's hard to tell, we're having a difficult time telling price and mix apart in it. So, we sort of have to look at them but the other in the price mix offset the most of the inflation this quarter. So, it will be about the same the next quarter.","Stephen East","Okay.","Frank Boykin","We did have in Europe when we ran in the -- longer in the third quarter this year. It brought some sales into the third quarter you would normally get into the fourth, so that was one impact. We also had buy-in for price increases.","Stephen East","Okay. All right. And that's one of the things I was going to ask, so okay, that helps. Jeff, you talked about, the best in highest use of your cash is reinvestment versus acquisition and I appreciate where you are coming from on that. Could you talk a little bit, could you give us, sort of some magnitudes of example, I don't know, what primary metric you look at to evaluate an acquisition versus a reinvestment, but can you help us out to understand how much more attractive reinvesting with the -- versus a typical acquisition?","Jeff Lorberbaum","You have to start to do there is a timing difference. So, they got to help you. There is a whole different types of pieces to the acquisitions, you have to pay for the cash flow, the existing businesses and typically you could end up with return on capital and mid-6% to 8% range when you start and then over time you have to take all the pieces you have to do, and bring it up above your cost of capital, could you pay not for the equipment, you pay for all the pieces they have done.","On the other ones, we don't pay for the cost of capital is that but depending on which one they are sometimes you have a year to investment getting the marketing setup, the broadening of the pieces. And then, when you go into the incremental investments those you already have the distribution piece, you fill them up much quicker, and so they ride. And in the end, I would -- the goal is to get the acquisition above the cost of capital, it usually takes three to five years to drive it up because the premium he paid for all acquisitions. And the other ones it depends on whether they are short or long and then you usually have a higher return in the other one when you get through and it happens earlier.","Stephen East","Okay. All right. I appreciate that. That helps me a lot there. And then, you made a comment, I think on Kathryn's question about the raw materials, you covered for now. I guess as you look at, do you think you are seeing any type of deceleration in the raw material inflation path that they are taking?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We don't believe that we are going to see a deflation. We think we are going to see an increase.","Stephen East","Yes. I just didn't know if they were moderating, I'm sorry, if you were -- if the inflation rates were moderating, the further away we get from these hurricanes et cetera?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We have a spike in some of those, but then you have the ongoing changes that you always see. The hurricanes spike, we should see moderation in it, but they were expecting increasing raw materials, this is a normal course of event.","Chris Wellborn","And Stephen, I don't know, if you are referring just to the U.S. or worldwide, but over in rest of global where we had a lot of inflationary earlier in the year that seems to have subsided inflation.","Stephen East","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Wojs from Baird.","Tim Wojs","Good morning. Just a couple of modeling questions from me. I guess, first, of the $1.4 billion for that you've talked about in the capacity adds. Could you maybe breakout what might be existing versus completely new markets for you just maybe ballparks figures. And then, second, on productivity, I think year-to-date you are almost even with what productivity was in 2016, so just anything that kind of mind around productivity if we go into 2018?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I don't in my head have a breakdown between new and existing pieces that you go through within each one. I will have to give you that one. We don\u2019t normally think of it like that. So, I mean, if that what I have off the top-off my head, the big things are -- the new products and geographies are going into rigid LVT, which we just recently started selling some in the last 6 months, importing it from China, so that's got a new business for.","We have the countertop business, which is countertops in the U.S., we are in the countertop business, selling it, but this will be first manufacturing of quartz countertops.","Porcelain and countertops is a new business for us in Europe, we are going to shift some to the U.S. and start seeding the market here and potentially open another line here to support, when the market is ready for it.","We have the carpet top business which -- the plan will be up and running limited this fourth quarter and more next year, so that's an entirely new market for us. And then in the sheet vinyl business -- the business we bought, they greenfielded a sheet vinyl plant in the United States and it's brought up doing well and the groups can do this same thing in Russia. And Russia is a big market for us. We think there is an opportunity for us.","Those are the pieces, I don't have the numbers by each of them is separating.","Tim Wojs","And then, anything just kind of think about productivity in 18?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes, never rough.","Frank Boykin","Every year everybody signs up for new productivity projects and initiatives and we will have a large number of projects next year just like we had this year.","Tim Wojs","Okay, great. Good work on the rest of the year. Thanks.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard","One question on the tile business, the U.S. tile, I think it's growing kind of low single digits 2% or 3% for three quarters now. Curious how we should be thinking about the growth rate of that piece of business moving forward?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It's going to increase. I mean, that's why we keep telling you that the first six, seven months, we didn't have anything more to sell. It's hard to grow a whole lot doing that. It's hard to be an aggressive posture in order to get new accounts and push business and so what's going to happen is next year we're going to elevate something of these things and we expect the business to grow more than it had. Now at the same time, every business we have is going to get impacted by LVT. There are some of these square feet of floors on the floor and as LVT grows at a rapid rate it's going to impact the growth rates of everything else is it. We think we're well positioned to compete in everything and we're doing things to improve our productivity and costs, we're bringing new products to market and everything. So, I mean we're well positioned to satisfy the consumers whatever they want to buy.","Eric Bosshard","Great. Thank you.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions this time. And I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lorberbaum for closing comments.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you very much for joining us. We think we're well positioned for next year and beyond. We're putting investments in to drive the business and profitability long-term. And we're really interested in the long-term growth and there is going to be more variation quarter-to-quarter with the all the aggressive actions we're taking.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, October 26, 2018. Thank you.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Frank Boykin. Mr. Boykin, you may begin your conference.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Katherine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor conference call. Today, we'll update you on the company's results for the third quarter of 2018 and provide guidance for the fourth quarter. I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Jeff?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. In the third quarter, we generated sales of $2.5 billion, up 4% compared to the prior year. For the period, our adjusted operating income was $314 million or 12.3% of sales with an adjusted EPS of $3.29. In the quarter, start-up costs related to new capital projects were $20 million, in line with our plan. Our third quarter results fell short of our expectations. Sales growth in all segments was lower than our estimates. Price increases had less impact, and we experienced more inflation than predicted. Transportation costs continued to rise due to limited availability of common carriers and higher fuel prices. Additional manufacturing reductions were required during the period to control inventory. Our LVT sales were up significantly, but were constrained by internal production. Our margins were further impacted by a decline in product mix from customers trading down, import competition due to the strengthening dollar and higher volumes in channels which use lower-value products.","In the U.S., we continued to execute additional pricing across most product categories to offset ongoing pricing inflationary pressures. Our LVT sales are expanding from both greater internal production and sourcing programs. We announced price increases on products that we import from China to pass through the new tariffs and other inflation. We are increasing our internal trucking to enhance service to our customers and control costs. Approximately 40% of our sales are outside the United States, and most of the major markets have experienced weakening. Sales growth in most of our European products slowed from the prior period, along with the economy, and margins were impacted by cost inflation and a weakening product mix.","Though political uncertainty has led to a decline in the Mexican ceramic market, we are increasing our sales with product innovation and expanded distribution. In the period, the acquisition of Godfrey Hirst added revenues of approximately $70 million, even as the Australian market slowed due to lending restrictions and reduced exports to China.","In our non-U.S. businesses, we are increasing prices as conditions permit, introducing innovative products, expanding our distribution and reducing our costs. We have many investments in new products and geographies that are in various stages of completion from presently being constructed to ramping up with limited utilization and lower product mix. Over time, these projects will progress from starting up with losses to a breakeven position and finally, to achieving our planned margins when sales productivity and product mix are optimized. The combined sales of these potential investments will exceed $1.2 billion and when optimized, should contribute margins similar to our existing businesses. Some benefits of these projects will be realized next year, but most will occur in 2020 and beyond when operating at anticipated levels.","The projects already starting up are rigid LVT and premium laminate in the United States, ceramic in Mexico and rigid LVT, carpet tile, porcelain slabs, technical tile and premium laminate in Europe. Other projects under construction include quartz countertops in the U.S., porcelain tile in Poland and sheet vinyl premium laminate in Russia. Even as we addressed the current environment, we are positive about the long-term value of these investments and our sales and profitability. We are confident about Mohawk's position in the global market and our aggressive strategy to deliver long-term profits and returns. Our Board of Directors has approved a new plan to purchase $500 million of our company's stock.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to review the segments. Chris?","William Wellborn","Thank you, Jeff. For the quarter, our Global Ceramic segment sales decreased about 1% as reported to $886 million, with challenges from inflation, pricing pressures and lower growth in most of our markets. Adjusted operating income for the segment was approximately $119 million or 13.4% of sales. During the period, our U.S. volume expanded, while margins were pressured by price, mix and higher transportation costs. Increased competition from imports due to a strong dollar and the growth of LVT continued to impact the U.S. ceramic industry. We have announced a price increase to recover freight and are taking other actions to improve our mix and margins. We're expanding our larger-size tiles, increasing our technical porcelain collections and growing our porcelain slab offering. Our patented technology to enhance the durability in slips and falls is being well accepted in both residential and commercial channels.","We're introducing commercial LVT into Dal-Tile's offering, and we are testing a number of new innovations which could be significant, including a patented technology to reduce the time and cost of ceramic installation and a patented porcelain roof tile system.","We are improving our processes to make it faster and easier for customers to place orders and pick up their products. We're enhancing our regional galleries and local showrooms to increase our premium porcelain sales and commercial specifications. In addition, we have consolidated eight service centers and are improving the efficiency of our administrative and logistics organization. As an alternative to imports, we are increasing our direct sales to larger customers who buy in truckload quantities, enhancing their supply chain.","To improve our inventory turns, we are presently manufacturing fewer units than we are selling, which is negatively impacting our costs. Next year, we anticipate that production levels will increase and approximate our sales level.","Given the changing transportation market, we're revising our distribution strategy to lower our costs by reducing the number of stops we make on each trip. A limited amount of our U.S. ceramic sales is sourced from China, and we are raising prices on these collections to offset recent tariffs. The imports from China had been the lowest-cost alternative from around the world. Because of this, our competitive tile position will improve as U.S. tariffs rise even as purchases shift to other countries.","In quartz countertops, the U.S. has initiated total duties of 44% due to tariffs and Chinese subsidies of these products. And additional penalties for dumping are expected. During the period, our countertop sales increased 15%, with quartz growing substantially more. Our quartz countertop manufacturing in Tennessee is preparing to start up in the fourth quarter. We have moved our quartz sourcing to countries that are not affected by tariffs. We should be well positioned to utilize our new quartz production as it ramps up over the next year.","Even with the Mexican ceramic market declining this year, our sales have increased as we expanded our distribution and introduced additional innovative products. We are currently launching our 2019 collections to enhance our share, improve our mix and better utilize our new capacity. We've expanded our commercial sales organization to increase specifications in large projects with designers and end users. We continue to grow the sales for our products in Central and South America. Next year, our margins should increase in Mexico with better mix and higher volumes as our business expands.","On October 15, we executed an agreement to purchase Eliane, one of the largest ceramic tile manufacturers in Brazil for approximately $250 million. Brazil is the world's third-largest ceramic tile market, where Eliane is a leader in the premium porcelain, with annual sales of about $215 million. We anticipate the acquisition closing in the fourth quarter. With additional investments from Mohawk, Eliane's strong management team will upgrade manufacturing assets, enhance product offerings and lower cost.","Margins at our European ceramic business had been under pressure due to lower industry demand and pricing as well as increased inflation. To manage this, we've introduced more differentiated collections and expanded our commercial offering to improve our mix. Our commercial sales are expanding as we open new design centers and increase our specifications with a more direct sales strategy. In residential, we are increasing our larger-size offerings in porcelain slabs as well as introducing decorative small sizes and unique thin wall tile.","We are realigning our sales force by market and channel to optimize our position in each segment. To broaden our distribution, we are offering exclusive programs for our large retailers. We are gaining traction with our new large slabs that were used in countertops, walls and floors. These slabs have industry-leading visuals and are easier to install than existing alternatives.","In Bulgaria, we are enhancing our mix with larger sizes and moving into a new warehouse to improve our service and distribution cost. We are transitioning production of lower-value ceramic from Italy to our Polish and Bulgarian operations to improve our competitive position. We are increasing our productivity and reengineering our material formulations to lower our manufacturing cost. In the fourth quarter, we will decrease our production levels to align our sales and inventories for next year.","In our Russian ceramic business, sales and volume improved but were partially offset by higher inflation. We have announced price increases of 4% to recover material and labor increases and the impact of a weaker ruble. In the period, our growth has been limited by our capacity, which we are increasing. We are expanding our design centers in major markets to increase our retail position and commercial specifications. Our differentiated products, commercial sales organization and national distribution have made us the leader in the premium commercial channel.","In the third quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales were approximately $1 billion, increasing about 2%, with an adjusted margin of 9.9%, including start-up cost of $9 million. Sales and volume did not improve as we had anticipated, and mix declined from growth in polyester carpets, customers trading down and higher sales in lower-value channels. Our realized price increases have taken longer to implement and were lower than we anticipated in the quarter. We're seeing a greater impact from our price increases as we enter the fourth quarter. In the quarter, production on our new LVT line was lower than anticipated, but recent improvements have increased output more than 30%. Due to all of these factors, it will take longer than anticipated for our margins to improve. We have announced additional carpet price increases for the end of the fourth quarter to offset further material increases from rising oil and chemical prices. Given this extraordinary inflation, we are enhancing our processes to manage pricing and ensure a more consistent execution.","Our new home construction in multifamily channels had the strongest performance during the period, and LVT continued to capture a greater share of the flooring market. We anticipate continued growth in LVT as our product offering expands, both with greater local production and sourced products. To better align our new European and U.S. LVT start-ups, the U.S. operation is now reporting to our European vinyl management, and we have transferred an experienced manager from Belgium to lead our U.S. operations. After initiating these changes, we are already seeing significant improvements in the processes and volume of our LVT production. In the U.S., we have successfully produced rigid LVT, which we'll begin introducing into the market.","Our proprietary SmartStrand Silk Reserve and patented Air.O soft flooring and luxury Karastan collections are continuing to gain share of the premium market. Our waterproof RevWood flooring is gaining share in the retail, builder and home center channels with their superior visuals and performance features. Our consolidated residential sales management now coordinates all retail products, making it easier for customers to satisfy all of their needs with Mohawk.","Our commercial sales improved as we progressed through the quarter, with hard surface sales significantly outpacing carpet. Our education, government and main street channels outperformed during the period. We're expanding our specialized sales forces to enhance our penetration in all channels. In the period, our sales backlog increased as we expanded the specifications for our innovative new offerings. We are consolidating multiple warehouses and closing two higher-cost manufacturing options - operations to improve our efficiencies.","Our Flooring Rest of the World segment delivered third quarter sales of $612 million, an increase of 17% as reported or 19% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted margin for the segment was 15.8% of sales, including start-up cost of $8 million.","As we moved through the quarter, overall market conditions softened. Our segment sales rose substantially with the recent acquisition of Godfrey Hirst. The segment's legacy growth was 4.6%, slowing from the second quarter's very strong results. In operating income, our higher sales and product mix improvements during the period were partially offset by currency headwinds and higher start-up costs. During the period, LVT led the segment's growth, along with insulation and wood panels. We are increasing prices in product categories impacted by inflation and currency headwinds.","Our LVT sales grew significantly, even though our new LVT production was constrained as we started up our new line. Engineering solutions have been implemented on the new line, and daily output has risen about 30%. We anticipate continuing incremental improvements throughout 2019 until we match the performance levels of our existing LVT lines. We do not expect to fully load the plant at the optimum mix in 2019. We are producing additional rigid LVT collections to broaden our offering and enhance our market position. These new products feature state-of-the-art realism, dimensional stability and noise suppression.","In laminate, our patented waterproof technology, combined with our unique surface textures, are enhancing our mix. The differentiated features and benefits we offer command a significant premium in the market. With our new Belgium production line, we are expanding the offering of these products. In Russia, a similar laminate production line is starting up, and we're introducing the same features to expand our distribution and capture greater share.","Our European sheet vinyl business is operating at capacity, as we bring to market innovative residential and commercial products with easier installation methods. We have announced price increases of 4% to 7% to cover cost inflation. Our new Russian sheet vinyl plant will start up by the end of the year and provide more product to sell in Europe. Our new carpet tile plant is ramping up production, and we're expanding sales by increasing our sales force and customer base as we bring greater styling and value to the market.","Our wood panels business continues to show strong results, driven by price increases and improved mix. Our manufacturing productivity has improved from investments we've made in our facilities. In the insulation business, demand for our products is increasing as material costs fall back to more normal levels.","In both Australia and New Zealand, the integration of Godfrey Hirst is well under way. The Australian housing market has weakened because of stricter lending standards, higher mortgage rates and slowing exports to China. SG&A efficiencies are being created as we merge Godfrey Hirst's operations with our local Mohawk distribution businesses. We added new carpet tile capabilities to expand our commercial business in both markets, and we've started supplying raw materials from the U.S. to broaden our product offering and reduce cost. Operational best practices are creating new ideas to improve both our U.S. and Australian operations.","I'll now turn the call over to Frank, who will cover our financial performance for the third quarter.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Chris. Starting with the income statement. Sales for the quarter were $2,546,000,000, growing 4% as reported, with our legacy business at 2% on a constant basis. Our Flooring Rest of the World segment had the strongest growth during the quarter. Gross margin as reported was 28.3% or 29%, excluding charges, and was down from 32.5% last year. Inflation of $63 million, higher start-up cost of $10 million, FX headwinds of $9 million and plant shutdowns of another $9 million offset increased volume of $29 million and productivity gains of $5 million. SG&A as reported was $433 million or 17% of sales. Excluding charges, it was 16.6% of sales and compares to 16.3% last year.","Unusual charges during the quarter were $27 million and primarily were related to the Godfrey Hirst acquisition and plant consolidation. Our operating income, excluding charges, was $314 million or 12.3% of sales. That was down from 16.2% last year. Negative mix offset our price increases, and inflation of $69 million was a drag in the quarter. Higher volume of $17 million was offset by start-up costs of $14 million, FX of $6 million and $9 million for plant shutdowns. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $445 million, and we estimate full year to be about $1.7 billion.","The income tax rate improved to 18.8% from 27.6%, as the 2017 U.S. tax reform drove the overall rate down. We estimate a fourth quarter rate of 19%, and in 2019, a full year rate of 22%. Earnings per share, excluding charges, was $3.29, a decrease of 12% compared to the prior year.","Turning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of $886 million, down 1% as reported, with our legacy business up 1% on a constant FX basis. Our Russian business reported the strongest growth in this segment. Operating income, excluding charges, was $119 million, with a margin of 13.4%, down from 16.8% last year. Inflation of $29 million and declining price and mix of $8 million was offset by $15 million of incremental productivity. In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $1,048,000,000, up 2% over last year. We had our strongest growth in LVT, which impacted most other product categories.","Operating income, excluding charges, was $104 million, with 9.9% margin compared to 16.7% last year. Lower mix offset price increases with negative productivity of $24 million and inflation of $36 million, influencing our results. Productivity was impacted by lower manufacturing and efficiency levels and higher depreciation, employee cost and SG&A. Incremental start-up costs were $8 million.","In the Flooring Rest of the World segment, sales were $612 million, up 17% over last year, with the business up 5% on a constant FX legacy basis. Operating income, excluding charges, was $97 million, with a margin of 15.8%, which was slightly less than 16.2% last year. Increased volume of $9 million and productivity of another $9 million, along with $6 million of higher price and mix, offset inflation of $4 million. Incremental start-up costs were $5 million during the quarter.","In the corporate and eliminations segment, the operating loss, excluding charges, was $5 million. We expect the corporate expense to range from $30 million to $35 million for the full year.","Then jumping to the balance sheet. Our receivables ended the quarter at $1,756,000,000, with DSO of 59 days in the third quarter. Inventories were $2,214,000,000. Inventory days ended at 118, which improved from 119 days in the fourth quarter of 2017. Inflation and backwards integration negatively impacted the calculations. Fixed assets were $4,586,000,000 and included capital expenditures of $145 million and depreciation and amortization of $133 million in the third quarter. We are estimating capital expenditures for the full year of 2018 to be $800 million, and depreciation and amortization is estimated at $520 million for the year. Next year, we estimate capital expenditures to range from $550 million to $570 million, and we anticipate D&A to be $570 million.","We look at our long-term debt. Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong. We had total debt of $2.9 billion, with our leverage at 1.5x debt to total EBITDA. We expect free cash flow of $450 million for the full year of 2018.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. We anticipate fourth quarter results continuing the soft trends we experienced in the third quarter. We expect sales to be slightly slower than the prior quarter in most markets and product categories. Even with price increases across the company, we will not offset inflation, and our results will remain under pressure. Our margins are being impacted by more competitive environments, declining product mix and lower manufacturing rates. We're introducing new products and executing cost reductions to improve our performance. In the U.S., we are expanding our internal transportation and optimizing our distribution. The Godfrey Hirst acquisition will benefit our results as we integrate our Australian and New Zealand businesses. Taking all this into account, our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter is $2.45 to $2.60, excluding any onetime charges. Based on this estimate, our EBITDA for 2018 will be approximately $1.7 billion. In the first quarter of 2019, we expect some improvement from the fourth quarter, with operating income of $225 million to $250 million.","Presently softening market conditions, significant inflation and declining product mix are hurting our results. LVT has an opportunity to expand while also impacting the volume, mix and pricing of our other products in the United States. We're reacting to a stronger dollar, which has compressed our margins.","Going forward, our results should improve as we align pricing and enhance our product offering. Our new investments are on track with construction start-up and acquisition of customers and will provide profitable returns when optimized. We will continue acquiring premier companies like Eliane to expand our offering and geographic presence. Mohawk is the largest flooring company in the world, with low-cost positions in our products. Mohawk's operational depth, innovative products and strong balance sheet provide competitive advantages to create long-term value.","With that, we'll now be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet.","Michael Wood","Jeff, I wanted to start with getting your opinion on a very high-level argument. As we sit here today, it looks like 2017 was really as good as it gets with high profit margins because of an ideal portfolio mix and pricing power and stable input costs. And now we're in an era of these increased import competition, cost inflation and excess capacity and perhaps declining flooring demand outside of LVT. So what's your perspective on that argument? Why - is it wrong? And are you managing the business to that \"best days are behind us\" philosophy?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We're going through temporary conditions where you have inflation and the dollar strength and the market conditions, as you said, are negatively impacting it. It has taken us longer to align our pricing with the cost structures than we had expected, and we're adjusting those as we can with price increases everywhere. I think, as we look forward, it will take us this next year to adjust to it. But I think we're putting the right things in place to expand our business. We haven't got the benefit of all these investments we've been putting in, in different categories which, when we get the volume up to a certain level with the right product mix, will significantly enhance our long-term profits. We believe that the profitability of the existing businesses will improve over time and get back closer to where they were.","Michael Wood","Okay. And then maybe a specific question. The $24 million productivity - negative $24 million productivity in Flooring North America. I'm assuming that's a net productivity. Is that correct? And what do you think the normal Flooring North America run rate productivity can be when growth stabilizes? And I'm curious on what it'll look like when you begin to lap the heavy destocking period in 2Q to 4Q 2019.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","So productivity was impacted by lower manufacturing levels and efficiencies, higher employee costs, depreciation, higher SG&A and even some uncovered freight, among others. In the productivity, anything that gets worse ends up in the productivity category. We think it'll continue to lag in the near term, but we expect it to improve over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates.","Justin Speer","I just - unpacking that fourth quarter guidance a little bit more and in thinking about the big - particularly in the third quarter, this productivity line. I think most - and I think you were looking for that to improve from the $3 million drag in the second quarter. And then you look to the fourth quarter, the guidance implies about 500 basis points plus of margin degradation year-over-year across the business. So I guess, unpack that Flooring North America piece, how much of that is that productivity continuing into the fourth quarter? And then maybe what's your implied margin guidance across the rest of your businesses? Because it seems we need some handholding around how you're going to exit the year and how to shape that as we think about next year in terms of the margin profile and your math as best you can provide it.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We anticipate continuous soft trends as we go into the fourth quarter, with sales slightly slower. We are continuing to assume that the price increases will lag our raw material inflation. In various markets, as - such as in the U.S., as the markets have slowed somewhat, we're seeing more competitive environments. We have declining product mix, and we're assuming lower manufacturing rates all the way through. With this, we're increasing prices further in almost every product and marketplace. We're putting out new products that'll have higher margins, and we're executing cost reductions to improve where we are. But it will take time to change the margin.","Justin Speer","So in thinking about the price - so we have tariffs rolling in, we have productivity drag - or you have productivity drag, particularly in Flooring North America, that should continue into at least the next couple of quarters. Thinking about getting price, how are you going to be getting price in a down volume environment and then maybe couch that with what you're seeing with tariffs? How, maybe, much price you're going to be requiring to get versus maybe your competition across your businesses?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","The costs in most of our product categories demand that we increase the prices. And we believe, from the announcements of the other competitors, that there's increases going on in those. The tariffs are - have limited impact so far, but there are increases in Chinese imports announced by others in the marketplace, which should help us implement a price increase in ceramic at the end of the year. The tariffs could rise to the 25% level in January. We think there's a reasonable probability they'll go in because we don't see the countries reaching a rational compromise. So as those occur, they should help improve our manufacturing positions in addition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim","So in addition to some of the longer-term questions that obviously people are going to want some handholding on. I guess, one of the aspects that I wanted to zero in on your term was the inventory dynamic. I think you had indicated that you think that sales would be a little lower in the 4Q. I wanted to clarify, did you mean down year-over-year? And I assume you mean down like low single digits year-over-year in 4Q. And then on - but within inventory specifically, I was hoping that you could help us understand or break down what we see in the overall inventory number because it still seems kind of high. In other words, are there big pieces, like was there a buildup of LVT ahead of some launches? Was there - is there any kind of acquisition impact from that inventory that you can break out for us? Or can you break out the inventory build internationally, let's say, versus domestically. Anything that you can give us regarding the inventory and the likelihood that, that will come down relatively quickly would be very helpful.","Frank Boykin","First, Steve, I just wanted to clarify. You had said sales would be down in the fourth quarter. Is that what you said? Was that...","Stephen Kim","I thought that was what Jeff had just said, but clarify me if it's wrong.","Frank Boykin","No. No, we don't expect sales...","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I said sales would be softer. But what's happening is we are cutting back on the production of the piece because at the third quarter, we started cutting back. And we're assuming it's going to be softer going into next year. So we're being more aggressive in the production rates going into the end of the year. Let me get some of it. And Frank, you can fill in the rest. What I'm saying also is that with the raw material inflation, you have the raw materials hitting the balance sheet before the sales prices have gone up. So the inventory turns get worse because the raw materials have increased, and it's showing up in the inventory dollars, in addition to having nothing to do with the units as the prices go up.","William Wellborn","Stephen, I would just add that we're increasing some of the source materials, like an quartz, for example, and we're taking down our manufactured inventories.","Frank Boykin","And that was a long question. Did we leave something out there, Steve?","Stephen Kim","Well, in particular, I'm looking for some numbers, either ratios or something that can give us a sense for what we can - how - because that's ultimately what I think The Street needs, is some confidence around your 4Q and 1Q guidance because we're starting to establish a scary pattern here, where we're sort of getting disappointments on guidance. And so one of the key aspects is your inventory issues - your inventory seems to be continuing to build even though that's something which I know you've been trying to address. So we just want to get a sense of are you being conservative enough in your sales expectation in 4Q and 1Q? And why do we feel confident that the inventory build is going to turn the other way and, therefore, not create all these other problems in 1Q? So it would be helpful if we could get some numbers around what the inventory build looks like, let's say, in the U.S., for example, or breakout pieces that were sort of not part of the regular flow.","Frank Boykin","The inventories are expected to go down in the fourth quarter. And we would expect to continue to see improvement in our inventory turns as we move to the next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut","First, just a question on the $1.2 billion of sales that you expect from all your different new investments over the next year or two. I just wanted to get a sense, the $1.2 billion numbers seems to be a little bit lower than the $1.4 billion, I believe, that you've talked to in the last year or 2. I just want to understand what - if that's correct, what the difference is there. And also, from a timing perspective, how are you thinking about that $1.2 billion fully coming online and \"being optimized\" so that you can generate margins similar to the business? Would that - is that more of a 2020, 2021 event? Any thoughts around when do you think those investments could get up to full strength would be helpful.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Okay. The difference in the numbers comes from two places. Some of the projects, we have moved out of this additional piece and into the other. We've been talking about this for about two years, so as some of the projects have been moved over. The second is the stronger dollar has impacted the translations of the sales back into U.S. dollars as the dollar has strengthened, is it - so that's the difference in the two. All of the projects are in all kinds of different states. In the remarks we sort of talked through, there are certain ones that are along in the process. There's other ones that are just getting started as you go through. They're all in various stages of completion and ramping up. Then with each of the investments, it depends on the cost of starting and stopping it. In some cases, we go out and sell it at lower margins to try to get the volume going through it, which doesn't help the profitability, but it gets the thing started up faster. In other cases, if the costs are lower, we will ramp it up as we put the sales on in each other. So in all the cases, they go through the stage where you're first underutilized and the mix is poor. Then they get to a point where there's enough volume going through it that they move from a loss to a breakeven, give or take.","And then it usually takes at least a year to get the volume up where you want. And then the next year, we start working on the mix between the two. So it takes periods of going through them depending upon - they're all in different spots a little bit as we start. Some haven't even gotten finished coming out of the ground yet. The new quartz plant in Tennessee, which is going to get helped by all the tariffs that are going on and countertops, the tariffs are for Chinese assisting their suppliers. And there could be future dumping charges on top if they're already up high. That should help us fill up the plant faster, for instance. But all the projects have to go through this process, which is - it takes several years to get them to the optimized point.","Michael Rehaut","Jeff, I appreciate the color there. Second question, just maybe a couple of points of clarification, again, on forward guidance. In terms of 4Q, when you say the sales slightly slower than the previous quarter, do you mean sales less going down sequentially? But should we still expect sales growth up sales growth year-over-year just - but you're talking about sales declining sequentially? And then in terms of first quarter, with the operating income guidance, does that reflect any of the pricing that you're talking about, trying to set in motion with the additional price increases as you try and offset some of the headwinds?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","So the sales, we meant that the sales rate relative to the third quarter would be lower because we're seeing softening trends in many of the markets as we go through. Is it - and then what was the rest of the question?","Frank Boykin","Rest of the question?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","What's the other part? I forgot.","Frank Boykin","I think he's gone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel.","John Baugh","I was curious on the guide on Q1 improving. I think it was an EBIT guide. Are you saying that the Q1 EBIT will be above Q4 EBIT?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","The guidance, I think, was saying that the decrease in - relative to the prior year would improve over the fourth quarter.","John Baugh","Okay. So that's not saying EBIT in Q1 will be higher than EBIT in Q4?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Q1 is always a much lower volume than the fourth quarter, and I don't think we're going to change that.","John Baugh","Okay. Jeff, on LVT and in pricing, I'm curious as to what you're doing, what you're seeing your competition do currently. We've got the 10% in place. And then you've got to contemplate if you're importing the stuff, the 25% at this even as early as now. Do you think if we see materially higher LVT pricing as we go into next year that, that will slow down the rate of growth of that product or not? And I'm curious as to how you think about that and then how that may or may not impact the rest of your business in the U.S.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","The tariffs, it takes a while for the marketplace to adjust to the changes. And in the marketplace, some people have raised it already. I'm not sure all have at this point because of some inventory pieces, but I think most are going up. If the tariffs go up to 25%, you're going to change the value relationship of it versus other products in the marketplace. And it should have an impact on its use in the marketplace relative to where it is and should change the growth rate and change the alternatives for it. And people may start using other things more. But we'll have to see. But again, it won't happen like a light switch. It's going to have to change over time.","John Baugh","Okay. And I was curious, Jeff, on the ceramic installation patent that, I believe, you discussed in your release. What - is there any way to - what is it? What are you doing? How revolutionary is it? And maybe your ceramic install cost X per square foot, this process would cost Y per square foot. Some kind of reference to what it is you're doing there.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","It hasn't hit the market yet. We've been testing it for a period of time. It looks like it's going to work. We have a small production starting up that we're starting ready to introduce it. What it does is when you put in ceramic, it usually takes at least two days to prep the floor, put it in and go to different stages to get the job done. This will cut the time in half by at least half, and you can get the whole job done in a day that would take you two days. Is it - and so the product's going to cost more, but the total install cost should be a benefit and it should cut the time significantly. So we think it has an opportunity to make the industry more competitive and make it easier to train people to install it. And we're on the initial stages of it today, but we think it's going to help the industry be more competitive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith Hughes","A question on inventory and production rates. On the inventory, it was up about 16% year-over-year. Can you kind of separate how much of that was units and how much of that was from the inflating raw materials? And then, I guess, as we look at production rates in your current planning, I assume it's worse - I assume it's lower in the fourth than the third. What are you looking to begin the year? Does that flatten out in the first quarter?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We don't have the units and volume here to give you. The fourth period will be significantly higher than the third quarter going into it and in multiple markets and product categories, as I said, as we go into next year with a lower expectation of the volume. And I forgot the last part of your question.","Keith Hughes","Sorry, so you're saying production - you're lowering your production capacity?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We're lowering the production below the selling rates in the third quarter. And then I'm hesitating a little bit, the first quarter is always a slower quarter, so it's typically - we don't run as hard in the first quarter, in general, just because it's always lower.","Keith Hughes","When I say in the fourth quarter, it will be a slower production period than the third, correct?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Yes. In the United States, we have been running the ceramic underneath the sales rate for a period of time, lowering the inventories in it. But - and come next year, we expect to run the rates aligned with our selling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Clark with the Goldman Sachs.","Douglas Clark","The first one is on the U.S. LVT facility and then actually the new European one as well. How loaded are those at those - at this point? I know you mentioned that 30% increase in the capacity, but I guess, I'm just circling a little bit because I don't know what that base is off of ultimately. So where are we in getting that fully ramped up and utilized?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","You're dealing with a process that has never been run before and going through. So it's - what happens is you start up the plant running at slow speeds with very simple products. And then over time, you keep speeding it up and you keep adding new products to it. It's not unusual as you go to each incremental stage that something that worked at a slower speed or with less things going on, that things don't work as they're supposed to. And you have to adjust things. What we had in the quarter, we had both software problems, that the software as we tried to speed it up and make it work, the software was not talking to itself properly, and we also had physical mechanical failures where things broke and we had to replace them. These are normal things as we go through. What we believe is that we'll keep going through these incremental changes all through next year and by the end of next year, the production lines should be operating at the capabilities that we expect. Even with that, you're still increasing the market, and you're still adding product to it. So I don't know if - as these things incrementally pick up, it takes time to balance the increased speeds with an increased output with the sales. So you're adjusting the sales strategies. And then typically, you're also - the product mix, when you start, is lower. And we probably will be working more on the product mix in 2020, as it - as you've gotten it settled down and you're putting higher-value products, the product mix will change, So you won't - we won't get the full benefit until sometime in 2020.","Douglas Clark","All right. That was super helpful. And then just in terms of the 1Q guide, I was curious, number one, does that include the acquisition Eliane? And then also, does that include the 25% tariff and the costs potentially associated with the source product on that?","Frank Boykin","It does not include the accretion from Eliane.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","And it doesn't include anything for the tariffs since we're not sure that - what's going to happen. And then if the tariffs are put in, again, it's not going to happen overnight. The market just isn't going to flip from one to something else in 1.5 minutes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Thompson","First, focusing on margins and understanding there have been a lot of puts and takes, the margin impact in the quarter by reporting segment and by geography. But first, focusing on Flooring North America. We just had the widest and most consistent step-down in adjusted profit margin in 28 this year. So stepping back and looking at the force for the fees, how much of the Q3 and the year-to-date impact is driven by investments or plant start-up, inflation, lower volumes or the other - the other headwinds that you've laid out in the prepared commentary. And really the spirit of the question is to understand what are the internal issues of the controllables versus external and how these can be managed more effectively going forward.","Frank Boykin","Kathryn, the two largest headwinds in the third quarter for the North American segment were, like I mentioned, $35 million of inflation and then the negative productivity of $23 million. We had shutdowns that hit the P&L for about $4 million, and then we had incremental start-ups that hit us for about $8 million. But the two largest were productivity and inflation. And we're - as Jeff said, we are putting in a fourth price increase at the end of this year to help continue to offset inflation, introducing new products to help with mix.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","The mix has been a significant piece as the - our sales have traded down from higher-value, more differentiated products with higher margins to lower-margin products as some of our customer base tries to hold price points in the marketplace. And then the other part of it is we have sold more in lower-value categories, so our sales in multifamily and builder, which is lower-value products at lower margins, has increased relative to the total versus the remodeling business on the other side, is it, which is the LVT's impacted the remodeling business at a greater amount.","Kathryn Thompson","Before I move to my follow-up question, just to clarify, it sounds like these are more - the majority are more internal-focused and fixable versus external. Is that a - would that be a fair statement?","Frank Boykin","We've still got the pricing and the mix that we've got to address, and some of that has external influences.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","It's a combination of both.","Kathryn Thompson","Yes. Just on ceramic, how much of trading down on products, in terms of that mix that you talked about, is being impacted by large home builders shifting from ceramic product to lower-priced LBT. And do you see this as a trend going forward? And any thoughts you have about that shutdown from a mix shift for ceramic to LBT?","Frank Boykin","The margin on ceramic is impacted by LBT and the pricing. But it's also being impacted by our mix, we're selling more into the builder channel, for example. And the other thing that's impacting our margin is higher freight cost which we've not been able to recover in pricing. We are taking a price increase in the fourth quarter that should help us a lot.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","So part of it is that we are taking a larger share of lower-value products as the ceramic industry has slowed down. So that's part of the mix shift. And then this freight piece that he talks about, the freight part we sell ceramic all landed. And we haven't recovered the freight. But we think with the tariffs and pieces, it offers us an opportunity to recover part of the cost.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays.","Matthew Bouley","So on the price side, Jeff, you've generally been successful in mostly offsetting inflation historically. So could you just elaborate on what is different this time? Why is there seemingly limited ability to improve pricing here? Is it really that mix is just a full offset or - I mean, ultimately, what visibility do you have to getting traction on the pricing side?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Two things. One is on the carpet side, the amount of it and the frequency of it has made it difficult to continue to get them through there. It's made it harder to read the competition and to react in the marketplace as we go through. And then they all don't go in on day one, they flow in overtime as you go through. So all those things have made it more difficult than usual. And because of the amount of changeover time, it's increasing the amount of trading down to lower-priced products to keep the price point which is also affecting the mix, which is offsetting a lot of the price increase. On the ceramic side, the biggest impact is this cost of freight. It is heavy and you move it, and the U.S. freight rates have been going up dramatically. And with the dollar strengthening, we haven't been able to recover all of the pricing. But we think we're going to get more of it in the fourth quarter than we have all year. And at the same time, we've talked about the same thing going on with mix. As the volume has been impacted in the United States, we're selling more lower-value products, all of which end up impacting the margins. And it all looks like price, but it's not all exactly price.","Matthew Bouley","Okay. Second question just on productivity in North America. Jeff, you made the comment that several items, obviously, end up in North American productivity. So I mean, is the suggestion that really you need to see a volume recovery there to kind of see that swing around? I guess, in other words, I mean, what would be the right way to think about the level of volumes you would need to return to generating productivity in that segment?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","The productivity is impacted by the unit volumes, but there are also other inefficiencies of things going on as we go through. We talked about even some of the freight charges end up in productivity. If they're not billed to the customer, they end up as a difference in last year versus of this year internal cost, which ends up in productivity. So I think the productivity will improve over time, but it's not going to improve tomorrow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Dahl","The first question goes back to the topic of kind of a trade-down effect in pricing. I guess, I'm curious, just the pricing has been consistently met over the last couple of quarters, at least with this trade-down effect. As you're thinking about kind of customer behavior and what you're hearing back from the customer, what gives you the confidence that this will improve as you look at your 2019 pricing actions? And ultimately, the second part of this is, you've talked about slower growth, but do you expect organic growth to be positive in '19?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We expect to get more price increase in all the different product categories, and every dollar we get helps improve the margins and offset the raw materials that we have. So we're expecting that to better align as we go through. We're taking actions with the new products to put out products that have higher margins, which should help it. But selling lower-value categories will continue in the piece from where it is today. I don't see that changing as we try to operate the business and get whatever share we can in the marketplace as we go through.","Frank Boykin","2019 sales growth.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We expect it to be up.","Michael Dahl","Okay. And I guess it...","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","One more thing. Part of the up to though, with the margins, all these new pieces we talk - I've gone over a few times of how they go. So in some cases, the volume's going to go up, but the margin's going to lag until the plants hit the cost structures they need and the mix.","Michael Dahl","Well, that's my second question, Jeff. Because if you look at the 1Q guide, your operating income down about $60 million year-on-year. You've made those comments consistently through the call about this is still going to be a transition year. 2020 is the optimization year. And so if you think about that where you're positioned after 1Q, again to try to put a finer point on things, do you expect operating income to improve in 2019 versus 2018 in dollar terms?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","The business - I think what we try to put forward is that the business will continue to be pressured next year, that the prices will not cover all the mix, inflation and pressures that we've been talking about. That - we have said that the income in the first quarter will be down. Over time, we expect the pricing mix and inflation to be better aligned. But the industry pressures across the market would have to improve for us to exceed 2018 earnings next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America.","John Lovallo","The first one on the CapEx guide for 2019 of 550 to 570. That's a pretty good step-down, kind of brings you back to 2014, 2015 levels. Now I realize that the past couple of years have been elevated given some of the spend. But are you guys delaying any spending in 2019, given what you're seeing in the market?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","First is a portion of that is still paying for those new investments. Even though the equipment's put in, typically, you pay for it in some time to make sure it does like it's supposed to. So there's lags in the investments. So it could be 20% or more of next year's budget's paying for the stuff that's going in, in the third and fourth quarter of this year. So the ongoing pieces, you have to take those out. And then if you look at the other parts, almost all the investments were very little going into increasing capacity anywhere is going into improving efficiencies. And then you have the normal maintenance and things you have to invest in as a typical thing. But that's the big chunk, so...","John Lovallo","Okay. And then next question is just on your - the $500 million of repurchase authorization put in place. How quickly can you guys get in the market? And how aggressive do you intend to be given where the stock is?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We think the stock is undervalued, and we - the window opens on Monday. And we plan to be in the market, purchasing stock.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo.","Stephen East","The first question. I guess if you look at your major product categories, how much are raw materials roughly up year-over-year? And then here in late October, I know you're still seeing raw materials go up. But if inflation stopped today on those major products, how long would it take you all, do you think, to get flush with your pricing versus how much raw materials have gone up?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","If inflation stopped today, I would hope that we would get most of the increases through in the first quarter and be more aligned. But some of the things are at different levels than they were. You got - I got to keep putting apart, one's inflation and one is this change in the channel mix and change in the product mix that we're doing. So as we go through the market, we are changing - the average value of the products is lower and the average margin on the lower mix is lower. So it's a combination of both. The mix won't change even if we could magically get rid of the inflation today, which is causing the compression.","Stephen East","Yes, sure. I appreciate that. And then the other thing I had is sort of a compound question. If you look at the U.S. end markets, are you seeing - could you sort of give us an idea of which ones are behaving the worst, which one's behaving the best? And then if you look at your cap utilization rates right now of your major product categories, however you want to answer it, whether it's at what level are you running today, or how much below a normalized level, like maybe earlier this year you're running - just so we can have some magnitude of what type of capacity flexibility you may have as we go through '19.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","You guys are asking the questions so long, by the time I get to the end, I get confused what the questions were.","Stephen East","Exactly. The first one's the U.S. end markets, what are you seeing?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Okay. The U.S. markets, what's happened is that a large part of the remodeling business is being impacted more, so the retail remodeling business, there's more pressure on the other products as LVT takes a bigger share, in that one versus the others. So you're seeing less of it in the new construction and the multifamily. But it's there, but it's not at the same levels as that one. So that's probably about what's happening with the channels. And the second half was?","Stephen East","The second half, just looking at your major products, where your capped utilization rates are right now and trying to understand how much flexibility and expansion you may have as you go into '19, ignoring your CapEx that you're putting in place. Just really trying to understand how much you've had to pull back from, say, where you were earlier this year.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I mean, all the different product categories, if you say LVT took 100% of the industry growth, and everything else is about even. And then we're seeing lower unit volumes in most of them. So all of them are being cut back everywhere. And that's where you see us moving into lower-value products, which we might not have taken as much of in prior years or period, that's compressing the mix, and they're all interrelated.","Frank Boykin","Steve, in some cases, like ceramic, we're taking down in the fourth quarter, both in the U.S. and Italy because it's the most economical time to take out inventories for us.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","You can't start and stop those. You have to stop them for a significant periods of time. So we're stopping and going into the fourth quarter even more.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng","Can you provide some color how to think about some of these start-up costs for '19 versus '18 and the cadence of that? And how we should think about productivity for next year, assuming you're done drawn down production? Because as you kind of highlighted, you still have a handful of projects that are coming up late this year, early next year.","Frank Boykin","Start-up costs will be down significantly next year. It could be down as much as 50% from what it ran for the full year this year.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Can you give him an estimate for next year?","Frank Boykin","No, I think, this year, as we said, it's going 65 to 70, so it could be half of that next year.","Philip Ng","And what about on the other productivity targets? Do you have a good handle on that?","Frank Boykin","I think the best we can say right now is it should improve as we go through the year, particularly once we get out of the first quarter.","Philip Ng","Got it. And Jeff, I just want to confirm I heard you correctly. So you're expecting organic growth to be up next year. But given some of these headwinds you called out you're seeing in the market, a couple of price costs, you're expecting legacy EBITDA and legacy EBITDA margins to be down year-over-year in 2019 until most things kind of inflect from here?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","You have this mix change that I keep talking about, about selling more lower-value products, which is impacting the margins. And that's going to continue for the foreseeable future. On the other hand, we do expect to get the pricing more aligned than it has been. So that's going to help. And then the industry will have to see where it goes. I'm still assuming the industry's going to be up next year.","Philip Ng","Okay. Are you planning to roll out any bigger initiatives to take out more costs, ratchet head count and just potentially even push out some of these growth projects given increased competition and slower growth in general?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We're going to continue working on the costs of all our businesses. And we've taken various actions, some of them we talked through already. We consolidated a couple of service centers. We are taking out some older cost assets as we speak. We're consolidating some warehousing in different parts of the country. We continue to increase the efficiencies and production of all the different businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Susan Maklari","My first question is around - there's obviously been some sense that markets have slowed globally. You noted Europe as well as the U.S. Is there anything that feels different to you in terms of the - perhaps the outlook for one region versus the other? Do you expect more growth to come through next year in the U.S. or in Europe versus the other?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","I'm not so sure my ouija board is any better than yours at guessing the future. I can say that like Mexico, Mexico, last year, the ceramic business grew double digits. This year, it's negative. I have no idea what's going to happen with the NAFTA behind and where it is. We believe it's going to get better, for instance. In Europe, the first half of the year was stronger, and we've seen weakening across almost all the markets. As we go through, there's a lot of political things making people uncomfortable. And I'm not sure how they're going to translate into next year's growth, and in particularly on all parts and pieces. In our ceramic business, we have a large business in Italy, and there's all kinds of confusion over the political environment as it goes through. So at the moment, we're just assuming all of them are going to be somewhat softer. But I can't tell you that we have any insight that's going to tell us how much or what's going to happen.","Susan Maklari","Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of the Eliane acquisition, Brazil's obviously a market that you've talked about for a while. Why did you decide that this was a good time to get into this? And how should we think about the growth that may be that can sort of add to your business over time?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We've looked in Brazil for a long period of time, and we've talked to a lot of companies. And the ceramic industry had gone through a downturn, and it's coming out of it. We think that it's improved, and that allowed us to come to an agreement with one of the companies that we think is one of the best down there in Brazil.","William Wellborn","Yes. I would just add that we've had discussions with Eliane probably 15 or 20 years. The - it's an excellent family, excellent management team. They have the number two position in Brazil, which is the - a huge market and has the best brand in the market.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","So we think it gives us a good position to grow from. And we started in Europe, and we bought one business in Italy. And now we have positions in Italy, Spain, Bulgaria. We're building one in Poland. So it's a large market where ceramic is really strong, and we're hoping that it will give us a foothold to expand the business much better. Their business has always been constrained by capital, and we think we can provide them more capital and we can help them beyond that. So it seems like an opportunity to expand on a long-term basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital Markets.","Laura Champine","Jeff, it's about the trade-down you're seeing with customers. Can you give us a little history lesson of when the last time was that you saw a trade-down of this magnitude across your businesses? And how long it took you to recover and what it tells us about where we are in the cycle?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","So normally - there's two parts. One is you have - you always have trading down when you have inflation. So whenever you have high rates of inflation, you see trading down as people try to maintain price points in pieces. Now usually, the inflation amount, it doesn't - isn't as great as this, so there's more trading down going on. At the same time, you see a channel mix change with us, whereas LVT - this one's different as LVT is taking more of the growth in the normal channels, we are getting more volume in lower-value price points. So that's not a normal circumstance in this. Normally, we would have that circumstance in a recession, and it's not for the same reason. In a recession, we try to optimize our price mix and maximize our margins when business is good. In a recession, what happens is we start taking lower-value, lower-return products to keep the assets running. So this time, it's caused more because the industry volume is more. And then all this together then changes the competition in the marketplace as everybody's reacting to the situation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","It's been a long call. I'll keep it to one question. But Jeff, just a strategic question on ceramic. I guess if the market's shifting to a greater degree of import sourcing, does it make sense for Mohawk to begin supplying the U.S. market with your foreign capacity maybe over the longer term, because I know you got a lot on your plate right now, but over the longer term investing sort of foreign nontariff export platforms that can you allow you to more competitively serve all segments of the U.S. market?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We have - with the prior moves in Europe, with Bulgaria, we have a - Bulgaria is the lowest labor area in all of Europe, and it could be one of the lowest ones in the world. We have Brazil, which is a lower one which is new. We're in Mexico, which is also low. So - and we have Poland, which is also low. Now on the other hand, ceramic has high freight so we can - it's not that we can't compete. It's that our margins are less. As the dollar strengthens, our cost positions allow us to compete, except the competition is reducing our margins. And we try to balance the volume with the pricing that we do.","William Wellborn","Yes. I would say in every market, we are the low-cost producer and we have the best product offering and the best distribution in every market that we're in. The strong dollar in the U.S. is causing imports to be more competitive than they normally would. But even in the U.S., we're a low-cost producer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard","Two questions. First of all, the competitive dynamic you're talking about in the U.S. regarding the LVT and imports, how do you feel about that happening in Europe in a similar way?","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","Europe is a totally different market, and it reacts different. And then you can't really even talk about Europe as a whole because each country and the dynamics and where they're located are different. The U.S. is used by a lot of countries as the dumping ground and has always been. In ceramic, I think 50-something percent of the ceramic sold in the United States historically comes from somewhere else. So we're used to competing in this environment with it as you go through. In Europe, you have a different set of dynamics. So our European business out of Italy is based on mid- to high, and we have very little sales in low coming out of our Italian operations. Different than our Bulgarian operations. They focus mostly on the mid- to low end, and we're expanding capacity to ship more into the rest of Europe from Bulgaria. But that's not our core business as you go through. But in Europe, in the last 1.5 years or two, they have increased the production of ceramic. And then what happened is the ceramic industry has slowed down, so the competitive nature of the market has changed in the last 4 or 5 months from where it has been. And we're having to react with pricing as well as other things in the marketplace. But in LVT it is not accepted and it's not as broad as it is here. You get down into the southern part of Europe, I mean, they've been using ceramic in huge quantities for thousands of years. It's embedded in their culture. And again, each market's a little different. So we don't expect that LVT will reach the same levels, but it's increasing. And we are one of the largest participants in it over there.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the questions we have for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lorberbaum for closing comments.","Jeffrey Lorberbaum","We have temporary conditions that we're adjusting to. Our business' investments will improve our margins and our profitability over time, and our new investments will be optimized when we get the volume and mix where we would like it. We're well positioned for the long term. In the short term, we're really focused on improving our margins in the various businesses. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14974":["Mohawk Industries, Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, August 5, 2016. Thank you.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Frank Boykin. Mr. Boykin, you may begin your conference.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries quarterly investor conference call. Today, we'll update you on the company's results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide guidance for the third quarter.","I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Our second quarter earnings exceeded our expectations. Our earnings per share for the period were $3.42, an increase of 35% or $3.47, excluding unusual charges, an increase of 29% over last year and an all-time record for the company. This marks the ninth consecutive period that Mohawk has delivered record adjusted earnings per share. Our strategic business initiatives and our acquisitions all contributed to our rise in earnings.","For the quarter, our operating margin grew 270 basis points to a second-quarter record of 15.2%. As a result of productivity, sales volume, acquisitions and lower input costs offset partially by investments in SG&A and an unfavorable price mix. Our revenues for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, an increase of 13%, our highest quarterly revenues ever.","During the period, we generated free cash flow of more than $270 million. Our innovations in products and processes, investments in efficiencies and integration of our acquisitions enhanced our performance during the quarter and provide a foundation for long-term growth. Our recent acquisitions are progressing as we broaden their strategies, leverage their distribution and provide additional resources. Across the enterprise, we are investing in marketing to improve our product introductions and expand our distribution and sales. We anticipate SG&A is a percent of sales, will improve as we progress through this year.","To optimize our businesses, we have initiated many capital projects that will enhance our performance this year and beyond by expanding our capacity, product offering and efficiencies. We are in the final stages of the start-up of our new U.S. ceramic, LVT and outdoor rug operations as well as our European LVT plant. We have begun additional projects to support our growth, including LVT and laminate in the U.S. and Europe, ceramic in Mexico, Italy and Russia, continuum polyester carpet, engineered wood and utility mats in the US. This year, we anticipate our capital expenditures will exceed $600 million depending on the timing of payments.","Consumer spending at the end of the second quarter strengthened the U.S. economy. The most recent National Association of Builders report affirmed continuing recovery of the U.S. single-family home market. Continued job creation, new household formations and low mortgage rates should support housing growth throughout this year.","Harvard LIRA Index projects remodeling activity will approach as 2006 peak in the middle of next year. The latest architectural building index, which measures commercial design activity rose to the highest level at almost a year. In Mexico, low inflation has raised consumer confidence to its highest level in a year and the comments are predicting further GDP growth.","The European Central Bank continue to stimulate the economy through a quantitative easing and low interest rates. The Russian economy remains in a recession, though there are indications it may be nearing a bottom.","I'll now review our second quarter performance by segment. Our Global Ceramic sales rose 5% as reported with operating income for the segment growing 16% over last year to a margin of 17%. FX negatively impacted the translation of our sales for Mexico and Russia by $16 million.","Our North American ceramic business continue to grow and our margins benefited from higher volume productivity mix. The home construction channel outperformed the rest of the business and we're expanding our position with builders across the country. Our new product introductions are gaining momentum, imperatively impacting our margins. We increased sales personnel and distribution points to optimize our market position. The introduction of some new [indiscernible] programs were postponed by large customers in the period and are back on track. Sales of our countertops are increasing as we expand our distribution and product offering.","We continue to enhance the quality of our independent distributor network and have expanded American Olean and Marazzi service centers on the West Coast. Our new Tennessee ceramic plant is ahead of schedule with the final production line becoming operational in the third quarter.","We are manufacturing higher value products at this facility, including 48-inch wood planks and color body porcelain tiles. The plant in Western Mexico that we acquire last year is improving its performance with higher production levels and lower costs. We're focusing each of our North American plants on specific products to optimize our productivity and increase their efficiency and quality.","We are reengineering our product formulations and increasing the recycling of our ceramic wastes. Our ceramic operating margins in Mexico expanded as we've upgraded our mix and reduced our cost. All of our Mexican tile capacity is being utilized and we have begun the expansion of our Salamanca plant.","We will double its capacity by adding new lines that will be operational in the fall of next year. We continue to grow our retail sales as well as our participation in DIY and new construction channels in Mexico. Our European ceramic sales continue to improve with expanded margins of improved mix by upgrading our assets, enhancing our offering and improving our sales execution with increased revenue and profitability.","To continue these trends, we are introducing more differentiated products in the middle price points and investing in retail merchandizing, retail sales training, and consumer advertise. We have initiated the final phase of our Italian asset modernization, which we completed during the first half of next year. In addition, we've purchased a new manufacturing line to make even larger tiles to be used on floors, walls, and countertops. We're enhancing our position and product offering, improving efficiencies, and supplying product to our Western European and U.S. markets.","Despite the continued decline of the Russian economy in ceramic industry, our sales rose significantly on a local basis, with improvements in volume, price and mix. We're increasing our market share through industry-leading design and broader distribution. We've started up a new line to give us more porcelain production to satisfy our growing demand. We've enhanced the strength of our organization and broadened our sales and manufacturing capability. We are further expanding our capacity to prepare for a stronger Russian market in 2018.","For the second quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales were up 7%, with operating income for the segment increasing 25%, to a margin of 12% as reported. Operating income grew 16% over last year, to a margin of 13%, excluding unusual charges. The segment's profitability as we increased investments in sales personnel, retail merchandizing and samples. Like ceramic, some large customers postponed product launches and reduced inventory in the period, and we anticipate sales improvement in the third quarter.","Our residential carpet margins expanded as a result of our differentiated products, process innovation, and investments that lowered our cost structure. During the quarter, the industry's average selling price for residential carpet declined due to the shift of polyester and the lower cost of materials. Our mix was negatively impacted by the strength of the new home and multifamily channels, which utilize lower value products. To satisfy the changing corporate market, we're adding more continuum polyester production, which uses recycled materials to provide higher quality and value.","We widened the distribution of our SmartStrand carpet, Karastan broadloom and mainstream commercial collections, which outpaced our other residential sales. Our exclusive SmartStrand franchise is being benefited by our new Silk Naturals collection, which has the appearance of wool, but a softer, more luxurious and easier to maintain. We continue to strengthen our manufacturing performance with many process advances, higher yields, and material enhancements. Our commercial carpet sales increased as we strengthened our product offering and expanded our sales in all channels.","Our innovative commercial introductions received multiple awards at the recent show and gained interest from architects and designers who attended. We continue to simplify our manufacturing, consolidate plans, and improve our planning processes. We're enhancing the designing value we provide to our customers while increasing our margins at the same time. All of our commercial channels are showing improvement with hospitality and senior living, the strongest.","Our new innovations in laminate are differentiating our products and expanding our market share. We continue to deliver unique styling and performance features in our laminate collections. Our European operations are providing product to the U.S. until our new capacity as operational next year. Our engineered wood sales continue to grow and we have a price increase that will be implemented in the third quarter. By the end of this year, we will install more engineered wood production to satisfy greater demand and produce higher value products. There is pressure on the solid wood sales, as consumer preference shifts to engineer. In June, we had a disruption in our Virginia wood plant, which impacted sales by $2 million and we are now getting back to normal levels.","Our vinyl business continued to expand as we increase the product assortment and distribution of our LVT and sheet vinyl. Our growth in the LVT category has been constrained by our manufacturing capacity. We've recently made equipment modifications that will significantly raise our LVT production and reduce costs. We are preparing to introduce new designs and features to further grow our LVT sales in both residential and commercial. By the end of the year - by the end of next year, we will double our U.S. LVT capacity and enhance our capabilities in this fast growing category.","For the period, our Flooring Rest of the World segment sales were up 51%, with operating income rising 91% to a margin of 20% as reported. Operating income grew 67% to a margin of 21% on a local basis excluding charges. Our Flooring business improved significantly led by premium laminate and LVT. Our laminate mix benefited from our sales of our new collections featuring more realistic visuals and water resistance. We're adding laminate capacity in Europe to support the next generation of this unique technology. To offset currency fluctuations, we're announcing selective price increases. The system integration for Balterio Laminate, will be completed during the third quarter and allow us to realize additional synergies. In Russia, our laminate facility continues to be fully utilized and we're exploring options to add capacity. The mix of our wood business improved during the period, offset by negative currency. Higher sales of wider wood increased our material costs and we are raising prices to offset. We're reducing our wood SKUs and driving productivity and quality.","Our LVT sales and margins increased as our mix and efficiencies improved. To support our LVT growth, additional equipment is being installed there also to raise our capacity and we're sourcing products to supplement in the meantime. To satisfy future LVT growth, another production line should be operational by the end of the year.","Our sheet vinyl sales were negatively affected by a fire in our Belgium plant that we reviewed last quarter. The operations are presently running about 95% of our expected rate and full production will be achieved this period. The impact to the fire on second quarter sales and earnings was approximately \u20ac6.5 million and \u20ac2.5 million respectively. We anticipate recovery of about \u20ac2 million from insurance during this period. We are expanding commercial sheet vinyl sales and will improve - that will improve our mix.","During the period, our panel sales and margins expanded, as we implemented many actions to enhance our results. Our insulation volumes increased significantly, offset by currency changes and lower prices as material cost declined. The integration of Xtratherm and our legacy insulation business continues with sales, administration and systems being realigned to enhance our results.","I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales as reported were $2.310 billion, up 13%. Our legacy business was up 3% on a constant days and exchange rate basis. We had one additional day in the second quarter and we will also have one additional day in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we'll have one last day compared to the last year.","Plant disruptions, temporarily pushed sales down by approximately $9 million in the quarter. We had a negative FX impact of $16 million with the decline in the ruble and the peso, offsetting the positive impact of the euro. All segments grew with the strongest performance in our Rest of World segment.","Our gross margin as reported was 32.7% or 32.8% excluding charges, up a 180 basis points over last year. Volume and productivity were the biggest drivers for our improvement. SG&A as reported was $405 million or 17.5% of sales. It was $402 million excluding charges or 17.4% of sales, which was 20 basis points higher than the last year.","Marketing investments primarily in the ceramic and flooring North American segments continued during the quarter. We expect the SG&A percent to net sales to decline in the second half as spending slows and we leverage our cost better with the higher sales. Operating income as reported was $351 million with the margin of 15.2%. We had restructuring charges of $6 million related primarily to the woven carpet consolidation in our North American segment. We estimate another $20 million to $25 million of charges in the second half of this year.","Our operating margin excluding charges was 15.4%, which is at a 160 basis points, even with a $4 million foreign exchange headwind. The operating increase over last year was impacted primarily by a positive volume at $46 million, and productivity at $41 million, offsetting SG&A investments of $18 million.","Interest expense for the quarter was $10 million, which improved $7 million as higher rate bonds were refinanced last year under - this year under CP program. Other income was $5 million, and includes favorable FX. Our income tax rate was 26% this year, compared to 24% last year. And we are estimating our full year rate at 25%. Earnings per share as reported were $3.42. Earnings per share excluding charges, was $3.47 up 29% over last year.","Moving to the segments. In our Global Ceramic segment sales as reported were $830 million, which is a 5% increase over last year. Our legacy business is up 4%, on a constant days and FX basis. We had very strong local currency growth in Russia, with both North America and Europe also growing. FX was a $16 million headwind in this segment. In Europe, our premium products experienced the strongest growth. Operating income as reported was a $141 million, or a margin of 16.9%. The operating margin excluding charges was 17%, an increase of a 140 basis points. Operating income growth was driven by positive volume of $12 million and productivity of $14 million, offsetting $6 million of SG&A investments.","In the Flooring North American segment, sales as reported were $981 million, an increase of 7%. The legacy business using constant days was up slightly with a 1% increase. Hard surfaces and LVT sales growth was the strongest. Operating income as reported was $119 million with a margin of 12.1%. The operating margin excluding charges was 12.8%, up 110 basis points.","The operating income increased primarily from productivity of $22 million, an input cost deflation of $9 million offsetting negative price mix of $9 million and another $9 million from SG&A investments.","And then finally, in our Flooring Rest of World segment, sales as reported were $500 million, up 51%, with the legacy business on a constant days and FX basis, up 5%.","Both, LVT and laminate had good growth in the quarter. The operating income as reported was $101 million with a margin of 20.2%. Our operating margin excluding charges was 20.1% and was an increase of 160 basis points. Operating income was positively impacted by volume of $28 million with lower input cost of $8 million and productivity of $6 million. If you look at the corporate elimination segment, we had an operating loss of $10 million and we expect a full-year loss of about $35 million.","Turning to the balance sheet, receivables ended at $1.4 billion with our days' sales outstanding up to 54 days from 52 days last year. This was primarily due to channel mix.","Inventories at the end of the quarter were a $1.7 billion. Inventory days continue to show good improvement with the 105 days this year compared to a 106 days last year. Fixed assets were $3.2 billion at the end of the quarter. We add capital expenditures in the second quarter of a $136 million and depreciation and amortization of a $101 million.","CapEx for the fiscal year is estimated to be between $600 million and $650 million for the quarter - for the year and depreciation and amortization of $410 million. Long-term debt ended up at $3 billion with our leverage at 1.8 times debt to pro forma EBITDA.","Jeff, I'll turn it back over to you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. We are optimistic about our future performance as a result of our ongoing investments and people products and assets. Our current booking trends have improved and we anticipate third quarter sales growth will be higher on a local basis. We expect continued margin expansion in all of our segments due to processed improvement, operational innovations and greater efficiencies.","Across the business, we are introducing differentiated products and leveraging customer relationships to increase our market position. We are making significant investments to expand our capacity and grow sales in all of our products and geographies. Our LVT sales growth is accelerating and our new plants are making gains in capacity productivity and efficiency.","Taking these factors into account, our EPS guidance for the third quarter is $3.40 to $3.49. This represents a 14% to 17% increase over a third quarter of 2015 EPS, excluding any restructuring charges from 2013 through 2016. We have invested over $2 billion in new assets to drive Mohawk's profitability. We have substantially integrated our recent acquisitions and with our strong organization and balance sheet, we can exploit additional opportunity. In every region, our differentiated product collections, operational excellence and extensive customer relationships give us advantages, so we can deliver stronger results. We'll now be glad to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Mike, your line is now open.","Michael Dahl","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you mentioned some of the modifications to the current LVT capacity. And, I'm just curious, is that's helping your productivity out of these plans. Could you give us a little more color around that and also maybe an update on just in light of that and some of the other investments you're making, where you stand from an LVT capacity on a revenue basis? And when you talk about doubling over the next year or so just forward, does that put you as far as how many dollars of revenues you will be able to produce? Thanks.","Jeff Lorberbaum","We presently have three plants, two in Europe and one in the United States. The plant in Europe was started before we purchased IVC and it's been a ramping up, we've just made - when we put the plant in, we didn't put in all the things that took to optimize the capacity, because we weren't sure what we didn't know. We've recently added more capacity to feed it, which is going to up the production levels as we speak in Europe. In the U.S. plant, with a totally different technologies than the other two, which ran about 50%, 60% faster over there. It's also in its final stages of startup. We've been making modifications to it, and over the July 4, we made additional changes to it, to try to get it to what we believe to be is optimum capacity later in the fall of this year.","In addition to those, we are in the process - or have ordered pieces of equipment that open the next generation of the United States plan that will run even better and have more capabilities, and we're going to put another line in the United States and into Europe, both of which should be running by the end of next year, will enable us to grow the business. The combination of all those together, will give us capacity exceeding a $1 billion between the two. We will have slightly more capacity in Europe, than we will have in the U.S. when we get through.","Michael Dahl","That's great. Thanks. And as my follow-up, I guess once you're fully ramped, and online with the three plants, could you give us sense for just differential in cost between fully producing domestically versus your current sourcing model?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I'm not sure, I'm prepared to break that out for you.","Michael Dahl","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Robert, your line is now open.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Bob, are you there? Maybe, we should go to the next one.","Robert Wetenhall","Hello.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Hey.","Robert Wetenhall","Can you hear me?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yeah, we can hear you now.","Robert Wetenhall","Sorry about that. Fantastic results I think, these speaks for themselves. Instead of going in because there is a lot of detail that both of you provided. I was hoping to kind of go big picture today and talk about the $600 million of capital spending through this year. If you could walk us through the kind of paybacks that you are getting on the dollar spend, and why it is that heavy investments that you've been making both in SG&A and capital spending to $2 billion between 2013 and 2016? Why does that make more sense for Mohawk, given your track record, your successful track record of acquisitions? Why is that preferable to share buybacks in returning capital to shareholders?","Frank Boykin","If I can get all those out, if I forget, you remind me. Our strategy is and has been to aggressively drive our business growth and profits through our profit allocations. And okay, where the truth I'm really not sure that our ability to do that's been fully recognized by the entire market. Prior to 2016, we invested about $5 billion into the business which is why we've been doing so well and expect to continue doing well.","Of that, about a $1.5 billion was into our existing assets and about $3.5 billion was into nine other acquisitions. With those things, the paybacks range from the short-end of two years for some of the capital to the long-end of about five years with most things and the difference in doing some of the internal pieces is, when you go into big projects, they can take year to year-and-a-half to get it going another year to bring it up to level. So, you don't get as much return in the first year too, but over the IRR over the five-year period and 10-year period is usually much greater, is it along with lower risks.","At the same time, during those things, we have invested, investing as the business get stronger, we started investing more in SG&A and most of the business is to drive it, and with the investments we're putting in, they get about $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion as what we said of additional sales. We have to be bringing up the SG&A in order to support those things and it goes in before you actually get the sales results, when you get through.","From there going forward, in 2016, we've announced, we're going to invest over $600 million, [indiscernible] in the same things of new products, increasing efficiencies, and giving us more capacity in all of our different businesses. Again, these investments are the ones that give us the highest return at what we believe to be the lowest risk of our various opportunities as they're.","Today, the fastest growing part of flooring industry is LVT as we just went through before, we'll have over $1 billion of capacity to support this in the U.S. and Europe, so we think we're well positioned. Our plants are more automated than others that are in the more integrated forward and backwards in order to make it at lower costs and give us high flexibility to make wherever the customer wants. With this, we continue to look at acquisition opportunities around the world. We remain disciplined in our approach to get good returns on those, and organization's ability to identify and execute these opportunities is really what sets us apart.","Robert Wetenhall","I agree. And that's a very helpful articulation of the strategy, and I also agree with your comment that I don't think this is being fully recognized by the investor base. Could you talk to us about the $600 million is a lot more than you normally spend, and we're thinking about only the next two years to three years. What's the trajectory of SG&A spending on a dollar basis. Frank mentioned you're going to get leverage. And although, it's a little early, how should we'll be thinking conceptually about CapEx in 2017 and 2018? Thanks. And good luck, nice quarter.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you very much. On the SG&A, we started raising it last fall, getting ready for all of these investments in order to have the sales stride, pushing through the growth to support all of these different pieces we're in. We've been doing it across the company in the various regions, which is why we are doing as well as we are. In the second quarter, even with those investments, the SG&A as a percent of sales, I think was only slightly above last year...","Frank Boykin","About 20 basis points.","Jeff Lorberbaum","So, it was slightly ahead of last year. And as we go through the fall, we think we're going to get leverage and expect percent of sales decline above the prior year as the sales get more in line with it. On a going forward basis, we'll have to keep investing, but we hope to keep the percent where it is or going down. For a given moment, it might get ahead or behind it as you try to align it with the new capacities we have coming in. did I get all the questions?","Robert Wetenhall","I was - that was great and just the other part of that and then I'll hand it over. What about capital spending in 2017 and 2018? Should we expect the elevated level of $600 million or do you see capital spending because you made a lot of investments in the last three years to your credit, should we think that will taper off?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We haven't finalized next year and beyond, a lot of the investment we're making this year there'll be parts of the carry over in next year. I would guess, it's going to be elevated, but we - next year, but we really haven't put it together yet. Just one last comment, the best thing I can do for the shareholders and the company is continue to find internal investments that have good paybacks. And I mean, if I could find twice as many I would do it, assuming that the risk and rewards are right which is what we're paid to do.","Robert Wetenhall","Sounds good to me. Good luck. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Eisner from Goldman Sachs. Sam, your line is now open.","Sam Eisner","Yeah. Thanks and good morning, everyone.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Good morning.","Sam Eisner","So going back to the productivity numbers Frank, if I heard you correctly I think you said about $41 million of productivity savings and I think that compares to $29 million in the first quarter or so. You're running at close to $70 million if I annualize that's about a $140 million. And so I'm curious the sustainability on the productivity savings. I understand that you're spending $600 million this year. But perhaps you can give us more of a medium-term commentary on how you think about productivity savings that's been steadily marching higher from about a $100 million in 2014 going to about $130 million in 2015 and now it seems to be, again run rate about $140 million for 2016. So, curious how you think about the medium-term productivity savings for the company.","Jeff Lorberbaum","This is Jeff to start. All these capital investments that we're putting in, a significant portion of them is also going towards improving the cost structures. As they come up, we have lower cost as well as higher revenues in pieces. So, some of it - some of the investments are going there. Every part of the business starts out the year with an internal productivity goal. It's made up of two parts. One is capital investments and the other is process changes. And we have very disciplined procedures of coming up with innovative ideas and then ensuring that they get driven through the business and execute it.","And the ideas, we start at with, I think, we probably get about 60 - I mean, some of it, we don't know how to do, we just put them down, so we need to do something, but probably get about 65% of get executed. At the same time, we come up with more of them every year and I am really putting a good process to drive it.","Frank Boykin","And besides that, Sam. I would not say that we're prepared to give a number or guidance, but like Jeff said, we are driving the business, everybody has goals in terms of productivity improvement, whether they're in manufacturing distribution or administrative roles, and it's a deeply embedded part of our culture here to continually improve the business.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes. I just want to make sure you understand, we're not out of ideas as the - and that's the reason we keep raising the profits and the margins.","Sam Eisner","Got it. So in your terms, we're halfway there on the productivity improvements?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes. I'm looking at a signing my office, it is halfway there, no matter where we are - we are always have quite.","Sam Eisner","Sounds good. And then maybe secondary, a little bit more of a macro question here. We've heard a couple of comments from other participants within the kind of broader building product sector this quarter talk about credit. And ultimately consumers beginning to use some credit, whether it HELOCs, whether it's home equity loans or even cash out refinancing. Curious what you're seeing on the ground level from some of the customers or at least commentary from some of your retailers, about how customer are ultimately using financing, if they're using it, in particular in North America? Thanks.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Hey, it's true, and that's close enough to actually give you a specifics of it. We think that the credit lines are getting better with people as their incomes go up. We think that the banks are getting a little easy in giving some credit. At the same time, as the incomes increase, and gasoline prices come down, we think all of the things are in place for us to do well over the near-term.","Sam Eisner","Appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. David, you line is now open.","David MacGregor","Hey, good morning, everyone. Great quarter, Jeff. With all of the things you've got going on right now, and where you started off, so can you just talk about the impact of startup costs on your 2Q margins, and how that might have compared with first quarter and year ago?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yeah. Startup cost in the second quarter were about $4 million. I don't know what year ago numbers were off the top of my head. We're estimating about another $3 million to $5 million in startup through the second half of the year though.","Frank Boykin","That's the amount of increase over last year.","Jeff Lorberbaum","That's total startup. Total startup.","David MacGregor","Yeah. Sound a little light to me. Congratulations on that. And then secondly, just if you could talk a little about China. And I know you've had investments there, you haven't really talk much about that lately, could you just update us on the scope of your presence there, are you profitable, what level of growth you're achieving, just any general elaboration would be helpful? Thanks.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Somewhere in the recent past, we changed the ownership position that we have in the China joint venture from an equity position to a debt position with agreements on a buy and sell arrangements between us and we changed the strategy because what we needed to do to operate in that environment, with us as an equity partner has limited their ability to participate on an equal basis in the marketplace. So, we still have a relationship with them, we are still purchasing product with them, but that's the relationship at this point.","David MacGregor","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baugh from Stifel. John, your line is now open.","John Baugh","Thank you. Good morning and congratulations on another terrific quarter.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you.","John Baugh","Could you tell us - you made this comment about orders improving. I am just curious is that a - an inventory pipeline time to refill comment or are you seeing end market demand actually improving and if you could maybe, discuss Jeff, regionally where you are seeing it as well as product wise where you see them? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Normally, we don't discuss the order side in the piece. We did it this time because the growth rate was a little lower, than we had wanted it to be and we wanted to make sure to understand that going into the next quarter, we are actually seeing the bookings from our customers increasing and going up. We believe that the growth rate is going to strengthen our growth rate, I can't speak for both, our growth rate is going to strengthen in the third period, and the first month that we've been seeing, we're seeing those things, and we think we're confident that it's going to occur going forward. At the same time, last time, we also had this $25 million of sales that were reduced between a combination of plant disruptions and negative FX, which decreased the - a little bit as we go through.","And so, we're seeing - so, we believe the businesses will be better. However, the European businesses were actually stronger in the second quarter, and we think those could moderate a little, because it was so strong in the second quarter. I want to remind everybody that our friends in Europe, in August - take August off, so it's always at a lower level and the margins drop - and the sales drop as things go in Europe. We keep trying to get them to work out through August, we're not working - we can't get them to do that. Yes.","John Baugh","If anybody can do it as you can, so just follow on up that, is there - you're saying then the - what you can see is better or but you're sure is that necessarily means, the end markets are better or [indiscernible] Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I can just say that our business is increasing. We also - we believe that we've taken actions that our business should be better than others. I'm not sure, how the home market is going to be versus where we are.","John Baugh","I appreciate that. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital. Mike, your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys. This is Drew on for Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. So, on LVT, there's no secret, that there's a lot of capacity coming on in the U.S and Mohawk alone is doubling capacity by the end of the year. So, I just wanted to ask what products do you think that the new LVT capacity is going to cannibalize and what products from Mohawk are most at risk?","Frank Boykin","So, the cannibalization within the marketplace. First is, there is a huge amount - I mean, almost all of the LVT is coming in from China as is. So, first is there is going to be a switch between the America sold from China and amount that's made here. The industry today here depending upon whose estimate years is somewhere around $1 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion, it's expected to grow maybe 15%, but it's going to grow $200 million over the next 12 months, so that's occurring, separate from that. So, one is there is the change from where it supplied from on a separate basis, it's taking a little bit from everything, it's coming out of almost every product category where it is. If you say, it's going to grow unlike up something, and you say, it's going to grow $200 million over the next 12 months, that's approximately 1% of the industry.","And if you do that the - if the whole industry grows maybe $3 million to $4 million, it's taken about one-third to 25% to 30% of all the growth is what's happening and it's coming from all over. We hope - we think we are going to be the best position in the marketplace with the lowest cost access and ability to deliver the best style and features in the marketplace, we know, we are ahead of everybody else.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks. And then, just on the margins for LVT in the U.S. Is that expanding across all price points or are there major differences between the high-end and the low-end?","Frank Boykin","There are different - and it's more segmented than that. The differences between residential and commercial, this differences between low, medium and high and a different products and different features require to optimize each. They are installed different, as at the low-end you know it could be glued in or laid in, the high-end could be clicked. And the performance features are different, depending upon residential and commercial.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks guys. Nice quarter.","Frank Boykin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research. Laura your line is now open.","Laura Champine","Thanks. Jeff, the question is about the assets that you're adding in Russia. You said they were to meet demand in 2018. Is that demand that you expect just through your own market share gains or are you actually making a call on a recovery of the end market there?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The first is, our present capacities, we're about three years into what I believe into the market decline. The ceramic industry in Russia, my estimate is, it's off about 35% from the peak, so the first thing that happened was the imports coming into Russia declined first. And they headed close to zero if they are not already. In that environment, the imports for supplying, the mid-to-high end part the marketplace. We were positioned in the mid-to-high end part of the marketplace and so we became the best option to replace it. Our business in connection with the rest of our businesses, we can make any product in Russia, you can get for anywhere.","So over that time what's happened is, our business has been expanding in the midst of a year to recession that's going on over there. We've also been expanding the - so have expanded the product offering with more style and design at different price points, and we've also been expanding our distribution points. But I don't know if you remember we also have over 300 either owned or franchised retail stores that we put through there as well as our own total national distribution system over there. In addition, because of these things, we're the only company over there that has a consumer brand.","So, with all this, we've been running our assets wide open at the moment. This year, we've actually increased the capacity. It's coming on in the fall of this year because we've run out our personal capacity as we speak today and that's coming in over the next, this period we're in right now. And then, the market is really close to looking like it's bottoming soon, so it takes us about almost a year and a half to two years to get new capacity in. So, we've ordered right now in order to be able to sustain the growth after 2017. We have to have some more capacity, so that's what we're ordered and it's coming in.","If the market picks up, we know the market is going to pick up somewhere, it's really low from where it is. It's got to pick up. Our distribution has been broadened, so we're really ready for it. And there is a chance we could be a little early or we could do a little late, but I mean we're in a right position. And I think we can push it through the marketplace no matter what.","Laura Champine","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Eric, your line is now open.","Eric Bosshard","Thanks. I'm curious for what you see going on in terms of your market share progress as you're adding capacity and adding new product and new designs of interested, but understand a little more about how that's connecting and what's happening with that, with your partners and your retail customers?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think that we're doing a little better than the overall market. The target go through, because each of the market is different. Carpet is about the industry this year is about flat in units; however, the dollars are down because of the change to polyester, which is the lower priced product and then the pass-through of the pricing, so the dollars are down even though the units were about flat. In the last quarter, I think we've done a little better than the industry.","On the other side of the thing you have products are growing much faster, so laminate is growing faster. I would guess, we're probably growing a little less than the industry in LVP, but I'm not sure, because we've held it up to - we don't want - we've held it up a little bit waiting for our capacity to support it, but it's going to start getting more as we go through. They have ceramic, it's growing relatively well and we're fully participating in it, would grow and we're putting in a new wood plant to folks participate more in it. Our plants have been running full. We've increased the capacity of it coming into this year. So, I think, we're doing well. I think we'll grow more than the marketplace.","Eric Bosshard","Okay. That's helpful. Secondly in terms of you're pretty specific on SG&A, the curious and how we should be thinking about gross margin you had now four quarters of benefit from I think lower input costs, we saw this quarter, I think a little bit less benefit and a little bit less give back on price? But any guidance you could give us and how we should think about the gross margin and\/or the price cost environment that we should look forward to?","Jeff Lorberbaum","The margins we're expecting to have higher margins this year over last year in the fall going forward, has built into the estimate that we've given you in the earnings per share. All these investments and things we're doing, are trying to drive the two pieces, which is the top line up and the cost down. And then you hear us, managing the SG&A piece on purpose, we raised the SG&A last fall, and we're going to have to keep tweaking it based on what the market is and what's happening in order to balance our sales with our production expectations. And hopefully, we'll be able to drive that without going - without raising the percentage and driving it down, but we'll have to see how it goes.","Eric Bosshard","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Michael, your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, this is Jason in for Mike. My question is on the organic growth trends in Flooring North America. I know, obviously the growth on an organic basis went to about 1% from 4% last quarter, and I think you highlighted that there was some large customers that postponed product launches, is one of the drivers there. Just wanted to see if that was really the biggest driver of the slow growth or is there anything else to call out?","Jeff Lorberbaum","And then, I know I think you talked about having more of an indication of solid orders in terms of 3Q, just wanted to see what July trends look like in Flooring North America and a better organic growth rate return to the kind of 3% to 4% number you saw over the last few quarters?","I think first our belief is that the GDP growth slowed, it was - didn't increase as we had anticipated and the market growth was a little slower. Second is that you have to realize that residential carpet is a huge part of our total business and the average selling prices are negative, and that for all the reasons we've already discussed. We did have large customers in multiple categories push product launches out, but they're still going in. We had some customers actually lowering inventory in the period. And given all those things what we said is that we expect the higher growth in the third quarter and the bookings that are in hand that we've been receiving through July, support that expectation.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. And then just a question on what you're seeing in terms of hardwood volumes in North America, and where do you stand right now from a price cost standpoint relative to [indiscernible]?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We announced a price increase sometime prior to now, with those increases are being implemented as we speak. And there will be put through the marketplace. We have seen from that as the categories, they have to look at it from an engineered wood product and a solid wood product. The solid wood product is under pressure because as the prices has gone up on the solid wood, the engineered price has gotten less and so the engineered capacity is going to continue growing at the expenses of the solid wood is that, I'm guessing that the wood - the total wood volume, if you look at the year we're guessing somewhere in the 3% to 4% range for the industry. And overall for the whole industry and it could be 3% or more, we think the wood piece will be growing at a faster rate in that, maybe 5% to 6%, but then the start - all the growth is going to be in the engineered piece and the solid could be flat or down.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Armstrong from Vertical Research. James, your line is now open.","James Armstrong","Congrats on a good quarter. First question is, have you seen any impact of Brexit on either your business or the M&A potential, and the European market cap?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I have to understand that the - our business in those areas only make up about 1% of our income. So, relative to our whole business, I mean, it's really a small part of it. Part of that, we support what we have here in two ways. One we have local manufacturing and the local manufacturing is in products that don't easily ship and have high freight costs. So, those businesses haven't seen a significant change in anything at this point.","The other part we ship from Western Europe into there, we have been - we're in the process of adjusting prices relatively where the pounds have been to get them leveled out. And it's a little early to tell exactly how this whole things going to move forward, but our total business is going to have a significant impact in one way or another?","James Armstrong","Okay. That helps. And switching gears, you talked about the mix shift in carpet in the North American business. Do you think that mix shift will continue into the back half of your or should it rebound more towards the consumer higher margin business.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I'm not sure the mix shift you're talking about.","James Armstrong","You talked about more shift to the home - to the new construction market.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yes. What I said was that there are channels that are doing better. And so as a general piece, new housing is growing much faster than the general market. The - some of that - a lot that new housing is at lower quality level, and at the same time you've seen the multifamily business grow. On average those channels use lower quality product, and when the consumer comes in and purchases it as a remodel piece.","So, as those pictures - I don't see those changing in the near term. I'm hoping that the remodel piece will improve as yet it more, but we'll have to see how it goes. On the other side, the other thing that's happening is the builder multi-family channels have moved faster to polyester. So, the different in moving from, when I used to buy nylon the polyester is also impacting the average price in those even more so than the other one.","James Armstrong","Okay. That helps. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkats from Raymond James. Sam your line is now open.","Sam Darkats","Good morning, Jeff and Frank. How are you?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Great.","Frank Boykin","Good morning, Sam.","Sam Darkats","Couple of questions, first of there is a piggyback on one of the earlier questioners. I know you mentioned the delays in - in some corporate shipments due to customers reducing inventory. I think you also sided in ceramic tile, there were some delays in the second quarter getting push to the third quarter. Can you estimate what the sales impact of that - I know, you have estimated the plant disruptions, but could you estimate what the shipping delays were because of customer timing?","Jeff Lorberbaum","No. I don't have those to give you in front of me.","Sam Darkats","Was it material?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I would have mentioned if - it didn't impact it.","Sam Darkats","Perfect. Okay. My last question, it's been maybe 12 months or so outside of Xtratherm, that you've made a deal, an acquisition of some significance, trying to get a sense of why that is based on the fact that that you've indicated as a real fertile hunting ground for deals, I'm wondering, if is it a lack of selling interest, is it the fits that you're looking at may not be that great or is it valuation being too high, what's been impediment or the constraint on making deals?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We continue to talk to people and look at various opportunities. We remain disclaimed in our approach with the risk and values. So we apply different risk levels to different businesses depending upon where they're located and what they are and we haven't been able to come to a common agreement with anybody in the last six months, but it doesn't mean, we're not trying.","Frank Boykin","Sam, I would also remind you that many of our acquisitions that we've done over the years have been discussions and negotiations that have gone on for years. Dal-Tile is a good example, IBC is a good example, is a good example, those each were at least two years or three years of ongoing discussions.","Sam Darkats","Helpful. Thank you much. Have a great weekend.","Frank Boykin","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Rednor from Zelman & Associates. Scott your line is now open.","Scott Rednor","Good afternoon. Frank real quick question for you, cash flow from operation year-to-date has essentially doubled from the last year. Just curios if you could talk about the cash conversion in the back of the half of the year, anything unusual on those numbers that we see?","Frank Boykin","No I expect - Scott I expect the cash flow this year to be - continue to be strong as we move into the second half of the year there, we're going continue to see good strong earnings and manage operating - our working capital even with the elevated CapEx. The CapEx, it will be more in the second half and it was in the first half as we go through, but so should the earnings. And then I don't know about acquisitions, whatever shows up.","Scott Rednor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Megan, your line is now open.","Megan McGrath","Thanks, good afternoon. Most of the my questions have been answered. I didn't want to ask you know you go through a lot of the capital projects each quarter, are there any of that - I know it's involved in increasing capacity. I could guess LVT, but I'd love to hear your answer. Where do you think the most acute need is to increase capacity and have you either accelerated plans or reprioritized any in the last couple of months?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Yeah I think LVT is the most important one because of the changing marketplace and the opportunity would make it that at the high one. The question about changing plans or not, given our capital structure, which I've spoken about few times up to now, we will have a huge amount of capital available to us. So, if it's a good idea, we're going to support it today as we go through. We have other things that, if you look at the different businesses, my laminate in the United States is running full out, we're importing products from other places, my ceramic, I'm actually importing product from our manufacturing in Italy, Russia and Bulgaria into my ceramic business, as you go through.","We mentioned, that my Mexico business, I was selling everything that we were making at this point. My wood business in the United States, as I said, I was building a new plant, because I'm sold up there. I mean, I can go through one of the timely deal, but I mean, the business is running really well and we are adding capacities to support our growth.","Megan McGrath","Thanks. That's helpful. That's all I have.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Susan, your line is now open.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good morning. Quickly, I'm just wondering, in your comments, you mentioned that your countertop sales are increasing and it sounds like as if perhaps you are gaining some share there, can you just talk about, who you think you are taking that from and maybe what the trends have been there?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I forgot how many years ago, we decided the goal into the countertop business. We saw it as an adjunct to our ceramic business, and we've become the largest distributor of countertops in the country. It's a very fractured business as a distribution business with a lot of small people in regional places and because we cover most of the United States, but not all of it, with it, so it's an opportunity to grow our business as a broad distribution company. We've been able to leverage our relationships with ceramic and stone flooring to build a nice business that we have and we see opportunities to expand the position into more distribution and look at the other opportunities within it. There are - for instance, in Europe, there is a porcelain countertop being made similar to ceramic tile, and we're actually putting in capacity, I mentioned earlier, to actually make it in Europe. So once we put that in, which should be sometime next year, we'll start importing it and selling it through our own distribution as it for instance.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Thank you. And then more broadly and you touched a little bit on this in some of your other comments. But can you talk about what you're seeing on the remodel side in general? Has that accelerated at all, and are you seeing any shift in people perhaps taking or choosing some higher margin kind of choices within that?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I think my best answer is more of the same is that it's okay, but you would normally think it should be really much stronger, given where we are in the cycle and what's going on, but it is what it is.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lorberbaum for closing comments.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you for joining us. We're optimistic about our position in the marketplace. We believe the market is going to continue doing well, and we think we're well positioned. Have a great day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14975":["Mohawk Industries, Inc.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answers period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, November 4, 2016. Thank you.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Frank Boykin. Mr. Boykin, you may begin your conference.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Heidi. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries quarterly investor conference call. Today, we'll update you on the Company's results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide guidance for the fourth quarter.","I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Jeff?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. In the third quarter, our growth strengthened and our margins continued to expand. Our earnings per share for the period were $3.62, a 25% increase over the prior year or $3.50 per share excluding unusual items, an increase of 17% and an all-time record for the Company. Our strategy of investing in our existing businesses as well as synergistic acquisitions continues to deliver record results. For the period, our operating margin excluding unusual charges and 160 basis points to an all-time high of 16% as a result of higher volume and productivity.","Our revenues as reported for the second quarter were 2.3 billion, an increase of 9% on a constant days and exchange rate basis. Our organization continues to create new products with greater value to the consumer to introduce unique ideas that enhance our processes and to invest and technology and equipment that improve our cost, quality and service. The four acquisitions we completed in 2015 contributed to our results as we enhance their performance by upgrading their offerings, expanding their distribution and improving their productivity.","As expected, excluding unusual charges, our SG&A costs as a percentage of sales improved 60 basis points, as our investment and sales personnel marketing and merchandising increased our sales and mix. In many of our product categories and geographies, our operations are running at or near capacity. These include all of our Global Ceramic, laminate, and sheet vinyl asset.","Additionally, we are currently selling all of our LVT we are manufacturing even as we continue to increase our production capacity in the U.S. and Europe. To meet our growing customer demand, our capital investments this year will be the highest in our history as we invest almost $650 million in additional capacity, more efficient assets and new products. Our strong results have increased our cash flow, enabling the expansion of our capacities and the pursuit of attractive opportunities. We continue to explore potential acquisitions from around the globe that complement our business and expand our geographic reach or product categories.","In late October, Moody's noted that the U.S. consumer spending is growing at a healthy pace through the job creation and wage growth, higher disposable income, strong consumer credit and pent up demand to replace aging goods. The National Association of Homebuilders affirmed that single-family housing demand should continue moving forward in the months ahead and that remodelers nationwide are seeing increased demand. Harvard's LIRA index likewise projects strong gains in home renovation to continue into next year with activity stimulated by rising home values and tightening existing home inventories.","The October Architectural Billing Index pulled back slightly although AIA expect commercial development to rebound after the Presidential Election. The European Central Bank remains committed to keeping interest rate at historic lows and buying bonds through at least March of 2017. Although, Russia remains in a recession, economists believe the economic slowdown is nearing a bottom. I'll now review our third quarter performance by segment.","Our Global Ceramic segment sales rose 4% as reported, and 6% on a constant based and FX basis with currency translation in Mexico and Russia negatively impacting our sales as reported by $5 million during the period. Operating income for the segment excluding unusual charges grew 13% over last year due to improvement in volume and productivity. Our North American Ceramic sales trends improved from the second to the third quarter and operating margin expanded over last year. New home construction in the commercial sector outperformed residential remodeling and sales growth through our regional service centers outperformed other channel.","The higher average selling prices of our new product introductions were partially offset by pressure on commodity products. We\u2019re introducing larger sizes and three-dimensional wall tiles to extend our design leadership. We've been operating at full capacity and supplementing our domestic production with imports from our global assets and other sources. Our new Tennessee plant is fully operational and improving throughput. With the facility state-of-the-art capabilities, we are developing unique styles and larger sizes that will enhance our offering.","We continue to upgrade the merchandising in our service centers to broaden our customer base and drive higher sales. New paperless systems and processes in our service centers are increasing our ability to satisfy our customer and increasing our productivity. Sales in Mexico continue to expand faster than the market, which is up more than 10% in volume this year. We are broadening our product offering and distribution and preparation for the expansion of our Salamanca plant, which will be operational in the fall of 2017.","We\u2019ve reduced the complexity of our U.S. operations as we realigned our plants by product types and increased capacity allocated to the Mexican market. This year hundreds of projects are enhancing productivity at all our facility, reducing the cost of raw materials and improving the service and efficiencies of our logistics network. During the period, we successfully upgraded our ERP system with a well executed implementation. The capabilities of our organization are improving daily and overtime the system will enhance our performance with new functionality.","Our European ceramic sales grew significantly in both Western and Eastern Europe from our sales and product strategies focused on local markets and preferences. In Western Europe, our investments in the state-of-the-art equipment have allowed us to bring unique products to market and expand our margins and mix. Our product introduction during the last two years had made us the leader in wood, stone and ceramic visual in large and small formats.","We are expanding our participation in the commercial channel by increasing specifications with architects, designers and property managers. We will complete the upgrading of our high-end commercial asset by mid 2017, which will finish the entire overhaul of the Italian operations we acquired in 2013. We are also entering the ceramic slab business and anticipate production of countertops and large ceramic wall coverings by the end of next year.","Our Eastern European ceramic business improved as we expanded capacity in Bulgaria and upgraded the style and design of our products. We are shipping products from Bulgaria to the U.S. and Western Europe to grow our business. We are in the process of transitioning our Bulgarian operations to our Italian operating system, and we expect this project to complete in the first quarter of 2017.","In Russia, the economy appears to be bottoming out, and our ceramic business there is operating at capacity. During the period, our sales improved on a local basis as we increased our participation in the new construction sector and expanded our distribution through investments in owned and franchise stores. Sales of our new product introduction have reinforced our style leadership and improved our mix and margins.","Next year, we will install new capacity to enhance our offering and support additional growth when the Russian market improves. Our Flooring North America segment improved as expected, growing 6% as reported or 7% on an adjusted days basis. Excluding unusual items, the segment's operating margin expanded the 15% from higher volume and productivity as well as lower SG&A as a percentage of sales.","During the quarter, both our soft and hard surface flooring increased with hard surface growing faster. Our commercial carpet and rug sales offset softer residential carpet, which was impacted by polyester growth and pressure on commodities. Our premium Karastan brand continues to grow with the expansion of our product offering and increased distribution. The SmartStrand Naturals collection we introduced this year is positioned at the high end of the market, reinforcing our leadership in the premium category. Product innovation continues to drive our business with recent introductions comprising about one third of our carpet sales during the period.","Our commercial carpet performance continues to strengthen with all end markets growing. We've expanded our commercial sales force and are increasing our participation in individual projects and large national accounts. We announce our resident and commercial carpet price increase of 3% to 5% effective January to cover increased costs. A new carpet pad plant is being completed to service the Southwest region adjacent to our ceramic plant in Mexico near California. Our rug sales grew during the period as we introduced new fashion forward collections and entered new categories with outdoor rugs and utility mats.","Our hard surface sales of laminate, wood, LVT and sheet vinyl continue to grow significantly with expanded margins. Our sales of these products are constrained by our present capacity, which are in various stages of expansion. Our participation in all channels is increasing as result of the investments we\u2019ve made in sales, marketing and innovative products. Improvement in our LVT production continues to increase our capacity and broaden our product offering.","We're adding new capabilities to our LVT manufacturing plant, which will provide new product features next year. We\u2019re in the final stages of completing our new engineered wood plant, which will allow us to introduce largest sizes with unique finishes. The expansion of our laminate plant in 2017 will satisfy the increasing demand of our premium collections with superior performance and realistic visuals.","Our manufacturing productivity across all product categories continues to positively impact our margin. Innovation in every process is driving cost and quality improvements. We\u2019re expanding our tracking fleet across the country to improve our service and cost position.","Our Flooring Rest of the World segment performed well during the period, delivering a 15% in sales as reported and a 41% improvement in operating income on a constant currency basis, excluding unusual item. Our legacy basis with constant days and FX sales rose 8%.","SG&A as a percent of sales continue to improve during the period. We\u2019re increasing prices based on market conditions to offset currency fluctuations. Our European flooring growth was lead by LVT and wood partially offset by lower sheet vinyl sales, due to the disruption of production at our Belgium facility.","Our laminate business continues to grow due to the strength of our Quick-Step and Pergo brands in the premium part of the market. We\u2019re leveraging the strong performance of our 2016 laminate introductions by expanding designs and sizes we offer. Our European and Russian laminate plants are operating near capacity with expansions planed for Europe at the end of \u201917 and Russia in \u201918. We\u2019re currently implementing process improvement to incrementally increase throughput and reduce cost.","Our wood business continues to expand and was raised prices to offset material increases and currency changes. Our LVT sales are increasing dramatically and our margins are expanding, as the product mix and productivity improve. In the period, our LVT sales were limited by our capacity which has recently been increased.","By the end of the year, we will further modify our processes to expand our production even more. In the interim, we\u2019re supplementing our LVT collections with source products to satisfy customers demand. We began construction of the building for our new LVT line which would be operational at the end of next year.","Our sheet vinyl sales during the period were lower as a result of a fire at the end of the second period. The Belgium plant is now fully operational, and we do not anticipate any long-term impact. Our insurance will cover the majority of these costs. We continue to expand our commercial sheet vinyl sale and have announced pricing increases to offset currency changes.","Investments we\u2019ve made to improve our costs of MDF and chipboard are increasing our margins. Our roof panel business remains steady. Sales of our insulation boards continue to grow, although lower material cost and manufacturing improvements are being offset by increased competition and unfavorable exchange rates. We\u2019re realizing the anticipated synergies from the integration of our Xtratherm acquisition.","I will now turn the call over to Frank, to review our financial performance for the period.","Frank Boykin","Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $2.294 billion and grew about 7% both as reported and using constant exchange rates and days for our legacy business. We had one last day in the third quarter, and we will have one more day in the fourth quarter compared to last year. All segments had good growth. As we stated last quarter, our Q2 sales growth was lower than expected and we anticipate that to help the Q3 growth rate. We do not expect to maintain a 7% growth rate going forward.","Our gross margin as reported was 31.7% excluding charges, the gross margin was 32.4% up a 100 basis points versus last year driven by growing productivity and higher volume. Our SG&A as reported was $348 million or 15.2% of sales. Excluding charges SG&A was 16.4% of sales, a 60 basis point improvement over last year. Unusual charges this quarter were net benefit of $12 million. This is comprised of a $90 million cash receipt for a legal settlement, partially offset by $48 million non-cash charge for a trade name write-off where we\u2019ve changed our commercial business, commercial carpet business brand focus, and a $30 million restructuring charge of which approximately half is cash.","Our operating margin excluding charges was 16% and is up 160 basis points over last year. Interest expense ended up $9 million and decrease due to the redemption of higher rate bonds in January of this year and the introduction of a lower rate commercial paper program. Other expense as reported was $5 million and includes approximately $3 million of an indemnification receivable recorded last year for our IVC purchase accounting. We have an offsetting tax benefit as a related tax liability was unwound.","Our income tax rate was 26.4% for the quarter and that compares to 21.9% last year. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to range between 23% and 24% and our tax rate for the full year next year in 2017 to range between 26% and 27%. Earnings per share excluding charges were $3.50, up 17% over last year. Return to the segments, in the Global Ceramic segment sales were $822 million or up 4% as reported. They increased 6% on a constant days and exchange rate basis. We had very strong growth both in Europe and in Russia in local currency with North America growth rate improving over the second quarter.","Our operating margin excluding charges was 16.6%, that's up a 130 basis points over last year. Contributing to the growth over last year was productivity of $14 million, volume of $6 million and a positive price mix of $7 million, partially offset by $4 million of SG&A investment. In the Flooring North American segment, sales as reported were $1.9 billion, up 6%, or up 7% using constant days, with the hard surface categories outpacing soft surface. In soft surface, both rugs and commercial carpet grew faster than residential carpet.","Our operating margin excluding charges was 15.3% that\u2019s 140 basis points primarily from productivity of $16 million and volume of 12%. In the Flooring Rest of World segment sales as reported were $464 million are up 15% over last year. Our legacy business was at 8% using constant days and constant exchange rates. Our operating margin excluding charges was 18.4%, up 250 basis points and it was positively impacted by productivity of $10 million and volume of $11 million plus deflation of $7 million.","FX negatively impacted operating income by approximately $5 million primarily from the British pound. We are planning to offset the sterling headwind next quarter with price increases. The corporate elimination segment had an operating loss of $10 million, and we expect this to be about a $36 million to $38 million loss for the full year.","Jumping to the balance sheet, receivables ended the quarter to $1.506 billion. Our days sales outstanding were up to 56 days compared to 53 days last year, due to change in the channel mix. Inventories ended the quarter $1.673 billion, our inventory days improved by one day to 104days in the quarter. Fixed assets were $3.341 million and included capital expenditures during the quarter of $184 million with depreciation and amortization of $104 million.","CapEx for the full year is estimated to be approximately $650 million with depreciation and amortization for the full year of $410 million. Long-term debt was about $3 billion and our leverage debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.6 times.","Jeff, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thank you, Frank. Today Mohawk is in the best position in the Company\u2019s history. This year, we are investing at our highest level ever to meet increasing demand around the globe. We are preparing for future growth by expanding our differentiated product offerings and increasing the capacity and efficiency of our operations. With our continued investment and manufacturing technology, we are introducing distinctive collections to improve our sales and enhance our mix.","We aggressively implementing productivity improvements across the enterprise and all facets of our business, and we are bringing new capacity online to support our growth. This year, our strong operating results have expanded our cash flow and reduced our leverage to historically low levels. We are currently exploring numerous investment options to further our expansion, including Greenfield opportunities, and acquisitions to broaden our geographic presence and product portfolio.","Taking these factors into account, our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter is $3.16 to $3.25, which represents a 12% to 15% increase over our fourth quarter 2015 EPS excluding any restructuring charges.","I\u2019ll now be glad to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Bob Wetenhall","Good morning. What a fantastic quarter. Thanks for all the detail, Jeff. I was hoping you could spend a little bit more time articulating what's going on with capacity. It sounds like you're sold out in a number of markets. And if you could give us a roadmap to think about what your outlook is for capital spending, and the timing and sequence with which new capacity comes to market, that would be helpful.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I gave it to you in the speech. I think I can consolidate it little better. In the Ceramic business, almost all of the various pieces are at capacity. We have just finished installing a new plant in Tennessee. It's up and operating almost at the projected levels already. We\u2019ve announced the increase of our plant in Mexico, which is outside Mexico City, it\u2019s going to -- we\u2019re going to double the capacity. That will be done in end of next year.","Moving to Europe, we\u2019re placing the balance of the assets that we acquired in a high end part, that are focused more on a high and commercial part of the business. Those should be in place sometime about mid year, I believe. In addition, we\u2019re putting a new capacity to go on a new product category, which makes ceramic slabs and those can be used for countertops and walls and other pieces as well as floor.","We have recently increased the capacity in Bulgaria. There won't be any more in next year; and in Russia, we\u2019re increasing our capacity next year to prepare for the Russian market to improve, once if we can move around the world -- I'll sort of combined some of these, because they are intertwined. In the laminate business, we're using all our capacity in that US, Europe and Russia presently.","We have expansion plans for all three. Some of the equipments going to be off, as it going to take a while to get it in, we\u2019ll expand the U.S. in the fall of next year followed by Europe and then followed by Russia. And it's just the matter of timing of the supplier to get the equipment in. In the wood business, we\u2019ve been putting in a new engineered wood plant, which we will be starting, which is in the middle of starting up this fall, and engineered wood which is also running in capacity.","The LVT businesses, we're running all the capacity we have in the US and in Europe. Both of those are making incremental increase as we speak in each one, and I\u2019ll continue to do so probably through the first quarter of next year. We\u2019re in the process of adding another production line in both Europe and the US, which will be working at the end of next year. And total combine will have about over a billion dollars of capacity in LVT, as a new category.","There are some other smaller things like we just put up a new pad plant in the Western United States, which will fill out our padding strategy across the United States. We have got put in new capacity to make two new types of rugs recently, and we\u2019re looking for alternatives everywhere. The best investments we can make are the ones in internal investment. They have the highest paybacks and lowest risk. The only negative is some of them would go into new geographies and pieces; you tend to lose money for the first year or so as you are ramping them up and getting enough volume to go through them. If I could identify twice as many, I would spend it.","Bob Wetenhall","It sounds like you're keeping busy. What are your -- and maybe this is for Frank, what is your best guess on a preliminary basis for capital spending in 2017? You're going to maintain the same pace in terms of internal investment opportunities. Is it going to be a $600 million or $700 million number? And I was just hoping you could step outside the quarter and maybe just talk on a bigger-picture basis. It seems like you're getting a lot of margin expansion. Is there any way through gross margin performance or EBITDA you could talk about the margin benefit you're getting between, splitting it between productivity improvements and favorable operating leverage? I\u2019m just trying to do a step-through or a walk-through to understand how CapEx can drive productivity enhancement. Thanks and good luck. Great quarter.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Thanks. So, this year as we mentioned, we\u2019re spending about $650 million in CapEx. It will remain elevated and next year probably more than that, we\u2019ve not finalized the plant yet, but as a high likelihood it would be more. I think if you look at the CapEx, we\u2019re spending this year and broke it down into three buckets maintenance, capacity and productivity margin improvement. Maintenance is about 100 million; and then of the balance, this lapped, about two-thirds of spend is going towards capacity; and about a third of spend is going towards margin improvement productivity. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Stephen Kim","Well, thanks very much and let me also add my congratulations. It seems like you guys never run out of things to keep yourself busy with. So, running through all that capacity that you just did, I know in the past you have given us some guide on what you think the combined potential sales that can be supported through this capacity is. But it's a moving target, obviously, because you keep doing more things. So can you give us an updated view on what you think the capacity expansion you've been putting through and by the end of, should be done, I would guess, by 2018, what kind of expansion in sales that can support?","Jeff Lorberbaum","So last time we gave a number, it was between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. But I\u2019m not sure includes everything that's in the plan going forward. But that's as close as I have at this minute.","Stephen Kim","Okay. But it's going to be higher than that, clearly, in light of everything that's been going on. Okay. My second question is, lots of things I'm sure that will be asked. But just generally speaking, I was curious if you could talk about on the M&A front, how Brexit and maybe even more broadly the overall change in tone, moving against issues of free trade, how that, if at all, has affected the way you think about M&A in Europe versus the U.S..","Jeff Lorberbaum","I don\u2019t think, it really impacts the way we look at it. We take each business depending upon geography and we determine what the risk or within that business. Most of our businesses, I think all the businesses. The majority of what we sale is in the local market in the same currencies.","So we\u2019re really look at it and how the markets going to change, but we do across currencies, as well as with small and secondary to the core businesses that we\u2019re trying. So the biggest questions we have, depends on where you go, is the political environment, the exchange risks, and how those impact the competition as we speak and with required different returns based on the risks levels we do and makes it more difficult to do things in certain markets and others.","On the acquisition side, we\u2019re always looking at acquisitions. We remain disciplined to ensure that you know we are taking a proper risk to getting the returns for it. At this point, our balance sheet in organization really allowed us to pursue multiple opportunities at the same time, if we can find the right one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter. First question, Frank, you referenced the 7% organic number in the third quarter and cautioned not to expect that type of a run rate going forward. But just looking at the guidance for the fourth quarter, it would seem that to get to that number you are probably still talking towards or getting at a good, healthy mid-single-digit organic growth rate. Is that correct?","Frank Boykin","No, I think what I said is it not going to be 7% going forward, but I think it\u2019s going to be more than what we saw in the second quarter. That helps.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. That does. And just also thinking about 2017, also on the top line, obviously referencing all the different types of capacity projects and the amounts that you\u2019re spending over the next couple years, that\u2019s going to obviously benefit the top line. A lot of the capacity, I believe, that you just outlined before, Jeff looks to be going online let\u2019s say the majority of mid 2017. So how should we think about the impact kind of on top of what you call end market growth, what type of incremental impact might we expect the different capacity projects to benefit sales on top of that. Would it be a kind of 1%, 2% number or is it really more of a 2018 event?","Frank Boykin","I mean, there are so many projects at different times, they flow in. I mean like we just finished the ceramic plant in Tennessee, that's running almost wide open already, is it. So, I mean, that's already happening. We have a wood plant that\u2019s coming up, by the end of the year, it will be running full. I mean, there is a lot of capacity is coming in all through the period, and it\u2019s the support that the business I mean the largest we've gotten. In order to support the growth rate, it takes a significant amount of capacity to keep growing at these rates across the business as big as we\u2019ve gotten. And we\u2019re committed to keep the growth up.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. One last one if I could, just on the margins, fantastic performance there as well. I think, Frank, you\u2019ve talked about it in the past you\u2019ve done 400 basis points consolidated over the last two years or on track to do. Again, with some of the capacity projects coming online, would you expect that to be dilutive at all? Or how should we think about the pace of margin improvement going forward into 2017?","Frank Boykin","Mike, I think margins going into\u201917 and the ceramic North America segment will continue to improve. And as we pull out the IP business out of the Rest of World segment, the margins in that remaining non-IP business will continue to improve as well.","Jeff Lorberbaum","We try to have philosophy, not to go on profit holidays.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.","Eric Bosshard","Good morning, Jeff. Two things. First of all, inasmuch as you know, curious on your growth rate relative to your end markets' strong growth. Wondering if that's what you observe in the market, or if you believe you're gaining share. Then, secondly, on the strong North America up 7% number, which is the best out of that segment a while, I just would love the little bit more detail of what drove that and where that number should be expected going forward.","Jeff Lorberbaum","I would guess and the U.S. market to the flooring industry is going to grow 3% to 4%. So, it spread across all different pieces, and it depends on which part you're participating in, to do at in each piece is different. My best guess is that will probably what will happen next year at this point, and we\u2019re hoping to do better than that. What was the second part of the question?","Eric Bosshard","The North America performance in the quarter?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Part of it was the second quarter was a little lower than we expected. Some of it got pushed in there. The other is the ramp up of our LVT sales and here with the new plant coming up, if all the investments we put in sales and marketing and new products all the way of 12 to 18 months. I mean these things don\u2019t just show up to one minute. It\u2019s all the activities that we started, we talked about last year our upping our investments to drive business in North America and NRI places and we\u2019re getting the benefit of that in our year and half later.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Stephen East","Thank you, good morning, guys. Jeff, just a couple questions around the revenue growth again. Sort of following on, Eric. Do you think the sell through in the industry, particularly in North America, was at the same pace as what you all were doing? Or do you think there was something unique that was going on that maybe you all were selling in faster than the sell through was going out? Then the Ceramic, we're typically used to seeing Ceramic growing faster than your North American business. Is this just because of your issues on capacity constraints, or you think there is a shift in what the market is? Which one is driving the market, if you will?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Each category is grown definitely, so what happens is right now to have LVT is started from a relatively low base, it\u2019s been accepted in the market place and it\u2019s in the same place at laminate was in the mid 90\u2019s to 2000. So with the investments we\u2019re putting in it, it\u2019s pushing it up. On the other side you have the wood business that tends to be driven a lot by the new housing construction as a much bigger piece in new housing. So it\u2019s doing better in the market in total. Those two pieces are helping it and then all the other activities we\u2019re trying to do to improve our own business relative to the market are helping our other parts.","Stephen East","Okay. So it sounds like the sell-through is matching up with what you all delivered then, just taking share out of it. Is that a correct assumption on that? Then the last question I've got, your price hikes that you're implementing, your past experience, how much do you think that will, how much of it typically sticks? And then are these price hikes just taking care of the inflation you've seen, or is it trying to get out ahead of where you think this inflation curve is going with raw materials?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We\u2019re in the very first initial stages of it. We just recently announced a 3% to 5% increase. It's to cover raw materials, energy, labor, medical benefits in it. We'll have to see how it evolves. We need the increases to cover cost changes we go through. On the other hand, we\u2019re going to remain competitive in the marketplace. That we always do. Historically these things start out and, as the prices get more finalized in the market some go up more, some go up less.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Rednor from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Scott Rednor","Hi, good morning. Question for you, Frank, on the padding income. I think earlier this year you guided to it being down in 2016. I wanted to check that that's been, that's followed that trajectory. And maybe you could just reiterate the outlook for the roll-off in 2017, if any way that's changed.","Frank Boykin","Yes. Royalty income improved due to some increased LVT sales and recovery of some old fees. And next year, so that was for this year that I was speaking to. Next year, we anticipate royalty income to be in the $65 million to $70 million with about a $35 million run rate after the patent expires at the end of May.","Scott Rednor","And then a bigger picture question for you guys on the countertop side. That's come up the past couple calls now. Maybe, Jeff, how long has that opportunity been available to you? And is there any risk that you're going through a different end channel or different customer? How do you think about that opportunity relative to what we see externally as core Flooring?","Jeff Lorberbaum","I don\u2019t want to get you confused. We have a countertop business which we act as a distributor in the United States and one of the largest distributors in the United States in a fairly fractured market. The ceramic countertop business started a limited number of years ago in Europe and it\u2019s just ramping up in Europe. And it takes a while to get the market to accept it. The same product in the U.S. is in it's really infancy. So it's a very small part of, it's almost none in the U.S. it's so small. So we're starting in Europe, where the market is already starting accepting it. And we\u2019ll be shipping product from there to the U.S. And over time if it makes sense, we will put in more capacity in the United States. All that different than the quartz business which we also sell-through our distribution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. Really tagging on the prior question, more conceptually, I know that you\u2019ve given some detail on your countertop business and expansion. But as you think about growing outside just Flooring and into other categories, could you give us more color in terms of strategic thoughts as you look over the next two to three years on where you\u2019d like to grow, as you think about M&A beyond just Flooring?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Let me start with Flooring before we leave it. We are really in an unusual position most businesses around the world that we have the capacity to expand our flooring business into all parts of geographies around the world, it gives us the opportunity to Greenfield and\/or acquire other flooring businesses that we think we can add value to and gives us a much broader market to play in. Beyond that at some point, it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for us to add another product category to our business, and there are a lot of options to do that. And we haven\u2019t chosen one, but we\u2019ve already be in it, yes.","Kathryn Thompson","I was just hoping a little color on what the most logical in your mind would be?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Listen, the closer a business is to our historical business, the more value we can add. The more we can influence the manufacturing, the distribution, the style and design of sort it, so the closer for it the better. On the other hand we have shown, as we started out in a carpet company, we didn\u2019t know anything about ceramic and we become the largest ceramic producer in the world. We didn\u2019t know anything about LVT, and we are going to be the largest LVT producer in the world recently. So, I mean we\u2019d look at it is on each one is as we find the right opportunities and value in, we take them on a one-off basis, and they really think we can participate in many things in the world.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. Great. And my follow-up question. Once again you said earlier in the Q&A that flooring industry is projected to grow 3%, 4% this year and also into next year. But in terms of the delta of your growth, how much of the upside was driven by market share gains? For instance, in big box and the soft side or is it -- would you attribute the upside to greater -- to just your increased sales efforts? Thank you very much.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Can any answer I give you that would be guess the data on market shares, there is limited data out there, where it is out there, I don\u2019t have full confidence what the numbers remain quarter-to-quarter. They are influenced by a lot of pieces. I think that we are probably doing a litter bit better in some categories in the marketplace and most.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Baugh from Stifel. Please go ahead.","John Baugh","Thank you. Good morning and my congrats as well. Jeff, could you tell us where you are in laminates with a waterproof technology and how important that might be to the future of laminates?","Jeff Lorberbaum","So in laminate, we participate in laminate in the mid to high end part of the business and very little in the commodity part. And there are reasons for which is that, they are really different assets and make highly style, highly design product efficiently and then they are making commodity. So that\u2019s where we set up. If you\u2019re going to participate in better one, you have to keep coming up with new innovative ideas to drive it both in style and features and we are the leader in the category until.","And so what are the problems with laminate and wood is that it\u2019s impacted by water and moisture in the house. And so we\u2019ve come up with another technology that allows us to give it dramatically better performance than the other products in the category and part of our expansions to support the expansion of that in the market place, which is one of many. And if you\u2019re going to be the leader, every year you have to keep coming up with new one.","John Baugh","And, Jeff, I have a follow-up question. But just on that quickly, where are we being, say, water-resistant versus waterproof? Then my follow-up question is simply: Any indication of roughly what your run rate of sales in LVT are currently? You gave us a $1 billion production run rate. And what you're sourcing versus making in-house currently. Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The first question was of moisture. There is no way to make anything out of wood completely moisture repellent. The technology that we have, if you spill things on them, usually you clean them up and the technology is in 24 or 48 hours, hours is almost nothing happens to it, where they the competitive products I mean dramatically degrade in the time. So we see that as a significant value proposition in the market place. One the other one, we don\u2019t give out this specific numbers of individual product categories in our segment, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of.","John Baugh","All right. Will you be replacing, say in the next 12 to 18 months, in-house production versus sourced? And will that be a margin helper? Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","Our goal is to continue expanding our business and the best thing it could happen with these that I need to keep sourcing significant amount.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. Please go ahead.","Tim Wojs","Hey, guys. Good morning; nice job. I guess my question, just maybe to put a little finer point, Frank, on productivity. I think you've been running maybe $30 million, $35 million a quarter from an EBIT perspective this year. And if you're spending more next year on CapEx, is there any reason why that run rate wouldn't continue into 2017?","Frank Boykin","First, is the state, we\u2019ve got tremendous number of projects and I think we said hundreds of projects across the business that people are working on both capital investments as well as process improvements that are driving those productivity numbers. We\u2019re in the process now in putting into our plan for next year. We\u2019ve got a very long list of projects for next year both CapEx and process improvement. So, we\u2019ll continue to generate good productivity numbers next year, but I don\u2019t know the number at this point.","Tim Wojs","Okay, okay. And then just on the commercial business; there is a little bit of worry that that business could slow down in 2017. I'm just curious what you're seeing, and maybe just some color on the investments that you're making in commercial today. Thanks.","Frank Boykin","The commercial business, I think in generally probably has weekend a little bit. I think that our product offering, our investment with sales and marketing are helping us to improve our position and the marketplace at this point. We have a very high part of the ceramic market that we do at the same time. The LVT and large part of the LVT is going into the commercial business.","The carpet tile business is growing for us, and these investment and sales force and product design and features and benefits are helping us push all the categories through the marketplace. So I think more than anything, it\u2019s really where we started. The business is in the best position from a manufacturing standpoint, from a cost standpoint, from a product innovation standpoint, execution standpoint and it\u2019s helping us in all areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Armstrong from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","James Armstrong","Good morning. I'd like to add my congratulations as well. First question is, you're obviously currently ramping up your LVT capacity quite significantly. That you said is slated to come online at the end of next year. Given the growth in the market right now, do you think that will be sufficient? Or do you believe that there probably is room for more as we go beyond that?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It\u2019s too early to tell. The marketplace has been growing significantly I would guess in the United States, it probably grew 300 million or more this year, just in growth. It's possible it could grow that or more next year. So there's plenty of opportunity for growth in the marketplace. The question is, as we get further along. Where is it going to plateau? And it's too early to tell.","James Armstrong","Fair enough. And then switching gears a little -- are you seeing any labor constraint issues in North America, either in your business or by your end customers? Is there any indication of that in your side of the business yet?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Hiring people has become more difficult in the business, but we\u2019ve been able to get what we need. On the customer side, I think the installation is becoming tight. In some of our places it's becoming hard for our customers to find the people to install the product. At the same time in the trucking piece finding drivers has been a problem for a while with most, but we also been able to get what we need for our own business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","John Lovallo","Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here. The first question is on, could you dimension the size of the Ceramics business in Mexico and perhaps how much of that serves the U.S. market? Then perhaps any thoughts or contingency plans if Trump does win the election and there is risk to NAFTA.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The Ceramic business in Mexico is about the same in units as the U.S. business, however, the average selling price is about half. So in -- on a dollar basis beginning the conversion, on the dollar basis, it\u2019s about half to size with about equal amount of unit, out of that.","John Lovallo","So that\u2019s the industry.","Jeff Lorberbaum","That\u2019s the industry. Out of that Mexico is one of the larger exporters into the U.S.; however, over the last two or three years the Mexican market has been growing dramatically and it\u2019s observed a huge amount of capacity in Mexico and is growing -- I don\u2019t can\u2019t even understand how much grown as much as they had, relative to the economy growing in Mexico. So what\u2019s happening is there has been a construction of the stuff coming up in the United States, because they higher value for in a local markets rather than exporting it to the U.S.","John Lovallo","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you\u2019re clearly running at or close to full capacity at many of your plants. Just curious, though. Similar to other manufacturing businesses, is there an opportunity for you to drive additional volume by doing things like increasing line speeds or adding shifts within existing plants?","Jeff Lorberbaum","What we said we are at capacity, it means we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve already running the same seven days a week and wide open and then every business is we have a around here half way there no matter where you\u2019re there is always way to get more out of it, is it but the more of it most cases once you optimize that is a few percent dramatic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. My question is on WPC LVT. The capacity you're adding for LVT now, is that -- can that produce both LVT and WPC LVT? Or is it exclusive to one versus the other, and generally how that works?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We think that we are building our equipment or we can satisfy any need in the marketplace with various products of different types of different features as we go through. So, I mean we are prepared to compete in all parts of the market providing products that will satisfy all level.","Keith Hughes","So you can produce both products in the same line, is that correct?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We\u2019ll be able to produce all of the above.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Please go ahead.","Susan Maklari","You noted that about a third of your product in the North American segment -- or a third of your sales in the North American segment are coming from more recent product introductions, especially on the soft surface side, I think\u2026","Jeff Lorberbaum","That was a carpet comment.","Susan Maklari","Okay. So as we think, though, about a lot of the work that you are doing and all the changes that are coming through, how should we think about where new products can go to as a percent of revenues either for that segment or as a whole? And what are the margin differentials between things that have been introduced, say in the last two or three years relative to some of your legacy products?","Jeff Lorberbaum","Product innovation is the crux of all of our businesses. So further you guess from commodity products the more important innovation is because you\u2019re selling differentiation rather than price and depending upon which business we\u2019re in, we\u2019ve different participations in commodity and the other. And all those things will continue to try to bring incremental product innovation to each one, so that the customers would prefer having ours. And with that you do get a margin premium as you bring more value to the customer. As you would think, as you would expect.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And then it sounds like you have continued to make some pretty nice progress on the working capital side as well. As we think about 2017 and some of these moving parts coming together, is there more room there that you think you can realize?","Jeff Lorberbaum","It\u2019s going to be incremental, we continuously try to find what is operating with lower inventories and giving higher service and you continually do those things and that at the same time off setting that, when your near capacity limitations of the working capital becomes lower and then more important is creating more product. So in some cases we\u2019re giving up turns and order to try to get more throughputs out of the business in the short term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Laura Champine","Good morning, Jeff. I think you called out weakness in residential carpet. Is that just a continuation of the secular trend towards hard surfaces? Or was there any change in that deteriorating trend in residential carpet, or any new drivers of that weakness?","Jeff Lorberbaum","First broader then carpet, residential replacement has not have the same robustness we would have expected, going through the cycle and it\u2019s in all the product categories as you go through. And addition in the carpet fees, there is increasing pressure from declining prices, as the market growth in polyester, which sells at lower prices, as reduced the prices and then with the over capacities in the carpet industry, the commodity prices have got in compressed even more.","All of those things are reducing the dollar volume of the industry, at the same time there is been the trend to selling more hard surfaces and use of more hard surfaces and more places, which has changed the growth rate of the entire industry, and those dynamics as continuing as they have been, so we\u2019re trying to participate it all the pieces. We\u2019re trying to make sure that we satisfy the customers from all the different product categories and our goal is to have our profit businesses largest we can have it.","And at the same time to optimize the other hard surface products, which we participate in all the parts of the business, and then going back to what we discussed before, having incremental innovation and everything has a huge benefit and we spend a huge amount of effort, trying to create some reasons that customers prefers ours in every single product category.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Rolle from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Brandon Rolle","Hi, this is Brandon Rolle on for David MacGregor. My question was in the Flooring North America segment. You had called out commodities pressure on the same; and how much of that was a drag on the 15% operating margin? Then as a follow-up, I was hoping you could talk about the levels of import competition in the hard surface flooring markets, whether it be LVT, laminate, or wood flooring. Thank you.","Jeff Lorberbaum","The pricing pressure in the commodity carpet business has been going on for some time. There is excess capacity in the marketplace. It has pushed the prices and margins down in the business for us. But I want to remind you at the same time that our North American Flooring business is operating at historically the highest margins it\u2019s ever been at. So it's just what we have to deal with, is the marketplace. The competition from offshore is there, and it\u2019s different and different product categories.","The Ceramic business, there's probably almost half of the industry comes from show somewhere, which includes, the biggest pieces coming from Mexico and China, I would guess, would be the two biggest. At the same time, the highest stuff is coming out of Europe, is it. In the other product categories, each one is different. The laminate business, there is the significant amount is to come from China and moved to Europe. There is new capacity coming up. So it\u2019s going to move here, you see the LVT with all coming out of China, but this new capacity coming up is moving to the U.S.","So in these product categories where you can automate it, there's advantages to being local but at the same time in the world marketplace with exchange rates and other pieces, people dump excess capacity into the marketplace. We think that we\u2019re well suited to compete and in the Ceramic industry and we're actually built, we own different capacity to everyone. We started this year, we\u2019ve actually shift product in Ceramic from Russia, Europe, and Bulgaria and out of our Chinese relationship into the U.S. to support our business.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Sam Darkatsh","Good morning, Jeff, Frank. How are you? A couple questions, one of them is just a follow-up on a prior question, as it relates to your Mexican exposure. Are you hedged for 2017 for transactional impacts if the peso does devalue after Tuesday?","Jeff Lorberbaum","We as a general rule do not hedge anything. And we go with the markets. We're in so many markets we're winning and losing in different ones all the time. And historically, I can't say, when we did hedge a long time ago, that the decisions were optimal.","Sam Darkatsh","So is there a way you can help us quantify or help quantify for us the potential exposure to the peso and\/or the export business?","Jeff Lorberbaum","In the peso, what\u2019s happening with probably or gaining and losing about equal amount. So on the imports we gain if it goes down, we gain on what we bring back. But our profits translated back from Mexico go down. If it reverses, the opposite occurs.","Sam Darkatsh","Final question, if I could. You\u2019re out of capacity in Russia, and new capacity coming online for Ceramic. Are you in the process of raising prices there? If you mentioned it in your prepared remarks and I missed it, I apologize. I was just curious if you\u2019re raising prices there?","Jeff Lorberbaum","No, we are not raising prices there, the market is probably in the depths of recession has been at and forever. I would guess that there ceramic market in Russia to 30%, 35% most of my competitors are struggling to stay alive the prices are compressed over there and then that environment we have, because we have the premium position install and designed because we have control of the downstream distribution, because we have the brand that\u2019s known in the marketplace were still promoting our brand through advertising across the market place. We are running opposite to the entire marketplace.","Sam Darkatsh","Very helpful. Thank you. Both have a terrific weekend.","Unidentified Company Representative","Thank you very much. We appreciate everyone being with us and we look forward to a good year. Have a great day.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
